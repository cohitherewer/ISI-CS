The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Crackdown on medical bills
 																											- BSNL sets up staff cost-cut panel, CalTel draws up list of hospitals SUNANDO SARKAR																								The Rs 1,16,777 teeth-extraction bill for a Calcutta-based BSNL employee, which had to be picked up by the public-sector firm, has had an impact from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.																								The BSNL headquarters in New Delhi has set in motion a process that is likely to culminate in a thorough whittling down of medical benefits its employees enjoy across the country. And Calcutta Telephones, taking a cue, has already scaled down the medical options for its staff.																								Last month, Metro had reported how a BSNL employee, who had admitted his epileptic son to a private hospital in Salt Lake for extraction of a few teeth, was presented with a six-figure bill that the firm had to pay.																								The most recent BSNL intra-office circular takes a very dim view of the reported exorbitant expenditure. With the annual all-India net profit dropping by over 76 per cent (from Rs 6,000 crore in the last financial year to Rs 1,444 crore this year) and competition from private players hotting up, officials say the belt must be tightened.																								The exorbitant expenditure could not have come at a more inopportune time, senior BSNL officials here admitted. It was this that forced the BSNL board to form a committee to review the medical scheme, especially in view of the reported exorbitant expenditure.																								The circular, officials revealed, was marked MOST URGENT. This explains the utmost seriousness with which the issue is being dealt, one of them said, adding that every BSNL circle had been asked to give details of medical expenses by December 19. These include the total number of employees who have opted for the BSNL Medical Reimbursement Scheme and the expenses incurred by them every month from April this year (when the scheme started) down to November 2003.																								The details are necessary to identify the areas where a clamp-down has become absolutely essential, a senior CalTel official said. The very fact that a review committee has been formed is a sure indication that the benefits the employees have enjoyed till now are likely to be scaled down drastically, he added.																								CalTel, meanwhile, has not even waited for Delhi to get into the act. It has released a list in which only six private institutions (like Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan, in south Calcutta) are mentioned as centres where admissions can be reimbursed.																								Beneficiaries are also entitled to be treated at all state/central government-run hospitals within the territorial jurisdiction of Calcutta Telephones, is another polite curb-cost pointer to BSNL employees.

																								Spotlight presents Close Encounters comprising two one-act plays, Next (written by Peter McNally) and The Interview (written by Peter Swet). Next proceeds as an interview between Sergeant Thech, the army medical officer, and Marion Cheever, an out-of-shape reluctant middle-aged man being drafted for military service. In spite of the surface humour of the situation, the criteria for eligibility always remains a question. The play features Rita Roy as Sergeant Thech and Pradip Mitra as Marion Cheever. The Interview is a rivetting and dramatic one-act play that juxtaposes an insurance investigator, James Shannon, who lives by the Rules and Regulations, and Abraham Moscowitz, a Jewish tailor whose experiences of the war has seen him age a lot more than his 63 years. The play features Cedric Spanos as Abraham Mscowitz and Cyrus Madan as James Shannon. 																								When: Today amp; tomorrow at 7 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch

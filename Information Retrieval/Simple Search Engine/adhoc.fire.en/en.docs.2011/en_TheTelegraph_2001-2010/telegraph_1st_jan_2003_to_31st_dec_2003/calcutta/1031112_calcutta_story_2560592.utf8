	Most parks across the city are used for holding pujas,  but organisers never care to restore them once the festival  is over. Hence, potholes and pits dot most grounds. The  organisers forget that people use the parks for morning  and evening strolls. Children frequent them too. The uneven  ground can cause accidents. The park authorities should  slap a fine on puja committees that damage public property.

	Five of us had gone out this Sunday evening. In front of  the Fort William South Gate, the front tyre of our car had  a puncture. Neither of us, girls in our twenties, had the  knowhow or the strength to replace the tyre. As we stood  round the van, at our wits end, a traffic constable came  over to check out the problem. Soon, he was back with a  taxi driver whom he had stopped. Tip him if you can, he  said, and went back to his post. We were too happy to do  so after he did the needful. It is nice to find such a helpful  attitude in men in uniform. 
	 Soma Biswas, Sealdah.

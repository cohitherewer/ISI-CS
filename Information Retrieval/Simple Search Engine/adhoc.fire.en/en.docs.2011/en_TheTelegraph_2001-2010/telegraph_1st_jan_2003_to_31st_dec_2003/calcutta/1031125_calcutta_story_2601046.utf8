				 	ANAND SHANKAR Anand Shankar																									Becomes a possibility when Anand takes the stage. His special talent is a rather unusual one  he can render songs in both a male and female voice.																									This 18-year-old has no trouble producing, and he has taken the school circuit by storm with his music, which draws from the classics of Mukesh just as easily as from Lata Mangeshkar. Others in his repertoire include Md Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Kumar Sanu, Sonu Nigam, Asha Bhonsle, Kavita Krishnamurthy and Shaan, to name a few.																									Of convention did not come easily. He admits to being very shy about his gift, scared to flaunt it for fear of being ridiculed. But the science student of Class XII of St Thomas Boys School (Kidderpore) overcame this fear, with a little help from his friends, parents and English teacher at school, Melody Rozario. His highly-acclaimed rendition of Mitwa from Lagaan at the Quetzel Quest was the start of great things to come.																									Is now second home to Anand. He has performed in shows at Birla Academy, GD Birla Sabhagar, Saraswati Sadan, Thyagaraja Hall and the Andhra Association, and in music festivals. His roots are firmly embedded in tradition, having trained in Carnatic music under Champakavalli Iyyer for the past six-and-a-half years. He has also mastered the violin under the watchful eye of the same teacher.																									Has the lead singer of the school band Eklipz, who can be a laugh with his ear for mimicry, which extends to just about any popular personality. His music has been heard at school fests, and the effort has come out on top at a number of competitions, including those organised by Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan, St Lawrence and St Thomas Boys School.																									Because though Anand would rather pursue a career in medicine or in the Indian Administrative Service, his association with melody will not come to an end. He is now hard at work preparing for the finals as well as the Joint Entrance Examination.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, December 19, 2003  The mountain in our minds
 Indifference is all it has to offer.  Calcutta has a long way to go in overcoming its mental block  against the plight of the disabled, feels Uttam Sengupta Isolated effort: Mamata Shankar shows children how to  sing in one voice and reach for the skies  We are all disabled in one way  or the other. But the indifference, ridicule and scorn that  we heap on the physically and mentally disabled must be  experienced first hand to feel the sting. In a country where  even the able find the going tough, it is difficult to  appreciate the plight of the disabled. On such occasions, one is tempted  to seek refuge in poetry. It came as a complete surprise  to discover that there are thousands of websites on poetry  by the disabled. One of the many poems that touched a chord  read as follows: They stop me going where Id  like; Stop me running, or riding a bike; But I can think,  and learn and talk; So what, if I cant go for a walk ? Arent you limited in your  career? By wealth, or circumstances or fear? Can you do  everything you see? Or are you just a bit like me? The city, however, paid scant  attention this week to a visiting old man in a wheelchair.  But the angry Major H.S. Ahluwalia couldnt care less. Addressing  less than 30 people in the boardroom of the Oberoi Grand,  he didnt mince words either while lamenting how Bengal  is one of the two states to have failed to take advantage  of a three-year-old centrally-sponsored scheme to train  and sensitise 3,300 doctors deployed at primary health centres. The scheme comes to an end in  March 2004 when funds dry up. But even after repeated efforts,  Bengal has only recently and half-heartedly started the  programme. Very few doctors in the state can be trained  in this short period, Ahluwalia fumed. The training would  have helped in early detection of disabilities, proper treatment  and helped reduce complications, he points out. The money was being provided  by the central government; training was to be provided by  the Rehabilitation Council of India  so where was the bottleneck?  wondered a bewildered Ahluwalia. Although he personally  met everyone, from the chief minister and the chief secretary  downwards, nothing moved. He persuaded the Speaker of the  West Bengal Assembly to call a meeting of legislators in  a bid to sensitise them on disability. Less than a dozen  legislators turned up for the meeting, he recalled. It is hardly a state secret that  the city is not very hospitable towards the disabled. The  most basic of the props, a ramp to enable the physically  handicapped to climb up without having to use stairs, is  missing in most public buildings and even government offices.  Even cinema halls, cultural complexes and eateries are generally  out of bounds for the handicapped, first because ramps are  non-existent and also because most public buildings, including  the high court and Writers Building, do not provide special  toilets for the handicapped. The disabled face similar problems  at railway stations and bus stands. Also, repeated pleas  for an additional step in buses to help the handicapped,  including those disabled by age, have been ignored. You might ask why you should  pay any attention to the disabled at all, Ahluwalia asked,  but look at me, I need constant attention from two people,  who cannot do any other work. While the disabled comprise  just around five per cent of the population, many more are  actually rendered dysfunctional. Rehabilitation of the disabled,  therefore, can release them at the very least for more productive  work. Remarkably, and single-handedly  at that, Ahluwalia has made rehabilitation, and not just  physiotherapy, into a promising career. The Rehabilitation  Council of India, of which he is the chairman, conducts  training programmes and also recognises professional rehabilitation  courses. He also helped wrest an important concession that  three per cent of all government jobs be reserved for the  handicapped. There are many other concessions now available  to the disabled, he points out, but most of the disabled  are unaware of them. There is an Everest in the mind,  says the author of Higher than Everest and The  Everest Within. He should know, having climbed the peak  in 1965. Later the same year, he received a Pakistani bullet  that paralysed him for life. For almost 40 years since then,  he has fought a war with disability, his sustained efforts  bearing fruit in surprising and significant ways. Major H.S. Ahluwalia has fought  and conquered the Everest within. But Calcutta clearly has  a long way to go.

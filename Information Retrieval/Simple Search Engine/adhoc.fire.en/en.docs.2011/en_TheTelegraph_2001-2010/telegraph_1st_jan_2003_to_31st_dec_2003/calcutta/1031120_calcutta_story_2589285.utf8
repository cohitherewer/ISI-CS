 Thursday, November 20, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Bo Derek You are warm and caring. You have a zest for life and live it to the fullest. Going off for short holidays is a necessity and refreshes you. You are frank and honest, yet delicate and gentle by nature. Others see you as an intense and sensitive person. Your optimistic nature and the spirit to move on make you a winner.  Kusum Bhandari

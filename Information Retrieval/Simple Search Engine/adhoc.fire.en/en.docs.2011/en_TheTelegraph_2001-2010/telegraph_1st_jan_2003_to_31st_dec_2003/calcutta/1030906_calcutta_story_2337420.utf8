The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, September 06, 2003 				 Puja date in CAS delay
 A STAFF REPORTER																								No conditional access system (CAS) before Durga Puja, unless the Centre introduces it simultaneously in all four metros, after sorting out all related issues. Chief secretary S.N. Roy has made this clear in a letter to Vijay Singh, additional secretary in the Union information and broadcasting ministry.																								Introduction of CAS right now may disturb the festive season, Roy argued. Serious public grievances leading to a law-and-order situation are not ruled out in case of hasty implementation of CAS. Since it has not yet been implemented in Delhi and Mumbai, there is a feeling that Calcutta is being singled out as a ground for an experiment, results of which are still unknown, he added.

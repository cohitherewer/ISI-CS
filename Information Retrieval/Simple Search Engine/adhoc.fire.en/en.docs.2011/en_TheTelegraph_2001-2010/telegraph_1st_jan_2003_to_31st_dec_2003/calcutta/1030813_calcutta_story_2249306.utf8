The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 IBM ushers in Saltlec season of recruitment
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT AND ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								The pink-slip panic has passed and its appointment-letter time once more in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec), the states IT hub.																								Leading the way in the recruitment rush is IBM Global Services. We are growing very fast in Calcutta. It is a software package competency centre, and with high growth in the package sector, we are doing well here. We are in recruitment mode and are also looking for more space in the city, says an IBM spokesperson.																								Though no exact figures in terms of manpower requirement are forthcoming, IBM sources indicate that the Calcutta centre will grow from the present roll-call of around 800 to more than 4,000 in the next 18 months. The company has roped in a number of hiring agencies and is also utilising its partners to source manpower, besides scouting B-school and tech school campuses for freshers. 																								The IT major is also known to have identified significant space in central Calcutta and is in the final stages of acquiring more square feet in Saltlec. 																								Other Sector V biggies, like Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), are also busy adding to their numbers, though not as aggressively as IBM. We are around 800 people here and we will cross the 1,000 mark shortly, but in a staggered manner, says Siddhartha Mukherjee vice-president of CTS.																								CTS chairman and chief executive officer Kumar Mahadeva adds: In the first quarter, 30 per cent recruitment was done on campus, while 70 per cent was lateral hiring. This is a complete reversal of our earlier recruitment policy, where around 70 per cent was from the campus. 																								With the new smaller outfits also busy ramping up resources and scouting for manpower, the recruitment drive in the industry  which has seen lay-offs, pay cuts and a freeze on fresh hiring in the past 18 months  is an indicator that the tide is turning for the IT shops.																								And the feel-good factor is showing in the figures. As per the data available with Webel, the combined export earning of the 94 firms in the software technology park totalled $41.6 million in the three-month period from April to June this year, over the $30.6 million mark in the same quarter of 2002-2003. 																								The growth is around 35 per cent. If this is the performance in the first quarter, when companies dont exert billing pressure, we can expect much higher growth by the year-end, says S. K. Mitra, managing director of the state governments nodal IT agency. 																								Also, the growth is not lopsided. The smaller players have also shown improved performances this quarter, with some growing by over 100 per cent. We are getting projects because companies in the US and Europe are desperate to bring down costs. We have grown by more than 100 per cent, and with more projects flowing in, we have started recruiting people. From the present strength of 130, we plan to take the number to 200 in the next three months, says Rahul Sharma, executive director, Web Development Company.

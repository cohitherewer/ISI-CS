																								Dance is as ancient a form of expression and communication as human memory can think of. The coordinated beauty of well-synchronised physical movements later elevated dance to an art form. We are all attracted to this performing art easily because of its inherent beauty and as a form of expressing unpremeditated joy. That is precisely the reason why children take to dance so easily as fish takes to water. Udayan is a dance institution set up by Mamata Shankar Ballet Troupe that aims to impart not just the basics of dance and movements but also inculcates the grace, beauty and discipline necessary for perfecting this art form. The institution is currently hosting a three-day dance festival, Prayas 2003, to showcase the efforts of a band of enthusiastic and disciplined pupils. The age group of the participants range from five years to 25 years, who are being trained by Mamata Shankar at Udayan.The festival, conducted by Mamata Shankar and her associates of Udayan, has several colourful and vibrant items and three dance-dramas  Shikaar (adapted from a poem by Jibanananda Das), set to music by Dipak Chowdhury, Kalmrigaya by Rabindranath Tagore, and Prakriti. Members of Mamata Shankar Ballet Troupe will also participate in the dance-drama, Prakriti, to be staged tomorrow. 																								When: Today amp; tomorrow at 6 pm																								Where: Science City auditorium

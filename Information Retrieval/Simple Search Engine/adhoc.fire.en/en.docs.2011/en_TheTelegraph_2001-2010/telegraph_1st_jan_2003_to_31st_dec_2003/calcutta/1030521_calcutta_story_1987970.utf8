 Wednesday, May 21, 2003 				 Cops in net after arrested men flee 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Three cops of Jadavpur police station were arrested on Monday night after two criminals fled from their custody at M.R. Bangur Hospital.																								Mota Feroz, one of the goons, was rounded up from Topsia on Sunday for peddling drugs and had been lodged in Tiljala police custody. Manwar, the other, had been arrested from Entally and was lodged in Alipore Presidency jail. On Monday night, both took ill and were admitted to the special ward of Bangur hospital.																								A police team, comprising constable Janaki Kumar Sharma, Sudhangshu Brahma of the National Volunteer Force and another colleague were posted in front of the ward to keep an eye on the duo. Early on Tuesday, the three policemen reported that the criminals had fled. 																								Officers were baffled by the news, as they failed to deduce how the goons could possibly have duped the guards, who were supposed to remain alert round-the-clock. The trio said the criminals might have escaped when they had fallen asleep.																								How can one accept the fact that the guards had fallen asleep, neglecting their duties? We will interrogate to find out if they were in connivance with the criminals or whether it was a case of negligence of duty, asserted additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Kumar Singh.																								According to deputy commissioner (central) Zulfiquar Hasan, the special custody in the hospital, where criminals are lodged, is well-fortified. Manwars arrest had led to some vital clues on the recent dacoities in and around the city, he added.

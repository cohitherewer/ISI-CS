																																																		The sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Dilip Das, an associate of gangster Sheikh Binod, from a hideout in Regent Park on Friday evening. According to CID officials investigating the case, Das used to extort money from businessmen and promoters while Binod was in Dum Dum Central jail. Preliminary investigation has revealed that Chaitanya Pal, the plumber who chalked out the jailbreak plan, introduced Das as one of his labourers and helped him gain easy access to the prison premises. Das had even entered the Dum Dum prison on September 24, the day before the jailbreak, and passed on three firearms and some ammunition to Binod, said an official. On the day of the escape, too, Das stood outside the jail and later provided shelter to Binod when he was on the run. Binod has been remanded in judicial custody till November 21. The CID will appeal to the Barrackpore court to transfer him to their custody.

				 																																									The security ring outside the American Center has become a major concern for pedestrians on Chowringhee Road. While one can fathom the need for tight security around this vital installation, the American Center authorities should also realise that they cannot jeopardise the lives of common people. The security measures force pedestrians to take the carriageway at the risk of being run over by vehicles. The state government should find a solution.

The civic body is indifferent to the unhygienic conditions.				 																																									Govinda Bakshi,				 																																									Budge Budge.

A group of young enthusiastic artists both painters and a sculptor  has congregated under a common platform, Horizon, to showcase their works. These young Turks  take them as you like  but if one goes by their works, one can confidently say, they are here to stay. Ananda De, Arindam Dutta, Chandan Das, Nirmal Kanti Chakraborty, Pradip Bhowmick and Sanchita Sengupta are armed with prestigious degrees from art colleges and have on and often been participating in various group as well as solo shows.

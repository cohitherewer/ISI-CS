 A STAFF REPORTER																								A chain of explosions rocked Lake Town on Saturday morning when bombs stored in an apartment on Bangur Avenue went off, leaving one seriously injured. Residents of the area caught two of the miscreants, while the others fled with their injured accomplice.																								According to Ajay Nand, additional superintendent of police, Salt Lake, eight miscreants had taken shelter in an empty flat to make bombs. The miscreants were hired by the flat-owner, Bikash Dutta, to get rid of a rival, Nand said.																								The miscreants had gone on a drinking spree before settling down to make the bombs late on Friday. This morning, at around 10 oclock, when they were about to leave the premises in a taxi, they realised that they had left behind the sack containing the bombs. One of them went back to get the sack. A bomb spilled out and burst, triggering a chain of explosions, Nand added.																								While the miscreants carried the injured to the waiting taxi and fled, local residents accosted two of them who had failed to get into the moving taxi. The two were handed over to police. The arrested youths have been identified as Raju and Kishore. 																								According to neighbours, Dutta used to let his flat out to dubious people. Though the residents were aware of the fact, they could not protest as Dutta was known to be well-connected. 																								Police recovered empty liquor bottles and CDs of pornographic films from the premises. It seems the discs belong to the flat-owner as the goons had not bothered to take these along with them. Blood stains on the floor suggest that the youth had been seriously hurt, said an official of the local police station.																								The arrested duo told us that Dutta had hired them to kill an individual but could not name the person. They also told us that their accomplice had suffered a fatal injury. We have got some leads but some of their statements were contradictory. We will conduct raids on Saturday night. The neighbouring healthcare centres have also been alerted, the official added.																								Govt officials evicted																								The urban development department on Saturday evicted around 45 government officers from housing estates in Salt Lake who were illegally occupying the flats.																								Flats in the seven housing complexes of the township, owned and maintained by the urban development department, had been rented out to government officers and eminent citizens for residential purposes till their retirement. Officers have to vacate the premises when they retire or if they are transferred. But many have been occupying the flats long after retirement. As all our appeals have fallen on deaf ears, we were forced to oust them, said urban development secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar.

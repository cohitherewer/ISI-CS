				 																																									Deshbandhu Park on Raja Dinendra Street, in north Calcutta, is slowly falling into misuse due to neglect. The park is a favourite venue for CAB matches but if the wear and tear continues without any maintenance, cricket matches will soon have to be abandoned. Potholes have already developed on the ground. Moreover, residents of the area use the swimming pool for bathing and washing. The ladies park, on the northern flank of this ground, is used as a dumping spot for scrap material. The local clubs should join hands with the civic body and chalk out some development schemes.				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Nayapatty Road.				 																																									The AB Market post office if Salt Lake frequently runs out of Monthly Income Scheme (MIS) withdrawal forms. As a result, people have to either get the forms photocopied, purchase them from touts or collect them from elsewhere. The behaviour of the staff manning the MIS counter is not cordial either. 				 																																									Madhabi Ghosh,				 																																									Salt Lake.

 Thursday, June 12, 2003 				 Another script rap for varsity
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Justice Pratap Roy of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed Calcutta University to produce the physics answer-script of Madhumita Dutta, who appeared in B.Sc Part I in 2002. She had been given 23 marks in the paper. 																								Madhumitas counsel Ekramul Bari told Metro she was academically bright. She had scored good marks in all the other papers in Part I. During the hearing, Bari told the court that Madhumita had bagged 63 in physics for her qualifying tests. After going through Madhumitas earlier report cards, the judge asked the university authorities to produce the answer-script.																								Six benches of Calcutta High Court have been assigned by the chief justice to hear education-related cases. The number of benches has been doubled as a large number of aggrieved students of schools, colleges and universities are moving court.																								High court sources said at least 300 petitions were filed by aggrieved candidates of Madhyamik, Higher Secondary and Calcutta University examinations in 2002. All the petitioners sought court orders directing the authorities to produce the answer-scripts. In many cases, the scripts were brought to court and in some cases, the marks were increased.																								A court official said under the present system, Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice P. Roy will hear matters relating to results of aggrieved candidates. Four other judges have been assigned to hear other educational matters, he added.

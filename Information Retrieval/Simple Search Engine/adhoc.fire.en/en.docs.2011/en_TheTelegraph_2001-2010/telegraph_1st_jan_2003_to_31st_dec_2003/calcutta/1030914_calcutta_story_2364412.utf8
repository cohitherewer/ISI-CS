 Sunday, September 14, 2003 				 Passport racket kingpin arrested
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sleuths arrested Mohammed Mazarul Haque in central Calcutta on Saturday evening for his involvement in a fake passport racket. A bunch of 30 international passport books and valuable documents were seized.																								Police said Haque, who had arrived from Bihar a few months ago, was operating the passport fraud from his Eden Hospital Road house. We have found a number of visa application forms for West Asian countries along with photographs, said an officer of the detective department. All 30 passport books recovered from Haque were originals, issued from the Calcutta, Patna and Lucknow offices, he added. Sleuths said Haque would first collect the passport books through his agents in various cities, and then replace the original photographs with those of his clients. Haque, preliminary investigation suggested, even had agents in Bangladesh.																								On Saturday, acting on a tip-off, sleuths from Lalbazar police headquarters lay in wait for Haque at the intersection of CR Avenue and Eden Hospital Road. He was picked up as soon as he emerged from his house. Officials of the security control office have been alerted and they will interrogate Haque on Sunday.

 Suha Priyadarshini Chakravorty																									On Suhas curriculum vitae. A long line of activities features on her regular list of things to do. But she isnt the kind of gal to dabble in things irrelevant. This 18-year-old knows exactly where she is going.																									Surrounds the Scorpio at any given time. And happily so. She has learnt classical music under the tutelage of Shantanu Banerjee and Rabindrasangeet from Arghya Sen. Her musical leanings dont end there, and she lent an ear to more western strains. At Dolna Day School, from where she completed her ISCE, she learnt how to play the piano and the keyboards from Jyotishka Dasgupta.																									Was hers at inter-school fests, in which she first represented Dolna, and later, Apeejay School, where she shifted in Class XI. Was on the winning side for many vocal rounds, and also grabbed the Best Female Singer honours in the western song category at the Carmel fest, Ambience, in 2002.																									Of the competition with her performances on stage. This occasional competitive rower participated in the Khadims One-Act play Competition while at Dolna, and bagged the first prize. Just a couple of weeks ago, she was part of the Apeejay Play Just Look At Me... Keep Looking at the M.P. Birla Smarak Kosh one-act play contest, which won the jury award.																									She puts her talents, speaking out about issues through her art. She participated in a recent anti-child labour campaign at the Oxford Bookstore, where Apeejay put up a show for a mixed audience of kids from all walks of life. The student of humanities wants to study social sciences and then go into human resource management, though her ultimate ambition is to become the best singer of all time. Determination is the only key to success, feels Suha, and what she is counting on to reach the top.																									Is another title our senorita wouldnt mind bagging. Our part-time poet wants to pick up as many languages as possible, already having stepped up to the Spanish challenge.

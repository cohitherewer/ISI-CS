 Thursday, January 23, 2003 				 Nurturing talent
																								Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide,/ The darkness deepens: Lord with me abide!/ When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,/ Help of the helpless, O abide with me H.F. Lyte																								At a time when the world is racing at a frantic pace and there is hardly any time to spare for others, the weak and the deprived can only turn to God for help and the Lord sends his messengers  the good samaritans  to support the poor and nurture those talents who are standing on the threshold of society, seeking a little encouragement to thrive independently and find a place under the sun. For children living on the streets and in slums of Kasba, life is one long, endless struggle from dawn to dusk. That is, until Charuchetana happened in 1996. An art and culture centre for underprivileged children, Charuchetana trains them in art and crafts so that they can be economically independent. Along with pursuing art, craft, dance, mime and recitation, the children are also encouraged to continue formal education. This effort has paid rich dividend and the kids are creating vibrant collages, water colours, stencils and pastels, sculptures and terracotta and paper mache masks. Their creations are displayed annually at an exhibition hosted by Charuchetana. Also, a folk art camp is held simultaneously where these kids are taught various crafts by rural craftsmen. The finished goods are sold and proceeds from the sale are handed over to their parents by the organisation.																								When: Till January 28; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The last of the shadows
  When Balaka Bhattacharjee, daughter of renowned painter Bikash Bhattacharjee, takes to painting, expectations are naturally high. To the connoisseurs of art, Balakas entry into the world of fine arts raises new hopes  the birth of a star in the citys art firmament. Balaka doesnt have any formal institutional training. Instead she has all along been guided by her father. To her, creation is a temple inside a pasture, from where there are infinite lives to be led, very many roads to be taken. So, when she takes up the brush to express her feelings, she is not just a painter, but someone who wishes to begin inside a dream, where I, for a moment, can become one with the temple and take up many lives and then journey on down those pastoral roads into unseen dreams. This is Balaka Bhattacharjees debut exhibition.When: Till March 16; 3 pm - 8 pmWhere:  Copyright

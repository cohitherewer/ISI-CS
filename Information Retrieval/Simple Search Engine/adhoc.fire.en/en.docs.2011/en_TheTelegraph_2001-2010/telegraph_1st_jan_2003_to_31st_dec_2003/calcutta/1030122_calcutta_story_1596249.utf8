 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a gruesome accident, a woman, riding pillion on the motorcycle of her son, was killed after the two-wheeler was hit by a bus on Diamond Harbour Road near Bishnupur, South 24-Parganas, on Tuesday morning.																								Subhadra Purkait, 50, was killed on the spot while her son, Madhai, 28, was seriously injured, Bishnupur police station sources said. Madhai was admitted to a city hospital, where his condition is stated to be serious.																								The two were on their way to Diamond Harbour when the bus, heading the same way, hit the motorcycle at Hariharpur, in Bishnupur. Mother and son were taken to a local hospital by bystanders, where Subhadra was declared dead. Madhai was transferred to a city hospital after his condition deteriorated. 																								Traffic on Diamond Harbour Road was crippled for a long time after the accident and office-goers and schoolchildren were inconvenienced.																								Residents demanded the arrest of the driver, who had fled immediately after the accident. The bus was impounded.																								Asit Basu, chairman of Diamond Harbour municipality, said that the civic body had appealed several times to drivers and bus-owners to slow down in the congested areas and at crossings. Even the local police have been requested to take measures against rash driving, Basu said. 																								Mehmood Akhtar, sub-divisional police officer of Diamond Harbour, said a number of meetings were held with bus unions and owners, urging them to avoid rash driving. They agree in principle but in their bid to earn more commission, the drivers break most rules, Akhtar said. Strict measures are in the pipeline against rogue drivers.

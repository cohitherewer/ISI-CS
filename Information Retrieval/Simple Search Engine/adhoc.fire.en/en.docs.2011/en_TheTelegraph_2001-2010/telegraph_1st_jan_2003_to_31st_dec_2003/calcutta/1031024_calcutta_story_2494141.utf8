 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government has ordered an inquiry into the Bagh Express assault on a group of 60 city students returning home from a trip to Nainital.																								The students of Prafulla Chandra College (night section of South City College) were assaulted on Tuesday afternoon after a group of people forcibly entered the reserved coach in which they were travelling at Deuria Sadar station. 																								A quarrel broke out as the unauthorised entrants refused to get off at the next station. The verbal exchange soon turned physical, but the matter was sorted out.																								However, it was the lull before the storm, as the students learnt to their dismay a little later. After about a quarter of an hour, the men started teasing the girls in the compartment. Protests first invited even more abuse, and then a round of beating. The students tried to resist but they failed. Some of the hoodlums were armed with choppers. 																								The assailants pulled the chain in the compartment and got off near Bhatni station. The students lodged a complaint with the Government Railway Police (GRP) at Bhatni. More than 20 of them were injured in the attack, they said.																								Another complaint was filed with the Howrah GRP on Wednesday afternoon after the train reached the city. Additional director-general (rail) S.C. Avasthi has been asked to take up the matter with the Uttar Pradesh police and submit a report. We feel that the GRP in Uttar Pradesh must initiate action against those involved in the attack, as it occurred in that state, state home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, December 10, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Any pain for stargaze gain
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should shooting of films be banned on city streets?				 Front Stall: Abhishek  Bachchan helps Rni Mukherjee pick a thorn from her foot  as the crowd gaps during shooting of Yuva on the Maidan Subhobrata Basu,
																		Asutosh College.																																																														Several roads were blocked for the shooting of Mani Rathnams Yuva recently. True, people were inconvenienced, but it was good publicity for our city. It earned us revenue. Also, we got to see some Bollywood hunks and beauties.									

Lalita Agarwal,
																		Maniktala Main Road.																																																														Since problems are faced by commuters during rush hours, Sundays and other public holidays should be set aside for shootings. If it is absolutely necessary to shoot on weekdays, peak hours should be avoided. After all, Calcutta can do with a bit of good publicity.									

Sayan Ghosh,
																		Baghbazar.																																																														Shooting on the roads should be prohibited in a congested city like Calcutta, where the daily traffic is a headache. If shooting is allowed, stargazers crowd the area, troubling others. Shooting may be allowed around midnight, so as not to create a public nuisance.									

Jayanta Datta,
																		Chinsurah.																																																														Definitely not. If shooting on city roads is banned, Calcutta will lose employment opportunities. Also, funds which might pour in from filming, can be used to beautify parks and repair old buildings. If Calcutta forbids shooting on roads, other cities will take advantage of that.									

Sayan Banerjee,
																		Belgachhia.																																																														Banning shooting is not an effective solution to traffic jams. It is true that shoots disrupt traffic, but this does not happen often. The schedule should be planned in advance so that the time for which the roads are blocked is minimised. Arrangements should also be made to clear up the area as soon as filming finishes.									

Joydeep Chatterjee,
																		Shyambazar.																																																														Yes. Shooting of films on city roads causes chaos. Roads are blocked and the chaos can cause accidents. Shooting of films should be banned on city roads.									

Purvi Thacker,
																		Deb Lane.																																																														Shooting on roads should be prohibited, as it causes commotion. Destabilising the lives of people for days just for a few film scenes is not right.									

Tariq Akhtar,
																		Collin Lane.																																																														On the one hand, shooting should be banned on city roads, since roads are blocked and the public has to suffer. Filming around midnight, perhaps, is a better idea. But if a film is shot in our city, we, Calcuttans, will feel proud.									

Sananda Sen,
																		Address not given.																																																														Absolutely, because it disrupts traffic. Roads are blocked, and passengers have to wait for hours stuck in jams, often missing important meetings or losing work. The recent shooting of Mani Rathnams film Yuva created a mess on Vidyasagar Setu.									

Hara Lal Chakraborty,
																		Arabinda Nagar.																																																														City roads are utilised for shooting all over the world. So, it should not be stopped. However, there should be reasonable fees and proper guidelines. The entire exercise should be planned so that the disruption is kept to a minimum. 									

Mahuya Samadder,
																		Canning.																																																														Shooting on streets is the sister of rallies. If it happens on weekdays on an important thoroughfare or bridge, we, students, and office-goers must suffer the jams. We may even miss an exam or an important class. A patient may lose his life because of this. 									

Tanmoy Das Lala, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														A film buff would want to see the shooting. But what about the office-goers? For daily wagers, too, every minute is valuable. Why cant shootings be done on Sundays? As long as peoples lives are not affected, shooting can always be allowed. After all, we would all like to watch celebrities, wouldnt we?									

Priyanka Dawn,
																		New Alipore.																																																														Shooting of films on city roads is an amusing extravaganza. Few cities get the privilege. Such films may be of great historical value, being documents of city life. Hence, it would be ridiculous to decline any such offer from movie-makers. It is also a source of revenue. Any inconvenience due to roadblocks can be avoided by arranging alternate routes for motorists. If a few busy roads are left out, shooting of a film will not affect us. 									

Vinay Poddar,
																		Address not given.																																																														Yes. Calcutta already suffers from more than its share of traffic-related problems. Crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars only add to the chaos. What if some day an ambulance cant make its way through the traffic and a patient perishes, just because a masterpiece is being shot on the roads? Maybe a shot or two can be allowed on the streets, but that, too, on holidays.									

Tapan Pal,
																		Batanagar.																																																														Shooting on Calcutta streets will help us promote tourism. Perhaps we should take a little inconvenience in our stride for that. Shooting cannot be treated at par with rallies. Rallies are totally unproductive but shooting can promote tourism.									

Masood Nehal,
																		Address not given.																																																														To allow shooting of films on city roads, the authorities should set a time frame to avoid traffic jams. Also, the number of stargazing onlookers must be checked, to avert crowds in the area.									

Sneha Rai Chowdhury,
																		College Street.																																																														It should be banned on weekdays. Since Calcutta roads are perennially congested, shooting causes added confusion.									

Satyen Biswas,
																		Behala																																																														Shooting of films on city roads is not a good idea. It creates traffic jams and huge crowds gather to see the action. Also, fanatic onlookers may cause harm to the actors or actresses, since they are out in the open without a proper security cover.									

Chandan Ray,
																		Sarsuna.																																																														Since traffic conditions in Calcutta are usually chaotic, the added havoc created by film-makers should not be allowed. This holds up people on emergency business, like patients on the way to hospitals. Shooting of films can be permitted at midnight or early in the morning. Also, the authorities should make sure that the area is cleaned up once the filming is over.

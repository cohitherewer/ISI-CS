 Thursday, September 18, 2003 				 Fan crashes on patient
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 30-year-old woman, Gouri Mondal, was injured on Wednesday afternoon at RG Kar Hospital when the ceiling fan over her bed sprang free of its metal frame and fell on her.																								Kuldiep Singh, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said Gouri had been admitted to the gynaecological ward a few days ago. At around 1.45 pm, she was sleeping on bed no. 14 after lunch. Suddenly, the iron support holding up the ceiling fan snapped and the blades came crashing down. The patient suffered a deep gash on her forehead and three stitches were required to stop the bleeding, said Singh.																								Hospital sources said Gouris condition was stable, but police warned that the accident could well have been fatal. The hospital authorities should monitor the condition of fans and other such equipment to avert similar mishaps, said Singh.

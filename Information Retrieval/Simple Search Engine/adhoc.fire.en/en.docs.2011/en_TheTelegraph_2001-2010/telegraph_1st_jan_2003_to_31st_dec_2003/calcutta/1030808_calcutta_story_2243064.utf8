	The Howrah Municipal Corporation must focus on the deplorable  condition of the area surrounding the Howrah bus terminus  and the auto stand. Heaps of litter are dumped on the main  road with things getting worse after a downpour. Vehicles,  especially buses and autorickshaws, flout traffic rules  all the time. The area is filled with the stench of rotten  refuse from the nearby fish market.

	While passing through the Dhakuria flyover, I am often  alarmed to see people chatting and walking along the edge  of the bridge carelessly. The railings, running along the  entire length of the bridge, are broken at several places.  Children from nearby slums playfully lean on the railings,  or fly kites balancing themselves precariously. The boundary  wall should be repaired without further delay. With the  tremendous rush of pandal-hoppers in this zone, one cant  rule out the possibility of accidents during the Pujas.  
	Md. Tanweer, Park Circus.

				 																																									Lake Town market is in very bad shape with large potholes dotting the ground. The market is often flooded with filthy water spilling out of the drains. The situation worsens when litter is dumped at the entrance of the market. The sewer water and the stench of the garbage make shopping a nightmarish experience. 				 																																									Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																									Lake Town.				 																																									Recently, I went for a series of tests at a diagnostic centre on Vivekananda Road for a gland in the neck. For one of the tests, the doctor pierced the affected area four times to extract fluid. The experience, needless to say, was extremely painful. On the day I was to receive the test report, the diagnostic centre called me up to say that the report wasnt clear and the test has to be done again. Later, I learnt from my family physician that the test should have been conducted by a pathologist and one insertion was sufficient. The government must check this harassment.				 																																									Namrata Daga,				 																																									Hindusthan Park.

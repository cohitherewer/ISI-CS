																																																																																		Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya on Thursday threatened to realise its water supply dues, amounting to Rs 345 crore, from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) by deducting the amount from other grants, if the civic body did not arrange for payment. It was decided in a meeting with mayor Subrata Mukherjee that the CMC would pay the outstanding amount in two instalments. The CMC supplies the maximum quantity of water to industrial houses from the Garden Reach plant at a high rate. But they are silent about paying the dues to the CMDA and the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority, which have implemented the drinking water project, Bhattacharya said. The decision to levy water tax was taken to raise funds required for maintaining the water treatment plants. It is up to the CMC whether it will levy a tax or supply water free to the citizens. We want the money, both the dues and the current expenses, Bhattacharya said.																																																		Sajda Khatun, aged 10, was alleged to have been raped and killed by Janab Ali, 21. The incident took place in Salap Battala, near Domjur, on Wednesday night. District superintendent of police, Mihir Kumar Bhattacharjee, said Sajda, a native of Bihar, used to stay with her sister and brother-in-law as her father could not afford to raise her. According to police, Sajdas brother-in-law, Mohammed Jafar, a trader in old newspapers and plastic sheets, went out to meet his customers. Sajda followed him down Howrah-Amta Road. On the way, Sajda met Janab Ali, a neighbour, who called her to his house, promising to accompany her back to her residence. He took away my sister-in-law to his tea shop, raped her and then killed her, Jafar alleged. Later, the accused confessed his guilt to the police and was arrested. He was produced in Howrah court and remanded in jail custody.

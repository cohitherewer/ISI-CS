 Sunday, March 09, 2003 				 Dead patient stripped, robbed
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Shortly after his death, a 60-year-old man was stripped of his clothes and cash. The money, amounting to around Rs 2,000, was stolen from his bag at the MR Bangur Hospital on Saturday morning.																								Police said Sabjilal Mondol, a Group IV employee, has been arrested for the crime. 																								Kantilal Guha was recuperating at the hospital for the past few weeks. On Saturday, his condition worsened and he died. Later, family members who reached the hospital to claim his body, found Guha lying naked.																								We were shocked to find his clothes missing. The hospital authorities were also at a loss to explain this, a family member told the police. Cash and other valuables were also found missing from his bag.																								The hospital authorities immediately initiated an inquiry and it was discovered that Mondol was seen loitering in the ward shortly after Guha died.																								Mondol claimed he had removed the mans clothes since he wanted to give him a bath. But during interrogation, he confessed to stripping the dead man and emptying his pockets and bag. The police recovered Guhas clothes and money from a room in the hospital. The hospital authorities apologised to Guhas family for the incident.

 Sunday, October 05, 2003 				 Restraint note in Front hit-the-street warcry
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The Communist Party of India (CPI)s was perhaps the lone voice of restraint in an hour-long meeting of Left Front leaders, specially convened at the Alimuddin Street headquarters on Saturday morning to work out a strategy against Justice Amitava Lalas order.																								As soon as Left Front chairman and CPM politburo member Biman Bose unveiled the days agenda for organising a mass convention on October 8, CPI state secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar asked if the Front had received a copy of Lalas order. When Bose replied in the negative, Majumdar indicated that his party was against hurriedly over-reacting to the judgment only on the basis of newspaper reports. The CPI leader reportedly spoke against any militant agitation to defy the court without going through the copy of the order.																								CPI secretariat member Debashis Dutta pointed out that there should be a restrained approach in this regard. When contacted later, Dutta said the Front leadership should tackle the issue cautiously. We are against the judgment as it infringes on the democratic movement of people. But we feel we should first go through a copy of the order before organising the movement, he said.																								Differences of opinion had also cropped up in the CPM when the leadership had met on Friday to chalk out the partys nature of agitation vis--vis the courts directive. Though both Bose and CPM state secretary Anil Biswas opted for a belligerent movement, many did not want to rush in.																								Leaders of the Forward Bloc and Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) have, however, decided to stick to a militant movement against the shocking and undemocratic order. Immersion deadline																								Police have threatened stern action against puja committees that fail to complete immersion of Durga idols by October 8. DC, headquarters, Kuldiep Singh said errant puja committees could have their licences revoked and refused permission next year.

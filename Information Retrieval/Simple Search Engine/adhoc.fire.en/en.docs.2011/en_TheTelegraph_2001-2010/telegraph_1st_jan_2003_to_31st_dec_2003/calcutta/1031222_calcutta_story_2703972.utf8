 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Cops cuff killer by husband account
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Bank manager Jayanta Banerjees sketchy description of his wifes killer has helped the Thakurpukur police identify the culprit, round him up and charge him with murder. In a Saturday morning swoop, police arrested 18-year-old Raju Modak from his Kaharpara residence.																								Jayanta had returned to his Thakurpukur residence in the last week of July after being transferred, from Assam, to the NS Road headquarters of Canara Bank. The day I returned (July 31), my wife Sarbari, daughter Sohini and I were all sleeping in the afternoon when a youth in a black singlet and shorts rang the bell of our third-floor flat in Rajani apartments, at Natunpara, off Biren Roy Road (West), Jayanta told sleuths.																								The youth stabbed Sarbari as soon as she opened the door. I followed her to the door and on seeing me, the miscreant attacked me and slashed my stomach. Trying to save me, Sarbari stepped in between us and the youth stabbed her a second time This proved fatal, Jayanta added. The injured couple managed to raise an alarm but failed to stop the assailant. Sohini slept through the attack.																								Salil Bhattacharya, officer-in-charge of Thakurpukur police station, said establishing the murder motive had taken a while. Sarbari and Sohini arrived in Calcutta on July 25 and hired a domestic help, Haridasi Malik. The mother and daughter showered her with gifts brought from Assam, Bhattacharya said.																								Haridasi would proudly show off these gifts to her neighbours. This caught the eye of Raju Modak, who sensed an easy kill at a wealthy home inhabited by a mother-daughter duo. Modak decided to strike on July 31, not knowing that Jayanta would be home that day.																								We had prepared a sketch of the culprit, based on the description given by Jayanta and a neighbour who had caught a glimpse of him. During interrogation, Haridasi identified the youth in the sketch as a neighbour who had been keeping bad company, said Bhattacharya.																								At around 2 am on Saturday, a police team went to Haridasis house and asked her to point out Modaks residence, from a distance. As we knocked on the main door, it was opened by a youth who perfectly matched the sketch we were carrying, added Bhattacharya.																								Modak confessed to his crime after four hours of interrogation. He was produced in court and will go through a test identification parade on Monday, said Deb Kumar Ganguly, superintendent of police, South 24- Parganas.

 Wednesday, March 12, 2003 				 ATM account broken into
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A senior executive of a private firm, who had written the PIN (or access code) on his Any Time Money (ATM) card and left it behind on the banks counter after checking his cash balance on March 7, discovered to his dismay some time later that Rs 60,000 had been removed from his account. 																								Later, Tukai Mondol, security guard of the ATM counter on Russel Street, was arrested and the money seized from him.																								Subrata Ghosh, officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station, said members of the force raided Mondols Barasat home on Monday night and seized the stolen card and a part of the cash. He was arrested and produced in court on Tuesday. The judge remanded him in a weeks jail custody.																								Police said the executive took a print-out of his cash balance, after which the card popped out. He was so busy scrutinising the printout that he forgot to take the card from the shelf before leaving the counter.																								A few days later, he discovered that the card was not in his purse. He immediately reported the loss to the bank authorities. They told him that with his card, he had withdrawn Rs 60,000 from the Shyambazar and Esplanade counters on March 7.																								But the executive had never been to those counters. So he registered an FIR at Shakespeare Sarani police station on March 10. Police initially detained the security guard and grilled him. 																								Investigators said the guard had changed the pin number in the hope that that he would not be traced. We suspect his friends have helped him, police said.

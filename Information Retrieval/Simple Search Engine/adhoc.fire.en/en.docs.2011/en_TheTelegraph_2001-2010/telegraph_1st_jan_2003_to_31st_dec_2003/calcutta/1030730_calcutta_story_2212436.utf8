 Wednesday, July 30, 2003 				 Space jam spectre on masters courses
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta University is likely to experience a tough time tackling the rush of students expected to seek admission to the universitys post-graduate courses in its science, arts and commerce faculties. Nearly all the students who had written the universitys BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part II (honours) tests have cleared the exams, results of which were declared on Tuesday.																								Besides, more students have secured first-class marks in the Part II exams in some subjects this time, the authorities say. 																								Announcing the results, Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic), said the pass percentage in BA Part II (honours) 2003 is 98.91 per cent. In B.Sc Part II (honours), the success rate is 97.91 per cent. In B.Com Part II (honours), 97.21 per cent of the examinees have passed.																								The results of the B.Com Part II (general), also declared on Tuesday, showed a high success rate, too. Nearly 92.21 per cent of the examinees who appeared in the exam have passed this year.																								The overall performance of students is very good in all the four exams. The number of students obtaining first-class marks has increased in the honours exams. Students securing less than 60 per cent marks in some subjects may find it difficult to manage a berth in our post-graduate courses, admitted Das. 																								He felt commerce students will face the worst crisis, as 1,058 of them have scored a first class. At present, the university can accommodate only 800 students in the M.Com course. This means 258 students will not get admission, in spite of their performance. In geography, chemistry and zoology, 175, 140 and 129 students, respectively, have scored first-class marks. 																								We may consider increasing a small number of seats in the post-graduate courses in some non-laboratory-based subjects, said Das.

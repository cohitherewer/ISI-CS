The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, April 30, 2003 				 Rap ahead for syllabus slip in Part II
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta University authorities are looking at punitive action against a section of teachers for setting out-of-syllabus questions in three subjects in the BA and B.Sc Part II honours examinations of 2003.																								The university has taken a stern view of the matter after a preliminary inquiry into complaints from examinees. The students claimed that a number of questions in the mathematics, Bengali and psychology papers did not conform to the syllabus.																								A preliminary inquiry has revealed that the complaints are genuine. We have convened a meeting with members of the board of studies in mathematics, psychology and Bengali on May 5, at which we will discuss why the examinees were asked to answer such questions, said Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor (academic). 																								Officials in the universitys examination department said a large number of examinees have written letters to the authorities complaining about the inconvenience caused to them due to these out-of-syllabus questions.																								I could not answer a full question, carrying 20 marks, as it was based on a chapter that was not taught to us at all in class, said an examinee in psychology. The officials felt negligence on the part of the teachers in charge of moderating the examination papers could have led to the mess.																								Pro vice-chancellor Das, however, said the university would take all possible steps to remedy the situation and ensure that no student suffered for the error.

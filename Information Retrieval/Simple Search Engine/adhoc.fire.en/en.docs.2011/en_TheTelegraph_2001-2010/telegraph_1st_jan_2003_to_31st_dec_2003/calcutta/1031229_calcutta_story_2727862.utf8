		 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Lights and action by the lake
								Hrishikesh Saha: Jodhpur Parks lake was earlier choked with hyacinth and the banks had turned into garbage dumps. We see some renovations taking place. Could you elaborate on the revamp? 																																																													This project is funded by the Asian Development Bank. Under the scheme, the one-and-a-half-km lake will be fenced and embanked with concrete. Lights will be installed in the park, along with benches for the elderly and children. The lake will have boating facilities. A sum of Rs 42 lakh has been earmarked for the project, to be completed within three months.

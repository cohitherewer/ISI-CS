 Tuesday, July 15, 2003 				 Car curbs in security cover for PM
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Police will impose traffic restrictions from Tuesday evening for Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit. After a brief discussion with the Special Protection Group (SPG) members, who have been camping in the city for the past two days, the police have decided to throw a security ring on the roads Vajpayee will use.																								M.K. Singh, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said vehicular movement will be restricted along VIP Road and the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, especially the stretch between Ultadanga and Science City for Vajpayees convoy. 																								Roads will be closed in four phases from Tuesday evening, when the Prime Minister arrives, till Wednesday afternoon, when he leaves. Both flanks of VIP Road will be restricted to traffic from 7.35 pm. As soon as the convoy starts moving down VIP Road, traffic will be stopped on the Bypass, Singh said.																								For Vajpayees journey from Dum Dum airport to Raj Bhavan, traffic will be affected on the Bypass Park Circus connector, Theatre Road, Chowringhee and the Maidan till 8.15 pm. The Bypass stretch between Ambedkar Bridge and Chingrihata will be closed to traffic for half an hour from noon, when Vajpayee moves from the Hyatt Regency. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, however, said Vajpayees arrival time is uncertain due to engagements he will have to attend in connection with the death of former RSS chief Rajendra Singh.

 Thursday, November 13, 2003 				 Cops claim breakthrough in vigilante killers aide 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								More than two days have passed since the murder of Joydeb Dey, but the police have not been able to net killer Saumitra Chakraborty, alias Bhaiya. However, according to a senior officer, the arrest on Wednesday of Kartik De, alias Buro, one of Bhaiyas associates, is a major breakthrough.																								Ajay Nand, additional superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas), said Kartik was rounded up from Ahiritola at around 5.30 pm. He was hiding at a friends house close to his own home. Our men raided the house and arrested him. We hope to get some information about Bhaiya from him. I am sure the killer has not been able to leave the city yet, Nand said.																								Joydeb was shoved into a car, along with his friend Badal Sen, while they were chatting in front of a fast-food stall on BK Pal Avenue at 10.30 on Monday night by Bhaiya and three associates. On the way to Dakshineswar, Bhaiya spliced Joydebs jugular on PWD Road, near Dunlop. Badal managed to escape as the car came to a sudden stop in a traffic snarl. Two of the criminals were netted on the spot as Badals cries of alarm drew bystanders to the car. Bhaiya and Kartik fled. 																								According to a local thana official, a neighbour tipped off the police about Kartik entering his friends house early on Wednesday. Baranagar police station was informed and we made a joint raid. Kartik made contradictory statements during his interrogation, so we have not been able to come to any conclusion yet, the official said.																								But we have definite information from another source that Bhaiya is still in town. A raid is likely tonight at a friends place in the Jadavpur area, the official added.

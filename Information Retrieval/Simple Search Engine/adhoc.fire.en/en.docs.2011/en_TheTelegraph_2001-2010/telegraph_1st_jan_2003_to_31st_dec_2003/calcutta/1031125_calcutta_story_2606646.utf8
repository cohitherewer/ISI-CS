 Tuesday, November 25, 2003 				 Super Lakshmi
																								Narrated in the form of a fairy tale, this play depicts the contemporary political scenario. Dwipendranath, the feudal lord of Krishnapur, is blessed by Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of bounty. He lords over the honest and poor people of the area. Goddess Lakshmi showers her blessings on those disciples whose names are recommended by the heavenly triumvirate of Brhama-Vishnu-Maheshwar. The recommendation list is made according to the grandeur of rites performed. Hence, the poor people remain perpetually deprived. At this juncture, Jataibaba the Tantrik (nee, the idealist) comes to their aid and tactfully manages to entrap Goddess Lakshmi, and once she falls prey to his plan, she is imprisoned in the house of Brindaban, the honest milkman. Now the situation changes and she begins to bless the underprivileged. Consequently, Dwipendranath loses his powers and importance. On the other hand, the socio-political uplift of the poor is ensured. The axis of power moves from despotic to democratic system. But can the poor really utilise their new-found power? Dwipendranath changes his tact and reappears in a new avatar. Once again, the confrontation between resolutions and anti-resolutions comes to the fore. Based on Jyotisman Chattopadhyays play and directed by Ambar Roy, this is Samakalin Shilpidals latest production.

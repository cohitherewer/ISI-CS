Adolescence is one of the most thrilling times in a young persons life. And also the scariest. Both for the young person as well as the adult. Being a wise parent to adolescents has been a difficult task at best. Being a calm adolescent during the growing up years is even more of an impossibility. The primary reason adolescence is so distressing is because youngsters do not fully understand what is happening to them. Many of their fears and anxieties and discouragements could be obviated by a simple instructional programme. Ipsita Dasgupta of IpsCan has specifically designed this convention for both teenagers and their parents. A panel of professionals comprising Fr Michael Fohshow, Dr Pritpal Singh, Dr Kanika Mitra, Himalini Varma, Anand Nayek, Anwar Wahab , M.J. Robertson, Ayesha Das and Mira Kakkar will interact with another panel of adolescents comprising students as well as young people who are on their way to become professionals. The two groups will collectively focus on parenting that is more cued to the care of the youth  to meet the requirements of the teenager rather than overshadowing their needs with adult hankering.																								When: Tomorrow at 4.30 pm																								Where: St Xaviers College Auditorium

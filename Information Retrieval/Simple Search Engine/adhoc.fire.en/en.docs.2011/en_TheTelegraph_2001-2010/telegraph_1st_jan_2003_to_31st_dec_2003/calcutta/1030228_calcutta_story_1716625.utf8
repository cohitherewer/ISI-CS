The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, February 28, 2003 				 Medicare units with online diagnosis
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In an effort to take quality healthcare across the state and into the neighbouring nations, a city-based private group has decided to open several treatment centres, equipped with telemedicine facilities connecting all the units with Calcutta and an Ohio-based hospital in the US.																								To begin with, B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre plans to open 15 treatment centres-cum-diagnostic facilities in places like Siliguri, Burdwan, Midnapore, Malda, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar and a few towns in the Northeast. The treatment centres will have doctors and diagnostic facilities. 																								They will be equipped with telemedicine connections, through which experts in Calcutta can opine on a patients condition after a look at the investigation results, including X-rays and ECGs, said M.L. Pachisia of the Heart Research Centre.																								If required, the patients can be given a ringside view from experts in the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio, USA, with which the Centre has a tie-up. 																								Concerned over the lack of awareness among cardiac patients on the necessity of a lifestyle change after surgery or an angiography, the Centre has decided to open a cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation centre at the hospital itself.																								The rehabilitation centre, a one-of-its-kind in the East, will impart psychological counsel and dietary advice for patients who have undergone heart surgery. Even cases of chronic asthma will benefit.																								Starting with a modest budget of Rs 20 crore, the twin projects will kick off in March, with the opening of the rehabilitation centre in the hospital. In another two years time, we should have a full-fledged team of practitioners, working in most districts and in neighbouring countries, asserted Pachisia.

 Wednesday, July 30, 2003 				 Depression blame in death
 																											- Husbands business problems drive woman to suicide A STAFF REPORTER																								There was unrest among the residents of Biren Roy Road (West) in Thakurpukur after Chandrika Bhattacharya, a 36-year-old housewife, died of burns on Tuesday. 																								Police said the woman was suffering from depression. They have arrested her parents-in-law but her husband is missing. 																								Chandrika used to live with her husband Supriyo, six-year-old son Debapriyo and parents-in-law. The husband has a business in electrical goods. The family was friendly but of late they used to keep to themselves. 																								According to officer-in-charge of Thakurpukur police station, Shyamal Ghosh, in recent times Supriyos business was in the doldrums and the couple would often fight bitterly. 																								Most probably they were facing a financial crisis which might have triggered Chandrikas depression, Ghosh said.																								On Monday night, neighbours were taken aback when they found smoke coming out of their house. The main entrance was locked. After repeated calls one of the residents opened it. They rushed into the house and found Chandrika in flames. She was screaming in pain and frantically pleading with them to save her. She was taken to SSKM Hospital with more than 80 per cent burns. She died on Tuesday. 																								Chandrikas sister Papia Mukherjee said she was married to Supriyo for 16 years. 																								They led a happy life. Their son was born after 10 years of marriage. We were taken by surprise when we got the news of her death, she said. They were worried about Debapriyo who was with his grandparents. 																								The OC said they were looking for the womans husband who fled after the incident. We are now trying to find out whether she committed suicide or there is foul play behind the incident, the OC said.																								He said everything will come to light after the in-laws, who were arrested, are interrogated. They were waiting for Supriyo to be arrested for the mystery to be cleared.

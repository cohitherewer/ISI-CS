				 																																										A division bench of Calcutta High Court observed on Thursday that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had no right to snap the deep tubewell connection of any city building. It also directed the CMC to restore water connection to a building on Russell Street after fixing terms and conditions for the payment of its dues. Water supply to the Russell Street building was disconnected after its property tax dues amounted to Rs 8.3 crore, said CMC counsels. Earlier, Justice Dipak Kundu of Calcutta High Court had passed an interim directive to the civic body to restore water supply to the premises. On Thursday, the CMC filed an appeal against this order before a division bench presided over by Justice Dilip Seth. During the hearing, residents of the building told the court that the CMC had not yet carried out the order. Not only that, the civic body has also threatened to disconnect our deep tubewell connections, the residents alleged.				 																																										People of Howrah and the adjoining areas reeled under a filtered water crisis on Thursday after a huge crack developed in the underground pipeline a few days ago. A joint team from Howrah Municipal Corporation and Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority detected a five-foot long crack in the mainline during the day. Chief engineer of Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Dibyendu Roy Choudhury, said the crack was too large for short-term repairs. Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya on Thursday assured Howrah residents that normal services will resume from Saturday. 				 																																										After the state government initiated a move last month to recover blocked sales tax amounting to Rs 75 crore from a Calcutta-headquartered company Metal Box, the BIFR has lined up a review meeting in Delhi on March 3 to discuss the reopening of the company with units across the country. The government has threatened to seize and auction Metal Boxs prime properties in Calcutta and Darjeeling if the management failed to pay up the pending dues. The management and the Metal Box Workers Union, which has organised agitations in the city to press for the companys revival, said on Thursday that they would attend the meet and discuss rehabilitation of the companys units.				 																																										Traffic movement was crippled in the city on Thursday after Youth Congress supporters blocked Rani Rashmoni Avenue to protest the Dhantola incident, where several women were molested by miscreants. Police arrested 368 demonstrators. 				 																																										Several areas in north Calcutta will suffer power cuts on Friday as a CESC team will carry out switchgear maintenance work at its Baranagar distribution station. Power supply in Baranagar, Kamarhati, Bonhooghly and Dakshineshwar will be affected from 9 am to 11 am as a result.				 																																										Habra police arrested Fakir Mondol, a criminal involved in a string of dacoities in the city and the adjoining districts, on Thursday. A revolver and several live cartridges were recovered from him.				 																																										Jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury on Thursday admitted that there was not enough infrastructure to handle high-risk prisoners like Aftab Ansari in Presidency and five other central jails in the state. Chowdhury held a meeting with inspector-general, prisons, and other senior officers after a cellphone was discovered from under the mattress of Ansari at Presidency jail early this week. We have already taken action against the jail employees concerned and asked two deputy IGs to investigate the matter, he said. The police have been asked to step up security outside Presidency jail, he added.

 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 Mastermind held for pellet raid on cop vehicle 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The leader of a gang of five miscreants, who sprayed pellets at a Radio Flying Squad (RFS) jeep on the Maidan, was arrested on Friday afternoon from Akra, in South 24-Parganas, barely 36 hours after the incident.																								The mastermind, identified as Md. Idris, has confessed to firing at the police vehicle. The police have booked him for attempt to murder. Raids continue in different hideouts to net the rest of the gangsters. Idris had been arrested two years ago on dacoity charges.																								Acting on a tip-off, a team of sleuths left for Akra on Thursday morning. The policemen, in plainclothes, rounded up Idris from Akra railway station. Idris told his interrogators that he and his gang members were on their way back from Howrah.																								Around 2.30 am on Thursday, the miscreants attacked the police jeep in front of Fort William, smashing its headlights and cracking the windscreen. After spraying pellets from a 12-bore pipegun, they sped away towards Kidderpore. One sergeant, armed with a revolver, and four constables  two of them with .303 rifles  were too stunned to react.																								Senior officers at Lalbazar initiated a departmental inquiry against the sergeant and the constables to find out why they failed to fire at the gangsters. Apparently, the constables and the sergeant could have fired. The inquiry is on and if we find them guilty, stern action will be taken, said Sivaji Ghosh, deputy commissioner, headquarters.

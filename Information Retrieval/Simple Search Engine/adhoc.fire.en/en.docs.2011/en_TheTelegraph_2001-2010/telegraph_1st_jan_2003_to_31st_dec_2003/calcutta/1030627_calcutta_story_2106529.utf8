The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, June 27, 2003 				 Class of 84
Class of 84 is a covertly introspective play, written and directed by Rahul Da Cunha and presented by Rage. The reunion of eight friends belonging to the 1984 batch of St Xaviers College explores and exhibits the complexities and frailties of human nature and relationships. The friends reunite in the beach house of Sanjay and Raveena Mehra, after the passing away of one of the gang members, and thus begin an odyssey of self-exploration, introspection and soul-searching. Comprising an impressive cast with Rajit Kapoor, Shenaz Patel, Rituraj, Radhika Da Cunha, Joy Sengupta, Sohrab Ardeshir, Dipika Ray and Zafar Karachiwala, the play is bound to grab attention and exceed expectations. Rahul Da Cunhas script delicately traverses the undulating plot, conflict and denouement of the play. Showcased as part of Odeon 2003, it is presented by Hutch. 																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

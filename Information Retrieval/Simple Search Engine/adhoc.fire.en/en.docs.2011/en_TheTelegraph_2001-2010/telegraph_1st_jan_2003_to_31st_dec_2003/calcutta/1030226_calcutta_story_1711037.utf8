				 																																										lCalcutta High Court on Tuesday passed an interim order, directing the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to restore water connection to the premises at 6, Russel Street, under the Park Street police station. Justice Dipak Kundu passed the order on the basis of a plea by residents of the building. The CMC, armed with another order by a division bench of the same court, had disconnected water supply to the building for alleged non-payment of property tax amounting to over Rs 8 crore. CMC lawyer Ashok Das Adhikari said he would appeal to the division bench against the order. Recently, the division bench, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice J. Biswas, passed an interim stay order on the verdict passed by Justice B. Bhattacharya that the CMC had no power to disconnect water connection for non-payment of property tax. After the order of the division bench, the CMC started its old move to realise the due property tax by disconnecting the water connections.				 																																										The West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation on Tuesday shut down 11 small industries in the Behala Industrial Estate as they have stopped production for years. However, entrepreneurs of the closed industries said they would move court protesting the closure. They argued that the corporation had illegally closed the industries though they were running well.				 																																										The court restrained the CMC from demolishing the stalls of food firm Benfish for its alleged refusal to pay higher licence fees. The CMC had demolished a Benfish stall at Chetla after the state-run company refused to pay the higher rate. The CMC was planning to take similar action against other stalls. Benfish moved court against the civic body. The court ordered a status quo in regard to the Chetla stalls and empowered the CMC to adopt other methods to realise the fee.				 																																										Anila Devi, 90, a veteran educationist and former president of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education, died on Monday night at her residence, following a long illness. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee condoled the death on Tuesday. She was also a member of the West Bengal Legislative Council and the Assembly. 				 																																										Jubeda Begum, 58, was hit by a private bus on Dilkhusha Street on Tuesday. She was taken to National Medical College and Hospital. The driver fled, leaving the bus behind. Locals damaged the vehicle and blocked the road for half an hour.				 																																										Members of the Jadavpur University Teachers Association (JUTA) submitted a memorandum to vice-chancellor Ashok Nath Basu on Tuesday, demanding immediate measures to fill up vacant teaching posts at the university. There are nearly 700 teaching posts, of which 180 are vacant. The teachers complained that normal teaching in all the faculties was affected due to the shortage of teachers. 				 																																										The court of Justice Kundu, on Tuesday, passed an interim directive restraining the CMC from demolishing 180 glosign boards of a mobile phone company as the company had already paid visual tax. The court, however, directed the company to send a list of its glosign advertisements in different shops and establishments in the city. The company moved court, demanding a return of the money, amounting to Rs 4.83 lakh, it had paid as tax.

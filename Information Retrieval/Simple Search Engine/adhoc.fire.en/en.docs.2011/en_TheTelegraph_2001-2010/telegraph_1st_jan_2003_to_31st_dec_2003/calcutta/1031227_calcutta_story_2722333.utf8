The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Buddha bows to foul-air fiat
 																											- Advocate-general steers motion to meet Bharat II deadline A STAFF REPORTER																								The government announced on Friday that it would abide by the Calcutta High Court order on cleaning up the city air by trying to ensure Bharat Stage II compliance within April 2004.																								The announcement came after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee convened a meeting at his Writers Buildings chamber to discuss the emission-standard deadline slapped by the court on all vehicles in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.																								The meeting was attended by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, finance minister Asim Dasgupta and advocate-general Balai Roy, besides chief secretary Ashok Gupta and transport secretary H.P. Roy.																								We shall follow the high court order and make all efforts to stick to the April 4 deadline. We shall take the steps as directed by the court, minister Chakraborty said after the meeting.																								The governments first public announcement on the thorny matter was prompted by indications that the judiciary was in no mood to soften its foul-air stand and allow the government more breathing space.																								According to officials in the state secretariat, once the high court made it clear last week that the government must comply with the Bharat II directives, the chief secretary convened a meeting on December 23 with officials from the transport department, oil companies and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. A 10-point action plan was adopted.																								The chief minister on Friday called up the advocate general to learn about the views of the court and the legal implications of the matter, before calling in ministers Dasgupta and Chakraborty. According to sources, Chakraborty tried to convince the chief minister that meeting the Bharat II deadline was tough, as there were a number of problems, including a corpus of at least Rs 150 crore.																								But Balai Roy insisted that the government must act. The advocate-general reportedly told the chief minister that the court had taken serious note of the governments inaction on the auto-emission count and would brook no more excuses.																								We are in no position to face the court, as we did not act properly and on time in this matter. It is the responsibility of the government to find out how the court order can be complied with. But it must at least do something to start with, Roy is believed to have told those present at the meeting.																								The transport department, meanwhile, has issued the government order to form a 10-member technical committee, headed by the member-secretary of the state pollution control board, to monitor the shift to Bharat II.

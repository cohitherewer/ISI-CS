																								This is Satyabatis tale, nay, about all the Satyabatis around us who refuse to mould themselves and fit into rigid, pre-defined social norms to be normal. Society labels them abnormal and uses brutal force to terrorise and subjugate them. Satyabati finds her world a difficult place to live in. Her parents strive to make their maladjusted daughter feel comfortable. Satyabatis elder brother wishes he had a normal sister. Her younger brother hardly knows his Didi because ever since he can recollect, Satyabati has been languishing in a mental asylum. Satyabati was an all-rounder  a brilliant student, equally talented in sports, specially in swimming. Ever since malady struck her, she has been barred from participating in all her favourite activities. Something somewhere has snapped. Her world has turned topsy-turvy and the vivacious girl has slowly and inexorably gone mad. Or has she? Who can define clearly who is mad? A society full of vices and maladies or someone who refuses to toe the line and follow the tenets of society blindly. Based on Olwen Wymarks play and adapted by Rudraprasad Sengupta, this Rangroop production sees the directorial debut of Swatilekha Sengupta, who has also scored the music. Cast includes Seema Mukhopadhyay and Sohini Sengupta.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

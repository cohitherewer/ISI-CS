The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, June 27, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	Travelling in a tram has become a risky affair, especially  in north Calcutta. Recently, a tram loaded with passengers  jumped tracks on Belgachhia bridge, but the commuters thankfully  survived. The vehicle screeched to a halt just on the edge  of the bridge. Most tramcars need repairs. The tracks must  also be relaid.

	This is in response to a complaint in this column. During  a recent inspection at Heysham Road, a CESC team found that  the lighting installations on this stretch were operating.  One of the two sodium vapour lamps fitted to a Corporation  post, in front of Ajmera High School, was found out of order.

	Mechua fruit market remains littered with fruit peels,  leaves and straws, while flies buzz overhead. The civic  body should order a clean-up.

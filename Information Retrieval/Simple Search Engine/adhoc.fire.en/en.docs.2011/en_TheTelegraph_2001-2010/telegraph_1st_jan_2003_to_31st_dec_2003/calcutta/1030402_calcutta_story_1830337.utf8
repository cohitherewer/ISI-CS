 																											- SUCI activists thrash Writers cops, snatch lathis in noon swoop OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT		 SUCI demonstrators stormed the Writers  Buildings security cordon in a surprise swoop on Tuesday  afternoon. They fought a pitched battle with the police  in front of the seat of governance, disrupting city  centre traffic for hours. The activists were protesting  the hike in public transport fares. Picture by Pabitra  DasTraffic became immobile in BBD Bag on Tuesday afternoon, when SUCI supporters fought a pitched battle with the police in front of Writers Buildings during a rally to protest the hike in bus, minibus and taxi fares.																								The SUCI activists hurled stones at the police, snatched lathis from them and beat them up. In a free-for-all that continued for nearly half an hour, an assistant commissioner of police was slapped, and some supporters tried to snatch deputy commissioner of police (reserve force) Ranvir Kumars baton. Twenty-four persons were arrested and 14 policemen injured. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could not take his usual route home for lunch. 																								Around 1 pm, about 100 slogan-shouting SUCI supporters approached the secretariat from the Reserve Bank of India-end and took the police by surprise. As some policemen rushed towards the west gate to hold the SUCI supporters at bay, another group of about 100 SUCI activists targeted the force manning the central gate.																								Unable to contain the activists, the police resorted to a lathicharge and dragged several of them into a prison van. Another group of activists, who marched towards Writers from the Lalbazar side, blocked the vans passage. About eight arrested supporters inside it kicked open the door and jumped out.																								At one point of time, it appeared as if the situation would spin out of hand, with the police force present at Writers outnumbered. Even after the lathicharge, SUCI activists repeatedly regrouped and attacked the policemen. Around 1.15 pm, the entire stretch from the Reserve Bank to Lalbazar and the areas in front of Stephen House on one side and Tea Board on the other, turned into a battle field.																								The SUCI activists snatched lathis from several policemen before they could realise what was happening. A number of policemen beat up the protesters with their shields made of cane. Activists lay on the road in front of the secretariat. Policewomen hesitated to tackle them. Peak afternoon traffic was severely  disrupted in the BBD Bag area. Vehicles stood still along  BBD Bag (West) and those bound for places like Bowbazar  and Great Eastern Hotel were stuck for over 15 minutes.  West-bound vehicles along BB Ganguly Street were stalled  owing to the clash near Tea Board and in front of the secretariats  eastern gate. The situation returned to normal after 1.30  pm.

 Monday, June 09, 2003 				 Train missed in time mess
 A STAFF REPORTER		 The Rajdhani Express jinx  saw a rerun on Sunday afternoon, with 14 passengers  missing the 2305 Up to New Delhi because they went by  the timings on their tickets.The Rajdhani Express jinx just refuses to end. A day after passengers of a Howrah-bound train via Patna went without food or drinking water, 14 passengers of a Delhi-bound train via Patna were left stranded in the station.																								The passengers reached the station as per the departure time printed on their tickets, which however, proved incorrect. All the passengers were offered berths on the Kalka Mail, with the balance amount refunded. Seven of them took the Kalka, while the rest accepted a refund, an Eastern Railway official said. 																								Of the 14 who missed the Rajdhani, six were from the Sunderbans, six from Orissas Berhampur and the other two were from Assam and Delhi, officials said. We have been issuing advertisements in newspapers and making announcements over the public address systems in all major stations in our divisions to let people know that the time printed on the ticket is incorrect. But some passengers still missed the train, he said. 																								Eastern Railway officials said the confusion over the Rajdhani tickets would persist till July 6. Earlier, the Rajdhani used to leave Howrah every Wednesday and Sunday. However, it was decided in March that the Rajdhani via Gaya will leave Howrah at 5 pm every day and the one via Patna would be discontinued. However, under pressure from a section of passengers, it was decided that the 2305 Up would run every Sunday, the official said. 																								Since some tickets till July 6 bear the wrong timings, we reserve some berths on alternative trains for passengers who might miss the 2305 Up. This arrangement will be continued till July 6, so that the inconvenience caused to passengers is minimised, the official added.

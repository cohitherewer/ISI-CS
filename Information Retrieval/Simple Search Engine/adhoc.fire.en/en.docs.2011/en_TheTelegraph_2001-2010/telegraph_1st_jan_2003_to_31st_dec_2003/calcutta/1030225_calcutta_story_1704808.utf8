The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, February 25, 2003 				 Extreme Human Behaviour
																								Max Mueller Bhavan Goethe Institut Inter Nationes, Calcutta, hosts an evening of enacted play-reading on the theme of Extreme Human Behaviour, performed by members of Spotlight. The first two monologues: Im Ulrike  Screaming and It Happened Tomorrow, by Franca Rame, have been described as obscenely tragic with the obscenity of our times. Ulrike Menhoff and Irmgard Moeller were both members of the Red Army Fraction  the German terrorist organisation, and high priests of their murderous ideologies. In 1976-77, they were found dead or dying in the maximum security prison of Stammheim in Munich  in what were described as suicides or suicide attempts. These two monologues will be read/enacted by Rita Roy and Punam Singh. Peter Swets The Interview, to be read/enacted by Cedric Spanos and Pradip Mitra, is a controversial duel between a tough insurance investigator and a gentle Jewish tailor trying to escape from dark memories of Nazi terrorism.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Max Mueller Bhavan

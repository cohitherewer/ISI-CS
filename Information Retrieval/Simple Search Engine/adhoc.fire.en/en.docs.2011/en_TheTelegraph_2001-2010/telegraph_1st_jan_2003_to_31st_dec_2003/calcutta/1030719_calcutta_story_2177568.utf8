 Saturday, July 19, 2003 				 Students and top scorers
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Arka Majumdar: Tops. Picture by Amit Datta																								The new rules being followed by the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary (HS) Education, as also the Madhyamik Board, have robbed the examinations of their merit-list but not the high-performers of their star status. 																								Though Council officials would not declare their ranks, the names of Arka Majumdar, Kaushik Dasgupta and Debaleena Basu (as also Iti Baidya, the girl in the news for overcoming poverty to rank high in the Joint Entrance Examination) were thrown up within a few hours of the results being declared on Friday.																								Arka, a student of Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission, appears to have got himself a place at the top with 977 out of a maximum of 1,000 marks. Till late in the evening, no one appeared to have outscored this Suri (Birbhum) boy, who joined the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, a few days ago with an all-India ranking of 68. 																								Arka, son of doctor parents (both work in a government hospital in Suri), is studying electronic engineering and would like to join academics. He likes listening to Hindi film songs, and is averse to settling abroad.																								South Points Kaushik Dasgupta is going to be neck-and-neck with Arka when the provisional merit-list is announced, after reviews, if any. Like Arka, this Behala boy has got through the Joint Entrance Examination for the IITs and will study electronic engineering.																								Bringing more cheer to the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission Residential College were Arkas classmates, Sumanta Chatterjee and Debapriyo Pati, both of whom scored 969.																								Among the girls, Debaleena Basu of Khardah appears to have outperformed others. The Rahara Bhabanath Institution for Girls student has notched up a score of 940 marks. Iti Baidya did well, too, with a tally of 896. The family appeared happy but the girl herself was not. She feels she could have done better, said father Nimai Baidya.																								Among government schools, Hare and Hindu appear to have outperformed others in the city. In the districts, Purulia Zilla HS School has a student in the 950-plus category.

																								What is life? According to ancient Indian philosophy, life is a continuing, indestructible force that is eternal, transcending barriers of time and space, and in this vast universe life is the only mobile force that motivates continuity. Dance is a primitive form of expression that emulates and explores the eternal force of life. Since time immemorial, man has explored the entire gamut of emotions through dance. Pallavi Krishnan, an alumni of both Santiniketan and Kerala Kalamandalam, is a Mohiniyattam exponent who has been performing solo in all important and prestigious national festivals. Recipient of numerous awards and honours, Krishnan is the artistic director of Lasya Academy of Mohiniyattam, Kerala. Anamika Kala Sangam hosts a solo recital of this talented danseuse whose graceful and stylised movements have always held the audience spellbound. Time for dance buffs to enjoy a memorable evening.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Padatik Little Theatre, 6/7 AJC Bose Road

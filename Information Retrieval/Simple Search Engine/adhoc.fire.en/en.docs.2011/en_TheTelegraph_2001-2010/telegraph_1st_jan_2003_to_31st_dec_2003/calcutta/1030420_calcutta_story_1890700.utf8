 Sunday, April 20, 2003 				 Service revolver in arms racket bust
 UTTAM DUTTA																								In a joint raid on Saturday morning, the CID and the district police busted an inter-state racket in arms smuggling at Uttarpara. Two traders were arrested and a cache of arms, including a .38 bore loaded revolver, was recovered.																								The revolver, which carried a Made in England label, is used only by policemen and defence personnel. The serial numbers of the revolver have been tampered with, said a senior CID official. Suspecting that the weapon must have been stolen from a police station, the CID has alerted all thanas in Bengal. The revolver will be sent to the state forensic science laboratory for investigation.																								Acting on a tip-off that two traders were involved in smuggling arms from Siwan and Munger districts of Bihar and supplying them to local criminals, a team of CID sleuths and the district police barged into a house at Makhla, two kilometres from the Uttarpara police station, shortly after midnight and arrested brothers Amod and Subodh Singh. 																								We found several pistols and improvised pipeguns stashed away in a corner of the house, said sub-divisional police officer of Serampore, Shankho Subhro Chakraborty. The duo was produced in court on Saturday and remanded in police custody for five days.																								nDacoity: A gang of seven dacoits looted cash and jewellery worth more than Rs 1 lakh from a house in Purbachal, in the East Jadavpur police station area, on Saturday. House-owner Samir Lahiri has been injured.

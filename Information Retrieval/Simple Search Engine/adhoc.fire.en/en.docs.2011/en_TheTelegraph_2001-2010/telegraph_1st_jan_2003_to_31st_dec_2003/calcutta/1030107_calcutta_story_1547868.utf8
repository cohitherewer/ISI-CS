				 pia sorcar 																									Is how this 25-year-old manages to pack in so much to a 24-hour day. But if she could fit in three under-graduate degrees in five years at the University of Colorado at Boulder, she clearly has time on her side.																									She must move through all the things she does. Without letting quality slip. A committee met to decide whether the 2001 batch student would be allowed to enrol at three colleges to major in economics, business administration and information systems. Broke all the Univ records she could find and bagged a Summa Cum Laude, the highest honour, for economics, too.																									There is more to Pia than her academic achievements. She has a parallel career in cultural activities, having started out in fathers [Manick, magician PC Sorcar (Sr)s eldest son] albums of nursery rhymes Chhucho Kottar Biye and Tai Tai Tai at age three. Released in the US as a video album, this was her fathers first animation live-action venture, for which Pia had to act on camera. Was nominated for the Hartland Regional Emmy Award for her performance in Deepa and Rupa, based on a Panchatantra tale, at age 12.																									Is the refrain for Pia and sis Payel for their 50-strong troupe, aged between four and 27. The gal, who just finished a show at Uttam Mancha called Sorcarama, started dancing on stage at three years, later learning tap, ballet, jazz, Greek, African, Tagore style, Bharatanatyam, Kathak and Santhali in hometown Denver. Now the sisters choreograph stage shows around the year and are planning tours of Canada, New Zealand and Australia with their family gig. Loves working with her family, especially for charity.																									Of excellence, is Pia, with her multi-faceted projects. She is working on a project, as part of her broadcast journalism studies on child abuse, sponsored by the American Bar Association. Though they wanted a graduate for the job, her work ex at an international TV channel caused her college to recommend her. Now this is a weekend project, as Pia works full time as an economic research analyst for a firm that produces financial models for litigation.

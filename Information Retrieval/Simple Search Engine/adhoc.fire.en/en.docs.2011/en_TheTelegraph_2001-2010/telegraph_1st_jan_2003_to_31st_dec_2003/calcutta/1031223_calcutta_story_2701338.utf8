The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

				 	SOUMIK DATTA SOUMIK DATTA																									Was a curiosity enough to make this London-based boy shift allegiance from Yeh kaali kaali aankhen, picked up during his early days in Mumbai, to Hindustani classical music. Was 12 when his father started giving him lessons. It has taken him just a few years to hone his natural talent enough to take the stage.																									Brought Soumik, now 19, to the Calcutta stage. A show on December 17 at GD Birla Sabhagar was not his premiere in town, as the boy with roots in Calcutta has already played at the Salt Lake Music Conference last year. But being accompanied by Bikram Ghosh on the tabla was out of this world. Hopefully, this is not the last we will see of the second-year student of English literature at University College London, as he plans to finish his degree and live here for at least six months to learn from guruji Buddhadev Dasgupta.																									Is what he invaded with some relish. After he won the senior strings competition at Harrow School three years running, introducing Indian strings there for the first time ever, he was politely told not to come back, so other students would get a chance! Given that the tutelage from the maestro is mainly during holidays, this feat is a result of tremendous motivation.																									Doesnt end there. The dude who tops his class in the academic arena just completed a run at the Bloomsbury Theatre, playing the lead on stage in Cabaret. Painting has been a long-standing passion, too. While he wants to see how many things he can take on at once, he realises that eventually he will have to scale down to one main area of interest, and that is most likely to be music.																									Is as much Soumiks style as a group gig. The guy who thinks playing at Prithvi Theatre, Mumbai, last year was really cool has dabbled with other media, like jazz-fusion, playing in a band called GO4 and touring festivals at Hanover Square, the Isle of Wight as well as Singapore. He has also toured as a solo artiste with the Asian Music Circuit, London.

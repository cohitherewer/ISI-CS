 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Barely a week before Higher Secondary (HS) 2003 begins, the HS Council was forced to admit on Monday that a student was given four marks less in his physics paper last year. As the student was still unsatisfied, a high court judge asked the Council to recheck his physics paper and file a fresh report in court.																								Tathagata Roy, who bagged a first division in HS 2002, filed a case in Calcutta High Court, alleging that his physics paper had not been evaluated properly. On the basis of his complaint, Justice Barin Ghosh asked the Council to produce the script in court. It was then found that Roy had not been given appropriate marks for several questions. The judge asked the Council to recheck the script and to file a report in court.																								On Monday, the Council told the court that there was an error in awarding marks to Roy and the tally had risen after a recheck of the answer-script.																								Roys lawyer Ekramul Bari told the court that when the answer-script was brought to court, it was found that the examiner had not awarded any marks for several questions, though the answers were correct. My client is not satisfied with the recheck and the subsequent report by the Council. I am sure his marks will rise further if a recheck is conducted properly, Bari added.																								The Councils lawyer Ranajit Chatterjee opposed the plea, but the judge asked the Council to rescan the answer-script and file a separate report. After publication of last years Higher Secondary and Madhyamik results, a good number of candidates approached the high court, demanding it look into their grievances. In many cases, the papers were found marked erroneously.

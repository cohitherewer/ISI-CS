The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, February 17, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									I am dismayed by the sluggishness of mobile police and the indifference of taxi drivers. While taking my mother-in-law back home from a nursing home in Salt Lake recently, I hailed several cabbies but none of them was willing to go, though my house is quite near. Then I asked the nearby police patrol van to help us get a taxi but none of them stepped forward either. My mother-in-law was hardly able to stand, while cabs passed by us one after the other. 				 																																									Shyamal Ghosh,				 																																									Purbachal.				 																																									Stray dogs are increasing in number. Most of them suffer from skin diseases. The Corporation should take steps.				 																																									B.N. Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, April 18, 2003  Ditties from a soulful land
 Watery landscapes, bhatiyali  songs, roving fishermen. Men of East Bengal drew nourishment  from a fertile cultural soil. Samir Mukerjee remembers  two of them The people of east bengal are  generally very robust, down-to-earth and nature-oriented.  I noticed these characteristics in my father, Sachin Mukherjee,  who was born and brought up in Dhaka. He left Dhaka in the  1920s to go to England where he became a chartered accountant.  As there was opposition to his going abroad, he took the  help of some of his friends and teachers to get away without  being detected. The watery landscape of East Bengal  had left an indelible imprint on his mind. The presence  of so many rivers and the haunting bhatiyali songs  of the roving fishermen travelling huge distances had enriched  my fathers mental landscape. He often sang ditties which  he must have heard from the Muslim peasants, proving his  closeness to the soil. He also amused us with a barrage  of slokas in Sanskrit. If he ever saw a bullock-cart,  laden with straw somewhere outside Calcutta, he would explain  to me where the straw came from and where it could be headed  for. Father did not want me to be purely an urban animal  divorced from the benedictions of nature. I also remember  how excited he felt when he heard the kokil announcing  its arrival at the crack of dawn perched on a mango tree  in our garden. Deep within him lay the echoes of another  world. Once in a while he used to go off to Belur Math early  in the morning, just to sit near the river quietly by himself.  This was his way of escaping from the hurly burly of daily  existence. As one of the leading lights of  Martin Burn Ltd. he was known for his solicitude for the  clerks. One such clerk had his sons education paid for  by my father. Another employee from one of the electric  supply companies that Martin Burn owned was afflicted with  tuberculosis and father became responsible for his treatment. Martin Burn Officers Club was  established by him where seniors could meet and talk to  juniors without the hierarchical barriers coming in the  way. This gesture was greatly appreciated by the officers.  He also made it a point to invite officers to the Calcutta  Club for lunch, where a first-rate meal was served with  hors doeuvres often on the menu. He was always anxious  to promote social intercourse amongst officers to preserve  internal harmony and cohesiveness.  Whenever labour disputes cropped  up, father sat at the negotiating table with the union leaders.  There was no anger, there were no harsh threats. Relying  on gentle and firm persuasion, my father could defuse a  crisis to the satisfaction of all concerned. The clerks  trusted him implicitly. After his death in 1957, union problems  often got out of hand and there were rowdy demonstrations. I remember how he took us round  the Continent a few times and how the trips went off without  any contretemps. He used to plan our travels meticulously  and made foolproof arrangements with the help of his friend,  Anil Sen, who ran Trade Wings. On our visit to Paris in  1948 he took us to the Folies Bergere and Bal Tabarin although  such a move might have been considered risque by any other  father. He wanted us to be exposed to the outside world  even if it meant watching beautiful women flaunting their  anatomy and performing capricious acts. He was one of the  most protective fathers one could ever have and even 46  years after his death, my memories of him remain as vivid  and vibrant as ever. When Im immersed in recollections  of the past, a very vital and dynamic person appears before  me in all his glory. This is Raibahadur Keshab Chandra Banerjee   one of the zamindars of Murapara in East Bengal and my  fathers uncle. My father and his brothers were brought  up in Murapara House, presided over by Keshabbabu.  He was a very talented musician and played the tabla with  great eclat all his life. He took his initial training from  Prasanna Banik, a redoubtable musician. Later, he was instructed  by the famous Nathu Khan. Keshabbabus eldest son,  Nirmal, was apprenticed to Ustad Maseed Khan and became  a competent tabla player. In 1939 when Dhaka Radio began  to air programmes, Nirmal participated in several tabla  lahara sessions. Once the Dhaka Radio Station got  into its stride, the town was inundated by musicians of  different hues, and quite a lot of them came and stayed  at Keshabbabus opulent mansion. I can remember the  names of Allauddin Khan, Hafiz Ali Khan, Enayat Hussain  Khan, Bhismadeb Chatterjee and Sachin Deb Burman. Murapara  House became an exciting centre for the propagation of Indian  classical music with a receptive audiences crowding the  courtyard. Keshabbabu accompanied  the leading instrumentalists of his day on the tabla. He  organised a number of musical soirees at different public  halls in Dhaka. In 1936-37, Dhaka was flooded with rich  classical music and in various well-to-do and culture-oriented  households, musical gatherings were held at regular intervals.  Keshabbabu was at the centre of this musical effervescence  and his cordial relationship with all the great musicians  made his position positively enviable. He could also play  the piano and encouraged his eldest daughter to take up  the esraj. When he started residing in Calcutta after the  Partition in the early Fifties, he participated in numerous  music conferences and was honoured with the Bhuwalka award  in 1980. During his long tenure in Calcutta,  musicians like Sachin Das Motilal, Tarapada Chakravarty  and Chinmoy Lahiri were regular visitors and their proximity  couldnt have been more productive. Quite often, historical  and mythological plays were staged in the house in Dhaka.  Members of the family and close friends were the main performers.  In this world of colour and bustle, life retained its sparkle,  creating an ambience of joy and wonder where the children  felt privileged. The concept of public service  ignited his sensibilities. He was vice-chairman of the Dhaka  District Board, chairman of the Dhaka Municipality and a  member of the Legislative Council. These were not ornamental  positions he held as he put in a tremendous amount of hard  work for the uplift of Dhaka. He was also associated with  various universities and I can imagine him taking an interest  in raising the educational standards  and making the universities  themselves centres of excellence. He was also an enthusiastic  shikari, concentrating on tigers and crocodiles.  He was the very embodiment of old world gentility and monumental  simplicity. Always easily approachable, he knew how to keep  children entertained and amused. One also remembers the  number of appendages residing in his opulent house, nourished  by his hospitality. Partition brought with it traumas  and travails but Keshabbabu bore his sense of loss  with an inner grace that few are blessed with. Wherever  he went, the plangent beat of the tabla accompanied him.  He deserves much greater recognition from the connoisseurs  in this age of forgetfulness.

 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Scowls over suspensions 
 OUR BUREAU																								Six days after the government found six junior doctors guilty of assault on a patients kin and members of the media at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, some officials of the college council at the troublespot have questioned the fairness of the punitive measure.																								The council members at the hospital told an inquiry team, comprising senior Indian Medical Association (IMA) functionaries and the Medical Service Centre, on Tuesday that the government had not taken them into confidence and had not explained on what basis the guilty doctors had been identified.																								The first independent inquiry team tried to piece together the circumstances under which the six doctors, including four interns and two house-staff members, were found guilty of the trouble that broke out on the night of November 1, after the death of 72-year-old Nityogopal Banik, in the emergency wing.																								The government announced on November 5 that six junior doctors  four interns (three of them members of the Democratic Students Organisation), two junior doctors (who left the SFI recently) and a student  were guilty of perpetrating violence on the campus. Four interns were suspended and the two house-staff members ordered to leave the hospital.																								After Tuesdays inquiry, Subhas Chakraborty, chairman of the inquiry team and a senior IMA functionary, said: Some of the college council members were not only surprised by the decision, but also dismayed that doctors owing allegiance to one particular party were singled out for such harsh punishment.																								Some council members even told the inquiry team they were planning to write to the government questioning the punitive procedure. Later on Tuesday, members of the Democratic Students Organisation and the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad held a protest meeting against the illegal suspension of the junior doctors.

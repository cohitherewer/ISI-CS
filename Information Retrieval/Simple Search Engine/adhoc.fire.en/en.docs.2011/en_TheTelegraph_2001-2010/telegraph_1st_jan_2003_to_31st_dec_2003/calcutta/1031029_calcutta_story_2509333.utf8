The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, October 29, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	I take the Metro to school from Belgachhia to Rabindra  Sadan. Hence, I buy the 80-ride-2-zone tickets for my convenience.  But unfortunately, the ticket gets stuck in the punching  machine at the stations after about 10 days of use. Getting  the fare reimbursed is a loss of time and energy. The authorities  must rectify the faulty machines or replace them with new  ones.  
	Nidhi Dokania, Student, Ashok Hall.  
	Quite a few care centres for animals have come up in the  city, but there are none for birds. Often, injured birds  fall prey to stray cats and dogs.

	A large number of commuters take the bus on route 47B from  the Kalindi bus stand. Potholes of various sizes have scarred  the approach road to the bus stand. A vat located on the  road emits a stench, which makes passing through the stretch  almost unbearable. 
	 Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 30, 2003 				 Party roots in illegal roofs
				 	 RAJIB DEB, Trinamul Congress councillor of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) ward no. 68 and mayoral council member (conservancy), met readers of The Telegraph last week to answer their queries. Participants included Kanan Banerjee, Ranjit Kumar Dutta, Samir Ganguly, Achintya Sen, Subhas Ghosh, Sudarshan Roy, Nemai Das, Bapi Mitra, Bimal Das, Joydeb Roychowdhury and Goutam Hari Chatterjee				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Bimal Das: Some illegal constructions are coming up in Bakul Bagan. Political parties are said to be involved in them. Will you please look into the matter?																																																			We cannot allow illegal construction. I shall request you to bring to my notice and the CMC as well if you come across such constructions. Neither any individual, nor any political party, is permitted to construct anything illegally. 																																																									

Samir Ganguly: In the Fern Road area, several unauthorised constructions have been accorded legal status. 																																																			If you provide me with the relevant papers, the CMC will take action after a proper inquiry. Everyone must remember that the present board in the CMC will never allow any illegal work whatsoever.																																																									

Joydeb Roychowdhury: Some residents of Bakul Bagan and Benoy Bose Road dump litter on the roads and pollute the area. How can we get rid of this menace?																																																			Every citizen has the right to enjoy a pollution-free atmosphere. So, I must see to it that the roads remain free of refuse.																																																									

Achintya Sen: Cars are parked on Ashutosh Mukherjee Road haphazardly and, often, illegally.																																																			I am aware of the problem. I need to talk to the deputy commissioner of police (traffic) about it.																																																									

Achintya Sen: A gang of goons is holding sway on Romesh Mitter Road and its adjacent areas. 																																																			I shall take up the matter with the deputy commissioner of police (south). 																																																									

Achintya Sen: The CMC conservancy lorries are quite irregular these days.																																																			I shall see to it that the lorries go to your area regularly and at fixed timings to collect the garbage.																																																									

Subhas Ghosh: Conservancy workers have stopped blowing their whistles. Why?																																																			The practice will be re-introduced soon for the benefit of all.																																																									

Nemai Das: Bakul Bagan Road has two parks  Puddapukur Park and Ladies Park. Both are filthy. Even the benches are broken or littered. 																																																			I shall talk to the mayoral council member in charge of parks and squares. In addition, I shall ask visitors to stop bringing plastic bags into the park. Immediately after taking charge, I started a clean-up operation in New Alipore. The drive will continue. I hope I shall get full cooperation from the public. 																																																									

Bapi Mitra: In the Chakraberia Road area, the CMC has not sunk a single tubewell from which residents can fetch drinking water. How long will this problem persist?																																																			I shall try my best to sink a tubewell at the earliest to resolve your drinking water problems.																																																									

Bapi Mitra: The roads here are clogged all the time, as car-owners park their vehicles on the road not only at night but also during the day. They even wash their cars, causing inconvenience to others. 																																																			I assure you of clearing the kerbs and thoroughfares of all obstacles. I shall not only stop the practice of parking cars and washing them on the roads, but also take steps to stop dumping building materials there.

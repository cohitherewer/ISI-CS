The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 12, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 New station, less congestion
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should some existing trains starting from Howrah and Sealdah be shifted to the new rail terminals? More letters will be published next week Arijit Roy Chowdhury
 Managing director, Gupta Press Madhusree Gupta,
																		Anil Roy Road.																																																														It is undeniable that Howrah and Sealdah railway stations are weighed down by immense pressure. A shift in the existing trains from these two stations to other railway terminals will definitely provide a great relief to Howrah and Sealdah. It will surely result in a massive reduction in traffic and crowds from these two stations. This implies cleaner and better Howrah and Sealdah stations for Calcutta and also breeds hopes of better functioning of the stations. B.N. Bose,
 Dum Dum Park. 																																																														Due to the increase in population and congestion in Howrah and Sealdah stations, it will be a great boon for people living in Shyambazar, Bagbazar, Paikpara, Belgachhia, Patipukur, Ultadanga and Dum Dum areas if a new railway station at Chitpur starts functioning in a short time. I have lived in Agra which had five railway stations. As Calcutta is a big metropolis, if trains leave from more stations, it will be helpful for people.									

Susanta Kumar Bedajna,
																		K.B. Sarani.																																																														Yes. People of the overpopulated areas of both the city and the suburbs will find it easier to reach Chitpur rail terminal. Besides, the adjoining areas of Howrah and Sealdah will be less congested, specially during peak hours. The Circular Railway services will then be more effective. Express duty: A train starts on its journey from Howrah										

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury,
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														It would be a good idea to shift the trains to new rail terminals. It would help reduce the congestion at Howrah and Sealdah. Since existing trains are usually preferred, shifting of these trains will ensure that these new terminals become equally important and busy. Otherwise, they may lack adequate crowd and usage. Trains should be equally divided between the terminals to reduce congestion at Howrah and Sealdah. New trains and new routes should also be introduced.									

Debashish Chakraborty,
																		Nilmoni Mitra Row.																																																														Yes, if some existing trains starting from Howrah and Sealdah are shifted to the new rail terminals, the pressure on Howrah and Sealdah will be eased. On the other hand, the railway authority should stop the move if any objection is raised by the commuters. The authority should act keeping in view the interest of the people.									

Subhasish Majumdar,
																		Sonarpur.																																																														Yes, the decision to set up a new rail terminal at Chitpur railyard is praiseworthy. Several trains  both mail and EMU  are flagged off from Howrah and Sealdah every year. But since platforms are not increasing in number, it results in heavy load on the existing ones. Between a mail/express train and an EMU train, the former always gets priority of use of a platform. This affects regular commuters. Such inconveniences may be solved to a great extent if some of the mail/express trains are shifted to the new rail terminals. 									

Uday Majumdar,
																		Salt Lake City.																																																														Howrah and Sealdah are two of the busiest stations in India. At present, a lot of trains are starting from Howrah and Sealdah. So for the smooth running of the regular train service, there is an urgent need for new terminals like Shalimar (for South-Eastern Railway), Liluah (for Eastern Railway) and Bidhannagar Road (for Sealdah division). If some of the long distance trains operate from those new terminals, it will take much load off Howrah and Sealdah.									

Santosh Chakravarty,
																		Unique Park.																																																														Yes, of course. At present, the existing twin railway terminals are tackling the traffic and timing at the cost of convenience and competence. Decongestion by way of setting up a third terminal is a welcome proposition as that will ease the situation. However, there must be a smooth transport network, particularly from the south, to reach Chitpur. Such multiplication is a must for a maturing metropolis.									

Sushma Jalan,
																		Alipore.																																																														Starting some existing trains from new terminals could certainly prove beneficial for the new terminal. Unless some major trains are started from there, these terminals will not get much traffic. But it has to be kept in mind that disturbing the existing schedule of trains from Howrah and Sealdah may prove problematic for passengers. Superfast trains like Shatabdi and Rajdhani Express can run from the new terminals on certain days. Moreover, it also has to be kept in mind that new terminals will only be beneficial for people living nearby as Howrah and Sealdah are centralised and hence convenient for everyone.									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
																		Behala.																																																														With the introduction of more long distance and local trains from time to time and the increase in the frequency of services of the existing trains, Howrah and Sealdah railway stations and the roads adjoining the areas have been facing acute pressure of passengers for which some remedial measures need to be taken immediately. The roads leading to these stations always remain congested. The plan to shift some trains to the new terminals is, therefore, welcome. But all the trains headed towards the same destination should not be diverted so that passengers do not face any inconvenience. Adequate arrangements should be made to provide transport facilities for easy access to the new terminals. Road transport leading to those areas needs to be improved as well.									

Piyal Mukherjee,
																		Lake Town.																																																														At present almost all the long distance as well as the local trains start from either Howrah or Sealdah. As a result, there is always a heavy rush of passengers to both these stations. The idea of shifting some of the existing trains to other terminals is a judicious and practicable one which will reduce the rush of passengers. Moreover, it will ensure a smooth flow of passenger traffic as the load will be evenly distributed.

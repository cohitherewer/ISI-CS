 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rashmi Papney: Too young to die																								Air hostess Rashmi Papney lost her four-day battle for life on Thursday morning in the intensive care unit of Ruby General Hospital, just five days before her third marriage anniversary.																								An employee of Alliance Air, the 27-year-old had been put on life-support system ever since she was admitted to the EM Bypass hospital on Monday in a very critical condition, following a car accident.																								An eight-member team of doctors was set up to oversee her treatment. One of the doctors, Rajarshi Banerjee, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, said Rashmi had suffered internal injuries, a fractured jaw and deep cuts all over her face and body.																								With Rashmis condition worsening over the past 24 hours, hopes of her survival faded. We did all we could do to save her. But our team of doctors lost the battle this morning. Her death is extremely unfortunate. She died very young, said Tapas Mukherjee, joint director of the hospital.																								Rashmis parents, who had come down from Delhi to be by their daughters bedside, were inconsolable. Husband Vishal Arora had flown in from Mumbai. The two had been planning to take a few days off and celebrate their wedding anniversary in Delhi, family members said.																								In the New Alipore neighbourhood where Rashmi used to live, and at the Alliance Air office, neighbours, friends and colleagues remembered the air hostess fondly.																								I still recall the day Rashmis father called me from Delhi to tell me that she was joining Alliance Air in Calcutta and was looking for a place to stay. I immediately offered my house in New Alipore. I am devastated and dont have words to describe the tragedy, said family friend T.K. Sen.																								Rashmis last rites were performed at the Keoratala crematorium, where she was taken via her New Alipore home, late on Thursday.

		 Chandni Varma 																									Is how this 17-year-old describes herself. The aspiring dentist is a debate, elocution and theatre freak, but her ambition is to be a journalist. Does not believe in restricting herself to the curriculum, but the Class XII humanities and maths student of Mahadevi Birla loves holding responsible posts. She has already held a few, like the first public relations officer of the Interact Club in school and director of the school district, and a member of the Student Council.																									Suchi won the second prize as part of her school team at the MP Birla Smarak Kosh, the inter-school one act play competition. After that, the offers just kept coming. An introduction to Tathagata Chowdhury, the man spearheading Theatrecian, was the jumpstart moment. Class X put a temporary hold on her activities, but she was back with a bang, as a member of the theatre group and on stage at school fests. Suchi has since played a variety of parts, including that of an insane 60-year-old. Cant forget that it all began with public speaking, at which learning meant more than winning, because she was always satisfied with her speeches.																									Curriculars are what really get the intrepid reporter going. Is one of the founder members of the nature club in school, and after cleanliness awareness, its a roots-and-shoots programme, with whacko banners on the agenda. But writing is her passion, and now that shes got a hang of working for the school newspaper, the new goal is television journalism, although being a future freelancer would be right up her alley. Being on the silver screen is by no means a distant reality. Currently playing an 18-year-old druggie in a Hindi telefilm.																									Are what she thanks the Almighty for, not necessarily in that order. Molteshia the internet buff also loves music and dancing. Since keep moving is her motto, theres no stopping this energetic teenager. On the sober side, she indulges in reading and poetry writing, and although not sporty, loves fast cars in bright colours. Has got her priorities in order  first get academically settled, and then everything falls into place, including becoming a dentist, which is still on the cards. And for that she credits her English teachers.

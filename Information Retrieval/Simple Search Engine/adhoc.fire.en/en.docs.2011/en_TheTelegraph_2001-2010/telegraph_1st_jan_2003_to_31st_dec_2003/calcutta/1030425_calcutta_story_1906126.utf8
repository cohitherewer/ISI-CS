	I depend on the tram for conveyance, as I am very old.  Often I have to wait at Esplanade or Dalhousie Square for  a long time to catch a tram, while dozens of vehicles are  parked on the tracks in the depot. One can also spot a large  number of drivers and conductors lazing around, waiting  for trams to return. The route between Park Circus and Gariahat  remains congested by auto-drivers, who pick up and drop  passengers in the middle of the road, blocking the tram  tracks. The slow speed of trams cant be blamed for the  delay. The traffic system needs to be restructured.

	Several bus stands in and around the city are in bad shape  and need immediate repairs. The stand for buses on route  44 at Baguiati becomes slippery even after a mild shower.  The 3C/1 bus stand opposite Shelly cinema is extremely dangerous  to use after dark, as the lighting on the streets is insufficient.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 21, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Clear kerbs, mark roads
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should jaywalkers be penalised if there are no zebra crossings nearby?  Familiar picture: Spot the carriageway Hara Lal Chakraborty,
																		Arabinda Nagar.																																																														People should accept that roads are primarily for vehicles. Whether there is a zebra crossing nearby or not, jaywalking should not be allowed and jaywalkers must be penalised heavily.									

T.R. Anand,
																		Budge Budge.																																																														Jaywalkers need to be fined to bring discipline on the roads. Zebra crossing is a must at every signal. In the recent past many accidents have taken place due to jaywalking, and this needs to be avoided. Such disciplinary steps need to be implemented in all walks of life. Spitting and urinating on thoroughfares, too, need to be stopped with spot fines. 									

Tripti Chandak,
																		G.T. Road.																																																														It is a ridiculous suggestion. To implement such strict discipline on the roads, the cops must first clear all the pavements encroached by hawkers and ensure that there is a zebra crossing as well as traffic signal posts at every prominent intersection.									

Barsha Chabaria,
																		Rabindra Nagar.																																																														In Calcutta, zebra crossings are found only at major junctions like Park Street, Chowringhee and Theatre Road. At peak hours, it is next to impossible to strictly adhere to traffic rules and walk along the zebra crossings. If they are not within 50 metres then penalising jaywalkers will be unjust. It is also undeniable that most accidents occur due to jaywalkers. In my opinion, apart from exemplary punishment, other factors like wide footpaths, increment in the number of zebra crossings, proper marking of the lines with bright colours and increase in traffic consciousness should be ensured.									

Anil Agarwal,
																		Howrah.																																																														No. Rather, there must be sufficient policemen to prevent them from crossing the road when the vehicles are on the move. If there is no zebra crossing, there should be proper traffic signals.									

Kalyan Ghosh,
																		Park Street.																																																														Jaywalking on Calcutta streets will never cease unless we have proper arrangements for pedestrians and laws for the cops. The traffic in Calcutta is absolutely chaotic. Policemen most of the time look helplessly at traffic violators. Even pedestrians have hardly any space on the kerbs to walk, thanks to hawkers and various agencies digging roads.									

Gunjeet S. Wadhwa,
																		Rai Bahadur Road.																																																														No. Instead, zebra crossings should be marked wherever necessary. Where it is not possible, traffic policemen should ensure that people find it convenient to cross roads. But pedestrians should definitely be fined if they try to cross the road helter skelter even if a zebra crossing is not nearby.									

SANANDA SEN,
																		New Alipore.																																																														Absence of zebra marks on the streets is not the fault of a person crossing the road. It is very natural for an individual to cross from anywhere if there is no zebra crossing nearby.									

Govind Das Dujari,
																		Diamond Harbour Road.																																																														Calcutta Police should take into consideration that jaywalkers might be innocent villagers or first-timers in Calcutta. Also, they should set their house in order first. Zebra crossing is not just a set of white parallel lines. We must know the significance of these lines. Drivers are supposed to stop and give way to someone crossing the road using a zebra crossing even with the green light on. This is the importance that drivers in the developed countries give to zebra crossings. Moreover, there should be a gap of say 15 seconds between two green lights on the opposite roads to enable pedestrians to cross. 									

MEGHA MUKIM,
																		Address not given.																																																														Yes, jaywalkers should be penalised. If something happens, they will blame the government and the drivers but not themselves. Zebra crossings are created for our safety but most pedestrians are not aware of it and continue breaking rules until drastic steps are taken. 									

Sounak Chakraborty,
																		Baranagar. 																																																														Zebra marks should be drawn at every crossing in the city. If there is no zebra crossing nearby, then pedestrians should follow the signals to cross the road safely. Awareness camps should be held every year. The media can also be used to spread the word. Thereafter, if any pedestrian does not follow the rules, then he should be penalised.									

Jayanta Datta,
																		Sil Lane.																																																														In no way should jaywalkers be penalised as Calcutta is not a planned city. The footpaths are not fit to walk on and naturally people do not stick to rules. There is no traffic management either compared to other metros. It is the responsibility of the police and the administration to evolve feasible rules. If the proposal is implemented the government can earn more revenue but will it be just?									

Arun Kumar Das,
																		Maheshtala. 																																																														No. If there is no zebra crossing nearby, how can people cross the road without being held guilty?									

Bharat Kamdar, 
																		Lord Sinha Road. 																																																														The problem cannot be solved by penalising jaywalkers. What is needed is implementation of strict traffic rules. Just as jaywalkers do not cross at zebra crossings, likewise drivers of vehicles do not respect the zebra crossing by stopping before the mark. Besides, pedestrians must be provided time at all busy intersections during which they can smoothly cross the roads. As soon as traffic in one direction is stopped, vehicles on the left and the right start coming, leaving no time for the pedestrians to cross without fear of getting run over. Once this is implemented properly, the number of jay-walkers will come down drastically. 									

Michelle Mendes,
																		Marquis Lane.																																																														With the poor infrastructure, pedestrians are not entirely to be blamed for flouting traffic rules. If there is no zebra-crossing nearby, I do not think jaywalkers should be penalised. In fact, attention should be given to revising the existing traffic rules which lack method. Also all the roads do not have zebra crossings, and if this is the criterion for crossing a road, how does one expect to cross in such a case? If there are no zebra crossings, traffic lights should indicate when to cross and signboards could be put up to indicate where to cross. Once these conditions are in place, jaywalkers found flouting the rules could be penalised. But this should not become an underhand means of income for traffic sergeants.

 Friday, May 23, 2003  The old house on the hill
 Haunted house to playground to historical  site. Robert Clives Dum Dum residence has been all of these  to Sumit Roy through his growing years Robert Clives house in Dum Dum: History beckons  Once upon a time in Dum Dum, near  Calcutta, there was a hill. It seemed large and formidable  to me as I climbed it with my small legs, with an aunt who  was the companion of my childhood adventures. The path up  the hill remains one of the clearest images from those days.  Slowly I became aware of other things. That there was a  large, old house in front of the hill; it had a haunted  look and I was not allowed to go near it because there were  snakes. There were large trees behind the house and nestling  under them, a small temple, where we did pranaam  every time we went. Gradually, I got to know other  things about the house and the hill. My aunt would look  glumly at the house as if it was some sort of a personal  enemy and whisper: The house was Robert Clives. He was  the first of the bad Englishmen who came and conquered our  country. Siraj, the Nawab of Bengal, was just a boy. Clive  defeated him by treachery and stabbed him in the back. I was filled with indignation  and also fear. My aunts attitude seemed to suggest that  Clive was still roaming around in his ruined house and would  rush out with his back-stabbing knife if he overheard our  conversation. There seems to be a gap in the  memory tape here for the next set of images comes from a  more grown-up viewpoint. I could come here alone, and with  friends. We explored every nook and corner. The house is  not ruined beyond repair. An Air Technical Institute takes  the building and starts holding classes. I am attracted  by two old planes that they have on display in front. But who cared for a semi-ruined  house there? We came mainly to play. There were three fields:  one in front of the house, one beside it, and one on the  mound behind the house. This was one of the most picturesque  grounds that I have ever seen. The hill had, of course,  been reduced by my changed perception. But it was still  impressive. Raised about 50 feet above the surrounding land,  it gently sloped down on three sides, with Clives house  on the southern side. This was the field which mainly  attracted us, since a football tournament was played here.  Leading amateur sides from near and far came to take part.  Huge crowds gathered for the matches and the football played  was hard-fought and exciting. Then for many years I took no  interest in the house on the mound. Till I started doing  some research on the history of Dum Dum and Barasat, both  old British settlements. I also had the chance to inspect  the house closely when I worked with some friends who were  making a documentary on old British houses in Dum Dum. In L.S.S. OMalleys Gazetteer  of 24 Parganas I came across some interesting facts. Firstly,  that the house and the mound existed before Clive, but no  one was sure when or who had made them. After the battle  of Plassey, Clive rebuilt the house, adding a fine upper  storey; the grounds were also laid out with great expense  and taste. OMalley quotes an interesting  account of the building before Clive renovated it: It appears  to have been originally a one-storeyed blockhouse, so constructed  as to secure a flank fire along each side, in underground  chambers or cellars. The walls were of great thickness  further strengthened by huge buttresses, between which the  walls were loop-holed for musketry. No authentic account  of the origin of this building can be found... The native  tradition is that the mound on which it stands was thrown  up by a spirit in a single night and to this day the house  and the grounds have the reputation of being haunted. This was a magic realist dream  come true. What demonic agents had laboured so mightily  to make this mound and to what purpose? OMalley also says the house is  probably one of the oldest existing buildings in Bengal.  Before it was rebuilt, the officers of the Bengal Artillery  lived in it when they came to Dum Dum for field practice.  After it was rebuilt, the house and gardens were well-maintained.  Bishop Heber, who visited the house in the 1820s, admired  its venerable appearance and the beauty of its gardens. And as late as 1891, we find it  serving as the headquarters of the Presidency Volunteer  Reserve Battalion. Sometime afterwards, the army vacated  the building and it was let out on rent. Sir Owain Jenkins,  who came to India to work for Balmer Lawrie and later became  a prominent industrialist after Independence, lived in Dum  Dum for a few years in the 1930s. In his book, Merchant  Prince, Memories of India 1929-1958, he wrote that he  had initially planned to stay in Clive House, but was unable  to bear the smell of the bazaar nearby. Investigation revealed  that the bazaar was in fact nearer to the house in those  days. Then one day in 2001, a shard  of pottery taken from the mound attracted the attention  of the chief of the Archaeological Survey. His trained eyes  detected its immense age, and excavations began. The findings are all set to revolutionise  the history of south Bengal. They reveal remnants of a civilization  over 2,000 years old. History will have to be rewritten  because nobody knew this area had a flourishing civilisation  so long back. However, the ancient poets knew.  Virgil, the great Roman poet, in his Georgics wrote  of a place hereabouts, which he called Gangaridih.  It is supposed that he learnt of this area from an ancient  book of maritime history, Periplus of the Erythrian Sea.  Many historians think this was located in Barobajar,  near Jessore (now in Bangladesh) where ruins of an old city  have been found, and that this was the capital of a kingdom  that ruled south Bengal over 2000 years ago. It is possible that the excavations  at the house on the hill in Dum Dum reveal another settlement  of the same civilisation. The possible scenarios should  inspire historians and poets for years to come.

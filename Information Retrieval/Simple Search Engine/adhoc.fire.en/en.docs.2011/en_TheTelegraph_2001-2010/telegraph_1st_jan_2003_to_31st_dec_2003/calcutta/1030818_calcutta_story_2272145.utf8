	Only a few ticket counters for local and long-distance  trains remain open on Sundays and other holidays at Howrah  and Sealdah stations. As a result, passengers waiting in  long queues panic at the thought of missing a train. The  rush can be reduced to a great extent if the authorities  open a few more counters at both stations on holidays.

	Salkia School Road, from Bandhaghat to Golabari police  station, is in a shambles. Two-wheelers and pedestrians  can easily trip on the large potholes dotting the entire  stretch, especially after a heavy downpour.  
	Suruchi Holani, GT Road.

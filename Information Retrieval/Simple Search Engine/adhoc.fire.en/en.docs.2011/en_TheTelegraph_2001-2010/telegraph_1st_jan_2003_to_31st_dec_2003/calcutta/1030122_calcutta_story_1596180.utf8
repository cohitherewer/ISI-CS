 Wednesday, January 22, 2003 				 Mayor calls partymen to water table
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Annoyed over the growing criticism against him in the Trinamul Congress over his water tax policy, mayor Subrata Mukherjee has convened a meeting with party MLAs on Wednesday to dispel their misconceptions.																								The mayor said the MLAs had failed to grasp that charging a price for filtered water in Calcutta was no novelty. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had been collecting water tax from commercial users and domestic connections for more than 15 years.																								Trinamul chairperson Mamata Banerjee, who had taken a stand against the CPM-led state government and Mukherjees announcement of a water tax last week, advised him to convince the MLAs first. 																								A section of Trinamul leaders and mayor-in-council members pointed out that Mukherjees water tax policy would affect house-owners in Calcutta proper only, since hardly one per cent of the house-owners in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur paid house tax.

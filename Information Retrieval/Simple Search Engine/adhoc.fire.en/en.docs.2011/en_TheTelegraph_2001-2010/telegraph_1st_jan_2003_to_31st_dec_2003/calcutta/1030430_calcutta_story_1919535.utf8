 The story of Bhadreswari is the tale of a popular and benign princess transformation into a cult figure. A popular folk icon, Bhadreswari or Bhadu is worshipped by the Santhals living in the Bankura-Purulia-Birbhum-Burdwan districts of West Bengal and a large part of Jharkhand state. She is the holy deity of corn, and a bumper harvest of paddy naturally calls for celebration when her worshippers pay their respect and thank her for a good harvest. Music and dance are an integral part of invoking this goddess. Bhadus origin is shrouded in mystery and no one exactly knows since when she was elevated to the status of a goddess. However, folklore has it that she was the only child of Neelmoni Singh Deo, Kashiraj (ruler) of Panchkot. He settled Bhadus wedding with the prince of Burdwan. Bhadreswari was loved by one and all, and as soon the news of her impending wedding reached the subjects they all began preparing for the big celebration. But then.... Based on folklore, this Nabamayukh Natyasanstha production has been conceived and directed by Rishi Mukhopadhyay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Triple dose in healthcare boost
 															- Multi-speciality hospital trio at three points in twin cities BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								The healthcare sector in the city is growing fast, with new players coming in and existing groups in expansion mode. Latest in the medical growth line are three big multi-speciality hospital projects.																								And leading the way is an organisation engaged in socio-cultural and philanthropic activities. Bharat Sevashram Sangha is the second socio-cultural organisation, after the Ramakrishna Mission, to make a foray into healthcare with an ambitious, 500-bed super-speciality hospital at Joka, on the southern fringes of the city.																								The Sangha, which has for several decades run clinics, charitable dispensaries and supplied medicines for relief operations, will be laying the foundation stone for the Rs 100-crore-plus hospital project on Saturday.																								Spread over a sprawling seven acres, the Sangha project will be completed in phases and realise its full strength of 500 beds in three years. We will devote the hospital to the increasing needs of those who cannot afford quality treatment, said Sangha spokesperson Swami Biswatmananda.																								In the first-phase, the Sangha will open an out-patients department (OPD) with various speciality clinics in the fields of medicine, surgery, gynaecology and diagnostics. A 10-bed day-care centre, with a minor operating theatre, will also come up within two years.																								The second and third phases of the project will see the completion of 500 beds in multi-speciality wings, like general medicine, surgery, neurology, cancer and orthopaedics.																								We are expecting over 2,000 people every day in the OPD centre, said Swami Biswatmananda.																								Ruby General Hospital is all set to provide cancer and neurological facilities in a new second hospital to be built off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, behind the existing one. We have just acquired the land and work will start soon. This not be an extension of Ruby, it will be a totally different hospital, with a different name, said Sajal Dutta, managing director of the hospital, adding that the Rs 80-crore project would be completed by 2005.																								The hospital group is negotiating with the Atomic Energy Commission for the necessary permission to set up radiological facilities in the hospital.																								Across the Hooghly, in Uluberia, a dozen doctors have joined hands to offer a 100-bed hospital with modern facilities. This marks the second venture by NRI doctors  after Westbank  returning to their roots to bolster healthcare in Bengal. Amal Bhattacharjee, one of the 12 doctors and treasurer of the registered society formed to set up the Sanjibon hospital, said they had already acquired an eight-bigha plot in Uluberia for the medical unit, meant mainly to cater to Midnapore, Howrah and Hooghly districts. We have plans to expand further in order to serve more people, said another doctor, Priyatosh De.

				 																																									Huge  pipes carry water from the Tallah tank to several thousand  households. But the water is often found to contain foreign  particles, as the underground pipes are very old and have  rusted on the inside. The pipes need to be replaced immediately  and a thorough survey of all damaged portions must be conducted.  B.N. Bose, 
 Dum Dum. 				 																																									My  daughter had recently been to the Indian Overseas Bank at  Majherhat to deposit my sons school fees, which amounted  to Rs 3,196. The bank opened sharp at 10.30 am and the man  at the counter requested her to give the exact amount, as  he did not have any change. My daughter, too, didnt have  any change and, so, waited for about half-an-hour, but without  any result. She finally left the counter to purchase something  unwanted to get the exact balance. If this is the kind of  service rendered by nationalised banks, very soon private  banks will take over the entire market.

 Monday, July 07, 2003 				 Rainwater stagnates, Metro work blamed
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Residents and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) hold the Metro Railway responsible for the waterlogging in the areas along Tollys Nullah. A major part of the canal is clogged by debris and construction material from the ongoing Metro extension project from Tollygunge to Garia station.																								Bansdroni, Naktala, Garia and a considerable pocket on the southern fringes of the city are still submerged by the showers this season and the lack of an alternative drainage arrangement. Its bad enough that we have to wade our way to work or school. Whats making matters worse is that the water is seeping into my ground-floor apartment, complained a resident of the many highrises that have come up in the area recently.																								 The angry residents had blocked roads a fortnight ago to highlight their plight and the lack of effort on the part of the authorities to drain out the water. 																								The Metro is responsible for this mess. Before work began on the expansion, it was supposed to make arrangements to divert the sewerage and rainwater, alleged Gopal Roy, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward no. 112. 																								As per the plans, Metro Railway should have dug channels on either side of the canal to ease the flow of water. It was also supposed to bear a portion of the expenses for dredging Tollys Nullah, but has not contributed anything yet, Roy added. 																								Kamal Ganguly, chairman of Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality, said he met minister for municipal affairs and urban development Asok Bhattacharya, the Metro general manager and engineers of the irrigation department, who had assured him that the waterlogging problem would be looked into shortly. 																								We are pumping out the stagnant water but then, the residents of Naktala and Bansdroni are pumping out water from their end, which is making its way to the low lands here. The problem is that Tollys Nullah is flowing on the same level as the roads along its sides, Ganguly said.																								Mayoral council member for sewerage and drainage Mala Roy said the problem had eased after her efforts in constructing pits and pumping out the water. The job should have been done by Metro and the irrigation department. I am in touch with the local people and the councillors of the area. she said.

 Will the City Centre designed by Charles  Correa for Salt Lake have a liberating influence on the architecture  of Calcutta? Soumitra Das wonders A graphic impression of the City Centre courtyard  Calcutta, even in its present  state of decrepitude, retains its mystery and a certain  element of surprise. The famous winding lanes and alleys  of the city, with their shabby genteel old houses and ruins  of grand mansions in both the white and native quarters  of this colonial hangover of a metropolis, have contributed  to its aura. But after the Fifties, it determinedly  became an uglier city. Only concrete boxes of various sizes  have come up here since. The seminal contribution of Le  Corbusier in conceiving and executing the plan of Chandigarh  had influenced the built environment of New Delhi. Some  of the best architects of the country worked there. In Ahmedabad,  the modernist master himself and later his assistant Balkrishna  Doshi were commissioned to design private homes. Mumbai  has its Charles Correa. Somehow Calcutta was left out. At  long last Correa is bringing his City Centre to Salt Lake.  But building beautiful is not on Calcuttas agenda. We have  been responsible for spawning a middle-class slum named  Salt Lake where people are allowed to make an exhibition  of their bad taste. Calcuttas strong civil engineering  culture and economic downslide contributed to this visual  anarchy. Amidst this urban nightmare, old  structures, sometimes labelled heritage, create charmed  spaces of their own. The ugliness of Chatterjee International  seems to recede when we look at Victoria House (beaux arts,  according to architect Prabir Mitra) dominating the Esplanade  area, the once-opulent interiors of Statesman House, the  art deco splendour of Metro, that home of Hollywood  stars, and other cinemas and buildings of that ilk. New  Empire, Minerva  even Bharati and Bijali  and Tower House,  opposite Tipu Sultan mosque, are significant examples of  art deco. The list of impressive buildings and apartment  blocks in the heart of the city itself is inexhaustible.  Strand Road and Esplanade East are showcases of some grand  neo-classical structures.  The babus forged a hybrid idiom  of their own that is a heady mix of the classical and the  vernacular that Desmond Doig called Bengali baroque. And  they have survived in spite of Calcuttans taking them for  granted. But the big change is about to  happen. Or so we are told by the backlit vinyl billboards  promoting the City Centre. About four decades ago, long  before he had become a name, Correa had designed two houses  for the Sens of Sen Raleigh fame, one still extant on Ballygunge  Circular Road. He was friends with the family. Now Bengal  Ambuja Metro Development Limited has commissioned Correa  to create the first public space to be designed by any architect  of international eminence. Harshvardhan Neotia, director,  Bengal Ambuja, speaks in glowing terms of his collaboration  with Correa. Whenever there were constraints, he evolved  to a higher plane of creativity, says Neotia. The land  was awarded under a tender floated by the Calcutta Metropolitan  Planning Authority and it was stipulated that a marketplace  with a broad mix of activities must come up there. Neotia  had prepared the project brief but it left a certain flexibility.  The promotional literature of  the City Centre that is a shopping plaza and a residential  complex, comprising 60 designer homes, already bears the  Correa stamp. It is a conglomeration of squares and rectangles  that seeks to break the monotony of straight lines through  variations in dimensions and levels. The openings and windows  in these geometric shapes of concrete, too, echo the square.  Keeping in mind the courtyard in Indian homes, the City  Centre has a large open space at the centre. The obligatory  kund in its midst, too, cannot be missed. Both the  courtyard and kund are very recognisable Correa hallmarks. Though now it is too early to  jump to conclusions about the design, and going strictly  by the evidence provided by the promos, the City Centre  does not reflect the texture of life that is uniquely Calcuttas,  that is so different from that of, say, arid Delhi. This  City Centre could have been built anywhere. It looks more  sleek but functionally it is no different from the appalling  shopping malls that have come up in the heart of the city,  where yuppies are invited to, as the slogan goes Shop till  you drop. Power dressing or jeans are de rigueur.  Saris are only meant for the elderly. Tradition (handicrafts)  is something you can buy over the counter. The cineplex  will screen the likes of the pedestrian Devdas. The  Residency holds the promise of living happily and youthfully  ever after  like all high-end housing complexes. Not the kind of place where flaneurs  are welcome, where one can roam aimlessly, or spend hours  window-shopping. For the only driving motive here is the  profit principle.  Think of the City Centre and think  of the pleasure of walking into the maze of New Market.  The latter gratifies all your five senses free. Perhaps  it is a clich to sell New Market as the ultimate shoppers  paradise but it is undeniable that we all love its functioning  chaos. The accessibility of its shops and kiosks that overflow  with their stock-in-trade, the division of intimate space  and its penetrability contributes to the feel-good factor.  Feeling good here not being equivalent to feeling like buying  up everything in sight. As to the secrets that each turn  of a north Calcutta alley seems to hold, can serendipity  survive in such cut-and-dried structures? Artist Chittrovanu Mazumdar says:  You dont force history. A city centre grows over the years.  Places like Park Street have personal histories. There is  not much of an exchange between architects, urban planners  and artists here. One expected a different dimension  in the design of the City Centre for it came from the drawing  board of Charles Correa, who, along with colleagues Balkrishna  Doshi and Raj Rewal have used the vernacular idiom to their  own end. Correa, for example, came into his own in the conception  of a hotel in Goa where he played around with space and  illusions. While stressing it is too early  to hazard any comment, architect Kabir Ray says Correa meets  his Waterloo in Calcutta. For one, the materials he uses  cannot be used here. Many people were vying for it, he says.  Correa was the clincher. The question is will it be another  promoters project or is it something the city desires,  he wonders. If the latter, there should have been some discussion  with the people. For Calcutta, the City Centre  is all the more important for it is the first full-fledged  project undertaken by Correa and it is bound to have a strong  impact on young architects, says Ray. But will it be a straitjacket  or will it have a liberating influence?

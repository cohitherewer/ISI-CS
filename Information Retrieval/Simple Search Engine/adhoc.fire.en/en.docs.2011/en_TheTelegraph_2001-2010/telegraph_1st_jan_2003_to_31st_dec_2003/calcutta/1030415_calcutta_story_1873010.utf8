The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, April 15, 2003 				 Blackmail veil over cop suicide
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 45-year-old sub-inspector, Biman Kumar Majumder, of the third battalion, who had shot himself with his service revolver on Sunday night, died on Monday morning at the SSKM Hospital where he was admitted minutes after the incident. The bullet had pierced his skull.																								Police found a suicide note in which Majumder said he was being blackmailed for the past few days. 																								The note is too sketchy and has only two lines. The officer never mentioned who was blackmailing him, said O. P. Gupta, deputy commissioner of police, third battalion.																								Gupta claimed that there was nothing wrong with Majumders professional life. We granted him leave for his only daughters marriage on April 25 at Nabadwip. Besides, he was given a promotion recently, he said.																								Majumder shot himself while he was on night duty along with others in a Heavy Radio Flying Squad vehicle at the Kidderpore Road crossing.																								Around 11 pm, he got down from the vehicle. After a few moments, the sound of gunfire was heard. The other policemen came out and found him lying on the road. He was rushed to SSKM Hospital where he died around 7.10 am on Monday, said an officer of the battalion.																								Dilip, elder brother of the deceased, said like every other week, Biman had gone home last Saturday and left the next day to join the night shift. There was nothing unusual about Majumders behaviour. Members of the Calcutta Police Association, too, are not sure what led to this incident.

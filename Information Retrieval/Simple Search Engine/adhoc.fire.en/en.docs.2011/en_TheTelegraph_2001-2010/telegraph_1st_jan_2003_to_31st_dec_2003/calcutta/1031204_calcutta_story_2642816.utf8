  New tracks: Will  the extensions of Circular Railway (above) and Metro  Railway (below) see light at the end of the tunnel?  The Metro Matters column on October 27 (The disease runs too deep in state-run hospitals), raised a few significant and burning issues in government hospitals.  What does it matter whether health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra resigns? These are enough such inefficient and incompetent persons in the party to take his place. Basic infrastructural facilities and dedicated staff are required for the smooth functioning of the hospitals. This does not require a huge amount of money or ultra-modern gadgets.  Why should we borrow professional administrators like in commercially-run private hospitals in the state? People like Dr Kanak Chandra Sarbadhikary, Dr Debabrata Roy Mahashay, Dr Bijoy Krishna Chakraborty and Dr J. B. Mukherjee had worked successfully in both administrative and teaching capacities as principal cum superintendent at a premier educational institution in Asia like Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. They did not have a PG diploma in hospital administration. Honesty, sincerity, devotion and discipline in duty should be the motto in government hospitals. The need of the hour is removal of political and union interference in healthcare delivery services.  Dr Mohan Lal Sarkar, 
 Budge Budge.  Railway minister Nitish Kumar has presented us a bouquet of promises (Kumar pilots touch-up train, Nov. 5). The extension of Circular Railway upto Majherhat, Metro Railway upto Dum Dum airport on one side and Garia on the other and beautification of Circular Railway stations are some of them. A time limit for completion of the programmes has also been announced. But from past experience, we know that work is rarely completed on time. The parliamentary election is due in 2004. Can we hope that the change of railway minister or the party in power will not affect the projects?  Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
 Behala.  Apropos the letter in this column on November 6 on the Bishops House, by Vimla C. Subaiya, I would like to thank her on behalf of the Christian community for focusing on the sensitive issue. I would like to ask the executive committee members why they acceded to chairman Rev. P. S.P. Rajus decision? As Subaiya has mentioned, the building of Bishops House is of sentimental value to Christians. Funds required for its repairs can be arranged by the Bishops contacts across the world and not by handing over the building to promoters, so that he can continue with his luxurious lifestyle. I appeal to the government to intervene.  S.K. Biswas, 
 Anglican Church, 
 Thakurpukur.  Although rattled by healthcare lapses and the rally row, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee retains his image of a Bengali gentleman. When our traditional attire is disappearing, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in his snow-white dhoti and kurta cuts a majestic figure (Busybee Buddha, Nov. 8).  Prahlad Agarwala,
 Majdia, Nadia.  Calcuttas fall from the rank of 31 to 46 among 593 districts does call for flak all around (City slides sharp on literacy scale, Nov. 3). The chief minister needs to analyse the situation. The Left Front governments recent reintroduction of the English language at the primary level may improve things.  T.R. Anand,
 Budge Budge Trunk Road.  The report Dearth masks death blame (Oct. 27) is a pointer to the alarming state of affairs. If unavailability of masks caused the death of a patient, responsibility does not lie solely with the doctors. The patients relatives should bear that in mind.  Rabindranath Kar, 
 Sankar Ghosh Lane.  For once, it is not agitations that kept the junior doctors away from work (Week of work minus interns, Nov. 6). Since the date was announced in advance, the government should have been prepared.  Sunil Banerjee,
 VIP Road.

																																																		The division bench of Justice A. Talukdar and Justice A.K. Bishi on Monday rejected the bail prayer of Goutam Burman, apprehending arrest in connection with the rape of a woman residing at Gharirampur in North Dinajpur. The woman, a widow, lodged a complaint with Gharirampur police station alleging that Goutam married her at a local temple and began to live with her. She became pregnant twice and went for abortions on his advice. When I became pregnant for the third time, he wanted an abortion again. When I refused, he left me, the woman said. The police, on the basis of the FIR, started a rape case against Goutam. The petitioners lawyer argued that this was not a rape case as his client had married the petitioner. Opposing the prayer, the additional public prosecutor told the court that according to Hindu law, weddings in temples were not  legal.																																																		Justice D. Sengupta of Calcutta High Court on Monday directed the West Bengal Juvenile Board to complete the trial of Souvik Nandi, alias Prince, rotting in jail for 15 years without trial. Prince was arrested in connection with a murder committed in the Maniktala police station area in February 29, 1988. As he was a minor at the time, he was sent to the juvenile court for trial. All his co-accused in the case were adults and were tried in the general court. They have completed their sentences and have been released, said Princes counsel Rabishankar Chatterjee. The lawyer also said that Princes trial could not take place as the state government failed to constitute a board which is a Supreme Court directive.																																																		A 45-year-old housewife, Kalabati Prajapati, died on Sunday night, after she was assaulted by her tenants on Canal Circular Road in Ultadanga police station area. Police said Kalabatis husband, Durjan Kumar, did not allow CESC officials to install an electricity meter in his house as this would have allowed slum-dwellers, who were his tenants, to get an electricity connection. Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Kuldeep Singh said: When Prajapati turned the CESC officials away, agitated tenants manhandled him. Kalabati, who rushed to help her husband, was also assaulted. She was taken to SSKM Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries at around 11 pm. Later Prajapati lodged an FIR naming Gopal Das, Jawhar Prajapati, Parul Das and Parvati Das as the offenders. All four are said to be on the run. Saraswati Maiti, who was later identified by Prajapati to be involved in the assault, has been arrested.

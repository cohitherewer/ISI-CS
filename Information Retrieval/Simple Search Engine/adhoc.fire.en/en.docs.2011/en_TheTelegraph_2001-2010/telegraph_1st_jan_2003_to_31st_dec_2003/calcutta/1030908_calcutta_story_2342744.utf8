 Monday, September 08, 2003 				 No-entry plan for risky malls
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is planning to bar entry to sections of New Market, College Street Market and Entally Market to ensure safety and security of users.																								Unsafe building notices have already been plastered on some crumbling corners. But since the notice had no impact either on vendors or buyers, member, mayor-in-council, markets, Samsuzzaman Ansari has sent a proposal to mayor Subrata Mukherjee urging that the sections identified as dangerous be shut down altogether.																								Every day, hundreds of men and women visit the fish range and the vegetable range of New Market, said Ansari. Who will take responsibility if there is a cave-in and lives are lost?																								Nearly a thousand vendors will be affected if the CMC does implement the mayoral council members proposal in the three civic markets. The mayor said the CMC wanted to repair the run-down parts but was being thwarted by encroachers on the pathway inside the markets.

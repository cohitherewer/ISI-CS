 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Equipment theft at SSKM
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Unidentified persons broke into the ground-floor catheterisation laboratory (cath lab) of SSKM Hospital early on Saturday and made off with medical equipment worth around Rs 75,000.																								Among the equipment stolen were several boxes of syringes and an infusion pump required to give intravenous fluids to patients with cardiac ailments. The pump, an electronic device, controls the flow of fluid from the infusion bottle to the patients body.																								A window of the cath lab was found open on Saturday morning when hospital staff detected the theft. The window did not have any iron bars and was supposed to have been shut from inside. The open window seems to have facilitated the thieves to wriggle in and sneak out with the equipment, said SSKM superintendent Santanu Tripathi.																								After a meeting with hospital officials, Tripathi decided to seal the window. Guards will also be posted there from tonight, he added.																								A complaint has been lodged with Bhowanipore police, but no arrest was made till late in the evening.																								Hinting at a possible connivance between some hospital employees and the miscreants, officers of Bhowanipore police station said the thieves were acquainted with the layout of the various units in the hospital. 																								They carried out the entire operation noiselessly and the open window helped them sneak in, a police officer said. 																								Saturdays incident once again highlighted the spurt in thefts at state-run hospitals, despite the presence of private security agencies and policemen. The government hospitals do not have security personnel to keep tabs on medical equipment, sources said. A police outpost with five constables on an average is posted at all hospitals to look only after law and order problems.

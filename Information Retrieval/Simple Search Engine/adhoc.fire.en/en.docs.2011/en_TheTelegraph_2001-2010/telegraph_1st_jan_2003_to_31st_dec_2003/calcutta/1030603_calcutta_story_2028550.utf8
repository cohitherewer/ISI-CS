 Bikash Barai																									Seek an audience with Bikash, because you would be hard-pressed to hide anything from him. This mind-reader may discover all youve been desperate to hold back.																									Blend seamlessly for this third-year student of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. The computer science major with a minor in architecture has been dabbling in matters magical for years. Hes held several shows and has been invited by IIT Delhi for a guest lecture on mind-reading and magic. He is now working on a new theory and practice that unifies magic, psychology and body language. Bikash has also started learning the ABCs of hypnotism.																									Is what he hopes to do to Taj Mahal in a vanishing act one day. But an act is all it would be, for this artist appreciates all things beautiful too well to bid the marvel goodbye. Picked up a sketchpad when he was six, and has bagged more than 100 prizes for his artwork, some of which has been sold abroad. Sculptures and clay modelling are also part of his repertoire. Has even represented IIT-KGP at the Inter-IIT Meet in photography, bringing home the gold.																									Is Bikashs formula for success in the tech world. He has already started his first website, www.bestfromindia. com, which is a showcase for the works of famous artists and small-time artisans alike. Tie-ups with government agencies and art galleries give him the material to both display and sell from his online storehouse. It is also the ideal platform to promote young talent. But, he hopes, this is just the beginning of the BFI Technologies brand, which our man hopes to build.																									Is what this over-stretched guy was famous for catching in class. But his extra-curricular energy knows no bounds. This National Talent Search scholar was the official fashion designer for IIT-KGP at Spring Fest 2002, where he experimented with everything from fish scales (yuk!) to cabbage leaves, fruits to trash. Used to represent his school in football and learnt how to play the tabla for three years.

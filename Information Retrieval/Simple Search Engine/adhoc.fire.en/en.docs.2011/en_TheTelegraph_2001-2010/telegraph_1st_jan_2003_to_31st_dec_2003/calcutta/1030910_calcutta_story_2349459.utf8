 Wednesday, September 10, 2003 				 State lists CAS queries
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Bengal government will raise some of its points of CAS contention when chief secretary S.N. Roy meets officials of the Union information and broadcasting (I amp;B) ministry in Delhi on September 15. These include: 																								-Why should all consumers suffer if police seize cable equipment on the basis of one complaint, post-CAS?																								-Channels offered in clusters are cheaper. If a consumer doesnt want one channel in the cluster or chooses one channel outside the cluster, it would not be viable. So, how is CAS optional?																								-What does the consumer do if some popular pay channels later turn free-to-air?																								-Will some channels fade out, post-CAS?

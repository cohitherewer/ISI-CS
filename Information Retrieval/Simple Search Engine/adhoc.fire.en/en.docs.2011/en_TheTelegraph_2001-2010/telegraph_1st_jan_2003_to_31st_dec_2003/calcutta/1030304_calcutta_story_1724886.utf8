 Books before ballgame
 A viewer cheers Sachin Tendulkar during his masterful knock against Pakistan, two days before the Board exams started Books before ballgameA viewer cheers Sachin Tendulkar during his masterful knock against Pakistan, two days before the Board exams startedIt was a day of fashion, music and dance. Spring Fest rocked Fun City on Sunday when the amusement park hosted a fashion show and a musical gig by Arun Daga. The crowd hit the dance floor to DJ Abhishakes music. Saw Sachin scorch the Pakistanis at Centurion? The answer to that question could be no, with lots of students missing out on the World Cup action thanks to the Board exams around the corner and final exams on in schools right now. Some students have reportedly even requested school authorities to shuffle papers according to the Indian teams timetable. Here is what fans had to say when Time to Talk asked Should exams be rescheduled if they clash with sporting events?lThe sports personalities around the world are all successful because they are top-notch professionals, who put their careers ahead of all other things in life. Why should we behave in a manner that contradicts this by making a fuss and rescheduling exams that clash with sporting encounters? After all, the first priority in a students mind should be his career. A student who works hard throughout the year should not find it difficult to find time to watch at least a part of the game, even if it does clash with exams.Piyal Mukherjee,1st year, Institute of Engineering and ManagementlI dont think schools or colleges should reschedule exams if they clash with sporting events. Throughout the year, there is some event on, specially cricket. So once exams start being rescheduled, schools and colleges would never be able to finish exams or sessions.Anil Agarwal,M.Com, Calcutta UniversitylExams are one of the most important stepping stones in a students life. A student can always manage his/her schedule to make time to watch the big games. But to shift an exam would hamper concentration and students would start taking studies lightly.Amrita Singh,IIIrd year, Gokhale Memorial Girls CollegelExams decide our careers. When a student applies for a position anywhere, he will be judged by exam results, not the number of matches he has watched. If the sports authorities do not reschedule big events for our sake, why should we reschedule exams when it is a question of our future?Arnab Mitra,Class X, Sri Aurobindo Institute of EducationlBig matches provide us a break from monotony. They inspire a sporting spirit and a feeling of unity. So why rain on our parade?Dhrubojyoti Sinha,Ist year, Jadavpur UniversitylSport, particularly cricket, is a major recreation for people of all age groups. With the World Cup fever reaching a peak, nobody can afford to miss a single match. After all, this is something that we all look forward to for four long years. Whether it is cricket or soccer, it would be very kind and considerate of the authorities if they reschedule exams so that students could put in their best effort.Barsha Chabaria,PG-I, Calcutta UniversitylStudents cant enjoy the World Cup since it is clashing with their board exams. Nowadays, cricket matches are being played all the time, but that doesnt mean all work should come to a halt. Some students will continue to burn the midnight oil even if India is playing the finals, but sports fans have to carefully fix their routines so that they can at least watch the second innings without hampering their studies.Subhobrata Basu,IIIrd year, Asutosh CollegelIt is not possible to postpone board exams, but schools can schedule the final exams after the World Cup. Schools should at least declare holidays before important matches played by India. This time it is too late, but hopefully some day this wish will come true!Sohini Roy,Class XI, Modern HighlI think the need to reschedule exams because of sports is a sign of irregular study habits. It wouldnt be difficult to manage exams during a sporting event, if I have studied regularly throughout the semester. I will not have to put a lot of extra effort during exam time.Manan Agarwal,Ist year, St Xaviers College
	 Romantic flavours It was a day of fashion, music and dance. Spring Fest rocked Fun City on Sunday when the amusement park hosted a fashion show and a musical gig by Arun Daga. The crowd hit the dance floor to DJ Abhishakes music. The annual seminar of the Centre for Studies in Romantic Literature (CSRL) was an event greatly awaited on the Jadavpur University campus. The two-day seminar, starting February 27, was held at the Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers auditorium. Apart from enthusiastic students, research fellows and professors also participated in the event.It wasnt only the literature of the Romantic age that was up for discussion, but music and art, too. After a welcome address by CSRL president Malabika Sarkar, followed an insightful lecture by Nicholas Roe from the University of St Andrews entitled Romantic Sonnets and Ideas of England. He attempted to explain how the fragmented form of the sonnet is a successful instrument in carrying through the ideas of isolation and alienation in various sonnets like those of Coleridge and Wordsworth. The paper also used as examples works by Seamus Heaney and Shakespeare.This was followed by a paper by Sarottama Majumdar of Sarsuna College, Small Certainties and Great Talents: Misunderstanding the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads. Sudeshna Banerjee, a journalist, presented an extremely interesting paper on Rom-antics on the cricket field. There is no escaping the game even at a literary seminar as the paper illustrated, being replete with anecdotes about Lord Byron, who extended his creativity in fields non-literary, fabricating the number of runs he scored in his account of a school match, and how Keats composed the Ode to Indolence after receiving a black eye the first time he held a bat.The final paper of the first day was a musical presentation by Kishore Chatterjee, artist and critic, called Berlioz and the Romantic Symphony. Chatterjees choice of Berlioz was part of a conscious decision to popularise his music. The presentation explored the composers response to Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet. It dealt with the various influences on Berliozs Romeo and Juliet symphony such as Beethoven and Chopin, and also the similarities between the Symphony Fantastique, Harold in Italy and its influences on Wagners Tristan and Isolde.The second day began with another paper by Nicholas Roe, Romantics at School: Leigh Hunt and Others at Christs Hospital. Simultaneously, the preliminary rounds for the inter-college quiz on Romanticism were held at the Indoor Stadium. Around 10 teams from JU, Loreto College and St Xaviers fought it out for place among the top five finalists. The names the teams gave themselves, such as Vathec, Don Juan and Witches of Atlanta, were the first promise of entertainment. In the finals, the lighter side of Romanticism was highlighted, with even a round of dumb charades, where participants gesticulated wildly as the audience and the contestants tried to guess the answers. There were audience prizes aplenty with even Prof Roe picking up one.The quiz ended on a musical note, with a Salil Chowdhury composition sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Talat Mehmood being played. The connection? A resemblance to a symphony by Mozart. And smiling away to the victory podium were winners Debojoy Chanda and Abhishek Sarkar and runners-up Gargi Mondal and Karishma Siddique of JU.

	 Literary precedentIf camaraderie exists among a bunch of young enthusiasts, surmounting barriers is not a problem. When students of Presidency College decided to launch a magazine on their own, eyebrows were raised, but they have come out with flying colours. Unpresidented got off the block as the brainchild of students of English and economics, but now it has backing from all departments.The first issue was produced with donations from teachers and seniors, but now, the growing number of copies sold has made the eight-page magazine self-sufficient. Students like Devapriya and Adhiraj ran from pillar to post collecting articles that were often hard to come by. But the enterprising bunch weathered the initial teething troubles and now the magazine is a regular monthly feature. The Milieu special edition was even extended to 12 pages. Articles range from campus architecture to national issues like disinvestment. Recently, a subscription system for alumni has been kicked off to boost sales.The magazine does not have an editorial board but a core group puts everything together. After initial glitches with layout, things have started to run smoothly. Support has cropped up from all quarters and Pramodda of the canteen has been a pillar of strength and inspiration. Future plans include involving the next batch, so the baton passes on smoothly keeping Unpresidented alive. Aritro Ganguly,Dept of English, Jadavpur University
	 A hand in aidIt was a proud moment for South Pointers on Sunday when students of the school handed over a cheque of Rs 21,32,453.20 to Swami Nityananda, general secretary, Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission, Barrackpore as a donation for the proposed Vivekananda University. More than 12,500 students collected Rs 10,66,226.60, while chairperson of the MP Birla Group, Priyamvada Birla matched this contribution. Arpita Bhattacharya,Class IX, South  Copyright

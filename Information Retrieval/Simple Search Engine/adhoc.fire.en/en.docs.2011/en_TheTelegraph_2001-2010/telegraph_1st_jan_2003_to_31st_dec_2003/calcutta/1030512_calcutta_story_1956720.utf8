 Monday, May 12, 2003 				 CMDA staff renting out cooperative apartments
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Illegal transfer of land in Salt Lake may furrow the brows of the administration, but another property scam in the township, involving a section of employees of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has triggered alarm.																								We have come to know that some CMDA employees, who have been allotted cooperative flats in Salt Lakes EE block, are letting these apartments out on rent. There are even cases where illegal transfers have taken place, said a senior CMDA official on Sunday. The agency has formed a committee to look into the allegations, he confirmed. 																								Among more than 160 employees cooperatives, irregularities have been detected in at least 20. Now, we have to decide on a course of action. In a number of cases it has been found that employees, staying at the work-cum-living centre in Ultadanga, are letting their flats out on rent, he said.																								However, even as the probe is on, more and more complaints of irregularities pour in from residents of the block. In one such complaint, dated May 3 and addressed to the secretary of a particular housing cooperative of CMDA employees, residents alleged that several flats of the cooperative were being occupied by people not the original owners.																								We receive a number of written complaints from the cooperative residents and these are, to some extent, true, admitted Samir Mondal, general secretary of EE Block Abashik Samity. The authorities must take up the issue immediately, he said. 																								According to Mondal, the CMDA employees had to submit an undertaking when they were given the plot that they did not own any house in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area. But now, it seems many of them had suppressed facts, Mondal said.																								There are two types of buildings, housing eight and 12 families in the estate. In many cases, five to six flats are being transferred in one housing society, sources said. According to the sources, a team of officials probing the case was heckled by the occupants of the flats. 																								As per the rules, if any employee wants to transfer the flat, he has to surrender it to the CMDA, which, in turn, can allot it to any other employee. 																								Bidhannagar Municipality chairman Dilip Gupta admitted that like illegal transfer of land, there are cases where occupancy of flats has been illegally transferred. The urban development department allows transfer of up to 50 per cent flats in a particular cooperative society, Gupta said. When the department blocks transfers, we do not allow mutation, he added.

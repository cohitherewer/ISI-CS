 Wednesday, May 14, 2003 				 Metalled verses
Whose frown/ And wrinkled lip,  and sneer of cold command,/ Tell that its sculptor well  those passions read/ Which yet survive, stamped on these  lifeless things   P.B. Shelley																								Tapan Kumar Das and Sunanda Das are well-known, city-based sculptor couple. They have been working independently, yet they both seem to be inspired by a common subject  human beings. The fluid movements of the limbs, the rigid postures, taut muscles, outstretched arms  these run through their works like leit motif. They share a close intellectual bond which is reflected in their creative works. There is a thematic resemblance in the present exhibition titled, Meta lics, which they describe thus: We melted the metal and cast / moulded into shapes/ into forms /dynamic in intention/ a scribble in the air. Sunanda sculpts men in action, rock-solid, stoic men, often warriors, who are for ever alert and on the verge of action. Tapans figures occupy a surreal space, often like a ballet-dancer  floating in a relaxed, well-practiced balanced act. No inhibitions to hold them back, these figures are free-spirits, masters of their own universe. 																								When: Till May 18; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, October 07, 2003 				 Wet Tuesday warning
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcuttans have been alerted by the Alipore weather office to gear up for a very wet Tuesday.																								To compound matters, a storm with windspeed of 55 kph is expected to hit the city sometime on Tuesday. Incessant rain was reported from large areas of the city on Monday, causing waterlogging and upsetting Durga immersion plans.																								 Meteorology department director Kusum Kumar Chakraborty forecast heavy showers in Gangetic West Bengal, too. Fishermen have been warned not to venture out, he added. The rain was the fallout of a depression over the Bay of Bengal, off the Vizag coast on Monday morning and moving northwest.

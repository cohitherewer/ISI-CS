 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Court orders mayor apology
 																											- Stern action threat greets Subrata tarry nine months remark OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed mayor Subrata Mukherjee to file an affidavit by December 16, seeking unconditional apology for announcing publicly that he would not carry out the order of the court directing him to give three casual employees permanent posts.																								A division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee threatened the mayor with stern action if he did not pray for apology. 																								The court also directed mayor Mukherjee to file another affidavit, saying that he would carry out the courts order and grant appointments to the petitioners. Otherwise, we know how to deal with such a mayor, the bench said.																								The judges, during the hearing of the case, commented that the mayor has taken the law into his own hands. There is a limit to tolerance. The court fixed the matter for hearing on December 16.																								The chief justice told the civic lawyer he had read reports about the mayor saying that he would not carry out the court order and was ready to go to jail for it. Justice Mathur said: This should not be the attitude of a public figure. Mayor Mukherjee should know how to accord respect to the courts.																								Contempt proceedings were initiated against the mayor after the court refused to accept his affidavit saying he would carry out the court order and grant the permanent appointments only after receiving the work study report. The mayor had earlier told the court that he had appointed a study group to assess the financial position of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).																								Lawyers appointed by the CMC told the court that the civic body was facing an acute financial crunch and the mayor was in no position to hand out fresh appointments. 																								They also informed the court that after assuming charge, the mayor had decided not to appoint a single person till the problem was resolved. 																								In 1985, the then civic body had decided to give permanent appointments to casual labourers of the corporation. But, three of the casual labourers were not given appointments. 																								They filed a case and the division bench of Calcutta High Court and the Supreme Court had directed the CMC to grant them permanent posts.																								The CMC declined to carry out the order and contempt petitions were filed by the petitioners in the high court. 																								The high court had directed the mayor, CMC commissioner Debashis Som, mayoral council member Javed Khan and two other senior officers of the CMC to appear before the court. All the accused attended court on December 6.

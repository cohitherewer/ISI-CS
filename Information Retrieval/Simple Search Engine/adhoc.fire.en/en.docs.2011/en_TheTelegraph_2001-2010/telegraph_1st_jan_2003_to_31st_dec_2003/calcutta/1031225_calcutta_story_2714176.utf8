 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Campus dangles cash carrot for script check
 MITA MUKHERJEE 																								Under-graduate students of Calcutta University (CU) can breathe easy now, as the authorities have adopted a way out of avoiding errors in marksheets and delay in publishing results.																								The university has decided to ensure quick payment to examiners for attracting qualified teachers in evaluation duties.																								For the first time, CU has decided to amend its rules that involve a long-drawn process for clearing the remuneration of answer-script examiners. The authorities will now ensure that each and every teacher who participates in any examination-related duty gets paid within 45 days of completing the assignment.																								This apart, a new counter will be opened at CUs main campus on College Street, exclusively for handing out remuneration to over 10,000 teachers who are to be engaged for examining under-graduate answer-scripts.																								We are confident the new move will attract more teachers to evaluation duty, once they are sure that they will get paid on time. This will help cut the delay in publishing results and also to maintain faultless evaluation, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, CUs controller of examinations.																								Examiners are now paid by cheque, which is sent to them individually by ordinary post. By the changed system, they will be paid in cash, which they can collect from the new counter any day after the 45th day of the submission of the answer-scripts.																								We are happy that we will no longer have to wait to receive the cheques by post. On many occasions, the cheques never reached us because of some postal snag. Then, we had to scurry from pillar to post to get the cheques redrawn, said an examiner. 																								The new move comes in the wake of CU realisation that teachers are reluctant to take up evaluation duties, which is one reason for the delay in publishing results of the under-graduate examinations. Moreover, the reluctance was indirectly responsible for the errors in tabulation, that often prompted candidates to move court. 																								Officials admit that errors often occurred because inexperienced teachers had to be drafted to examine the scripts, as an adequate number of qualified teachers was not available for the job.																								An average of two lakh examinees sits for the BA, B.Sc and B.Com examinations every year. To correct the 1.6 million-plus scripts of these candidates, over 10,000 examiners are required. 																								Many teachers are reluctant to evaluate scripts as it takes more than a year for them to get paid for the job.

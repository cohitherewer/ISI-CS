DANCE				 																																	 February 24 at Kala Mandir; 6.30 pm: Charmes  a unique dance creation by renowned French choreographer Karine Saporta.

Saporta says: I created Chames in homage also to this Greek theatre whose word is pure poetry as much as drama. The dancing flows to texts spoken by Marie Belle and Maria Casares, whose diction is both lyrical and sensual....I wanted Charmes to be like a sketch. The culture of antiquity has produced so many epics that I felt we should show nothing more than the imprint left in the white spray....

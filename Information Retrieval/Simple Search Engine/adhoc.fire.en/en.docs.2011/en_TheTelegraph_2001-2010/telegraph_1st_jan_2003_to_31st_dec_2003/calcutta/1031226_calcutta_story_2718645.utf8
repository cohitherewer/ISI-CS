The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Crowds out on Christmas cue
 															- Parties and performers, special menus and shopper scurry OUR BUREAU Singer-actor Sonu  Nigam regales his audience of under-privileged students  with the title song of Kal Ho Naa Ho at Don Bosco  Park Circus on Thursday. Picture by Pabitra Das 																								Take a trip to the North Pole in the morning, sample some special Chinese prawns and a Christmas pudding for lunch, drop in to see Kal Ho Naa Ho or Kill Bill in the afternoon, party till dawn with fire-eaters from Bollywood and dancers from the UK and Las Vegas, and dont forget to SMS Merry Christmas! to friends and family.																								Calcutta was doing all that and more, on Xmas and its eve, as the footfall at most places prove. While midnight mass at St Pauls Cathedral was not to be missed by the devout, there was plenty in store for those looking to have some holiday fun. And most destinations went the extra mile to woo the big spenders.																								The cyclones and roller-coasters were popular as usual at Nicco Park, then there was a 600-sq-ft Santa tableau for the kids and, of course, the cold crowd-puller Iceland, with real snow for the North Pole experience. The figures there, at last count on Thursday afternoon, stood at well over 25,000, much more than during the Pujas.																								At Inox, the plethora of films for youngsters and adults drew viewers in large numbers, too, with over 4,000 by Thursday afternoon, comparable to the Puja rush. Not to mention the carol-singing band, a Santa lookalike contest and a popcorn snow pool just for the toddlers at the citys sole multiplex.																								The nightlong parties in clubs and hotels around town on Christmas Eve were brimming with revellers. At Tantra, apart from the usual mix of music and madness, there were fire-eaters, performers from Mumbai and international dancers. The 3,000 party-goers, were definitely more in number than last year.																								But no holiday is complete without a meal out, and most restaurants had dished out special menus. At Mainland China, the prawns and pudding did the trick, attracting more than 500 Calcutta foodies on December 24, and nearly 400 for the Christmas lunch alone. At Bar-B-Q, on Park Street, it was maximum capacity on both days.																								Whats Christmas without plum cake, and the old favourite topped the chart this time, too, at Kookie Jar, followed by pudding with brandy butter. New entrants cinnamon, orange and dried fruit and nut cake also disappeared off the shelves.																								Shopping, too, rated high on the holiday list of things to do, and the malls really raked in customers with seasonal offers. All the stores have something or the other happening, observes Rahul Saraf, developer of Forum. The place is packed. Our Sunday average is about 18,000 people, but on December 25, we should be crossing 20,000.																								At the citys heritage plaza, Christmas was crammed with activities for non-stop family fun, from stalls and games to competitions and prizes, as well as a band, DJ and dance troupe. Usually on a holiday, we have about 5,000 people. But the maximum crowds are on Christmas and New Year  about 10,000, says P. Sandeep, general manager, Swabhumi. Till Thursday evening, the crowd count had crossed 7,000.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, June 12, 2003 				 A hobby for every hour of day
 ABHIJIT DAS Doctor, magician, mathematician,  musician, poet Abhijit Das is a jack of many trades and  teacher of most. This 39-year-old doesnt believe in wasting  time. Making most of the God-given hours in a day is his  motto. His day begins at 5 am with an hour of yoga and ends  at midnight, after a round of clinics and surgeries. On  other days, its workshops, seminars and teaching. I am  not abnormal, he smiles. Just off-normal.																								Although now a Mumbaikar, the gynaecological surgeon was born and brought up at Purna Das Road. The Nilratan Sirkar Medical College student went to Edinburgh and London in 1987 to pursue his chosen profession for the next 14 years. I came back to India because I wanted to give my daughter a Bengali upbringing, the father of a nine-year-old says.																								Das fascination for things off the beaten track led him to pursue a variety of activities right from childhood. The member of the Magic Circle in London and the Brotherhood of Magicians in Ohio, USA, held his first public show as a student in La Martiniere for Boys. The specialist in close-up and sleight-of-hand tricks continues to perform, in medical conferences and public shows.																								Music, however, is his passion. This composer has two post-graduate degrees and a M.Phil from Calcutta University. From making music for school plays, he now performs solo in India and abroad, and continues to compose for theatre, as well as acting and directing numerous stage productions every year. Violin or vocal, classical or contemporary, he knows and enjoys it all.																								This romantic at heart writer has had poems and short stories published, too. The soft-spoken gentleman is also a black belt in karate. But its language that gets this diploma-holder in German going. The man of science is currently working on literature of a different kind  a book on the supernatural and the occult. I have researched, for many years, things that I cannot explain. Its a hobby, Das adds.																								All this, apart from his most recent obsession  teaching alternate ways of doing pure maths and working on the zoom in method of study to improve the memory. This was something I got involved with when I was abroad. Now, he roams the country conducting workshops on Vedic maths and memory enhancement, besides holding seminars on corporate grooming. Techniques of yoga, which he learnt after spending nine months in an ashram, is what Das propagates, be it to relieve stress or to concentrate.																								Creativity is his spice of life. The diploma-holder in interior and computer-assisted designing, in his leisure time, creates envelopes and cards, besides delving in origami. In Class VII, I was into magic, art, karate and music. I see no reason to be any different now, Das sums up.

	Traffic snarls will remain a constant feature in Taratala  unless the flyover is completed. Going by the pace of construction  work, it seems the project will take up another year and  a half. The civic authorities can repair Brace Bridge-Garden  Reach Road and divert Esplanade-bound traffic from Budge  Budge.  
	Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge.  
	Promoters and encroachers have damaged the tranquility  of Sarsuna. The area, which had a lot of greenery, is now  an extremely polluted zone with the number of diesel-driven  cars on the rise. The spurt in multi-storeyed buildings  has resulted in drainage problems. The whole township gets  inundated after a half-an-hour shower. Law and order problems  are also cropping up.  
	Name and address withheld.  
	The pavements of Sarat Bose Road are in bad shape and need  immediate repairs. Saryu Sheth,  
	Sarat Bose Road.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 City doors shut as French come beaming in
 SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 Anil Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai in Hamara Dil Aapke Pas Hai, the first Hindi film to be telecast on TV5																								The worlds second largest international television network (after MTV) is going Indian in a major way. TV5, the only worldwide French-speaking public channel, is ready to serve up a platter of programmes based on local content. But a large part of Calcutta is set to miss out on the beam bouquet, since the channel has been blanked out by RPG Netcom, the citys biggest cable TV service provider. 																								India is our target for tomorrow, declares Alexandre Muller, deputy director, TV5, after flying down to Mumbai from the Paris headquarters, to oversee operations here. No surprises there, since French is Indias most popular foreign language after English and the channel reaches 9.3 million homes here, a hefty 42 per cent of TV5 Asias global reception.																								The first French overture will be beamed into Indian drawing rooms over the weekend. Mumbai has been chosen as the first Indian city to feature in TV5s special feature 24 hours in. So, from Saturday, it will be a close-up session with Indias business capital. 																								The bouquet will contain a host of French documentaries subtitled in English and a Hindi film, the first to be aired on the French channel. The themes of these documentaries will be as varied as life in Mumbai  the dabbawalas to the cabaret dancers, the famous Patiala necklace featuring 2,930 diamonds to sons of the soil Rudyard Kipling and Salman Rushdie. 																								Our regular feed is also of particular interest to Calcutta, with its passion for movies and football, says Muller. 																								Adds Navin Tikoo, sales manager, Catvision Products Ltd, which markets the channel in India: Our highest viewership is in Calcutta, according to an ORG Marg Survey. It is unfortunate that despite negotiations, so many viewers are being deprived of our beam.																								Earlier in the month, the audio-visual attach to the French embassy and a representative of the French trade commission had come to town to meet RPG Netcom officials. But talks hit a dead end with the MSO citing technical difficulties till CAS came into operation.																								Francophiles in the city are also up in arms at the no-show. Says artist Paritosh Sen: When other metropolises are continuing to view the foreign-language channels,why should we be exposed to only the world of BBC and CNN? 																								Director of Alliance Francaise de Calcutta Nicolas Blasquez says: TV5 is a free-to-air channel which is the French governments gift to the Indian people. They just cannot take it away.																								The citys French language students are perhaps the hardest hit. And considering only Alliance Francaise takes in 1,500 every year, they are a sizeable lot. The channel is a pedagogical tool that we would use in class, says Padminie Dufrene, cultural coordinator.																								A signature campaign has already been carried out. We will wait till the year-end. If TV5 is not back, we will take the protest path, Blasquez warns.

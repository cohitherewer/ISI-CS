 Sunday, April 20, 2003 				 Night chase fails to net hijackers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT IN CHINSURAH																								In what could have been a perfect take from a Bollywood thriller, officials from three police stations in Hooghly district chased a gang of criminals all night shortly after it hijacked a lorry from the national highway on Friday. In the end, none of the three teams managed to catch the miscreants. The third team ended up in a ditch, with two members sustaining serious injuries.																								The highway drama started around 12.30 am after a sand-laden lorry plying from Ilambazar in Murshidabad to Barasat on the northern fringes of the city was intercepted by another lorry near the Assam-Delhi Road intersection.																								After blocking the path of the lorry, the miscreants, armed with choppers and improvised weapons, hurled the driver out of the lorry. The lorry than restarted and continued on its journey with the second lorry in tow.																								The overpowered driver, identified as Suresh Prasad, rushed to the police for help. They are armed. Please be careful, Prasad reportedly told the team from the Mogra police station.																								After a brief chase, the Singur police station was alerted and they in turn decided to join the chase. Around 1 am, the patrol party reported that it had identified the two lorries. The second lorry was traced, but the criminals had given the slip.																								Now the Singur police alerted the Bhadreswar police station, which soon sent a team to chase the fleeing lorry. Around 2 am, the police jeep intercepted the lorry, but the driver managed to steer clear.																								The race between the police and the criminals continued and finally, on Baidyabati Road, the lorry driver swerved to his right, pushing the police jeep into a ditch. Two constables were injured by the fall. The duo was taken to the Chinsurah hospital for treatment.																								A little before dawn, the lorry was finally found parked on Baidyabati Road a few kilometres away from the ditch. 																								The two injured policemen have sustained serious injuries and a search is on to trace the culprits who do not seem to be regular offenders, said superintendent of police (Hooghly) Ajay Kumar.

	The nine-day-long National Book Fair held in the city in  early September after a gap of 30 years failed to pull in  the crowds. Though the fair was held with great fanfare   inaugurated by union minister Murli Manohar Joshi and  advertisements splashing the event in the print media   Calcuttans, strangely, decided to skip it. Visiting the  fair one evening, I was astonished to find the stalls almost  empty. The salespersons, sitting idle from 11 in the morning,  looked bored and tired. The Pujas could be a reason, but  the organisers need to probe this before wasting their resources  on another such fair.

	Some banks in the city still issue stapled currency notes  to customers in spite of regular advertisements on TV asking  them not to do so. A better solution to prevent mutilation  of currency notes would be to advise customers not to accept  stapled bundles. Notices in this regard can be put up at  the banks.

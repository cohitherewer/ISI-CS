 Harsh Maskara																									Is this guys plea to one and all. So, taking a leaf from his book, we ask you to consider the rather formidable list of achievements this 17-year-old boasts. Starting with this: The student of Class XII at La Martiniere for Boys has just been awarded the Founders medal, having been adjudged best all-rounder in studies, games and conduct for the year 2003.																									Isnt how Harsh is known now, but that was how he describes himself, till the transformation somewhere down the line. This science student broke out of his shell by joining the schools informal quiz club. Soon after, one of his seniors convinced him that he had to debate for his house. No regrets, ever since.																									Is what he became because of his exploits. Two busy years were spent in Classes IX and X, having joined the Interact club, and starting quizzing on a serious level. First, he and partner Shovik Banerjee won the Mindspot quiz, a week after which the duo took the regional ESPN school quiz, hosted by Charu Sharma, by storm. The second spot out of 100 schools won them a berth in the national finals at Delhi. His interest in tennis, which Harsh played for four years, stood him in good stead, as did a passion for cricket. They won the televised zonal quarter-finals, qualifying for the semis, after which they had to bow out. But the final verdict on standing up for the school on TV is that it was really cool.																									Only came about, however, with the Interact years. The first brush with Karma Yatra, the first involvement with the day-to-day activities, put him on the road to the top. This house captain and Nature Club editorial board member stood for president of the school club and now holds the post. He has initiated a drawing competition for underprivileged kids.																									You may think he has to play, but Harsh, who has won academic distinctions in English and economics, happily took on a theatrical role as well. A stint at the annual inter-house dramatics set his sights on the British Council play festival. He scripted, directed and acted in this years play, based on Macbeth.

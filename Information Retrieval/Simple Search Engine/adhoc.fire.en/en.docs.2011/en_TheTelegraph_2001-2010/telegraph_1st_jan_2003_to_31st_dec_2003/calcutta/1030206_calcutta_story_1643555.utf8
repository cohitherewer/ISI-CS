				 																																										Sabita Tamang, 40, the only witness to her husbands murder, was shot dead at her Titagarh residence by a gang of criminals on Tuesday night. According to police, Rabi Bahadur, alias Nepua, was murdered in front of his house two months ago. Sabita had alleged before investigating officers that four persons, led by Pancham Rizvi, a local hoodlum, had murdered her husband. According to additional superintendent of police (Barrackpore) K. Jayraman, Sabita was attacked on her way to the market from her Lakshmighat residence. The assailants surrounded her and shot from point blank range. No arrest has so far been made.				 																																										The city sessions court on Wednesday sentenced Ratan Mitra to imprisonment for life on charges of murdering his elder brother Tapan four years ago. The third sessions judge of the court P. S. Banerjee also slapped a fine of Rs 1,000 on the convict. According to police, Ratan had hacked his brother to death on June 27, 1998. He was on the run for over one month after the incident. Ratan, a hawker, committed the murder as his brother had asked him to leave home. 				 																																										Calcutta High Court on Wednesday held that it had no judicial power to change the venue of the trial of criminal cases from the sessions court to the jail. The court, however, observed that the high court could shift the trial venue by applying its administrative power. The case had been filed by the state to seek permission to shift the trial venue of Aftab Ansari, the main accused in the American Center attack case, from the city sessions court to Presidency jail. Justice S.B. Roy, while delivering the judgment, said the government could apply to the high court for its administrative decision in this regard. On the basis of the decision of the high court, the state could change the venue of the trial, the judge held. The state government then sought an administrative decision of the high court, shifting the venue of Ansaris trial. Earlier, the state government had prayed before the 11th judge of the city sessions court, P.K. Dutta, asking him to shift the venue of the trial on security grounds. 				 																																										The forensic report on the blaze that gutted a four-storeyed building in Burrabazar indicates that it was not just the woollen goods stored in the house that caused the fire to spread. Forensic experts point to the presence of other inflammable materials that may have caught fire and caused the abnormal rise in temperature. While maintaining that the fire originated from the ground floor, the report concludes that the fire did not start from an electrical short circuit.				 																																										Rebel MP Ajit Panjas close associate Tapan Dasgupta returned to Trinamul chairperson Mamata Banerjees camp on Wednesday. Mamata welcomed Dasguptas decision, saying it would strengthen the party in Hooghly district.

The sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Howrah on Wednesday referred the case of the 92 Bangladeshis, arrested in different areas of Howrah 14 days ago, to the fourth judicial magistrate. The Bangladeshis were arrested after they failed to produce valid documents for stay in India.

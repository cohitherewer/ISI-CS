								Tanima Biswas: Sahapur Girls High School teaches up to the Madhyamik level. We have almost every facility, including computer classes. We are trying to upgrade the school to the Class XII level, as the area has no Higher Secondary (HS) school for girls. We have written to the HS Council but no reply has come from them. Will you please look into the matter?																																																													I am aware that the school is being run quite efficiently. I am glad to know that the computer section is running well, too. I suggest you give me a copy of the application sent to the HS Council. I shall take up the matter with the higher education minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, October 05, 2003 				 Cleft stick of rule and rally
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Police are caught between the devil (read: facing the wrath of the political leadership) and the deep blue sea (read: facing a contempt of court).																								Initially eager to implement the high courts directive of stopping weekday rallies on the city streets, the Lalbazar top brass is now confronted with the possibility of having to arrest some of its political masters when they launch a mass movement this Wednesday to defy Justice Amitava Lalas verdict.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Sujoy Chakraborty, commissioner of police, said on Saturday that his force will definitely try to implement the courts order if they get a copy of the judgment before Wednesdays convention.																								As of now, we have no clue what the order says. We will have to take a look at it and then sit down and decide on its implementation, Chakraborty said. 																								But one thing is clear, we will not make any exception while implementing the court order, he added.																								However, senior police officers admitted, on condition of anonymity, that they were in a precarious situation. 																								Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Kuldiep Singh was more tight-lipped: We cant comment since we have neither received the court order nor the application for the October 8 rally.																								Singh insisted that it was essential to understand the true nature of the order and the directives to the police. Without taking a look at a certified copy of the order and seeking legal opinion, one can even end up flouting the order while implementing it, said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) M.K. Singh.																								A meeting of senior police officers, along with legal experts, has been called to assess the situation and figure out the next course of action. Once the copy of the order and an application for Wednesdays rally land on their table, the brass will decide on what to do next.

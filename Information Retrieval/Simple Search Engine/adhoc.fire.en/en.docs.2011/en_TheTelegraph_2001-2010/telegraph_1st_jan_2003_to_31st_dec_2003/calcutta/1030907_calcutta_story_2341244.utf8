 A STAFF REPORTER																								In the first pre-puja drive against banned fireworks, the police unearthed a cracker-manufacturing unit in Budge Budge on Saturday and arrested five persons. During the overnight raid, seven lakh banned crackers and raw materials weighing 350 kg were recovered from the unauthorised factory.																								Rajesh Kumar Singh, additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said the raid was a part of a series of pre-Puja drives planned by the police.																								The raid was carried out following a directive from the city police. We warned all the neighbouring districts, especially Howrah and South 24-Parganas, to undertake drives so that banned crackers do not enter the city before the Pujas, said a senior officer at the Lalbazar headquarters.																								The Budge Budge police station received information about an unauthorised factory in the Nungi area. A large contingent surrounded the factory. We caught the five men while they were busy manufacturing the crackers.																								Kuldeep Singh, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, said a strict vigil would be kept on the roads leading to the city before the Pujas.

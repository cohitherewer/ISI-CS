 															- Buyer keeps choco bar, company keen on tests A STAFF REPORTER																								The day after a complaint of worms in a Cadburys Dairy Milk chocolate bar, the multinational on Wednesday dug its teeth into the controversy.																								Even as the complainants from Jawpur, near Lake Town, were preparing to take up the matter with higher authorities, the company expressed its commitment to get to the bottom of the case.																								We are still trying to ascertain more facts about the incident. Our people have visited the area to gather more information, said a Cadbury India spokesperson from Mumbai. 																								If the complainants are willing to part with the chocolate, we shall be happy to conduct a test of the bar, which was allegedly infested with worms. We are sensible marketers and dont want any controversy surrounding our brand, he added.																								The Cadbury India spokesperson went on to cast doubts on the veracity of the complaint by citing some inconsistencies, including the mutilated condition of the bar.																								But members of the Jawpur Byayam Samiti, a local club, made it clear that they wanted to take the matter to government bodies and the consumer court to build public awareness.																								We have got in touch with representatives of the Federation of Consumer Associations of West Bengal and will hand over our official complaint and the sample of the product on Thursday, said Gautam Ash, who had bought five Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolates from a stationery shop in Jawpur on Sunday.																								Ash, an assistant professor of anatomy at the National Institute of Homoeopathy and a resident of Patipukur, in north Calcutta, distributed the chocolates among his friends in Jawpur.																								Biplab, an employee at Ashs friend Probir Kundus hardware shop, P. K. Enterprises, in Jawpur, found worms crawling in the chocolate bar and alerted others in the area on Tuesday.																								Cadbury officials met us on Wednesday afternoon. They wanted to take away the sample, but we didnt hand it over, said Pronob Kundu, a resident of the area.																								Ash and his friends have reiterated their decision to see the matter to its logical end, with legal advice from Tapash Gan Choudhury, an advocate in the area.

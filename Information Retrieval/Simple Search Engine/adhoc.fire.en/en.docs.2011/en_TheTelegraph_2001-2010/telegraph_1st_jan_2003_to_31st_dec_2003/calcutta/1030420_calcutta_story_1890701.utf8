 Sunday, April 20, 2003 				 Three held with heroin haul
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a major catch, the CID has seized about 2.5 kg of heroin from a house in Dakshin Sibrampore village, in the Namkhana police station area of South 24-Parganas, on Saturday afternoon. The haul is worth around Rs 2.5 crore in the international market. Three persons were arrested in this connection.																								Working on a tip-off, a team of eight CID officers from the special operation group raided the house of one Pradip Patra and recovered the heroin sealed in plastic packets. 																								We went to Patras house posing as customers and told him to show us some samples of heroin before finalising the rate. Patra told us to wait and soon returned with four packets. After interrogating him, we tracked down two more persons involved in the racket. All are residents of Namkhana, said Haripada Si, officer in charge of the special operation group. The three are involved in an international network of drug peddling and work as local agents.																								Si said the drug haul had reached Namkhana through the Sunderbans from Singapore and Thailand. Heroin is smuggled in from Thailand by fishermen sailing on the rivers of the Sunderbans. Local agents then pass it on to city peddlers, sleuths said.

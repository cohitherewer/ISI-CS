	Several political meetings are held in front of Metro cinema  and Victoria House, crippling traffic movement in the entire  region. The state government has allocated the Maidan and  the Sahid Minar for meetings and rallies. Then, why do the  authorities allow agitating organisations to air their grievances  in prime locations, inconveniencing the public?  
	T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.  
	The staff of Tollygunge post office does not sell more  than two revenue stamps to customers at a time. In order  to buy a set of 10 stamps, one will have to visit the post  office for five days. Can the postal authorities please  explain the reasons behind this strange system?  
	S. Bhattacharjee, Santoshpur.  
	Signposts indicating no-parking zones must be flashed properly  to facilitate car-owners. People often end up flouting rules  unintentionally.  
	Jagdish Kumar, Chittaranjan Avenue.

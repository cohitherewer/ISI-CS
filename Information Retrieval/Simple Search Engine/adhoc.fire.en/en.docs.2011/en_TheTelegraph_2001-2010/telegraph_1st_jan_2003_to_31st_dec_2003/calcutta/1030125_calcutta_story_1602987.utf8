The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 Natakiya
																								The play revolves around the members of a theatre group rehearsing their latest production and trying to cope with the difficulties that plague theatre groups today. Natakiyo addresses the inherent and extraneous problems but does not offer any easy solution. We become aware of the dangerous situation wherein the main objective  quot;good theatre quot; becomes the victim of triviality. Fortunately, all is not lost just yet; the spirit is still alive and, not without humour. The script of the play resulted from a script-structuring workshop. The actors have contributed to build this play. The theme and the style too, has been defined by them. Designed and directed by Sohag Sen. An Ensemble production, being staged as part of the ongoing Nattya Mela, organised by Paschim Banga Nattya Academy, the state governments ministry of information and cultural affairs and EZCC.																								When: Tomorrow at 6.30 pm																								Where: Rabindra Sadan

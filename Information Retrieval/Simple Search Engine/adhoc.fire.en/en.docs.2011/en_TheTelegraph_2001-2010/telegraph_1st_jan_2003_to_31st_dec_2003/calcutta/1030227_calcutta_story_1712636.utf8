																								Tagores Chandalika is based on a Buddhist Jataka tale. The story revolves around Prakriti, a low-caste girl who is shunned by her neighbours. Even the hawkers refuse to sell her their wares. Disappointed and forlorn, she blames the Almighty for her predicament and curses her mother for bringing her into this accursed world. Despondently, Prakriti goes to fetch water from the well at her mothers bidding. It is here that Ananda, a Buddhist monk, thirsty and enchanted, approaches her and requests her for a drink of water. When Prakriti tells Ananda she is untouchable and as such has no right to offer him water from the well, Ananda replies that all human beings are equal and accepts water from her. The incident changes Prakritis entire attitude to life and she lives for the day when she will be united with Ananda. She tries to enchant and ensnare Ananda in various ways, but ultimately realises her folly and begs Ananda to forgive her. Ananda blesses her and forgives an emancipated Prakriti. Nrityangan presents this dance-drama, directed by Shanti Bose and Sunanda Bose. Participants include Sulakshana Sen, Moumita Nandy, Shanti Bose, Arghya Sen, Abhirup Guha Thakurta, Swapan Som, Debarati Som and Indira Bandyopadhyay.

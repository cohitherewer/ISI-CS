The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

				 SCREEN JAM: Die Another Day (above)  and Kaante, among the bouquet of films released on a  festive Friday 				 																																																																				 Apropos the report Strike cry in trader-mayor row (Metro, December 21), it is pertinent to point out that the proposed abnormal hike in licence fee by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will affect small traders who are struggling to survive. People at the helm of affairs cannot understand the problems faced by these traders. As the CMC is suffering from a funds crunch, the mayor is exploring all possibilities to augment revenue. But a hike of licence fee from Rs 10 to Rs 2,500 is not based on logical assessment.				 																																													Moreover, the argument put forward by the mayor that the unemployed youth can take on the business of the traders is in bad taste. The ploy to increase income will yield little result in the long run. The proposal, if implemented, will throw a large number of small traders out of gear. The CMC should base its fee hike on a realistic assessment. 				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																																																				The report Friday frenzy in space jam (Metro, December 20) was interesting reading. Bachchans Kaante, Vivek Oberois Saathiyan, Vishal Bharadwajs Makdee and Rituparna Ghoshs Subha Mahurat and above all the latest James Bond thriller Die Another Day opening on the same day calls for entertainment all through the week. We need more theatres to accommodate so many good films. The government should look into the possibility of opening the closed theatres.				 																																													T.R. Anand,				 																																													Address not given.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Cops chart Romeo roadmap (Metro, December 25), it has become imperative for the police to be more vigilant. For some youngsters, who prefer partying away the night at discotheques, eve-teasing is a game. The police must nip these tendencies in the bud to pre-empt more serious sexual offences.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																													lThat the chief ministers daughter, too, can become a target of eve-teasers shows how the Romeos have the run of the roads these days. 				 																																													Bhupen Bose, 				 																																													Dum Dum.				 																																																																				Should one laud the special branch and the security control wing of the city police? (Faux pas flurry at terror point, Metro, December 20) They had erroneously picked up a beggar, two policemen and a German-based film-maker and his girlfriend within a week from near the American Center. Such zealous hyper-activity is ridiculous and only causes harassment to the common people. 				 																																													M. Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.					 																																																					Apropos the report Playing with fire is his passion (Metro, December 23) Bipin Ganatras selfless acts stand out. His efforts to rescue people caught in the flames at Firpos as well as in Canning Street should be emulated. A selfless person like Ganatra is rare. He deserves to be accorded a civic reception by the government. 				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																													Lake Town.				 																																																																				The report on Calcutta University launching a full-fledged post-graduate course on peace and security with funds from the Ford Foundation was amusing (Masters in peace and security, Metro, December 18). The university authorities are ignoring the dearth of post-graduate seats in popular subjects like English, economics and political science and embarking on an ambitious project. Besides, what prospects does this new subject hold? 				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Wanted: new strategy to fight the bite (Metro, December 19), it is good to learn that a workshop was held in the city to initiate measures against malaria. Given the spread of malignant malaria, the authorities should spray DDT as before, besides using the spray gun.				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia.

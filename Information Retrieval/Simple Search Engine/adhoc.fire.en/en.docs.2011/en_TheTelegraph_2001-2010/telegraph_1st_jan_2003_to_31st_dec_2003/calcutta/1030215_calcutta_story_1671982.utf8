 Saturday, February 15, 2003 				 Global pitch for flower show
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Agri-Horticultural Society of India is planning to organise an international horticulture fair from next year in Calcutta. The event will coincide with the 183-year-old Societys annual flower show in February 2004.																								The past few years have seen a sudden surge in flower shows in various parts of the country. We want to cash in on this craze to display the flora and fauna of West Bengal to the world, said Sujit Chakravorti, president of the Society, on Friday, during the inauguration of the Societys annual flower show (Picture on right by Pradip Sanyal). From February 14 to 16, over 340 exhibitors, both individuals and corporations, will display 15,455 exhibits in 211 sections.																								To push its objective of promoting awareness on horticulture and floriculture, the Society also plans to introduce formal training in horticulture by tying up with some academic institutes. We are in the midst of discussions with some institutes and will take a decision shortly, added Chakravorti.																								Recognising the need for commercialisation of the produce, the Society has decided to offer marketing support to the rural segment and organise special training sessions to help them explore the export market. The potential of export from this part of the country is very high and we want to act as the facilitators, said Alka Bangur, vice-president.

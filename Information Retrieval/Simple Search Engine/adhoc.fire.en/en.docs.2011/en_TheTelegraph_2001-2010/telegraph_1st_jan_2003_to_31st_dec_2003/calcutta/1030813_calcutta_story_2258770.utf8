 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Raj statue park plan on the waterfront
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A statue park in the heart of the city. And another parking plaza-cum-market complex, this one under Curzon Park. 																								The state public works department (PWD) has visualised the statue park on a green patch off Prinsep Ghat. The state government has written to the army for permission, as the land lies in the army blue zone. It will work out a plan, along with an estimate of funds, once the nod is in. The government may require private funds for the project. 																								Statues  some from the Raj, that are now at Latbagan, once Barrackpores Raj Bhavan, will find a place in the park. Some of the statues are full figures, others busts. The Left Front government had packed off these statues nearly two decades ago in a bid to erase colonial memories. The transfer from Calcuttas key streets to Barrackpore took place during the tenure of then PWD minister Jatin Chakraborty. 																								On Tuesday, state PWD minister Amar Choudhury and commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen, along with principal secretaries of their departments, met to discuss the twin projects. They are part of the PWDs agenda to beautify the heart of the city. Several underground parking lots and market plazas are also in the pipeline, Choudhury said.																								Apart from the proposed underground parking lot opposite Writers Buildings, the government also intends a similar parking zone-cum-shopping plaza under Curzon Park. This parking lot will definitely require private funding, Choudhury said. 																								The PWD minister wants to add a dash of green to Chowringhee, too. He wants the BC Roy Market (Maidan Market) shops shifted underground. The space above will be turned into a park. Modalities of this market complex are being worked out.																								Industry minister Sen placed a proposal at the meeting for a similar beautification project at the Collectorate Building, in Burdwan town.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Yards of beige Bengal for biwi-to-be
 A STAFF REPORTER Sabyasachi, Raveena:  Trousseau ties 																								Theres a bit of Bengal in most things Raveena Tandon does these days.																								As an actor, shes Chhoti Bahu in the small-screen adaptation of Bimal Mitras Sahib, Biwi, Ghulam. As a cine gourmet, shes feasting on the creations of Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak. As a bride-to-be, shes picked up select stuff for her trousseau from city boy Sabyasachi Mukherjee.																								Sabya is a friend and so I just had to take something from his latest collection, Raveena told Metro the morning after a Delhi date with the designer from NIFT, Salt Lake.																								The Bengal-centric sari, created specially for the star, is on a beige background. The old Mughal embroidery is woven in with ivory thread and golden zari. A red border completes the Bangali bou look for the February wedding with film producer-distributor Anil Thadani.																								This sari is something Ravs has been raving about for some time now. It happened by chance, when Raveena walked into my Mumbai store and liked what she saw, recalls Pepsi, as the young designer is better known as in his hometown. Ive been working on it for about a month-and-a-half. Ive tried to underplay the sari a little, since she is classically beautiful, anyway, and doesnt need too many trappings.																								And traditional is the way this lady likes it. For the all-important pheras, Raveena has chosen her mothers lehenga and dupatta. These have enormous sentimental value for me and they are being restored by my friend Manav (Gangwani), she says, all excited about D-Day.																								The rest of the trousseau comprises creations of designers Anna Singh, Tarun Tahiliani and J.J. Valaya. I am all for Indian rang-birangi (colourful) stuff, but in earthy tones, adds Raveena, who was Stumped by Thadani earlier this year while working on her first film as producer.																								The run-up to the wedding has been maddeningly hectic, but a blast for the Bollywood beauty. The best thing about getting married is shopping, she laughs. Usually, Papa (director Ravi Tandon) cribs about me running up shopping bills. But now, he, and everyone else at home, is pushing me to shop more. Its like Ive suddenly hit a jackpot.																								The likes of Sabyasachi sure arent complaining. Indulgence is an integral part of making a wedding trousseau, feels the 27-year-old, whos already cast his designs on quite a few socialite marriages (memorable among them being a Thapar do). Its far more time-consuming and complex, but I love the process. There are no parameters, like price or commercial viability. They are once-in-a-lifetime clothes that people wont otherwise wear. Its like wearing a fantasy, adds Pepsi, whose next hush-hush assignment is the Sahara wedding.

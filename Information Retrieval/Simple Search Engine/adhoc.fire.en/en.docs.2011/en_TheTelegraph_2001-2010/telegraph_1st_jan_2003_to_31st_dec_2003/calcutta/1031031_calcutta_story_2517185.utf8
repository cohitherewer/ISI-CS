				 																																									When a lot of hue and cry is being raised on cleanliness drives in the city, the civic authorities just need to pay a visit to the back of Writers Buildings where a garbage dump piles up everyday. The litter is removed only between 10 and 11 am. Till then office-goers have to negotiate the path through the stink. Did it never occur to the civic officials to shift the garbage vat elsewhere? Considering that this area houses the states administrative headquarters, the litter should be cleaned by 8 am.				 																																									R.K. Gupta,				 																																									Chandmari Road.				 																																									Although costs of movie tickets are increasing steadily, the amenities provided in the halls are not up to the mark. Seats are often torn and uncomfortable, and the screen is hazy. Not to forget cockroaches and bugs which have become permanent settlers. Most viewers litter the floors with packets of potato chips and pop corn, and the hall authorities do not take steps either to check this or arrange for the floors to be cleaned.

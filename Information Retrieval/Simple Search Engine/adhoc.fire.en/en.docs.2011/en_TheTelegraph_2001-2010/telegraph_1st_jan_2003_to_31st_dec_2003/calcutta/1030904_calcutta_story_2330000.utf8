The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, September 04, 2003 				 Cop drags cop to court over assault
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The officer-in-charge (OC) of Bowbazar police station moved court after his counterpart at Madhyamgram thana allegedly refused to allow him to file a general diary over a land dispute in Madhyamgram.																								On Tuesday, Basudeb Bag, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, filed a report before Calcutta High Court saying he had censured Madhyamgram OC Biswajit Patra for turning away Ashim Das, OC, Bowbazar police station.																								The superintendent stated that Das allegations were correct, as Patra had not registered the complaint and had manhandled him. Bag added that he had not taken stronger action against Patra considering the short term of his service. 																								The high court judge sought a report from the superintendent after Das filed a writ petition alleging that Patra had refused to register his complaint and had driven him out.																								Das owns a piece of land at Bireshtala in Madhyamgram. On July 29, he had gone there to start construction of a boundary wall around the property. Some residents, said Das counsel Arunava Ghosh and Subroto Mookherjee, allegedly linked to the CPM, stopped him from constructing the wall. The Bowbazar OC then approached the chairman of the Madhyamgram municipality for assistance, who, having visited the site, gave Das the go-ahead to proceed with the construction.																								Apparently, when Das tried to start work, local residents Abhoy Das Gupta and Shyamal Gupta resisted him. Das then went to lodge a complaint at the Madhyamgram Investigating Centre (police station) in Barasat.																								OC Biswajit Patra asked Das to sit down, but refused to take his complaint. When Das pointed out it was the duty of the police to register a case, Patra became furious and asked him to get out of the police station, the lawyers stated. Even after Das disclosed his identity, the Madhyamgram OC refused to hear his complaint, and even abused him, argued Das counsel. This had, apparently, led to an injury in Das right hand.																								The Bowbazar OC then returned to Calcutta and met deputy commissioner of police (central) Rajiv Kumar. On July 30, Kumar wrote to Bag asking him to look into the allegations made by Das and take appropriate action if they were found true. Das submitted in court that no action had been taken, prompting him to move court.																								Justice Pranab Chatterjee passed an interim order asking the superintendent to provide adequate police protection to the petitioner so that he could continue with the construction.

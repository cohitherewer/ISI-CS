 Sunday, June 15, 2003 				 Girls relatives blame clinic for drug overdose
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Even as the Rajnis Patel case files are doing the rounds of the police top brass tables, the family of a 13-year-old girl is locking horns with a city nursing home where she is admitted. The family has accused doctors of being negligent after drugs administered on the girl caused a dreaded drug-induced infection called Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS).																								The nursing home authorities have asked the childs parents to take her home, claiming she was better. But the family has refused to do so and has filed a police complaint against them.																								When Sumana Mondol, a resident of Thakurpukur, developed high fever on May 15, she was taken to local physician D. Sinha Roy who diagnosed her with viral fever and prescribed medicines. But Sumanas condition deteriorated and three days later, she started having convulsions.																								On May 18, she was admitted to Bangur Medicare Research Institute (BMRI), in Thakurpukur. There, doctors put her on anti-epileptic drugs. On May 21, the nursing home released the girl with instructions to continue with the medicines. Soon after, Sumana broke into blisters and rashes. We contacted Sinha Roy who said the rashes were just a reaction to the antibiotics, said Sumanas father, Shyamal.																								By June 2, the girl was covered with blisters. She also had a red eye, muscular pain and high fever with frequent convulsions. She was re-admitted to BMRI. This time, doctors declared she was suffering from SJS  a reaction to over-administration of drugs that a patient is allergic to. The girl was then shifted to the intensive care unit.																								Sumanas relatives blame BMRI for failing to anticipate the drug reactions. The doctors now admit that the drugs could have had an adverse effect on the girl, said uncle Pronab Banerjee. The family lodged a complaint with the Thakurpukur police station against the nursing home, alleging wrong treatment.																								Under pressure, the nursing home authorities formed a medical board and changed the drugs. The local physician should have understood the problem since SJS, although rare, can happen. There was no negligence on BMRIs part and Sumana is fine now, said Debasish Mukherjee, member of the board. For the past few days, they have been pressuring the family to take Sumana home. Sinha Roy, too, says he has agreed to bear half of the cost of Sumanas treatment. But the family wants an admission of the nursing homes failure in writing first.

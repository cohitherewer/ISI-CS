 An old-world charm combined in her  with a zest for life. Samir Mukerjee remembers a lady  who took in the city and its people with warm understanding The author with Charlotte Hayward: Memory revisited  When charlotte hayward entered  our drawing room for the very first time a few months ago,  my 92-year-old mother was heard to remark that Charlotte  reminded her of the upper-class British ladies like Lady  Pugh or Lady Rankin whom she had met in the 30s in Calcutta.  Mother had seen something that revived her memories of the  past. Charlottes deportment, finesse, attractive face,  smiling eyes and an air of natural affability made her eminently  acceptable, even irresistible. We had hardly been introduced  when we observed all this with increasing excitement. An  old-world English charm is an indefinable quality but one  can recognise its contours. The initiated know it for what  it is worth. She was the very embodiment of graciousness. Charlottes father, Anthony Hayward,  was intimately connected with Shaw Wallace for many years  and stayed on in India long after the other British mercantile  chiefs had left. Charlotte was born and brought up in Calcutta  and spent quite a few years imbibing the Indian ethos before  she was sent to school in England. Those formative years  left a deep impression on her mind and there was something  in the ambience here that she couldnt quite get out of  her system. During the Raj, life was orderly,  seemly, privacy-oriented. I can imagine Mr Hayward carving  out a niche for himself and his family from where he functioned  with a sense of self-sufficiency. Indian servants in those  days had a tremendous sense of loyalty and efficiency and  understood the habits and demands of their employers only  too well. There was never a false step, no lapses likely  to cause any consternation. Charlotte grew up in this world  where certain basic assumptions were never questioned. Talking to Charlotte, my wife  and I discovered how very involved she was mentally with  certain aspects of Indian life. She wanted to know what  we felt about our Indian minions, what backgrounds they  came from, what sort of work they were especially good at,  how long they lasted and the reasons for the frequent change  of jobs. Her interests were far flung, covering an immense  range of subjects. The very fact that she came back to Calcutta  to take copious notes about what she saw and felt and heard,  made us realise her emotional attachment to this city. She  wanted to produce a book on India where her personal discoveries  would find a suitable resting place. When we pointed out the derelict  nature of Calcutta, the decrepitude that we saw around us,  the endless traffic jams that clogged our lives, the palpable  erosion of law and order and the colossal inertia that left  the city gasping for breath, she wasnt put off by our tirades.  Although agreeing with the points we were trying to make,  Charlotte never dismissed anything out of hand and did not  believe in outright condemnation. She refused to be judgmental  and dogmatic, which was one of her most endearing qualities.  She looked for compensations and redeeming features even  where she saw the sandcastles crumbling and poor governance  reducing a great city to a state of utter hopelessness. She went to Santiniketan to discover  the power and glory of nature and the towns aesthetic qualities.  She couldnt have spent her stay more profitably, walking  miles on her own and visiting some old inhabitants as well  as Tagores houses, which reflected his various moods. Charlotte  was so much in love with Santiniketan that she wanted us  to return there just to breathe in the fresh scents. She  also went to Mirzapur to study the carpet-making industry  and talk to the old Muslim artisans devoted to their craft.  It was so easy for her to establish a rapport with different  types of people and I can imagine how the workers must have  warmed to her compassionate personality. While she was in Calcutta and  the heat was at its peak, she went to Chitpore to chat up  the pavement typists and find out what made them tick and  how drudgery did not obliterate their stamina. Its the  same thirst for novel contacts that made her converse with  odd people in railway compartments. A smattering of Hindustani  enabled her to open up with her fellow passengers. She visited  Mother Teresas home for abandoned babies almost every day.  Whatever she did, there was no fanfare involved. The more  you praised her efforts, the more self-effacing she became. Charlotte liked reading all sorts  of books and seemed to know an awful lot about British writers  like Philip Woodruff, Michael Edwards and Percival Spears  who wrote about India knowledgeably, furnishing exciting  details about Indias administration and cultural heritage.  She had finished George Elliots Middlemarch while  she was here and dipped into Dalrymples White Nabobs.  She also had a sound knowledge of psychology and must have  got to grips with Jung and Freud when she was teaching children  with special needs in London. Charlotte never confined herself  to the brandy-and-cigar circuit. Her exploratory instincts  took her far and wide, away from the constricting influences  of club life and mindless revelry. Was her life one long  round of epiphanies, blinding discoveries and transfiguring  experiences? Whenever she came to have tea with us we spoke  animatedly for hours and the ticking of the clock became  inaudible. Her impeccable Oxbridge accent was a feast for  the ears. She always mulled over what we said while we also  listened to her pertinent observations and serious comments  with concentration. Whenever I mimicked people whose follies  made them vulnerable, Charlotte was in stitches and her  infectious laughter livened the tempo. With her, my wife  and I entered a serene yet throbbing world where we did  not need garnishes. There was no topic we couldnt discuss  with her, there was no anecdote she didnt want to listen  to. Charlotte believed that life was  a glorious feast where everyone has a right to participate.  The table wasnt reserved for the chosen few. At the end  of the day when its time for some kind of summing up, this  is what I have to say about Charlotte and the way she took  us all by storm  Woh aye bazm mein, itna to  Mir ne dekha Phir uske baad chiraghon mein  raushni na rahi (Mir saw her join the assembly  out of the corner of his eye; all the lamps were extinguished,  leaving only her resplendent). Charlotte brought with her just  those resonances and flavours which had enriched our lives  during the heyday of the Raj.

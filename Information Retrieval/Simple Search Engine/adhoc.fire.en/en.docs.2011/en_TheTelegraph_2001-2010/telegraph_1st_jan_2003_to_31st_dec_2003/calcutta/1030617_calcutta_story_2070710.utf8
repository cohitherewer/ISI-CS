 Tuesday, June 17, 2003  Inquiries that hide, rather than reveal
 Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta Governments revel in inquiries.  Give them a pretext and they would constitute a committee.  Provide them half an opportunity, and they would happily  form another committee to monitor the findings of the first.  They would generally be known to everybody. But the inquiry  report, through a convoluted process, would let people know  what ideally should have happened; and since conditions  are rarely ideal, why it would be foolish to expect it  in the first place. This familiar pattern is being  re-enacted all over again by the health department, which  last week constituted another expert panel to vet the  findings of a team constituted earlier to inquire into the  unfortunate death of a 17-year-old, who had merely broken  a shin bone during a cricket match. A broken bone in the lower limb  can rarely be fatal. It was, therefore, an open-and-shut  case from the beginning, indicating collective irresponsibility  of the doctors, paramedics and other staff that nipped a  cricketing career in the bud. If such a case had taken place  elsewhere, the hospital superintendent would have had the  authority to fix responsibility and recommend suspension  or other forms of suitable punishment. But the health department  does not appear to have much confidence, rightly or wrongly,  in the superintendents. The official inquiry could have  taken the form of an administrative inquiry to fix responsibility.  It could also be a medical inquiry to ascertain the cause  of death and whether the course of treatment was correct.  Finally, it could address wider issues and find out the  systemic failures that require correction. But the focus  of the official inquiry remains uncertain. It would be enlightening, for  example, to find out whether the teenager was the first  or the only patient to have died in the orthopaedic ward  of SSKM Hospital. The number of unsuccessful surgical operations  and the rate of infection in the ward would be other indicators  to show if alls right with the hospital. Information such  as these should, perhaps, be displayed prominently to inspire  confidence in the people, ensure transparency that would  inevitably exert pressure on medical teams. But neither doctors nor officials  appear to be motivated by any such desire to improve hospital  administration. That is why the secretary of the Indian  Medical Association was quoted as asking if it was fair  to suspend the orthopaedic surgeon on the basis of a one-page  inquiry report. Would a four-page report make a difference? Even the health department, which  perforce suspended the surgeon, has been taking pains to  explain that the doctor was not present during any of the  five operations that the victim went through in the hospital,  though he, as head of the medical team, was responsible  for the treatment. The surgeon himself has been quick to  point out that there were nine members in the medical team  and, therefore, it is unfair to single him out. Thus, even  before the official inquiry is completed, the outcome appears  to be a foregone conclusion. Expertise of the World Health  Organisation is surely not needed to improve internal communication,  monitoring, quality of supervision and proper maintenance  of medical records and bed-head tickets. Nor does it require  any genius to conclude that both the surgeon superintendent  and the head of the department of orthopaedics should also  be held accountable for their failure to monitor complicated  cases. The city, which once boasted of  doctors with almost miraculous healing powers, is fast acquiring  notoriety for callous medicare. Therefore, dealing with  one case at a time, and then waiting for the next crisis,  is the kind of ad-hocism that simply will not work.

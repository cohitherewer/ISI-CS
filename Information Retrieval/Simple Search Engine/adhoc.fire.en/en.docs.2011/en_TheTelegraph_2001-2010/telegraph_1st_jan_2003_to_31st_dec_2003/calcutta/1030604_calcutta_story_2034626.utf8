 Wednesday, June 04, 2003  The City Diary
																																																																																		After 10 days of soaring temperatures, the city experienced a little rain on Tuesday evening. The smattering, however, failed to bring the mercury down. The Alipore weather office said there was only a trace of rain. Bangur Avenue, Ultadanga, Lake Town, Salt Lake, Esplanade. Park Street, Ballygunge, Dhakuria, Garia and other parts of the city recorded sparse rainfall. Met office sources said the rainfall was pre-monsoon. We expect clouds to develop on Wednesday, too, but it is difficult to predict whether it will lead to a Norwester or a heavy shower, an official said.																																																		Five armed dacoits stormed a house at Adrab, in Moyna, near Barasat, on Monday night and looted cash and jewellery worth Rs 1 lakh. The miscreants broke into the house and tied up the family members before fleeing with the booty. Residents put up a roadblock on National Highway 34 on Tuesday for an hour, causing massive traffic snarls on Krishnagar Road, protesting the spate of dacoities in the area. Police said the miscreants had been identified and would be arrested. 																																																		A National Mango Show will be organised on the Agri-Horticultural Society of India premises on Alipore Road, from June 13 to 15. Organised jointly by Agri-Horticultural Society of India and the state department of food processing industries and horticulture, the show will feature varieties of mangoes from states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Industries minister Nirupam Sen will inaugurate the show, which seeks to bring together growers, investors, industrialists, researchers, consumers, state food processing and horticulture minister Sailen Sarkar said. There will also be seminars and workshops to improve quality, export and processing procedures. A similar show will be held at Malda from June 20 to 22.																																																		Two persons were seriously injured in separate road accidents in the city. Bibhutibhusan Chatterjee, 45, was knocked down by a truck at Girish Park on Tuesday morning. He was taken to Medical College and Hospital in a serious condition. In another accident at the Rashbehari Avenue crossing, Ajoy Sinha, 45, was hit by an unknown vehicle. Sinha was admitted to hospital with serious injuries.																																																		With a spurt in motorcycle thefts in the area, officials of the Amherst Street police station launched an awareness campaign for owners of two-wheelers. Leaflets were distributed and checks carried out in the bylanes of the theft-prone areas. Police said they were trying to persuade people to keep their two-wheelers properly locked.

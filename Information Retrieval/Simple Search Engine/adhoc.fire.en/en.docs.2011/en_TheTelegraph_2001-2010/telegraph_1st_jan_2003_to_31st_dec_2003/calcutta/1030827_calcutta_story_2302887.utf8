 Wednesday, August 27, 2003 				 Court refuses student plea to see script 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								An unsuccessful candidate of this years Higher Secondary examination broke down in the courtroom on Tuesday when the judge refused to hand over the answer-scripts to her or her teachers. Justice Pratap Chatterjee observed that there was no provision in the rules of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education to show the scripts to students.																								By the judges earlier order, the physics, chemistry and mathematics answer-scripts of Paramita Roy Chowdhury, a student of Dum Dum Airport Higher Secondary School, were brought to court by the council lawyer. The judge also asked the petitioner to come to court with her teachers. 																								Paramita was under the impression that the court would hand over her answer-scripts to her teachers for a recheck. On Tuesday, when the matter came up for hearing, the council lawyer handed over a packet to the judge. Justice Chatterjee went through the papers in the packet and remarked: Everything is okay. 																								Petitioners lawyer Supradip Roy urged the court to show his client the papers, but the judge declined. Roy asked how the court could be sure the scripts brought by the council were Paramitas unless she recognised her handwriting. The council lawyer Ranajit Chatterjee cited a Supreme Court ruling and the judge stuck to his decision. He said the students had no right to see their answer-scripts.

 Prayasam is an effort (as the name suggests) by a city-based NGO to uplift the condition of the citys underprivileged children. Since its inception seven years ago, this organisation has been working tirelessly to ensure the four basic rights of children: survival, development, protection and participation in every sphere of decision-making. Prayasam works with and for children till the age of 17 from all social strata. Ahladi is one of its foremost child development programmes and consists about 20 talented teenagers who are groomed in performing arts to pursue and fulfil their dreams of making it big some day. This evening they will present two dance items, Intezaar and Deyala. Intezaar portrays the stagnant life of women labourers who wait endlessly for their release from the drudgery of daily life. The choreography focuses on the economic deprivation of women who remain dependant on their menfolk in spite of their hard labour. It also portrays the ill effects of early marriage. Deyala means infant dream in Bengali. It focuses on those children who wistfully dream of leading a better life as they struggle to accommodate their study time while working simultaneously as domestic help. The production highlights the earnest desires, dreams and wishes of these deprived children who struggle hard to fulfill them.																								When: Today at 4 pm																								Where: 5 Mall Road, Dum Dum

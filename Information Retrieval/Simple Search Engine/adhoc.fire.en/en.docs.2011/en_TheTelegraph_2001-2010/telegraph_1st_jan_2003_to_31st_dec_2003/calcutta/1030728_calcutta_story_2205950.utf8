		 South Dum Dums Town Hall, its only  seat for cultural activities. Pictures by Kishor Roy  ChowdhurySambhu De: Dum Dum has witnessed all-round progress. But we still need a cultural centre. Will you please oblige?																																																													The demand is justified. Regrettably, South Dum Dum does not have its own cultural centre, though it has always played a pioneering role in cultural activities. The existing Town Hall, locally known as Ananta Dutta Smriti Sadan, was built in 1971. Later, when the government was sanctioning funds for cultural centres, Dum Dum was bypassed because it already had a hall, though it was no longer serving the purpose. We tried to build another in a joint venture, but the private party backed out. We do have plans for a full-fledged hall with a carpark and other facilities.

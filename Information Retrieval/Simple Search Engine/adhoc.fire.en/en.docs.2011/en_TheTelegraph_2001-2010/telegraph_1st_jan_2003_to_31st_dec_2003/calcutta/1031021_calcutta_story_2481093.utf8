				 	RASHI KEDIA Rashi Kedia																									Go well together in the life of this young lady. The Class X student of La Martiniere for Girls is as happy being the director of the school Science Club, as she is designing rangoli and jewellery. Franky, as she is known to her friends, is also a regular in the school fest circuit, famous for taking part and winning.																									Is this 16-year-old. But studying definitely doesnt mean giving hobbies and extra-curriculars a miss. Taking time out for competitions is her speciality. First prize in the intra-school jewellery-designing and mask-making contest, top honours for fashion designing at the inter-school fests Callisto and Drishtikon, second place for fashion designing at Karma Yatra The list goes on. Awards for dramatics and the odd scavenger hunt were just part of the fun.																									Is Rashis one true passion, and rangoli is her medium, using anything, from pan pata to plasticine. Her efforts produced what she called the Devdas rangoli, which won her a competition at a city shopping mall. Experimenting with colours to come up with new combinations  be it on her room walls, designing a dress, painting, doing computer animation or making candles  is what she likes best.																									Are definitely the keys to success for this avid swimmer. Maybe doing a fashion designing course had something to do with it. Or perhaps, the idea of mixing clay, gold colour, stones and intricate designs to create a unique rangoli was her own doing. She blames it on an innate desire to do well. Being a lawyer no longer fits in with Rashis future plans. Pursuing a special skill is more important, she feels.																									Or at least, thats the aim, for a fashion designing course. Coz this young trend-setter dreams of being a self-made woman, with inspiration from her father. With firm faith in hard work, shes on the right track. And with family support spurring her on, she hopes to make her mark on the international fashion industry.

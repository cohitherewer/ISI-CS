The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, July 30, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Arnold Schwarzenegger.  You are a creative person. Your happy nature shines through  all that you do. You do not get bogged down by failure.  You are an active person and regular sports appeal to you.  In your thoughtful moments, you like to be left alone. You  are flexible and like to try out new things. You are popular  for your wonderful sense of humour.Kusum Bhandari

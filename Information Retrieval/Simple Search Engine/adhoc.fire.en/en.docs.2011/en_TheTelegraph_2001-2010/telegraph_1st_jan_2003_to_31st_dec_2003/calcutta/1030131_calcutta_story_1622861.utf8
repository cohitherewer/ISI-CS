The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, January 31, 2003 				 Pinky and Asha Mary
																								Pinky and Asha Mary has been inspired by French dramatist Jean Genets The Maids. Keeping the physical structure of the play intact, director Sohag Sen has contemporised it. Set in a modern urban Indian household, the play juxtaposes the mutually parasitic worlds of Vasundhara Devi Chauhan, an ageing actress and her domestic aides  Pinky and Asha Mary. The psychological drama that unfolds subverts the classic master-slave scenario and deals with the relationship between the quot;visible and the quot;invisible quot; people. The unequal liaison is at best unhappy and hence potentially dangerous. It explores the complexities of human aspiration to climb the social structure, and the aberrative psychological pressure that comes with it. Power politics and individual crisis surround the claustrophobic lives of the three women at the heart of the play. The cast includes Konkona Sen Sharma, Renu Roy and Niharika Seth. A Spandan presentation.																								When: Today and February 1 amp; 2; 6.30 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch, Pretoria Street

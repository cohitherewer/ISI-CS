 Monday, June 23, 2003  Tramcars, slow and empty, cannot be  forever
 Metro Matters UTTAM SENGUPTA Those who regularly drive down  Lenin Sarani are undoubtedly familiar with the chaos caused  by trams, for no fault of the latter though. The totally  unruly traffic, with loony bus drivers behaving as if they  are in a Formula 4 racing event, is actually brought to  a standstill by not one, but often as many as four tramcars  moving one after another. With the up and down tracks  laid on two sides of the street, vehicular traffic is often  sandwiched and must wait for the slow and sedate tramcars  to pass. What is even more maddening is to find that many  of these tramcars are actually half-empty, with some of  the passengers blissfully dozing. On such occasions, who  can blame motorists who gnash their teeth and silently pray  for more power to the mayor, who has been threatening to  pull out tramcars from the streets of the city. With more  cars clogging the city in the next few years, the cry is  bound to get increasingly shrill. Even in Melbourne, with which  this city forged fraternal relations between tram fans,  tramcars are coming in for some sharp criticism. A study  conducted by engineers from RMIT University there has apparently  indicted the trams for causing more pollution than cars  and buses that run on petrol or natural gases. The argument  is that tramcars are powered by electricity, which in turn  is generated by coal. And burning of coal obviously causes  more greenhouse effect than petrol or natural gases. The study also points out that  trams actually block traffic, forcing cars to remain longer  on the roads, thereby use up more petrol and add further  to the greenhouse effect. One of the more startling aspects  of the study is where it blames tramcars for generating  20 million kg of carbon dioxide, while cars generate only  6 million kg and trains just 4 million kg. With just sketchy details available  so far about the study, it would be foolhardy to jump to  any conclusion. We must also take into account the fact  that tramcars, theoretically at least, can replace a much  larger number of cars on the streets and are found to be  more comfortable by women, children and the elderly. But  quite apart from the economic reasons and the mounting losses  of the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC), often cited as compelling  reasons for closing it down, the city requires a more comprehensive  cost-benefit analysis to take a final decision. A couple of points can still be  made. While there is a strong case for allowing tramcars  to run early in the morning and in the afternoon  when  more students can ride them to school and back  and possibly  late in the evening, when it becomes uneconomical for buses  to ply, there is an equally strong case for withdrawing  tramcars during peak hours, when all it does is to slow  down the traffic. The frequency of tramcars also  needs to be monitored, because it is fairly common to see  two or more tramcars trundling down the Maidan at all hours  and in one direction, with barely half-a-dozen passengers  in each of them. Clearly, there is a need to calibrate their  timing better.  Finally, it is not really understood  why the CTC cannot leverage its unique position as the only  tram company in the country to offer consultancy and accept  turnkey jobs to set up the system in smaller towns, where  tramcars can be a roaring hit.

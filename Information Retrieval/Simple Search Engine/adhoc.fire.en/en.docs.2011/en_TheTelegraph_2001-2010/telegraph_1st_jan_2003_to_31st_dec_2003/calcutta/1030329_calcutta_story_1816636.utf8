Not just a historical perspective, but a poignant look at one familys personal struggle for survival. The Event				 																																	(Gaganendra Pradarshashala, March 29, 4 pm)				 																																	lAn exhibition of theatre photographs and memorabilia of Utpal Dutt, as part of his 73rd birthday celebrations, will be inaugurated by Somnath Chatterjee. Peoples Little Theatre will stage Titumir at Rabindra Sadan at 6 pm.

Writer Amit Chaudhuri (picture above) will perform, host a discussion on the subject and introduce the three singers in the following weeks.

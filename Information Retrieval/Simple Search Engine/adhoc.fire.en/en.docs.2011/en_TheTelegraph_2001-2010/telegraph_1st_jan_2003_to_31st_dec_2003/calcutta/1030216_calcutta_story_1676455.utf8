 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 NGO aid for smooth traffic
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Concerned with the growing incidence of road accidents, the state government has decided to deploy NGOs on some vital thoroughfares in the city to ensure smooth vehicular movement.																								The Centre, transport department officials said, has agreed to shoulder the major share of funds required for the project. The Union surface transport ministry cleared the project and assured funds at a meeting attended by state transport department officials in Delhi last week. The Centre also expressed concern over gross violation of traffic rules in the city.																								NGOs are engaged in organising awareness campaigns from time to time only for specific programmes, like road safety weeks and special awareness drives. But the new system will be permanent. We expect the move will help restore traffic discipline, said Prashant, joint secretary in the state transport department.																								Several teams will be formed after training the NGO members on motor vehicle rules and auto emission norms, said transport department officials. Each team will comprise 10 to 15 members.																								Apart from monitoring traffic movement, the teams will take up awareness campaigns round the year. They will organise seminars, workshops, bring out booklets on safe traffic movement for distribution among students and drivers. They will also help the police impound vehicles flouting traffic norms.																								This apart, the NGOs will aid in organising training camps for drivers of heavy vehicles and teach them how to attend to accident victims. The teams will be empowered to check licences, permits and other related papers of drivers. The units, moreover, will work as a bridge between the Public Vehicles Department and the traffic police.																								The transport department decided to engage NGOs as the state government was not in a position to make fresh recruitment. A huge manpower is required to tackle the increasing volume of traffic in the city, an official said.																								Power supply off																								CESC will carry out maintenance of switchgears at Prince Anwar Shah Road distribution station on Monday. As a result, power supply to the following areas may be affected between 9 am and 11 am on Monday: Jadavpur, Lake Gardens, Golf Green, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Tollygunge, Deshpran Sashmal Road, Jodhpur Park, Poddar Park, Prince Ghulam Md. Shah Road, Deodhar Rahman Road, Prince Bakhtiar Shah Road, B.L. Shah Road and Kudghat.

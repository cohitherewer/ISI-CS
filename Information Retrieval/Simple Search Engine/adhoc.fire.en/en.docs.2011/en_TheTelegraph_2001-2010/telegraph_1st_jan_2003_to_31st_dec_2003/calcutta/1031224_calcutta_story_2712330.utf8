	Broken down buses, cars, autos and even trucks, impounded  by police, are parked on either side of SN Banerjee Road.  This has narrowed the road space. Police should remove these  vehicles and make room for traffic. With Elite cinema in  the vicinity, its all the more necessary that the stretch  is made safe for pedestrians. 
	 Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake.  
	Lights at several wedding halls are installed in such a  way that the beam falls on the streets almost horizontally,  dazzling drivers who approach the hall. Often the light  is blinding enough to drag the driver into a mishap. The  civic authorities must formulate some norms in this regard. 
	 Biman Saha, Lake Town.  
	Netaji Udyan in Lake Towns Block B is taken over for religious  functions in the winter. This is a bother, as local residents  need the ground for morning walks. 
	 Piyal Mukherjee, Lake Town.

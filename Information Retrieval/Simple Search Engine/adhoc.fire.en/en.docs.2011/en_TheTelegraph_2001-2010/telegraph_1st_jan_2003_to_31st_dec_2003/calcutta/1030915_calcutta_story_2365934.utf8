 Diptendu Bikash Sengupta:  There are various types of hospitals and within a hospital  there are so many different departments. But due to lack  of proper information, patients are confused about where  to go. Can something be done about this?																																																													You have raised a valid point. To increase awareness, basic knowledge about the nature of hospitals needs to be communicated. Signboards can be put up in front of a hospital giving details of what treatment is available inside. We need the co-operation of hospital authorities, patients and their relatives for this.

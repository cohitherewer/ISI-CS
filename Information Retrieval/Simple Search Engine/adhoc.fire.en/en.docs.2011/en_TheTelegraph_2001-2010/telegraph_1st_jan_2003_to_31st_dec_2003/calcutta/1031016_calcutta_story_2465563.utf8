  Uncertain cure: A ward in a government  hospital Apropos the report Tenants to pay for landlord sins (Metro, Sept 11) it is disheartening to read about the Supreme Court verdict in favour of the Corporation. This is bad news for thousands of trade licence-holding tenants who are doing business in rented spaces in buildings for commercial use if their landlords are tax-defaulters. Landlords are used to sitting on taxes for years, deceiving the civic body of nearly Rs 100 crore every year. More painful is the fact that the apex court verdict has a wide purview, allowing the Corporation to involve all types of tenants of commercial buildings  lessee, sub-lessee, sub-tenants or even any occupants residing in a building who will have to swallow the bitter pill and simply fork out property tax, as the court verdict considers them tax-defaulters along with their landlord. This leaves hardly any way out for the tenants involved or any tenants association whose members fall under the purview of the Supreme Court verdict, as any attempt or action or any other procedure in defiance of the verdict would amount to contempt of the apex court.  The Supreme Court verdict comes as a gift to the workaholic mayor of our city. This would bring over two lakh Calcuttans within the purview of one more civic tax, bringing him Rs 100 crore a year.  Sunil Banerjee, 
 VIP Road.  Yet another shameful act by the medicos of a premier government hospital (Ward without docs, all night long, Metro, Sept. 18). The principal of the Medical College promises disciplinary action. It is common knowledge that such pledges rarely become reality. Unless a sense of accountability is instilled in the healers, medical crimes are likely to continue.  Dr. Kunal Saha,
 Columbus, Ohio.  Three doctors on duty left the  hospital without handing over charge and we claim to live  in civilized society.  Govinda Bakshi, 
 Budge Budge.  A whole night in the emergency  ward without a single doctor and that too in the Medical  College and Hospital! This must be happening regularly.  The promises of action by the authorities are too empty  to believe.  Kunal Ray, 
 Santragachhi. Howrah.  Todays youth no longer take an interest in stamp collection (Catch em young, stamp a hobby, Metro, Sept. 8). Although the postal department launched a course on philately at Jadavpur University, it was not publicised. The stamp fair at Charnock City, too, was more a meeting place of stamp dealers than an exhibition.  Diptimoy Ghosh, 
 Salt Lake City.  It is distressing to learn that cases of conjunctivitis are on the rise in and around the city (Eye doctors sound infection red alert, Metro, Sept. 11). The state-run hospitals should distribute medicines free of cost among the poor.  Prahlad Agarwala, 
 Majdia, Nadia.  It is disconcerting how brilliant students are being denied a decent higher education only because of their lack of knowledge of English (Queens language, a barrier in the method and the mind, Metro, Sept 9). I am a 64-year-old engineer. I wish to offer my services free to such students, if they want to learn English (2474-5636).  Ashok Mehta, 
 Ray Street.  We hope that the article Cabbage, poultry on Nippon route (Metro, Sept. 10) will provide business opportunities to farmers and backyard gardeners.  Bhupen Bose, 
 Dum Dum Park.  We welcome the UGCs plan to introduce job-oriented courses in colleges affiliated to Calcutta University (Time lag trips new-age CU courses, Metro, Sept. 10). Mere academic qualification is not enough to get established in life nowadays.  Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
 Behala.  In the report Lost on pandal grounds, found on airwaves (Metro, Oct. 15), it was stated that Arya Ghosh, secretary, Calcutta VHF Amateur Radio Society, handled a false claim for a child at the Ekdalia Evergreen Club puja, while volunteering at the missing persons booth. It was, in fact, a colleague of his who handled the claim.

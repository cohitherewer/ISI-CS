	The organisers of the musical soiree, held at the Nandan-Rabindra  Sadan complex on Rabindranath Tagores birth anniversary  this year, did a very poor job. I had attended the celebrations  from early morning on May 9. Within a span of four hours,  the public address system developed technical snags and  one of the elocutionists was even forced to stop his recitation  midway. Moreover, the announcer missed the name of a particular  artiste. Such lapses spoil the mood of the audience and  the performers. The responsibility of arranging such a huge  function should be given to competent people.

	Cut fruits are selling on roadsides, with customers queuing  up in front of these makeshift stalls. What several people  dont know is the fact that even green mangoes are dipped  in carbide solutions to make them look more fresh. Such  chemicals can cause health hazards. The civic authorities  must check this.

																									Kaizad Gherda																									He was not, till the age of 10. Having started off at six, he kept at it because Kaizad is not one to give up. It was his piano performance in Oliver Twist, his first public appearance, that gave him a glimpse of how good it felt to be appreciated for hard work.																									He has progressed. The Grade 8 student of the Royal College of London is now gearing up for the next theoretical exam, apart from spreading his musical talents outside the classical arena.																									Is where the Xaverians talents and ambitions extend. The aspiring actor is a member of the theatre group Red Curtain and has also participated in the Two Left Feet summer 2003 production Malice in Wonderland. The David Benegal fan also took time out to act in a Gujarati production by the Calcutta Parsee Amateur Dramatic Club in August this year. 																									Is where his acting career began, as a member of the Drama Club. Winning the most original concept in the British Council theatre festival, in Class XII, was a memorable moment.																									Is what got the 18-year-old famous in the inter-school fest circuit, with many a laurel for elocution. The first-year mass communications student intends to continue in college. Football, too, is the left-back defenders forte. But criticism, feels Kaizad, is important, particularly when it comes from his 15-year-old sister, who doesnt much appreciate any of his talents.																									Are his passions and pastimes. Now one of the five members of the creative music band Rise from the Ashes, hes busy making his own music for a demo tape of original compositions. Singing, be it for the school choir or band practice, is the Bach fans bane, because of a bass voice which doesnt quite gel with pop tunes, which, unlike western classical, he has an ear for.																									Is Kaizu, but would like to be the master of just one. The self-taught guitarist has also tried his hand at the drums and the mouth organ. Acting might be in his heart, but music is in his blood.

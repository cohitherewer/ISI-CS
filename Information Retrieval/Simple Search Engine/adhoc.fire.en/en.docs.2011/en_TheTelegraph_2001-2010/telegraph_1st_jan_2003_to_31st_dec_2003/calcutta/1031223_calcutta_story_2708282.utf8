 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Five-year road tax challenged
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI) moved a petition in Calcutta High Court on Monday, challenging the state governments decision making it mandatory for four-wheeler owners to pay road tax for a five-year period at a time.																								The AAEI, challenging the West Bengal Additional and One-Time Tax on Motor Vehicles (Second Amendment) Act, 2003, pleaded in the court of Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta that the decision be set aside as it was against natural justice. The petition was admitted and set for judgment on Tuesday. 																								A large number of private vehicle-owners, who are members of the association, were present in court on Monday. The petitioners organisation contended that the decision to levy one-time five-year road tax on owners was ultra vires of the Constitution and against the norms of the West Bengal Road Tax Act, 1998. The petition also challenged the fixing of road tax on the basis of cubic capacity instead of a vehicles overall weight.																								Appearing for the petitioner, P.K. Roy and Subrata Basu challenged the governments decision to impose 100 per cent penalty on vehicle-owners who failed to pay the tax within 75 days after November 1, 2003. The government had issued a notification in August asking private vehicle-owners to pay road taxes for five years at a time. Earlier, the government had amended the Road Tax Act, 1998, in this regard. Additional government pleader Debasish Kar Gupta told the court that the state had fixed the new tax as the legislature thought it fit for implementation.

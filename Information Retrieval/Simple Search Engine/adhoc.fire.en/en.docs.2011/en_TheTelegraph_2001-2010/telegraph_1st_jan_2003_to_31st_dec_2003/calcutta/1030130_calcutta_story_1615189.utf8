 SUVRO ROY																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has stepped in to stop VIP Road from becoming even more chaotic than it is today, by flattening the proposal to build two special humps on the arterial stretch to the airport.																								Officials said on Wednesday that the CMDA, under instructions from the chief minister, has drawn up alternate plans to ensure freer flow of traffic on VIP Road. One way out is to extend the Salt Lake Bypass, from Nicco Park to the Dum Dum Park crossing, with a right-turning flyover to Keshtopur, at an estimated cost of Rs 60 crore. The construction of the Salt Lake Bypass from Nicco Park to Salt Lakes AL Block is complete.																								Urban development minister and CMDA chairman Asok Bhattacharya presented the alternate plan to public works department (PWD) minister Amar Choudhury on Monday, suggesting that the PWD drop the proposal for construction of two elevated humps, 4.5 metres high, at two congested intersections on VIP Road. We have received a plan on the Keshtopur flyover. I have sent it to our technical experts and will let the CMDA know in about a weeks time, said Choudhury.																								The CMDA, prodded by the chief minister, is convinced that the proposed humps at Keshtopur and Baguiati will not solve any traffic problem. Instead, it will lead to waste of road space and add to the areas ugliness. The PWD has been pushing the humps-plan as it involves just Rs 27 crore, against the CMDAs masterplan for a Rs 170-crore flyover from Keshtopur to Kaikhali.

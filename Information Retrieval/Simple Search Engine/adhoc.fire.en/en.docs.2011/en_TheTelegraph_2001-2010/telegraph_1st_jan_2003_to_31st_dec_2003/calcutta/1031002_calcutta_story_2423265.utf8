Abhudaya in Patuli inaugurated  their puja celebrations on Panchami night with conch-blowing  and diya-lighting competitions, continuing with a sit-and-draw  contest on Sashthi morning.

The prizes  gift hampers ranging  from Rs 50 to 300  were given away to the first, second  and third place winners by Nestle. Antakshari teams and  several quizzers also carried home some goodies. Tradition is trendy As Calcutta put the finishing  touches to the Devi on Wednesday, four teams of watchful  eyes were quietly at work, roaming the streets all day long. The first round of assessment  is underway for The CESC The Telegraph True Spirit  Puja, supported by People United for Better Living in Calcutta.  Many of the 79 participating committees met representatives  entrusted with the task of identifying the pujas which have  tried to create not only a mood of celebration, but also  a thoughtful and sensitive environment inclusive of all. Braving the traffic jams that  have already set in at major intersections  and the pouring  rain  panelists, including members of The Telegraph,  CESC, Calcutta Municipal Corporation and student reporters  associated with The Telegraph in Schools, did the  rounds of the participating pandals.  They had the full cooperation  of the committee members who had enrolled for this first-time  self-assessment, which seeks to rekindle the spirit of  the Pujas that sometimes is overshadowed by gimmicks and  grandeur. It is a really wonderful concept,  feels Shyamal Choudhury, puja committee president of Jagaran  Club. This is more than just another prize. The Selimpur  club was impressed with the attention to safety precautions  and ambience.  Everything was carefully inspected,  says Choudhury, who would like to participate in the True  Spirit Puja next year. If they do make it to the final list  of star pujas or the ultimate salute  the True Spirit Model  Puja  Jagaran Club hopes to use the grant to build a free  library and clinic. The judges were equally impressed  with the level of awareness that seemed to have spread to  most committees. We have received cooperation from all  committees, says S.N. Sen, manager, main systems, CESC.  Most of them have tried to comply with safety norms, make  the proper electricity arrangements and keep an ambulance  ready, adds Sen. At Barisha Srishti, dust is at  a minimum, with terracotta tiles lining the floor of the  pandal ensuring visitors do not kick up a storm.  We have our own ambulance ready  at all times. Fire-fighting equipment is at hand, explains  P.K. Roy, puja committee vice-president. Dustbins have been  placed at several corners of the no-smoking pandal. The results of the initiative  will be announced on Ashtami evening. But till then, committees  are happy just having a chance to boast of the traditional   rather than the trendy  for a change.

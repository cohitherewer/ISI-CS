 Thursday, December 11, 2003 				 Court rap for nine-month rain check 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Wednesday came down heavily on mayor Subrata Mukherjee for filing an affidavit stating that he intended to carry out a court order within nine months of receiving the work study report.																								The division bench of Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee refused to accept the mayors affidavit on Wednesday. I came to know that mayor Mukherjee is ready to go to jail but will not obey the court order. Does he know that he will lose the right to act as the city mayor if the court sentences him to jail for three months? Chief Justice Mathur asked the civic lawyer during the hearing of the case.																								Mukherjee faces contempt proceedings following a petition by three casual labourers, alleging that the civic body was not giving them permanent posts in spite of court directives. 																								Mukherjee told the court last week that the civic body was not in a position to bear the extra load. The court granted him time to review the situation. But on Monday, he filed two separate affidavits, saying that the court order would be obeyed within nine months of receiving the work study report.

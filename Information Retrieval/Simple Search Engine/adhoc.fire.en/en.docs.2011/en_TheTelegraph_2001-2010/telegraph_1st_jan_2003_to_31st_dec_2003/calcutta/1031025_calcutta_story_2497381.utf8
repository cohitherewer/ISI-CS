 Saturday, October 25, 2003 				 CID scan on hospital staff
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) are zeroing in on a section of low-level employees of Howrah State General Hospital, whose negligence was responsible for the disappearance of Santosh Hela, a diarrhoea patient later found dead near the hospital vat. The investigators also found a nexus between the local country liquor traders and the group-D staff.																								Hela left his ward last Sunday night and his body was found lying on the ground floor of the hospital. Later, the post-mortem report revealed that he was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and a liquid substance was found in his stomach.																								Initially, the hospital authorities had no idea about Helas identity when they found his body. It was kept in the morgue and recorded as unidentified. But one of the hospital employees who knew Hela identified the body.																								The CID has drawn up a list of the employees who had been on duty when Hela disappeared. Initially, we thought he had left his room alone and gone downstairs. But now it seems there were a number of employees who were aware of his disappearance, said a CID official.																								We have interrogated a number of employees who said they noticed Helas bed empty around 9 pm on Sunday. But it has put another question mark on the role of the hospital authorities, said the official. The complaint was lodged on Monday, after Helas body was found. The hospital authorities should have informed the local police station on Sunday, as soon as they noticed Hela missing, added the sleuth on the case.

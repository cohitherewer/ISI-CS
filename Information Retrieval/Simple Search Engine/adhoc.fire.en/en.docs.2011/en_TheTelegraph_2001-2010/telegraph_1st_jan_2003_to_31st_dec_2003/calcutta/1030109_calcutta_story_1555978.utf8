 Thursday, January 09, 2003 				 Cops unaware of killer dog shift decision
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Two of the killer dogs, chained to the wall of a room in the factory, photographed through the glass panes of a window. Picture by Amit Datta																								The four killer dogs  three Dobermanns and a Rottweiler  that tore apart 22-year-old worker Anup Ghosh at a mineral water factory in Barasat last month, will soon be shifted elsewhere.																								This was disclosed by Sanjiv Sarkar, legal consultant to factory-owner Sudipta Sen, absconding since the gory incident. The factory management has handed over Rs 3 lakh to Anups family.																								Chained to an iron rod sticking out of the wall of a dingy room inside the factory for over a month, the starved canines look weak and lie in their own filth.																								A manager of the factory, not wishing to be named, said on Wednesday: We had appealed to the district administration to save the dogs, as the police were not taking proper care. The sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Barasat granted us permission to shift the dogs today, and we will shift the animals soon.																								Officials of Barasat police station were not even aware of the development, though. They failed to explain how the representatives of the management could enter the factory premises despite a magisterial order against it.																								Investigating officer R. Kundu groped for an excuse when asked how the factorys manager and the lawyer went inside. They belong to the factory, so they can enter, he blurted out.																								SDPO Barasat Bhuvan Mondal said he was not aware of the permission granted by the SDO to shift the dogs. I am not aware of such a move. The factory is closed since its worker Anup was attacked and killed by the dogs on the premises on December 3. As far as I know, the dogs can only be taken out after the case is settled, Mondal said.																								The legal adviser to the owner said: We have settled with the district administration the issue of the factory closure. We will reopen it soon. Even though Sen is still absconding, we have a good management and can resume operations. The case relating to the death of the worker can be settled in court.																								Sarkar said that the company management handed over Rs 50,000 in cash and Rs 2.5 lakh by demand draft to Anups father, Amar Ghosh, as compensation. 																								Meanwhile, the local unit of Citu is staging demonstrations and meetings outside the gate, saying the factory cant be reopened without consulting them.

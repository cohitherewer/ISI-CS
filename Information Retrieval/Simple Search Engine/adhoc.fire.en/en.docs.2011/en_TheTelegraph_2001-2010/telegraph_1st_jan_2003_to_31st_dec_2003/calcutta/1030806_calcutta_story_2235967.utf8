	Rash driving by private buses during rush hours is on the  rise. Recently, I was witness to an accident while travelling  in a bus on route 46. While racing with another bus, the  driver applied the brakes all of a sudden. One of the passengers  fell and was seriously injured. He had to be rushed to a  nursing home. Such incidents keep on happening but bus drivers  are indifferent to our plight.

	Several water-borne diseases, especially skin-related ones,  break out during monsoon as the quality of water supplied  deteriorates. The Corporation should take steps to purify  the water.

	It must be mandatory for all minibuses to reserve some  seats for women. This will particularly benefit elderly  women who face a lot of hardships while travelling in minibuses.

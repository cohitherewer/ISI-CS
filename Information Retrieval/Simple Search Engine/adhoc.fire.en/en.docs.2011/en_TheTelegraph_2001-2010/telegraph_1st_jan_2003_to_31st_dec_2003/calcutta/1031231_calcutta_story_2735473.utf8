 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Seven-day grace for paying scooter tax
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government on Tuesday extended the deadline for payment of tax on two-wheelers from December 31 to January 7, 2004. The transport departments decision comes in the wake of a high court order, which allowed five petitioners seven days extra time after the due date of December 31 for paying the tax.																								Five two-wheeler owners from the city had moved the court, challenging the government order for collecting a life-time 15-year tax on all two-wheelers. The court in its directive said the petitioners need not pay tax till January 7, by which time the court will hear the case.																								At Writers Buildings, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said the high court had allowed seven days grace only to the five petitioners but the government had extended it to all two-wheeler owners. I appeal to all two-wheeler owners who have not yet paid the tax to pay it within January 7 to avoid being penalised, the minister said.																								According to the new tax structure, two-wheeler owners will have to pay tax only once, covering 15 years. The amount of tax already paid would be adjusted. A penalty of 100 per cent of the tax will be charged if it is not paid within the deadline.																								Transport department officials said the lifespan of a two-wheeler is about 15 years. Chakraborty said the government had no plan to revoke the new tax structure. 																								We have introduced one-time, five-year tax for four-wheelers and lifetime tax for two-wheelers for the benefit of both the government and vehicle-owners. Thereby, a huge amount will be credited to the transport department. Owners, too, wont have to run to the PVD office every year. Besides, vehicle-owners will get a discount, he said.

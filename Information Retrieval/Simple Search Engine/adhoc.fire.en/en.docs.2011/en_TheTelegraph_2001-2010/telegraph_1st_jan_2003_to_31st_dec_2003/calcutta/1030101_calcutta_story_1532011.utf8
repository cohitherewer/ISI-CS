The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 Coldest 31st in five years
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta partied through Tuesday, the coldest New Years eve in five years. The weatherman said the mercury dipped to 12.2 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. The coldest New Years eve in the past four decades was in 1970, when 10.3 degrees was recorded. 																								The morning was chilly on Tuesday, thanks to cold blasts from the north. The minimum temperatures in Calcuttas adjoining districts on Tuesday were even lower. Dum Dum recorded 9.8 degrees, Mogra 10.8 degrees and Diamond Harbour 11.4 degrees.																								However, the chill is unlikely to continue, as an upper-air cyclonic circulation is moving eastwards from western Madhya Pradesh, leading to the formation of a low-pressure area. As the low pressure approaches Bengal, the wind is likely to change direction and blow from the south-west from early Wednesday, raising the temperature.																								Weather officers said as the upper-air circulation  now a little over three kilometres above sea level and laden with altocumulous and altostratus types of clouds  swirls nearer to the city, it will attract moisture from the Bay of Bengal and transform into rain clouds.																								 This is likely to cause scattered and isolated light rain in Calcutta and elsewhere in south Bengal and the temperature is expected to go up during the next two or three days, said R.N. Goldar, deputy director-general of the regional meteorological centre in Alipore. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature is likely to be about 13 degrees.																								Goldar clarified that in the next two or three days, the wind will again start blowing from the north. Then the minimum temperature is likely to drop below what it was on Tuesday.

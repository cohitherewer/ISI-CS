The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, April 03, 2003 				 Mayor buries Davis Cup racquet
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A day after they clashed on backtax realisation and related issues, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and South Club ironed out their differences on Wednesday.																								The club management, after offering to settle the dues in full and comply with all other statutory obligations, went ahead to invite mayor Subrata Mukherjee to inaugurate the second round of India-New Zealand Davis Cup Asia Oceania Group I on Friday.																								Club president Rajat Majumdar said: We have told the CMC that we will settle the arrears of Rs 1.17 lakh in one go. On Wednesday morning, Majumdar called on the mayor with the invitation to the inauguration. He also requested Mukherjee to send the arrear bill, so the club could clear it immediately.																								It is a grand event (the Davis Cup tie). So, I have agreed to inaugurate it. Besides, South Club is a renowned institution, mayor Mukherjee said. He had set South Club less than 72 hours to renew the lease between the CMC and the club, failing which he threatened to block the Davis Cup tie. The lease had expired on December 31, 2000, said CMC records.																								Though the former Left Front board had decided to renew the lease at its mayor-in-council meeting for another term of 25 years, the decision had not been effected. Mukherjee slapped the demand notice on the club with a reminder that the lease had expired in 2000. The CMC had leased out the 10-bigha plot to the club in 1950 for 25 years. In 1975, it was renewed for another 25 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, August 01, 2003 				 Enter, B-school twin
 															- Delhi institute-Mission campus at Agarpara A STAFF REPORTER																								From Joka to Agarpara. The premier one is on the southern fringes of the city and in a years time, Calcutta will have another B-school, this time on the northern fringes. Delhi-based management school International Management Institute of India (IMI) has joined hands with the Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission to set up the Vivekananda School of Management at Agarpara, in North 24-Parganas.																								We always wanted to have some presence in this part of the country, as we had set up the institute in Delhi with the help of corporates from Calcutta. Besides, around 30 to 40 per cent of our students come from this region, explained Nitish Sengupta, director-general, IMI. 																								As of now, IMIs plans for Calcutta include a two-year, full-time management programme by July 2004, and a three-year evening programme for working executives starting this year. The evening programme will be conducted from its city office on Ripon Street. 																								The bureaucrat-turned-politician has already held preliminary discussions with Swami Nityananda of Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission and will be in town next week to seal the deal.																								We have recently bought a 30-bigha plot on BT Road for the campus. Though the infrastructure will be ours, the other responsibilities, like syllabus, faculty, affiliation and placement of students, will be completely managed by IMI, explained Swami Nityananda on Thursday.																								Though the decision on the mode of selection of students  conducted on the basis of the Common Admission Test (CAT) in IMI Delhi  is yet to be finalised, the promoters are keen on an all-India character for the institute. There wont be any compromise on quality, assured Sengupta. 																								IMI is rated among the leading B-schools in the country, and has tie-ups with institutes like Manchester Business School and IMD Geneva. The institute will offer much more than management tips. Students will be exposed to value-based education, which will help in their development as well-rounded managers and good human beings, said Swami Nityananda. The students should know about their country and its rich heritage.

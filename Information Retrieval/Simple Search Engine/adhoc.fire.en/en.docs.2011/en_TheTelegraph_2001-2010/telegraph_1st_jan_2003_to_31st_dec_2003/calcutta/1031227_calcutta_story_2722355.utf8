 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Murder maid held in hut with loot 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								At the crack of dawn on Thursday, she had murdered a 52-year-old housewife in a New Alipore apartment and fled with plastic carrybags full of cash and ornaments. By Friday morning, she had confessed to her crime of greed to cops who caught up with her at Harinbari village, in the Sunderbans.																								The chase  from a plush New Alipore flat to a mud hut in a remote island under the Sagar police station  ended on Friday with the arrest of Rina Bar, the domestic help who killed her employer Gayatri Singhal. A part of the booty was also recovered.																								Rinas sister Tina was also picked up for interrogation. Officers found both sisters at home, around 140 km from the city, in South 24-Parganas, said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, south division.																								Residents of Neelachal Apartment had found Gayatris body on Thursday morning with her throat slit and a wound on the back of her head. Her husband and son were out of town.																								The last one to see Rina was the driver, Mahadev Ram, who dropped her to a house in New Alipores D block, where her sister worked as a domestic help, said an official of New Alipore police station. This was the vital clue. Police tracked down one of Rinas relatives and picked up the Sagar trail. Around 2.30 pm on Thursday, a team of officers left for Harinbari. We sought help from Sagar police station and raided Rinas house. But there was no one except her old father, Sharma added.																								Early on Friday the police team was tipped off about Rina returning home. We raided the house and found both the sisters, said Sharma. Rina led police to the spot where she had hidden part of the jewellery and cash. We found Rs 70,000 and ornaments weighing 500 gm, said Sharma, adding that Rina would reach the city late on Friday.																								We will take her back to the scene of the crime and recreate the murder, said Sharma. Preliminary investigations suggest that Gayatri Singhal was murdered in her sleep.																								City police have reiterated the guidelines laid down for recruiting domestic help: Ensure that the domestic  help is referred by a reliable person Check their antecedents Ask for a passport photograph  and residential address. Send a copy to the local police  station If the domestic help is  from a distant district, ask police to check the antecedents.

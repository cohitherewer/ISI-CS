 																											- Underground sewer lines choked by refuse from household pipes A STAFF REPORTER																								Sewer lines in Salt Lake are under threat of a major infrastructural problem. And residents of the township are largely to be blamed, say Bidhannagar Municipality officials.																								A number of residents have thrown the underground outlet system into jeopardy by connecting their drainage pipes with the sewer lines. Filth from the sewers, choked with refuse from the drainage lines, is spilling over on to the roads as a result.																								While scooping out refuse from the sewers, civic workers found a lot of drainage waste mixed in it, which is possible only if the drainage lines are connected with the sewer lines. The rainwater, supposed to pass through the drainage line, is now flowing into the sewers, an official of Bidhannagar Municipality explained.																								Several residents of Salt Lake, knowingly or unknowingly, have connected their drainage outlets with the sewer lines. This will lead to a severe infrastructural problem during the monsoon, said Ramesh Bar, chairman-in-council, sewerage and drainage, of Bidhannagar Municipality. This is illegal and unfortunate. We are planning to slap fines on those who are continuing with this practice, Bar added.																								Sewer lines in the township have choked in several places after the monsoon set in, pushing the filth on to the roads. The problem is acute in Sectors I, II and III, and may soon snowball into a major infrastuctural hassle, said ward 17s CPM councillor Chandan Ghosh. 																								The rest of the year, we have to operate the sewerage pumps for three hours, but now, they are on for more than 12 hours. Water pressure in the sewer lines has increased manifold, said Dilip Gupta, executive engineer of the municipality. During the rains, the drainage lines usually overflow. But in Salt Lake, sewer lines are overflowing instead, an engineer of the municipality said. It is surprising, as there has been no significant rise in the townships population over the past few months, which might have exerted the sewer system.																								The civic authorities, however, admitted that deposition of silt in the sewer lines could be another cause for the spillover.

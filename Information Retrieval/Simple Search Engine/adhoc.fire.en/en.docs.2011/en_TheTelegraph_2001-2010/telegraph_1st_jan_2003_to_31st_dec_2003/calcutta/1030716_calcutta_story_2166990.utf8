 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The Council for Higher Secondary (HS) Education handed over a cheque for Rs 50,000 as compensation to a student on Tuesday, for harassing him by awarding wrong marks in a paper in HS 2002. 																								The lawyer for the Council, Ranajit Chatterjee, handed the cheque to the petitioners counsel in the court of Justice Barin Ghosh, who had imposed the fine. 																								Sheikh Sirajul Islam, who had appeared for HS 2002 from Nabab Bahadur Higher Secondary School, in Murshidabad, received seven marks in the Arabic Paper II. In other subjects, he got more than 50 per cent.																								Sirajul applied for a review of the answer-script, but the marks remained unaltered. He then filed a case in Calcutta High Court. 																								When the answer-script was brought before the court, the judge ordered the Council authorities to have the paper reassessed by two lecturers of Arabic language of Calcutta University. Accordingly, the Council sent the paper to the university for reassessment.																								Examining the paper, both lecturers felt that Sirajul should have been awarded 67 marks. 																								The observation made by the lecturers prompted the judge to pass an order asking the Council to identify the head-examiner and the cause behind the granting of wrong marks to the student.																								Later, it was revealed that the head-examiner had awarded wrong marks to the student out of a personal grudge. He, allegedly, had an old rivalry with Sirajuls father.																								The judge asked the Council to pay a compensation of Rs 50,000 to the petitioner and realise the same amount from the salary of the head-examiner concerned. 																								The judge also asked the Council authorities to issue a fresh marksheet to Sirajul as soon as possible.

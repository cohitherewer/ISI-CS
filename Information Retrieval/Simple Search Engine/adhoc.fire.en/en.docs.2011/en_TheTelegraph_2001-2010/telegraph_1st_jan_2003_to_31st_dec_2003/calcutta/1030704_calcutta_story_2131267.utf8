																																																		Three persons were robbed of their belongings on Wednesday night after four men hijacked a taxi. The miscreants hailed Shankar Adhikaris taxi near National Library in Alipore around 9 pm. They pleaded with him to be dropped off at Esplanade. Adhikari was speeding down Red Road when he felt a revolver barrel at his neck. Adhikaris pockets were emptied of Rs 800, his earnings of the past two days, and he was thrown out. 																																																								ne of the men took the wheel and they set out north. The first stop was Shyampukur at 10 pm, where the driver asked bystanders if anyone wanted to be dropped further north towards Baranagar. The other three youths pretended to be passengers. The car drove down narrow bylanes towards Sinthee. A passenger, Kedarnath Jha, became increasingly nervous and asked why the driver was taking that route. Suddenly, one co-passenger pointed a revolver at him, while another grabbed his bag containing Rs 15,000. Jha tried to resist, but he was bundled out of the car. The carjackers then drove towards the Shyambazar five-point crossing and sought out another passenger, Rajesh Das, headed for Dum Dum. Das had only Rs 350 with him. He was deprived of the cash before being thrown out. It was nearly 10.30 pm when Jha lodged a complaint with the nearest police station. The Lalbazar control room was alerted. The men could not be traced, said DC, DD-I, Soumen Mitra.

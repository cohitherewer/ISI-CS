 Sunday, November 30, 2003 				 Two die as bus in race overturns
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two persons were killed after a minibus turned turtle on Bhupen Bose Avenue in the Shyampukur police station area on Saturday evening. Ten people were injured. 																								Police said two unidentified men, in their 50s, died on the spot. The injured, including a woman, were admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. The condition of one passenger was stated to be critical.																								The minibus on the Belghoria-Howrah fire station route was trying to overtake another bus when it skidded and overturned near Shyam Park at around 8 pm. A probe had been ordered, said S.K. Ganguly, additional commissioner of police, north division I.																								Four fire tenders and two cranes were called into service and the bus was removed in about half an hour. One of the bodies was stuck under the bus. We have seized the bus and filed a case, Ganguly said. Traffic was diverted for around half an hour in the area, he added.																								The minibus, coming from Howrah, was severely damaged. We heard a noise and saw the minibus overturned near the road divider, said a shop-owner. Local people and students of Maharaja Manindra College, in the neighbourhood, rushed to the spot and helped police and firemen in the rescue operation. 																								Passersby smashed the windows of the minibus and pulled out the injured passengers. Some of them were bleeding profusely. A mans legs were badly damaged, said a member of the rescue team. 																								Without help from local people, it would have been difficult to rescue the passengers so fast, a police officer said.																								The injured were rushed to hospital in taxis and police vehicles. The condition of Biswanath Saha, whose legs were fractured, is critical. Sheela Jaiswal is the only woman among the injured, the officer added.																								Police are yet to trace the minibus driver. A probe is on to find whether he has fled or is among the dead or the injured, said an official of Shyampukur police station.																								The minibus, impounded by the police, had blood stains all over. Belongings of the passengers were strewn all around and seats lay broken. It was horrifying to hear the injured cry for help and see the dead lying in a pool of blood, said Pradip De, a witness.																								Residents of the area alleged that vehicles running at high speeds caused frequent mishaps on the stretch.

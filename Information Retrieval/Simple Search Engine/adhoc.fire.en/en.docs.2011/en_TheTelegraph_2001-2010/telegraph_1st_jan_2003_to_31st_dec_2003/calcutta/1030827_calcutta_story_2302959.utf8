The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, August 27, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									Recently, a relative of mine was admitted to the cardiology ward of SSKM Hospital. My memories of the place still haunt me. There was a power cut at the hospital on August 11, leading to pitch darkness in the intensive care unit. If this was not enough, an operation was under way in the OT. Even that, I noticed, had stopped midway. The door of the OT was thrown ajar and the surgeon was pacing up and down the corridor in his green apron. I peeped in and saw a single candle flickering at one end of the room and someone using a newspaper as a fan to bring some comfort to the patient on the table. So much for healthcare in a showpiece state hospital!				 																																									Saurav, Howrah.				 																																									Jhamapukur Park in north Calcutta used to be a green corner in the congested locality. But lack of maintenance has taken a toll on the park. Puddles have formed all over the ground, which becomes slushy during the monsoon. Children cant play here anymore.

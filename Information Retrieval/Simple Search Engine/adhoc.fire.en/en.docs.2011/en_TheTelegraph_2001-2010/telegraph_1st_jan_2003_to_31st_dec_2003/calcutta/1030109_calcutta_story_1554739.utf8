The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, January 09, 2003 				 On campus, the Milieu matters most
 															- Presidency SFI lines up pre-poll annual fest with items reflecting decadent West SUNANDO SARKAR AND TAMAL SENGUPTA 																								If you cant beat them, join them. The Students Federation of India (SFI) seems to have abandoned any plans of changing the 186-year-old Presidency College, where it formed the union for the first time last year. Instead, the students wing of the states ruling party is now joining the Presidency bandwagon by planning a binge  costing lakhs and involving what it has termed decadent culture all these years  for the colleges annual fest. Presidency College SFI leaders told Metro on Wednesday that they had the leaderships go-ahead on their party plans. We have been told that our Presidency strategy will be followed in other elite colleges, too, said SFI Presidency unit secretary Jad Mahmud.																								The strategy, according to SFI activists, will focus on making Milieu  the annual college festival preceding this years college elections by three weeks  a success in every respect. Milieu, which till last year was under the control of the anti-SFI students conglomeration (Independents Consolidation), has a reputation of playing to the field and SFI leaders say they will keep it that way.																								We have plans to spend several lakhs this year, asserted college general secretary Sujoy Ray. The sponsors include the same range which have always come flocking to the College Street institution  soft-drink giants and multinational corps selling mobile phones and other gizmos.																								The programme, too, will feature the usual stuff, activists disclosed. Though, like every year, folk music and Eastern classical music will make up a part, all eyes will definitely be on the Western and Bangla rock bands, they added. This cluster of programmes, featuring rock of various varieties, has always drawn the biggest crowds, said an SFI leader. We cant go against popular sentiment, he added, justifying the fact that the programmes would cater to every taste.																								On condition of anonymity, a section of SFI cadre admitted it was not feeling very comfortable swimming with the Presi tide, especially as the unit had, till the year before, decried the easy invasion of Western culture and blood-sucking MNCs via Milieu.																								But, with college union polls round the corner, the party was left with no option, they said, even as the SFI continues to campaign on other campuses against the mindless aping of the decadent West. We have no conflict here with other SFI units, Ray insisted. Rather, we have got the go-ahead to tailor the Milieu menu the Presidency way and told that our union would follow this model elsewhere (like Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University).																								Political opponents in the college, however, have found in this a handy poll tool. The SFI strategy (of saying something when in the Opposition and doing exactly the opposite when in power) only exposed the unions doublespeak, an Independents Consolidation leader said.

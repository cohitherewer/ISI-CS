The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, July 01, 2003  Drive to enjoy the ride, dont drive  people crazy
 Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta Two of the earliest driving instructions  given to this writer were diametrically opposite. The first  instruction was to assume that while on the road, everybody  except yours truly was blind, half-blind or colour-blind.  The lesson: you had to be cautious.  The second instruction was that  no matter what you did or did not, accidents were inevitable.  If you drove fast, the instructor had intoned, you were  likely to ram into others. But if you drove slowly, others  would ram into you. The lesson: you had a choice. Bad driving actually indicates  a host of maladies. For example, it would indicate poor  policing. It could also indicate poor road signs, bad roads  or the existence of other bad drivers who provoke you into  acts of madness.  Calcutta must rank rather low  if one takes into account the display of traffic and road  signs, making the city a nightmare for new residents and  people who drive in from outside. Reflective or fluorescent  signs are rare, that is if there is one, which makes driving  at night so much more difficult.  Traffic signs about U-turns and  one-ways are tucked away in inconspicuous corners and at  uneven heights, making city roads rather unfriendly and  encouraging bad driving. The last few years in this city  have convinced this writer that all vehicles should have  a mandatory message to remind drivers that while it is nice  to know that they enjoy driving, they surely would not like  to drive people crazy. We must keep our fingers crossed  and wait for some automobile-maker or agency to rank cities  on driving skills and quality. There are drivers who do their  window-shopping while driving. Too busy craning their neck  to the left or the right, they have no time to look into  the rear-view mirror as they slow down, accelerate and then  slow down again. If you have the misfortune to have fallen  behind them, and if you are not smart enough to change your  lane, you can do nothing better than gnash your teeth. Most  of the drivers use the rear-view mirror to look at themselves  and not the space behind them. Then there are those who want  to turn into a street to the right but insist on driving  on the left lane till the last minute and then swerve merrily  or nervously, depending on the luck of motorists following  them. Buses in this city often come to a dead stop right  in the middle of the road, giving little or no advance warning.  Overtaking from the left, sometimes to take a sharp U-turn,  using headlights on high beam and using their horns as if  their lives depended on them are some of the other rules  of the road here, which make driving difficult. There are reasons to believe that  there has been a sharp increase in road accidents. The non-fatal  accidents are, of course, never reported, though they can  set you back by ten or twenty thousand rupees and six weeks  in a plaster.  There would have been more accidents  too, but for the slowing down of traffic. In both New York  and London, not to speak of Los Angeles, there are stretches  where vehicles crawl at eight to 10 miles per hour.  Ironically, this must have been  the speed at which horse-drawn carriages crawled on Chowringhee  at the turn of the last century. We would like to suggest a simple  enough exercise to check bad or rash driving. Let the public  vehicles department (PVD) invite volunteers to travel incognito  in buses and file a comprehensive report on traffic violations  by the driver. Rather than allow a sergeant to stop the  bus at a static point, it would make more sense to record  driving behaviour over a longer period. Based on these reports,  PVD inspectors can then zero in and record the quality of  driving and traffic violations by the drivers concerned. Random and anonymous checks, with  a prominent citizen as witness, could result in reports  recommending fines, suspension or cancellation of licence.  People driving private cars, too, should be asked to get  their driving certified once every year by approved and  qualified instructors, who could be paid a fee by car-owners.  The police, in turn, could identify  and honour good drivers and publicise a random list of bad  drivers during the road safety week. Tailpiece: A Google search  yielded 7,93,000 entries on driving lessons, 142,000 sites  on driving jokes and 2,320,000 sites on bad driving.  Hope you enjoy the search more than driving down Calcutta  roads.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, May 30, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	The house of Lord Clive, in Dum Dum, becomes a den of crime  after dark. Some people have encroached on certain portions  of the dilapidated building, while hoodlums throng the premises  to gamble and drink. 
	 Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia.  
	I had deposited my phone bill on May 11, a day before the  due date. But for some unknown reasons, my telephone line  was disconnected on May 26. I rushed to the Behala office  of Calcutta Telephones the next day and recounted the incident  to the accounts officer. A few others who faced a similar  problem, too, joined me and demanded that our lines be restored.  The officer assured us that the lines would be restored  by the evening. I called up another official, who also assured  me of restoring the phone line. But when no action was taken  till May 28, I once again met the accounts officer, who  nonchalantly told me that he would look into the matter  on a priority basis. I am quite helpless in such a circumstance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, April 24, 2003 				 Attendance rules bent for Part II
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Teachers of government colleges are crying foul over the large number of discollegiate and non-collegiate students that has been allowed to appear for Calcutta University (CU) Part II examinations, now underway.																								Blaming the principals of some leading colleges for the blatant flouting of the universitys attendance rules, they have petitioned the state higher education department and CU vice-chancellor Asis Banerjee. The university recently issued a circular asking all colleges to provide details of students attendance every two months. 																								According to the new regulations, all colleges affiliated to CU will have to provide details of students  and teachers  attendance six times a year, instead of the earlier stipulation of annual accountability. 																								Teachers, however, say the rules have been reduced to a farce. Prinicipals are allowing students with attendance records much lower than stipulated to write the tests, alleged Nationalist Democratic Teachers Association college and university cell secretary Benoy Bhushan Chakraborty. 																								All-Bengal State Government College Teachers Association general secretary Pradip Datta echoed Chakraborty. Attendance, even in premier institutes, is way below the required level, he admitted, adding that his organisation, too, had sought official intervention in the problem.

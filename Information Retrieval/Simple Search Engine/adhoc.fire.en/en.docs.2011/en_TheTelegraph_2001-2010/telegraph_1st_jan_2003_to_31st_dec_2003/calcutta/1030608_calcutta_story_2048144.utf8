 A STAFF REPORTER																								After being ranked among the top five universities in the country, Jadavpur University (JU) now has another feather in its cap.																								Nippon Foundation, a Japanese non-profit organisation affiliated with the Japanese ministry of land, infrastructure and transport, has awarded its Ryoichi Sasawaka Young Leaders Fellowship Fund (SYLFF), a prestigious endowment fund of US $1 million, to the university. The endowment is being sponsored by the foundation for several Indian universities for promotion of studies in the humanities and social sciences.																								Our institution is the first among the 200-odd universities in the country to receive this prestigious endowment. It is a remarkable achievement, JU vice-chancellor Ashoke Nath Basu said on Saturday. The foundation conveyed its decision to the university in a faxed message on Friday night, said Basu. Since the Foundation introduced the fund in 1987, 66 universities in 44 countries have benefited by it.																								Going by the agreement signed between the foundation and the university, the annual interest of the capital fund will be used only to give fellowships to students, the vice-chancellor said. Initially, the fellowship will be offered to six students  one for a masters degree, two for an M.Phil and three for a Ph.D. The amount of the fellowship will vary between Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 a month. 																								A substantial amount from contingency funds will also be given to each of the students annually. The duration of the fellowships will vary between one and three years.																								The research projects under the fund will become operational from the 2004 academic session. The fellowships will be awarded only to students who intend to study issues relevant to contemporary Indian society.																								The vice-chancellor said this programme would enable students to visit SYLFF institutions in other countries, the expenses for the visits being borne by the endowment fund. This will give them a chance to strengthen their global understanding, he said.																								The university had to get the approval of the Central government as well as the Reserve Bank of India to avail of the foreign agency fund amounting to approximately Rs 4.7 crore. Dacoity foiled																								The city police foiled a dacoity in Lake Gardens late on Friday. Four dacoits were rounded up when they had assembled in the Lake area with plans to rob a house. Three revolvers and a chopper were recovered from them.

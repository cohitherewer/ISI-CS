 Wednesday, December 03, 2003 				 Jailbreak rocks Assembly members
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Jail and social welfare minister Biswanath Chowdhury faced the wrath of Opposition members in the Assembly on Tuesday over last months jailbreak at Dum Dum Central.																								During question hour, Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy demanded to know what action the minister had taken against the employees involved in the jailbreak. Roy was supported by Trinamul legislators Paras Dutta and Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, as well as Asim Bala and Abu Ayesh Mondal of the CPM. The MLAs expressed concern over the inadequate security arrangements in the prisons.																								Criminals are being supplied with special food, mobile phones and even liquor and drugs by a section of jail employees. The jailbreak at Dum Dum Central proves the callousness of the department, Roy said.																								Legislators Bala and Mondal demanded stern action against the persons who helped Sheikh Binod and five aides flee. They sought steps to prevent a recurrence of the incident.																								Chowdhury, in his reply, said he had already suspended seven jail employees and arrested them on charges of being involved in the getaway. The CID is conducting an inquiry into the jailbreak and the government will take action after receiving the report. I assure the House that the government will spare nobody found involved in the incident, the minister said.																								He told the House the government had taken a series of programmes to tighten security at jails, including the installation of sophisticated equipment.

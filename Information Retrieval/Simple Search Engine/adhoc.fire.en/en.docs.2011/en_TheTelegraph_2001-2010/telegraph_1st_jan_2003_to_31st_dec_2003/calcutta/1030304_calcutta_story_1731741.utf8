 Tuesday, March 04, 2003 				 Ansari plea for Varanasi trip stayed
 OUR BUREAU																								Aftab Ansari, main accused in the American Center attack case, prayed before a trial judge of the city sessions court on Monday that he be allowed to attend the last rites of his mother, who died in Varanasi. The judge asked him to produce his mothers death certificate, which Ansari failed to. The court has fixed March 10 to hear the issue.																								nCellphone role: Officials of the West Bengal Prison Directorate said on Monday that two more warders of Presidency jail were involved in giving a cellphone to Ansari. 																								Jailer Srikanta Mondal and three warders have already been suspended for alleged involvement. Minister for jails and social welfare Biswanath Chowdhury has ordered a probe, after jail officials and city detectives jointly conducted a raid in Ansaris cell last Monday night and stumbled upon the mobile phone under his mattress. Jail sources said the two warders assigned to oversee security arrangements first handed over the mobile to Ruplal Majumdar, who passed it on to Ansari against a hefty amount. 																								Majumdar, already suspended, was handed over to the detectives for interrogation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, November 20, 2003 				 Care facility for stomach, liver ailments
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Liver failure, acute pancreatitis, life-threatening gastro-intestinal bleeds or any other gastro-hepato emergencies can now be managed in a cohesive and comprehensive manner in the city, with the commissioning of the Institute of Gastroenterology amp; Endoscopy within the Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals campus on the EM Bypass.																								The 320-bed multi-speciality hospital will be ceremonially unveiled by vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat on Thursday, a year after its soft-launch.																								Apollo Hospitals Group chairman Prathap C. Reddy promised the group would keep on adding value to the Calcutta project, its first with an international partner. More than Rs 225 crore has been spent on this hospital and we are building another 11-floor facility adjacent to the main building for a 100-bed super-speciality oncology unit, he said.																								With over 6,250 international-quality hospital beds, Apollo hopes to contribute significantly to the imminent sunrise in health tourism. Our clinical governance compares with the best hospitals in the world, and the Calcutta hospital has also benchmarked itself to global standards, said Reddy.																								The focus, on Wednesday, was on the state-of-the-art gastroenterology institute, a brand new addition to the 300,000-sq-ft property, poised to make a major difference to the way stomach and liver ailments are treated in town.																								This is the only facility in the country with a dedicated gastro-enterology intensive care unit, with focused, state-of-the-art equipment to handle critical cases and emergencies, said chief gastroenterologist Mahesh K. Goenka. It will also be the only hospital in India to use the Steris system for disinfecting and cleaning endoscopes, to prevent cross-infection.																								According to Goenka, the institute will be the first private healthcare facility in the east with manometry to study gut motility disorders. We will also use MARS (molecular adsorbent recirculating system) for the first time in the city to treat liver failure. It is like a liver dialysis, which entails exchanging the whole blood albumin, he explained.																								With further upgradation of the hepatology segment of the institute, a liver transplantation unit is in the pipeline. While the dedicated ITU will be equipped with the latest technology and resources to deal with critically-ill patients like GI bleeding, jaundice-induced coma and liver failure, there will be round-the-clock emergency services, daily outpatient services, all diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopies and packages for stomach and liver diseases.																								The centre will also have speciality clinics from Monday through Saturday on pancreas, liver, colitis, dyspepsia, etc. We will have continuous support from allied departments like surgery, radiology, pathology and oncology, Goenka stressed.

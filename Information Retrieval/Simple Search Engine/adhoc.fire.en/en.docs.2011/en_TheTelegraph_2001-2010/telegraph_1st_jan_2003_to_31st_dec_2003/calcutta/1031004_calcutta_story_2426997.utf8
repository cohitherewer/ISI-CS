The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, October 04, 2003  Beyond the glitter, the crowning glory  Safety and security, traffic management  and help at hand, cleanliness and camaraderie CESC The  Telegraph True Spirit Puja was an effort not to be blinded  by the glitz, but to look beyond; to applaud sensitivity,  not sensationalism. A closer look at the leaders Picture Pabitra Das Picture by Aranya Sen A novel CESC-The Telegraph  endeavour  supported by PUBLIC and helped by the Calcutta  Municipal Corporation (CMC), the fire services department,  the pollution control board and student representatives  of The Telegraph in Schools  sought to shift the  spotlight away from the big and the bright and, instead,  focus on festive feel and community care. After long hours of intense scrutiny,  some efforts were cheered louder than the others. Topping  the ladder for marks with a mission was Shibmandir Sarbojanin  Durgotsav Committee, on Lake Temple Road. What won the  day for the puja near Menoka cinema was the sense of community  involvement and integration, evident from the smallest effort  (appointing local volunteers to first urge pandal-hoppers  not to litter, and if their pleas go unheard, to clean the  path to piety themselves every two hours), to the greater  good (running a school and a medical camp for the under-privileged). We are very proud to have been  picked, as it is a recognition of our effort to follow all  the puja norms laid down by the authorities, said an organiser  of Shibmandir, after it was crowned Model Puja 2003, making  it eligible for funding up to Rs 50,000 for a specific community  development project in its area. Next in line for the star trek   from five to two  was Ajeya Sanghati, on Haridevpurs  Mahatma Gandhi Road. Community participation was just  one of the plus points at this south Calcutta puja . Ajeya  Sanghati, which runs social service projects through the  year, won a 5-star rating also for its use of bio-degradable  material, use of non-toxic paints, and a comprehensive health  plan  ambulance, mini medical centre, insurance for pandal  and public With a 5-star in its puja kitty,  Ajeya proposes to start a unit to link local residents in  distress with specialist medical facilities, which could  well be supported by a True Spirit grant of up to Rs 25,000. Thats exactly the sum the Lake  Town Adibashibrinda Durga Puja Committee can also claim.  This puja was modelled after Orissas pata chitra,  featuring sand sculptures, with the Devi fashioned after  a Santhali Jagannath . But it was the exemplary traffic  management the organisers demonstrated that struck a chord  with the True Spirit Puja assessment panel. Located on a  busy road, they managed to keep both vehicles and pedestrians  flowing. Fire-fighting precautions, access for senior citizens  and waste disposal measures were also in place, ensuring  a place on the 5-star podium. This is just the beginning in  an effort to identify clean pujas with a social commitment  and hold them up as examples for others to follow, concluded  the panel of judges on Mahashtami.

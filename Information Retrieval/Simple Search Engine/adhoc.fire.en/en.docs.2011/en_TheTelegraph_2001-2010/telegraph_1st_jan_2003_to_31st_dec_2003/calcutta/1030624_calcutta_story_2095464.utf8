 Tuesday, June 24, 2003 				 Marital mess motive behind triple deaths
 A STAFF REPORTER																								One day, two incidents and three deaths  all mired in the mess of marriage. One ended with a young couple taking their lives three months into their marriage, the other found a constable committing suicide a fortnight before he was to tie the knot.																								Kamal Kumar Das, 28, and Aparna, 22, were found dead in their M.N.K. Road residence, in Baranagar, on Monday morning. Kamal apparently strangled Aparna with an electric wire before hanging himself from the ceiling.																								A few hours later, 29-year-old- Md Sultan Ali of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) leapt to his death from the roof of the Police Training School, beside SSKM Hospital. Ali, police said, was depressed after his marriage had been fixed with a girl he did not approve of.																								Tracking the first case, K. Jayraman, additional police superintendent of Barrackpore, said: The husband committed suicide after murdering his wife. But the motive behind the incident is yet to be ascertained. Marital problems might have been the cause.																								There was no ostensible economic reason behind the deaths, police said. Kamal had bought a new grocery shop and was planning to inaugurate it on the day of the Rathayatra. Besides, he was running a stationery-shop, which was doing well, said a police officer.																								Kamal had married Aparna, who hails from Ariadaha, on March 13. Initially, there seemed nothing wrong with their marriage, said an officer of Baranagar police station.																								Around 7 am on Monday, a relative of Kamal, who lives nearby, came knocking on his door. But finding the doors and windows locked from inside, he went away, said neighbour Rana Roy. Soumen Das, Kamals elder brother, later smashed open one of the windows, only to see Kamal hanging from the ceiling and Aparna lying on the floor.																								The police arrived and broke down the door. Das had used a gamchha (cloth towel) to hang himself. An electric wire was tied around the womans neck, police said.																								At the Police Training School, meanwhile, mystery shrouded the suicide of Md Sultan Ali. The RAF constable from Murshidabad was found dead behind the recreation building around 8.30 am. Ali was to have got married on July 11. According to sources, Ali was opposed to the marriage. 																								Alis relatives from Nayagram, in Murshidabad, came and met him on Sunday. He went to see them off at the Esplanade bus depot on Monday morning, returned to the School, went up to the roof and jumped off, said K.L. Tamta, DC (headquarters). 																								Ali did not want to marry this girl and had told his mother about his reservations, said one of his colleagues.

				 																																									Even while the city police observed Road Safety Week with great fanfare, minibuses and private buses continued driving recklessly. A week ago, I boarded a bus on route 215 from Maniktala. In a bid to overtake another bus, the driver crossed the permissible speed limit from Bagmari to Kankurgachhi and screeched to a halt, with a massive jerk, at the 3A bus stand. I got off the bus, along with a few co-passengers, and complained to a sergeant, who let the driver off after slapping a spot fine. But the driver threatened us in front of the sergeant, who, to my astonishment, didnt utter a word in protest. Its a pity such rogues can scare our law-enforcers.

Several renowned sweet shops across the city have started adding rice powder to the sweets. The practice has lowered the flavour and quality of some traditional items. The government should adopt certain quality control measures to retain the standard of sweets.				 																																									B.N. Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.

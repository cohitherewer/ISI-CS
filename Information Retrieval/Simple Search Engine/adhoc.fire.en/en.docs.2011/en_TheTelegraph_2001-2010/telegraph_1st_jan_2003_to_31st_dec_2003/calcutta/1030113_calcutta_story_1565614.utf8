The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 Journey to an idyllic world
																								All nature is but art, unknown to thee/ All chance, direction which thou canst not see;/ All discord, harmony, not understood/ All partial evil, universal good/ And spite of pride, in erring reasons spite/ One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right  Alexander Pope																								Only an artist with his inner perception can visualise the beauty inherent in all things, big and small. Dr Atish Sengupta, a decorated orthopaedic surgeon, has set aside his scalpel for the paintbrush. Currently in the city, this 65-year-old unassuming artist is holding his maiden exhibition in oil. Senguptas forte is landscape painting. During the course of his hectic career, he criss-crossed across three continents (Sydney, Ireland and the US) and clicked to his hearts content the virgin beauty of the places of his visit. Later, he sketched them. This self-taught artist draws in bright , vibrant colours and his landscapes seem to throb with life.																								When: Till January 21; 4 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery

 Thursday, January 30, 2003 				 Constable job for Bapi wife
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police have decided to draft Bapi Sens widow, Soma, into the force as a lady constable on compassionate grounds. Bapi, a traffic sergeant, had been badly beaten up on the last night of 2002 by some constables of the city police for protesting an incident of eve-teasing.																								According to senior officers at Lalbazar police headquarters, though the date has not been fixed so far, Soma will be officially recruited next month.																								K.L. Tamta, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, said it had not yet been decided where Soma would be posted. The basic paperwork has been completed. We will sort out the rest soon, Tamta added.																								Soma will have to appear for an interview next month. It will be a mere formality, as Soma has the requisite qualifications and also the physical fitness required for the job, said an officer. 																								Bapi, a sergeant of the Tollygunge Traffic Guard, laid down his life to save a woman from the clutches of five rogue colleagues on New Years eve. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had announced in Lalbazar that the state government would recruit Bapis wife and find her a place in the police force as soon as possible. Bhattacharjee had directed finance minister Asim Dasgupta to supervise the process.																								Senior police officers then initiated a move, under the supervision of commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty. We have already given her the insurance money. We have also formed a fund with the help of other policemen, said an official of the traffic department.																								Anup Sen, the sergeants elder brother, had received a letter from Lalbazar traffic department before Bapis shradh, asking Soma to meet deputy commissioner of traffic M.K. Singh, as soon as possible.																								Soma met commissioner Chakraborty at a condolence meet for Bapi in Rotary Sadan on January 25. The commissioner assured her she would have no problems joining as a constable. Soma agreed and wrote back, saying: I am ready to accept any kind of job in the force.																								The cheques, bank drafts and other financial help for Bapis family that have reached Lalbazar from all over the country and abroad will soon be handed over to Soma, officers said.

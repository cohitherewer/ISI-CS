 Monday, September 15, 2003 				 Stitched post
																								The letter killeth,/ But the spirit giveth life. True indeed. Letters are not just a mode of communication between the sender and the receiver, they are the messengers of the senders sentiments. Hae Soon Han is a young artist from Soegu Busan, South Korea. The current exhibition of her works depicts her foray into the world of textiles, needles and thread. Titled Stitched Post, these novel creations by Hae Soon touch on a very unusual subject  stitching postal stamps on envelopes made of cloth. She has used Kantha stitches extensively to embellish her works and her colour combinations are based on Indian and Korean textiles. Since long back, I had an Indian dream of vivid coloured textiles. And luckily, I have been here for several years. I consider this show to be a kind of memoir about my views of Indian colours and textiles.... She also adds, I wish these stitched post would bring you good feeling as same as when you read an unexpected lovely letter from someone.... This feeling persists long after viewing the show.																								 When: Till today; 10 am - 7 pm																								Where: Chemould Art Gallery, 																								 12F, Park Street

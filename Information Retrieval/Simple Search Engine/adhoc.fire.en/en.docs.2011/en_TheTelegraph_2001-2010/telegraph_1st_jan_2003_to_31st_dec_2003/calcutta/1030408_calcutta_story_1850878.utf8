 Tuesday, April 08, 2003 				 Natty thief clears out office vault
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police are desperately seeking a nattily-dressed, clean-shaven man in his mid-thirties for the simple reason that he is said to have broken into a fifth-floor office in a Park Street highrise on Sunday evening and walked off with over a lakh.																								Stunned executives of Conveyor and Ropeways Ltd discovered on Monday morning that the iron chest in their office, at 75C, Park Street, had been cleaned out. Fayaz Khan, officer-in-charge of Park Street police station, pegged the stolen amount at Rs 1.5 lakh.																								The office was shut on Sunday evening and the security guard had gone to the Mullickbazar vegetable market. A sweeper was cleaning the stairs when the well-dressed man strolled in, taking advantage of the unmanned gates.																								Police said the sweeper noticed the stranger trying to open the latch of the office main door with a steel rod, but was too drunk to protest. 																								The intruder warned the sweeper not to raise an alarm, entered the office, broke open the safe with the iron rod he was carrying, stole the money and left before the guard at the gate returned.																								Park Street police said they have got a fair idea about the man and is circulating his profile to neighbouring police stations. He is, they say, either close to a company official or a regular visitor or a former employee.																								We will conduct some raids in the area through Monday night to track down the culprit, said assistant commissioner of police B. Bhattacharya.

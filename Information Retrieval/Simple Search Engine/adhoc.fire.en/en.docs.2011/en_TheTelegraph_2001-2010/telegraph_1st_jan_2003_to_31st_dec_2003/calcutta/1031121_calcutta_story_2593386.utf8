The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, November 21, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The recent restrictions on vehicular movement at Dum Dum airport are troubling passengers. The authorities have banned the entry of private cars to the airport building to pick up passengers. As a result, one has to walk down the parking lot with the baggage and look for ones car. This becomes very difficult under the scorching summer sun or during a shower. With children, elderly people and sometimes even patients, it is even more difficult. The authorities must consider plugging the other loopholes in the security ring rather than cause problems for common people.				 																																									S.C. Sekhsaria,				 																																									Tollygunge.				 																																									I had gone to buy some National Savings Certificate papers from the Lake Town post office recently, but the stock was exhausted. The man at the counter told me to come a week later. I did so, but to my utter astonishment, the certificates had not yet been replenished. This is not expected of such an important public utility service.

Photography is truth... 																								  Jean Luc Godard																								Lensmen capture the essence of truth and beauty inherent in nature  all manifestations of our Creators great love for us. Ordinary mortals often overlook or ignore these beautiful moments and then it is left to the blessed souls, people endowed with special vision of the third eye to capture these sights for posterity. Photography is steadily gaining acceptance and eligibility as a medium of art and self-expression. Despite the technical aspects one needs to master the medium before taking up photography. One can always use the technical tools as handmaidens of creation. Foto Friends is an organisation set up by photographer-artists way back in 1982. In 1994, members of the organisation showcased their works that created quite a stir among connoisseurs in the city. The second exhibition was held in 2002. In the third annual exhibition being held now, 25 members of Foto Friends have put up their works. Exquisite landscapes of virgin territories and perfectly balanced photographs of events and profiles, both in colour and monochromes, are the highlights of this show.

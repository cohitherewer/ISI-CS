 Tuesday, October 07, 2003 					 					 It's Your Birthday So...				 Yukta Mookhey You have a logical mind with tremendous practical sense. You are honest, open and clean-hearted. You are artistic, observant and your intuition rarely fails you. You have the ability to translate your ideas into reality. You are humorous and fun to be with, well-liked by others because of your quiet and easy-going disposition.  Kusum Bhandari

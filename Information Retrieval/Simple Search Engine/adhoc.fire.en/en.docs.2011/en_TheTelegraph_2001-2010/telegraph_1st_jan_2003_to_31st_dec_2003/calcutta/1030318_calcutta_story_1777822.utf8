The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 Cloud cover spells wet Holi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcuttans may get soaked in more than just festive colours on Tuesday, with the weatherman forecasting a Norwester and rain.																								Deputy director-general of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore, R.N. Goldar, said on Monday that the sky is expected to remain cloudy during the next 24 hours due to a trough of low pressure, extending from central Madhya Pradesh across Chhattisgarh, north Orissa and south Bengal.																								Under its influence, there may be some local development of thunderclouds over the city and other parts of south Bengal. This may cause a storm and rain on Tuesday, he added.																								However, Goldar held out a ray of hope for revellers. A storm or a spell of rain, if any, is more likely to occur in the afternoon. The sky will stay generally cloudy and there may be a drizzle or two in the morning. That should not upset Holi plans, he said. 																								According to the Met office chief, a dark and heavy mass of thunderclouds had formed over the Sunderbans and the coastal areas on the Bangladesh side on Monday, which may lead to a squall there.																								Weather officials, however, said the cloud canopy over Calcutta over the past couple of days helped keep the mercury under control. The day temperature in the city on Monday remained at 28.1 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal. The day temperature on Tuesday is expected to remain at a comfortable level, an official said.																								The city received its first Norwester last Wednesday, when a storm hit north Calcutta and its neighbourhood at over 80 kph.

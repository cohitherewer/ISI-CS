The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, December 03, 2003  Anup Chatterjee								Member, mayor-in-council (roads), CMC																																							Why should shooting be banned on roads? Then all films will have to be shot in the jungles or in the mountains. But it is best to complete the shooting at night. Even otherwise, proper planning is needed so that people do not have to suffer in traffic jams. There should also be supervision so that the roads are not dirtied or damaged. The Corporation is in charge of the citys roads, but few producers approach us for permission. As long as they do not cause disruption, we do not pull them up for this. After all, shooting means good on-screen advertisement for Calcutta.

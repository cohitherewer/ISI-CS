 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 JU nod for World Bank aid
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Jadavpur University (JU) will accept part of the Rs 200-crore World Bank assistance offered to it by the state government. JU was recently selected one of the two major recipients of the aid, which the Centre earmarked for Bengal under the bank-sponsored technical education quality improvement programme. 																								Acting on a Central directive, the state government has selected JU and Bengal Engineering College (Deemed University) for the World Bank fund. Each will be allotted Rs 50 crore. 																								As proposed by the World Bank, the remaining Rs 100 crore will be distributed among 10 other lesser-known engineering institutions in the state that are yet to be selected. 																								We are ready to accept the Rs 50-crore assistance that the state government has offered us under the World Bank programme, Rajat Bandyopadhay, JU registrar, said on Thursday.																								The matter was raised at the varsitys executive council meeting, where members unanimously decided to accept the offer.																								University officials said owing to resistance from some teachers, the authorities took over a month to decide whether the assistance would be accepted or not. Some teachers were against the idea because the bank had laid down some questionable conditions for its beneficiaries. They said an implication of accepting the fund is that beneficiaries will gradually have to become financially self-reliant and stop taking aid from their respective state governments.																								The authorities should accept the assistance only after scrutinising the conditions set by the bank. About Rs 62 crore is required every year to run the institution. Almost the entire amount comes from government subsidy, pointed out Chittaranjan Mondal, general secretary, Jadavpur University Teachers Association.

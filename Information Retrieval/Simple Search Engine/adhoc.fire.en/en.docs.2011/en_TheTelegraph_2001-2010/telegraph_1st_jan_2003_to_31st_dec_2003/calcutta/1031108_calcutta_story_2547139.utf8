 Saturday, November 08, 2003 				 Saltlec seeks private push
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The government is inviting IT companies located in the long-neglected Saltlec (Salt Lake Electronics Complex) to help build its silicon dream.																								Unable to rustle up the funds to improve infrastructure in Sector V  with little help from the Salt Lake civic body, which collects crores in taxes without, allegedly, providing civic services  the urban development ministry hopes to enlist the help of private players.																								The blueprint includes repairing the main and inner roads, installing adequate street lighting, piped drinking water facilities, modern garbage clearance and clean-up and beautification of the area, including creation of parks and gardens.																								Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya finalised the Rs 7-crore project on Friday after a meeting with officers of his department and the CMDA.																								Improved infrastructure in Sector V is essential to attract new industries but, at the moment, we arent in a position to invest ourselves. So, we have decided to urge the industrial houses to contribute for the overall development of the area, said Bhattacharya. A meeting will be held next week with IT minister Manab Mukherjee and corporates about the project.																								Saltlec covers an area of 400-odd acres, of which 155 acres are owned by Webel and the rest by the urban development department. Webel has leased out plots to 175 units, while the urban development department has distributed plots to another 150.																								The sector, under the Salt Lake municipality, does not get any service from the civic body, said Webel managing director S.K. Mitra. They collect Rs seven to eight crore a year but spend virtually nothing. We urge the civic body to spend some of the tax they collect for the development of the sector, minister Bhattacharya added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, June 19, 2003 				 Dui-Taranga
																								Dui Taranga consists of two one-act plays. The first play is based on a short story by the renowned Hindi litterateur, Nirmal Verma. It is an introspection about human relationships. It is a womans journey into her past. Set amid a sombre mood, the play is about her search for warmth amid an ocean of loneliness. The second play, adapted from a short story by Nabaneeta Dev Sen, is a complete contrast to the earlier play. This one revolves around a writer trying frantically to meet the deadline for a magazine article. The wit and humour of the play go far beyond words. Dui Taranga reflects the intangible high and low of life through a constant search for the mysterious object called Love. This Choopkatha production is directed by Dolly Basu. This evenings show is being staged to celebrate the eighth anniversary of Choopkatha. Before the play, veteran theatreperson Kumar Roy will be honoured with Asit Mukhopadhyay Smarak Samman for outstanding contribution to theatre. Another thespian and comrade of Roy, Khaled Chowdhury, will do the honours.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

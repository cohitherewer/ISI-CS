The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, September 27, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Lata Mangeshkar You are a keen observer of the minutest of details. Your sense of humour sees you through the toughest of times. You work for a greater good, beyond personal needs. You are one of those who set out to achieve their dreams. You make a loyal and true friend. You have a sharp mind and quick understanding. You have the senses of an artist and appreciate beauty in all forms.  Kusum Bhandari

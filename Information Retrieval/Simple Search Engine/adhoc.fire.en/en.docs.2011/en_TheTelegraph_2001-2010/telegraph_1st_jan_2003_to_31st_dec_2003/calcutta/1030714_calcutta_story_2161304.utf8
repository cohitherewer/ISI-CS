																																																		Three persons were arrested for fraud on Saturday night from the Barrackpore railway reservation counter in North 24-Parganas and from Santragachhi, in Howrah. Naseeruddin Ahmed, 27, produced a railway pass at the Barrackpore reservation counter to book a seat on the Jodhpur Express. The counter clerk found the pass suspicious and informed the railway police. On interrogation, Ahmed revealed that two accomplices had, on fake passes, already boarded the Porbander Express heading for Surat. The police immediately called up the Howrah GRP and had the two arrested. They were identified as Rajesh Sharma and Ashish Sharma, travelling as a medical officer and a railway clerk. They named a travel agent who had issued them the passes for half of the scheduled fare. 																																																		A 40-year-old unidentified man was killed when a private bus knocked him down on Bowbazar Street on Sunday afternoon. The man was crossing the road when the accident occurred. He was rushed to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Police said the man was drunk.

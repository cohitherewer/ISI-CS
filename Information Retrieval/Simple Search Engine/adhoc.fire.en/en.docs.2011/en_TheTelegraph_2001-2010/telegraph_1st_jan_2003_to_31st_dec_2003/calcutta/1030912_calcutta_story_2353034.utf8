																								For an artist art is an expression of the self and a mode of communication with his viewers. However, what distinguishes an ordinary work of art from a masters canvas is not only in the selection or skillful delineation of subject or medium but rather a cerebral approach and execution. Bengal art has a rich tradition and its practitioners have often ventured into virgin territory, experimenting with form, style, subject et al and evolving new genres. The current exhibition showcases the works of four great masters: K.G. Subramanyan, Shyamal Dutta Roy, Suhas Roy and Sunil Das. K.G. Subramanyan is widely recognised as one of Indias major modern artists, an influential teacher, an astute writer on art and an authority on the folk, tribal and craft traditions of India. His major innovations include terracotta reliefs and reverse painting on glass. His works are distinguished by their remarkable diversity of themes, and a richness and flexibility of language. His works on display remind of the Japanese Haiku. After a long hiatus, Shyamal Dutta Roy has painted flowers with an impressionistic touch besides the usual human figures. Suhas Roy used to paint fascinating landscapes on glass, but for this show, he has painted landscapes on paper and they are a visual treat for art aficianados. Sunil Das the enfant terrible of contemporary Indian art who refuses to be dominated by convention and tradition. This exhibition showcases the maximum number of works among the four artists  17 horses and bulls, all very typical and distinctive of Das style.

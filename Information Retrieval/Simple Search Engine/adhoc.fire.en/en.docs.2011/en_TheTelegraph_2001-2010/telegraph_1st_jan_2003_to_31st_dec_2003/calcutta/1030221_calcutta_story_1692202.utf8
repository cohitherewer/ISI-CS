The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, February 21, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									A portion of APC Road, near Khanna cinema, becomes chaotic three days a week when the Harish Shah Market is held. Hawkers selling bed sheets, pillow covers and other household accessories squat on the pavements and often spill over on to the thoroughfare. Pedestrians are greatly inconvenienced by this. The market authorities must take steps to ensure smooth traffic in the area.				 																																									B.N. Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.				 																																									A huge quantity of water is wasted daily as faucets on several roadside water taps are missing. There is one such tap on College Street, near Presidency College. The waterworks department must check such waste.				 																																									Tathagata Kar,				 																																									Kailash Bose Street.				 																																									A parcel I recently received from an organisation in Mumbai was torn and soiled. Can I not blame the courier company for this?				 																																									Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																									Budge Budge.

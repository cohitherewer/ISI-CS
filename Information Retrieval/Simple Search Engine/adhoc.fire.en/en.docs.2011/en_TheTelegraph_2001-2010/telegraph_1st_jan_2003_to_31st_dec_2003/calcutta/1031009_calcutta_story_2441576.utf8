  Colour contest: A porter carrying  luggage at Howrah station. The stand taken by Jadavpur University authorities not to increase their post-graduate seats to accommodate surplus honours graduates of Calcutta University is quite reasonable (Varsities wage numbers war, Metro, Sept. 2). To maintain a high academic standard, the number of students of a university needs to be restricted. Both quality and quantity cannot stay side by side. Any compromise with quantity will definitely have an adverse effect on quality.  We are living in an era of competition. The slogan of the day is survival of the fittest. Each and every person or organisation is trying to prove his/its superiority with good performance. This is healthy and cannot be considered offensive. The allotment of funds to the universities depends on their scores in the University Grants Commission and National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) books.  JU has already been declared one of the five best universities in India by the Centre. It has also got a five-star rating from NAAC. The students prefer JU as better quality of education and other amenities are available there.  On the other hand, CU faces difficulties in maintaining a high academic standard due to its excessive number of students which needs to be curbed suitably. The surplus honours graduates of CU may be persuaded to move to other universities of West Bengal. JU should not be disturbed. Nothing should be done which may deteriorate its quality.  Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
 Behala.  Apropos the report Porter peace  at Howrah station (Metro, Sept. 1), there is no  denying the fact that political backing creates problems  everywhere. In view of the harassment that unlicensed porters  cause passengers, the authorities move to rein them in  is laudable.  Govinda Bakshi,
 Budge Budge.  Apropos the report Minister clean chit for arrested Bangla robber (Metro, Sept. 2), the minister claims he was unaware of the identity of the man as he had signed on a blank letterhead. But how can he evade responsibility on such a flimsy pretext?  Debaprasad Mukherjee,
 Nayapatty Road.  Apropos the report Boy run over in rush to reach exam hall (Metro, Sept. 3), it seems that there is so much pressure on students that their lives hang in the balance over an examination. It is upto the guardians to relieve them of the tension.  Piyal Mukherjee,
 Lake Town.  It is interesting to note that Bimal Mukherjee has been running a business over telephone from his bed for so many years (62 years in bed and busy, Metro, Sept. 1). He is an example for disabled people.  Rabindranath Kar,
 Sankar Ghosh Lane.  The report Numbers game: Score 100, get 99 (Metro, Sept. 4) shocked us. Will all students studying under either of the two boards be deprived of what they are really capable of? It is almost impossible to score full marks in most subjects, mathematics being the only exception. If this system comes into practice, students will be deprived of this distinction. When other boards have no objection in awarding full marks, what is wrong if the ICSE or the ISC does the same?  Kunal Roy,
 Howrah.  The report Model answers mar results (Metro, Sept. 4) is another pointer to the decline in the education system of West Bengal, which is making students shift to other states to pursue higher studies.  Ajit Kumar Chakraborty,
 Behala. The authorities of English-medium schools take in unemployed educated youth at nominal wages and exploit them (Salary stamp for teachers, Metro, Sept. 5). The school education department is doing the right thing in monitoring their salaries.  G. Bakshi,
 Budge Budge.  The report that the mayor has ordered the demolition of all roadside gardens reminds us of Mohd bin Tughlaqs regime (Stop sign on street gardens, Metro, Sept. 5). Why does he not concern himself with more pressing civic problems instead?  Mohan Lal Sarkar,
 Budge Budge.

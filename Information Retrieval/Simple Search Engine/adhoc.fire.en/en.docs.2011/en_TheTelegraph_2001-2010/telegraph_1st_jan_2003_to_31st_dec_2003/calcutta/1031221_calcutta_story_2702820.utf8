 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Tax-cut toast to tourism boost
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Here is some appetising news for all those who love to eat out, but are wary of the taxes they have to pay on the food bills.																								The Food and Drinks Federation (FDF)  representing employees of Calcuttas big restaurants  has, in a significant shift of stand, agreed to hiring of labour on a contract basis and doing away with variable dearness allowance.																								To help the state government, it has also decided to approach chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with a multi-point agenda to increase clientele by boosting tourism and working out a formula that requires customers to pay less tax on food and beverages.																								This is one of the ways to survive in the highly-competitive market and attract more clients. The proposal will be taken up soon with owners and the government, said FDF president Ramen Pandey.																								Currently, customers have to pay a 15 per cent government tax on food items, apart from a 10 per cent service charge that is levied by hotel-owners for distribution among the employer and the employees. The customer tips waiters, but this is ignored.																								During the meeting, FDF officials, including mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who is also the state Intuc president, had a discussion on urging the abolition of variable dearness allowance, which, according to them, was applicable decades ago when employees never got increments. Now the trade unions should bargain for increment on the basis of a companys profit and loss and not clamour for dearness allowance, Pandey added.																								The mayor, also the FDF chairman, said he was not averse to the idea of introducing contract jobs provided an employee was given some sort of social security. If a worker is awarded provident-fund benefits and ESI hospital coverage, there should be no problem, Mukherjee said. Suicide: Ranjit Sinha,  83, hanged himself from the ceiling-fan of his bedroom on  Saturday morning at his Purna Das Road residence, in the  Gariahat police station area. Sinha, a former central government  employee, was a bachelor living with his nephew. Metro services hit: Panic  gripped passengers of a Metro train on Saturday morning  when smoke started billowing from a coach. The train was  stopped at Park Street. Firemen doused the flames. The next  Down train was delayed by six minutes.

 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 Overseer burnt in mill mishap
 							 - Molten iron spills from overhead ladle on factory employee A STAFF REPORTER																								A man was critically injured inside the Texmaco factory at Belghoria on Monday when an overhead ladle carrying molten iron tipped on him around 8 am.																								Shyamal Ghosh (51), a supervisor of the factory, received 100 per cent burns and was admitted to the Kamarhati ESI Hospital. The crane operator, Jayprakash, received minor injuries and was released after first-aid.																								Ghosh, a supervisor, was on the night shift. The iron was being smelted and he was watching this from a furnace panel. Suddenly, the molten iron spilled over from the ladle and fell on the panel, instead of the furnace, a Texmaco officer said.																								The molten iron, at a temperature of about 1,600 degrees Celsius, completely burnt Ghosh. He was taken to the ESI Hospital in the company ambulance. Doctors said there was little hope of his survival. 																								The patient is in such a bad condition that we cannot refer him to any other hospital. We were not even able to administer any saline, doctors said.																								The panel on which Ghosh stood caught fire, officers said. Later, two fire tenders took an hour to put out the blaze.																								Colleagues of Ghosh, his wife and children as well as some company officers were present at the hospital till late in the evening. His family members are dumbfounded.																								There was resentment over the accident among some Texmaco workers. There was no ambulance driver when the accident occurred, they alleged. 																								Although today was the weekly holiday, and the supervisor was working overtime, there should have arrangements for an emergency, a Texmaco employee said. 																								The management denied the charge.																								The accident happened due to a technical error, said Belghorias sub-divisional police officer Basab Dasgupta. 																								Nobody has lodged any complaint against the factory management. There are at least six big companies in the area, apart from numerous small industries, including jute mills, foundries and biscuit companies, part of the industrial zone of North 24-Parganas																								Both the Intuc and the local CPM leadership have made familiar noises over inadequate safety measures in the factories.

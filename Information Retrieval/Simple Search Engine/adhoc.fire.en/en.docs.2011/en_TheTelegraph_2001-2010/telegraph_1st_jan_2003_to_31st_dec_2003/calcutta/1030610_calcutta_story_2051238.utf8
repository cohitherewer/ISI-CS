 Deborshi Barat																									That this guy aims to be as good as it gets. The Jack Nicholson devotee clearly has a talent for acting. But is equally  and confusingly -- clear that he has a penchant for public speaking and writing, too.																									If Guddu wanted to become a politician, no doubt. But would work for his personal ambition of becoming a media man or filmmaker or landing a job at the UN. The first-year student at the National University of Juridical Sciences has talked em all under the table. The one-time president of the St Xaviers school debate club, X-Calibre was adjudged the best speaker at the Frank Anthony Public School National Debate last year. Inter-school debates saw him bring home the gold on a regular basis, much like elocution competitions across the city.																									Gives way to the weaver when this 18-year-old picks up the pen. He had stood first in a competition run by The International Library of Poetry competition, which published his poem in its anthology, The Open Door. It also selected Deborshi, nominee for the 2002 International Poet of the Year, as one of 33 poets around the world to record a CD, The Sound of Poetry, and awarded him the Editors Choice. He has also written his way through Princeton University international play and poetry-writing contests.																									And into the limelight went this accidental actor, most recently seen as Launcelot Gobo in The Merchant of Venice, staged by Calcutta Club. Before Shakespeare, he tried his acting muscle out on Wilde in The Importance of Being Earnest. The common face at the British Council One Act Play Competition has anchored a few shows for Doordarshan and was in Stagecrafts M2G on a Roll and Mousetrap.																									Was chucked in favour of teamwork, when Deborshi won his leaders hat. This ardent quizzer and tennis player (before succumbing to an ankle injury) used to be the vice-president of the Leadership Training Service. Went for a student exchange programme with Belvedere College, Dublin, completing 60 hours of social work in Calcutta and Ireland.

 Tuesday, December 02, 2003 				 Rajarhat land papers sought
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Justice Arun Mitra of Calcutta High Court on Monday directed the government to submit all documents relating to the Rajarhat township (phase II) project on December 5, 2003. The order was passed on a plea by Imnat Ali Gaji and others, challenging the legality of the acquisition of their land for the project.																								Petitioners counsels Idris Ali and Sreemoyee Das told the court that a total of 4,500 families had already surrendered their land at a very low rate for Rajarhat phase I. 																								This time, 15,000 bighas owned by the petitioners are being acquired at nominal rates. A cottah of land in Rajarhat currently fetches Rs 1 lakh. But the government is paying only Rs 8,000 per cottah, the petitioners pointed out, demanding that they be paid the market rate for their land.

 Art and literature, music and dance,  religion and spirituality. Rita Bhimani found in the  holy city a confluence of activities in all these fields at  an institute Bimla Poddar in a class at Jnana Pravaha. (Above) The  music room at the institute  Journeying to varanasi has such  a varied set of compulsions for people who flock to this  unconquered city by the river that pathfinder and pilgrim,  sinner and saint, tourist and tramp alike get caught up  in multi-hued yatras. Some without end, others keeping  their inevitable trysts with immortality, salvation and  revelation. Templetown, university-city, tourist-mecca   Kashi, the Luminous, can be as terrifyingly chaotic as  it can be the ultimate resting place for seekers of peace  and illumination. Most people seem to take much more from  this holy city, though, than they give back to it. Which is why, when, about a fortnight  or so ago, an institution in Varanasi  Jnana Pravaha, a  Centre for Cultural Studies, launched a project to train  young Sanskrit scholars to perform the numerous rituals  and ceremonies that are an integral part of the Indian ethos  from birth to death, I rushed to see what it was all about.  And to get an endorsement of the fact that something concrete  was being given back to the city. And to the country. To get to the Samskara and Anusthana  Kendra in Meer Ghat at Varanasi, I trekked up through the  charmingly claustrophobic alleyways that are a hallmark  of the old city to find a historic family haveli,  (near the famous temple of Viswanath), that houses the centre  spawned by Jnana Pravaha.  As I went up the steep flight  of stairs, aided by a rope grouted into the wall, a unified  chant of youthful voices in recitation gave me the moral  push to climb the last few steps and enter a hall filled  with a remarkable sight. Ten boys, average age 15, in saffron  attire, earnestly memorising and practising the recitation  of the Vedas. Just the beginning of an intensive  three-year course that can be a re-engineering of the way  in which a group of priests can bring back the sanctity  of our multifarious rituals. Everything from Sanskrit grammar  and the knowledge of astrology and the basics of Indian  culture to the performance of vedic rites and karmkanda,  the consecration of images and deities, fixing of auspicious  moments and preparing horoscopes and training in rituals  and sacraments according to prescribed scriptures  the  course is intense and comprehensive. And each year, 10 students  will be added. Where do they all come from? Who  will pay for them? A totally residential course, funded  entirely by Jnana Pravaha, the Bari Kothi will be home to  these young brahmacharis. They will live, eat, chant,  learn and come out at the end of three years, polished and  pummelled into a practical priestdom to serve a society  in need of rituals that make sense, with ceremonial observances  in correct Vedic form. Where did it all begin? When a  young widow, based in Calcutta, learned the scriptures,  imbibed the love for art and music and grew and grew, until  the city could no longer be her dham. She felt she  had to give back something of her knowledge and her interest  in the preservation and promotion of Indian heritage to  the country. And that led her to succumb to the lure of  the holy of holies  Varanasi. Many of us in Calcutta gravitate  to a private, beautifully crafted evening of music and dance  at Gulab Bari, every spring, at Queens Park. Today more  than 1,500 lovers of music flock to this landmark event  at the invitation of the vector of this musical meld  Bimla  Poddar, an elegant lady dressed in white with her trademark  white coiffeured hair, quietly dominating proceedings. But it is in Varanasi that Bimla  Poddar really took complete charge of value-adding to its  cultural milieu, when she discovered an ideal spot on the  riverside, in full view of the magnificent Ramnagar fort  opposite. So, when Jnana Pravaha was established in 1996  on the banks of the Uttarvahini Ganga, it created a remarkable  turn of events. It facilitated the opening up of a cultural  hub for the enhancement of academic and spiritual pursuits  rooted in Indian tradition. But in the seven years since she  made her voyage of discovery and settled down there, two  most amazing structures  Praci and Pratici which make up  the whole concept of Jnana Pravaha  have transformed the  Varanasi landscape. Praci, where she lives and which houses  a yagnasala and a hostel for guest scholars, is a  multi-tiered structure with magnificently manicured lawns,  arjun and neem trees in plenty and hedged  by tulsi bushes.  The building called Pratici was  designed by Balkrishna Doshi, now well known to us in Calcutta  for his pathbreaking urban concepts at Udayan. Doshi created  an early cave architectural pattern in the building which  represents the ardhanarisvara concept and it affords  a panoramic view of the Ganga from every hall. Housed in  it are some remarkable treasures of Indian art and Kasi  culture where the rare collections have been personally  donated by brother-in-law Suresh Neotia, who was also Poddars  mentor in her early years when she visited archaeological  sites and museums in India and abroad. From Girija Devi  came the inputs for Indian classical music, and from Dr  Pradyot Bandopadhyay, the learning of Sanskrit followed  by reading the epics in their original. When you see the magnificent conference  and lecture hall with projection and classrooms facilities;  the richly stocked reference library on Indian arts, culture,  history, philosophy, archaeology and other subjects, the  computerised databank on art and an amphitheatre for performances  and other programmes, you understand the depths of learning  the founder underwent. And the lengths she is going to meet  all costs of running this institution from her own resources. With this fertile infrastructure,  the objectives of an institution like Jnana Pravaha are  able to flower in furthering the promotion, presentation  and publication of a vast span of subjects. Academically,  it has organised innumerable lectures, discourses, seminars,  workshops, demonstrations in art and literature, music and  dance, religion and spirituality. The seminars discuss everything  from pilgrimage tourism and Buddhism and Gandharva art to  reflections of the Vedas in Sanskrit literature,  Jaina contribution to Kasi, and go into the depths of manuscriptology.  The documentation, research and commitment is what makes  the whole institution of Jnana Pravaha a jewel not only  in the Varanasi crown, but also a force to reckon with at  a national and international level. The Samskara Kendra  caps the credibility further.  The academic roster stretches  into July 2004. Want a 24-week Indian culture orientation?  Or an international seminar on Indias perception through  Chinese travellers? Its all there waiting to be assimilated  on the banks of the Ganga, prescribed with eminence and  elegance.

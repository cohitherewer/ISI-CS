 Thursday, March 20, 2003 				 Police round up tease on wheels 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police seem to have their hands full cracking down on crimes against women. In yet another case of eve-teasing, 32-year-old Abdul Samad Khan was arrested for passing lewd remarks and trying to grab hold of a girl on Park Street on Tuesday morning.																								Earlier, on Sunday afternoon, a seven-year-old girl was molested by Haran Bag, her next-door neighbour. The night before, two youths  Mohammed Sohail and Tabraz Aslam Khan  harassed a Class X student of a reputed school while she was waiting with her parents to enter an eatery on Free School Street. And, last Tuesday, a television actress faced the same ordeal as she stepped out of an eatery on Sarat Bose Road. In all three cases, the accused were arrested.																								The latest in the series of crimes against women occurred near Allen Park, on Park Street. Shakespeare Sarani police station officer-in-charge Subrata Ghosh said Geeta Dey (name changed), a cashier of the Mother Diary milk-booth counter in Allen Park, was walking down Park Street to her office when Samad, on a motorcycle, crossed her path. It was about 6.15 am.																								Aaja meri jaan, main tujhe pyar karta hoon, he shouted at Geeta while trying to grab her. The girl stepped back and shouted for help. The anti-crime patrol of Shakespeare Sarani thana was on its morning round. Three policemen hemmed in Samad. They pinned him to the ground and took him into custody.																								Police said Samad hails from Afghanistan and lives in a rented apartment in Beniapukur. He is a dealer in woollen garments, officer-in-charge Ghosh said. Geeta lives with her family on New Park Street. She usually walks to the milk booth  a 15-minute distance from home  every morning, he added.																								Samad takes a morning ride on his motorcycle and spotted Geeta about a month ago. He began to follow her as she walked to work and often waved at her and blew her kisses, an officer said. Geeta would ignore him. The situation turned worse after Samad managed to get hold of the booths telephone number. He would call up often. An officer said: He would make obscene calls but never reveal his name.																								For the past week, Geeta noticed Samad following her every day, often on foot. She consulted her parents and decided to lodge a complaint with the police. We decided to step up patrolling in the area. The men were told to be in plain clothes to avoid being identified, Ghosh said. Samad was produced in court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody.

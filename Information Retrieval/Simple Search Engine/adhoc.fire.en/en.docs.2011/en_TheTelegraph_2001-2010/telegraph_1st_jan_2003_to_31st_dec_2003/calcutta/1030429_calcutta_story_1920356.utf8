The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, April 29, 2003 				 Bail scrapped in fake marriage ad case
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Monday cancelled the bail of a Salt Lake resident who had allegedly fabricated the academic and professional credentials of his son and managed to get a TV newscaster to marry the unemployed youth two years ago.																								With the bail originally granted by a lower court now standing cancelled, Samarendranath Bhattacharya can be arrested for misrepresenting his jobless son as a chartered accountant with a high income in a few matrimonial ads he had put out in a popular Bengali daily, seeking alliance from a beautiful and educated girl.																								The Tangra police had arrested Bhattacharya once after a complaint was lodged with them last year. But the latter had secured release on bail from a city court. When the matter came up for hearing, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah told the court about Bhattacharyas misleading matrimonial ads.																								Rabindra Nath Chakraborty of Tangra had responded to the advertisement. Subsequently, his daughter Sudeshna got married to Samarendras son Debabrata on August 28, 2000. Rabindranath had spent Rs 2 lakh on the wedding. A few months after the marriage, Sudeshna found that Debabrata was only a B.Com and held no fixed job.																								Sudeshna came down on her father-in-law for suppressing facts relating to his son. But her in-laws and husband began to torture her regularly. At last, Sudeshna walked out on her in-laws and lodged a complaint with Tangra police station.																								Samarendra was arrested last August, but the additional chief judicial magistrate of Sealdah granted him bail the same day. Sudeshna filed a case in the high court, demanding her father-in-laws bail be cancelled. 																								Dilip Dutta, Samarendras advocate, said his client would never leave Calcutta even if bail was granted. He assured the court that Samarendra would be available whenever and wherever summoned by police. 																								The public prosecutor opposed Duttas prayer and said the man was responsible for ruining a girls life. The accused was arrested under Section 467 of the IPC, a non-bailable section.

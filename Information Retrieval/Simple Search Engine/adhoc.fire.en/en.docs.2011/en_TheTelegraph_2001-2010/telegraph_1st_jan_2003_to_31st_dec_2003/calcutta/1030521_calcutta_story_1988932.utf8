 Wednesday, May 21, 2003 				 Bail plea of men freed in drug case
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A year ago, a lower court acquitted them of drug charges and allowed them to walk free. But the high court is yet to hear the bail petitions of the two accused. Tuesday saw the bail case for the free men coming up, but not being heard, as the lawyers failed to turn up.																								Mujibur Molla Malatipur and Bablu were arrested in May 1999 for their alleged involvement in a drug deal. After the Barasat court refused to grant them bail, counsel on behalf of the accused filed a bail plea in Calcutta High Court in March 2000. A division bench, presided over by Justice S.B. Roy, referred the matter to the second bench and requested the chief justice to send the matter to an appropriate bench.																								Three years later, the matter came up for hearing on Tuesday before the division bench of Justice A. Talukdar and Justice P. N. Sinha, but the lawyers were absent. The petitioners counsel later told Metro that the trial had already ended last year and the Barasat court had released the duo. When the persons are outside jail, how can their bail pleas be heard? he wondered.

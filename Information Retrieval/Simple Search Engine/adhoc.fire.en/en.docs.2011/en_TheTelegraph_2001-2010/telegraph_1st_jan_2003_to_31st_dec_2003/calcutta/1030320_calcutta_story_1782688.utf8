 Thursday, March 20, 2003 				 Youth beaten to death by Holi hoods
 A STAFF REPORTER																								He raised his voice against a group of youths trying to forcibly drench him in coloured water, and paid for the crime with his life.																								Twenty-eight-year-old Sanjay Roy was beaten to death at Sonarpur on Tuesday as he tried to resist violent Holi revellers. 																								Sanjays attackers beat him up mercilessly with rods, and fled the spot, leaving him unconscious.																								Later, neighbours rushed him to hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Local police have arrested five persons in this connection.																								According to the police, the incident occurred around 11 in the morning. Sanjay, known in his area as an introvert, was enjoying the revelries from a distance, when Robin Roy and his friends, residents of a nearby locality, entered the para. Some of them were drunk and walked menacingly up to him. Sensing trouble, Sanjay tried to run away, but was cornered by the miscreants.																								He politely told Robin he was not interested in playing with colours, but his request fell on deaf ears. As they sprinkled him with coloured water, Sanjay picked up a stick in self-defence and started flaying it around, said Rajesh Kumar Singh, additional superintendent of police (industrial).																								In his anxiety, he struck Robin on the head, Singh said. Seeing their leader hurt, Robins associates turned violent and pounced on Sanjay, according to an official of Sonarpur police station.																								After examining his wounds, police said the attackers had struck Sanjay on the head repeatedly. They even kicked and punched him. He screamed for help, but none present could muster enough courage to resist the violent and intoxicated aggressors, said the official.																								As soon as Sanjay fell unconscious, the criminals walked away. He was taken to the hospital, but had succumbed to his injuries on the way. 																								A large contingent of police personnel reached the spot and was greeted by agitated residents, who demanded immediate arrest of the assailants.																								Police later combed the area and arrested five persons in different localities. We are looking for the others who were involved in the brutal killing. Raids will continue till we track down all the culprits. All those arrested have been booked under murder charges, said additional superintendent Singh.																								In another incident, Poltu Mandal, a youngster, was gunned down at Mahestala. The assailants struck around midnight, when Poltu was returning home. He was shot from point-blank range and the bullet pierced his chest. 																								Later, police carried out a series of raids in the area and rounded up 12 persons.																								All the arrested have criminal records. We are also looking into the victims background to determine whether there was a history of any gang rivalry, said Singh.

	The traffic system is crippled during peak hours at the  Shyambazar five-point crossing every day. Marking a bus  bay in the area has not improved the situation at all.  Instead, the line of buses waiting to pick up passengers  has become even longer. This results in a bottleneck on  the crossing, and vehicles are stranded for at least half-an-hour.  Why isnt a flyover constructed in the area?  
	Sayan Ghosh, Bagbazar.  
	A traffic signal was installed at Salkia Chowrasta, in  Howrah, but the lights have never been operated till date.  It is sad to see our money go down the drain in this way. 
	 B.L. Chandak, Salkia.

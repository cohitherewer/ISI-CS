 Saturday, July 19, 2003 				 Kolaghat breakdown
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Large parts of the city and its adjoining areas experienced severe power cuts on Friday evening, after tube leaks in the boilers shut down two giant 210mw units at the Kolaghat power stattion. The shortfall in the CESC-served areas shot up to 150 mw in the evening peak hour.																								The shortfall in the SEB-supplied areas, including Salt Lake, rose to 450 mw. The power cuts lasted more than two hours. 																								However, in the districts, five to six hours of power cuts were reported. 																								A senior power department official held out no hope of the situation improving on Saturday. We expect to bring one of the units back on stream by Sunday evening. The situation is not likely to normalise before Monday, he said. The power cuts would be imposed by rotation.

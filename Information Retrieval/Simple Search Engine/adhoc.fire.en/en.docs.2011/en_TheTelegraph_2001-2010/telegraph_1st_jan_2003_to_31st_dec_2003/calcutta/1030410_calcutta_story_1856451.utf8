 Thursday, April 10, 2003 				 Pay Beltala at bank for tax token
 BARUN GHOSH																								Its a Puja bonus for car-owners. Come October, and they will be spared harassment at the hands of touts and even some officials at the Public Vehicles Departments (PVD) Beltala office. 																								For, they wont have to go to Lansdowne Road to pay road tax any more. Instead, they can drop into an enlisted nationalised or private bank to deposit cash or cheque, and get a receipt over the counter.																								The PVD is working on a proposal to tie up with four city-based nationalised and private banks, authorising them to accept taxes from nearly 900,000 vehicle-owners. We shall finalise the deal with eight or nine banks across the city in the next few days. They will accept the cash or cheques, against a minimum service charge. Vehicle-owners can even use credit cards for payment, said Prashant, PVD director and joint secretary, transport department, on Wednesday.																								Banks having several branches across the city were being preferred. Accordingly, deals are being worked out with SBI and UBI among the nationalised banks and ICCI and HDFC among private banks.																								Though the banks are asking for Rs 15 as service charges, we want to settle at a rate of Rs 5, Prashant said, adding that the move would not only ease the pressure on the PVD staff but also minimise harassment of car owners at the Beltala office. The enlisted banks will generate three copies of receipts, one for the vehicle-owner and another for the PVD. Till the tax token is received by the vehicle-owner by mail, the bank receipt can be used as a tax-token, Prashant added.

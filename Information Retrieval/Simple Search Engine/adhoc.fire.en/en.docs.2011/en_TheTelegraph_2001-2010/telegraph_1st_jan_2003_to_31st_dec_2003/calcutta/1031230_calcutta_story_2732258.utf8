The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Beyond Eden, a bit of home Match lost but hearts won
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT				 	 Shahid Afridi at one of the stalls set up by Pakistanis at the Industrial India Trade Fair on the Maidan. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Oi je Afridi, (Look, theres Afridi), screamed a crowd of college girls as a striking young man, in a flaming orange T-shirt and faded jeans, emerged from Al Sabah, a furniture stall set up by a Peshawar-based businessman.																								Shahid Afridi had failed at the Eden Gardens on Sunday, but on the Maidan on Monday  barely a few hundred metres away from the amphitheatre and 24 hours after bowing to his arch-rivals  the Pakistan-A skipper bowled em over.																								We are not here to play only cricket. Our tour also has a focus to develop relationships, smiled Afridi, a dasher on the pitch, dashing off it.																								The 18-member team visited the Pakistani corner of the trade fair, responding to the request of 30-odd traders from beyond the border now camping in Calcutta. And the spotlight was firmly on Afridi.																								This is the first time we are getting a chance to mingle with the people here, and we want to make the most of it, said the opening bat and leggie, busy obliging autograph-hunters  mostly young girls  with a smile.																								Captain Afridi, coach Naveed Anjum and manager Azhar H. Zaidi reached the fair ground at around 3.15 pm and the good word spread fast.																								The Pakistan pavilion, with 17 stalls, became the centre of attraction, as crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the first set of Pakistani cricketers on Indian soil for months.																								We invited them to visit us and they happily agreed, said Md Iqbal of Saleem Associates. 																								For the motley group of Pakistani traders, Monday afternoon was a chance to give their cricketers a feel of home away from home. 																								But the security cover played somewhat of a spoilsport. We had to hand them over packets of Hyderabadi biryani, as they were not allowed to sit and enjoy the food in the open, complained Iqbal and his friend Shafiq-ur-Rahaman.																								There was no stopping Afridi, however. Its a goodwill mission and keeping with the spirit of the tour, we are planning to visit a hospital, said the young all-rounder, before stopping to wave at a middle-aged woman, who shouted out to him from a distance: I love your game.																								But not everyone could catch Afridis eye and made do with the lesser names. I got Salman Bhutts autograph, said Chirag Seth, a Class V student of St Xaviers, at the fair with his mother.																								Led by the team manager Zaidi, some of the team-members  enjoying a fair bit of freedom after being confined in their hotel  went window-shopping and stall-hopping, keeping the rest waiting.																								We want more cricket to be played between India and Pakistan at the highest level That will be good for both the countries, signed off Afridi, before boarding the team bus and rolling on to the next goodwill destination on a tour where cricket was a game to be won or lost, but hearts had to be won.

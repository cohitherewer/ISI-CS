 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Cuffs for Maidan trade fair cooks
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A mela on the Maidan has cooked up a storm, with five persons being arrested on Monday from the greens for lighting up kerosene stoves and gas ovens, flouting a police bar order.																								Officers from Maidan police station rounded up the quintet on the penultimate day of the 17th Industrial India Trade Fair for allegedly cooking various food items in stalls on the Maidan.																								A complaint was lodged against the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI), which organises this fair, touted as a showcase for the governments initiative to industrialise Bengal.																								Police said the permission letter issued by the commissioner to the organisers clearly stated that food could not be cooked on the fair grounds.																								Earlier, a division bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Justice Ashoke Kumar Ganguly and Justice Soumitra Sen, had directed the public works department as well as Calcutta Police not to allow stall-holders and others to use open ovens and chullahs for cooking on a fair ground.																								The court had passed the order on the basis of a complaint filed by environment activist Subhash Dutta, alerting the administration to the dangers of cooking on the Maidan. 																								The court had also directed the authorities to take penal action against offenders.																								We had to take a firm stand after the high court order. We warned the Chamber repeatedly about this clause before granting them permission to host the fair, said an officer at Lalbazar.																								When contacted, BNCCI secretary D.D. Nag said: We are looking into the matter We will speak to the police about it.																								The crackdown on Monday followed a report filed by the fire services department. After examining the fair ground thoroughly, fire services officials complained of a violation of norms. Immediately after getting the report, the raid was carried out and five persons were caught cooking, said the Lalbazar official.																								All five were booked under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, involving disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant (in this case, the police commissioner). The ovens and stoves were confiscated.																								The high-profile fair had been inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and industry minister Nirupam Sen was scheduled to attend Tuesdays conclusion.

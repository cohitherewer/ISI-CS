  How green is our valley: A view of  the Maidan The West Bengal Medical Councils (WBMC) intention of getting very strict about illegal practice by foreign doctors coming to the city for a day or two to treat patients appears to be a laudable attempt (Licence leash on foreign doctors, Metro, July 1). But the WBMC has no control over even doctors who are registered in another state but practise in Bengal. Why should it bother to take action against qualified foreign physicians who bring their expertise to the city, albeit for a few days?  Numerous patients have come to the People for Better Treatment in search of justice after the WBMC slammed the doors on these victims of medical negligence by doctors who practise medicine in Bengal but are registered with a different state medical council. Since the accused doctors are not registered with the WBMC, it has no power to take disciplinary action against them. When these victims approached the state medical council with which the accused doctors are registered, they were refused justice on the plea that the crime occurred in a different state. Unbelievable but true  a doctor registered in one state cannot be punished if he/ she commits a medical error in another.  WBMC president Ashok Choudhury has referred to a practice in the US in defence of his councils move. It is true that a doctor from a foreign country may not practise medicine in the US without a permit from the respective state medical board. But when a physician in the US moves to a different state to practise medicine, it is mandatory for him to obtain another licence from the new state. When a medical crime occurs, the state medical board can take immediate measures against the delinquent physician. It is ironic that the medical councils in India never felt it necessary to change this defective system that has existed for decades.  Dr Kunal Saha,

 Apropos the report Ban the rallies and stop the fairs, give our lungs a breather (Metro, July 1), it is a matter of concern that the Maidan, the breathing space in the city, is fast losing ground. Political parties, visitors, fairs, bus passengers have all contributed to the deterioration of the piece of greenery. It is really eclipse time for the Maidan.  Debaprasad Mukherjee, 
 Nayapatty Road.  Your report Paper politics in  plastic wasteland (Metro, July 3) was set exactly  to the tune of reality. The Maidan is undoubtedly under  threat. The government will as usual create a few rules  but to what extent they would be put into application is  anybodys guess. As citizens, its our duty to join hands  and take initiatives for its protection.  Kunal Ray,
 Howrah.  lIt is good to learn that environment  activists want the Maidan free from rallies and fairs in  order to fight the three menaces  people, plastic and petrol.  Since the Maidan serves as the lungs of the city, all government  agencies should unite to keep it clean and green.  Prahlad Agarwala, 
 Majdia, Nadia.  The report on the gallery of grotesque made shocking reading (Foetus and demon stars of horror show in city heart, Metro, June 25). How could the mela organisers permit such a bizarre display of bodies? There was every possibility of infection. The exhibits should have found place in a museum, not a public fair.  S. Ram, 
 Purba Putiary.  It was a heinous act on the part of HSBC Bank to involve muscle power to realise a refund defaulted just for a month (Court raps bank force formula, Metro, June 24). No civilised state ever approves of such a method.  Madhabi D. Ghosh,
 Salt Lake City.  It is ridiculous to learn that Government Railway Police is reluctant to bear the responsibility to oust encroachers at the station (Sealdahs new station shelter for vagrants, Metro, June 24). The force is maintained through public money and if it refuses to work, what is its use?  Diptimoy Ghosh,
 Salt Lake City.  The high court judgment regarding disbursement of pension benefits of a teacher of Panihati Pran Nath High School should serve as an eye-opener to greedy and unscrupulous government officials (A decade of dues, some paid out of pocket, Metro, July 1).  Mohal Lal Sarkar,
 Budge Budge.  Apropos the story A good hand  and a steady head (Metro, July 24), Aashirvad Vidyalaya  is run by Christian fathers, not Jesuit brothers, as published.  The error is regretted.

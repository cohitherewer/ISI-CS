 A STAFF REPORTER																								The horror run in state hospitals continued on Tuesday, as a 70-year-old woman locked herself in a toilet of Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, pulled out a few rusty iron bars from the window and leapt to her death.																								Harried hospital authorities immediately ordered a probe to find whether there had been any negligence on the part of the nursing staff in the death of Bichitra Gayen, from Rajarhat.																								 By the end of the day, the authorities were ready to give a clean chit to the staff, concluding that the woman had been suffering from depression and had even been allowed a family member to stay with her at night.																								Gayen, a resident of Udayan Pally, near Rajarhat, was admitted in the hospital last Sunday with acute infection in her lungs and septicaemia. Doctors first examined her in the out-patients department and then proceeded to admit her in the female medical ward. However, there was no bed available, so Gayen was put on a trolley, since her condition required immediate hospitalisation, said Shyamal Rudra, the superintendent of the hospital.																								On Monday evening, Gayen told nurses she wanted to retire early. Around 2.30 am, some hospital employees reported that someone had jumped from the third-floor ward. Gayen died within half an hour. Entally police recorded an unnatural death case. The hospital scurried to set the window right.

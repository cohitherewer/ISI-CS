 Tuesday, September 02, 2003 				 A slice of our heritage 
																								SPIC MACAY (Society for Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture Among Youth) is a 26-year-old NGO student movement formed out of the conviction that an appreciation of the richness, variety and aesthetics of culture is a cornerstone of education. The societys Calcutta chapter acts as an interphase between eminent artistes and personalities from different walks of life and educational institutions, both schools and colleges, so that the former can interact with students, provide them with an insight into their particular craft and also inspire them with their dedication (sadhana). Every year over 1000 free concerts are organised in educational institutions covering classical music, dance, theatre, yoga camps etc. to make students aware of the diverse yet integrated strands of our culture. Virasat is a month-long festival held all over the country and comprises interactive lecture-demonstrations, performances and workshops in folk and classical arts, literature, crafts, theatre, films and yoga. This years Virasat 2003 begins from today with a dance recital by eminent Manipuri danseuse, Priti Patel (picture on the right) and her troupe and will conclude with an Odissi recital by Aloka Kanungo at St James and a dolls theatre presentation by Sudip Gupta at St Thomas on September 29. The 28-day festival covers 19 educational institutions including the BE College, Jadavpur University, Kolaghat Engineering College and NUJS.

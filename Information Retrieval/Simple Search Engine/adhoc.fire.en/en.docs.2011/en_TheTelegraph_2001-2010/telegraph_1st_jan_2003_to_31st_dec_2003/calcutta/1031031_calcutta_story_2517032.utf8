																								For most Bengalees, like the Latin Americans, football is not only a passion but a philosophy, a way of life, or rather, the sole mode of sustenance and survival. Globalisation and IT boom have perhaps robbed local football of its inherent glamour and charm, nonetheless, it still remains Bengals most favourite sport. Debrup Ganguly is a talented artist by profession but a sportsman at heart. A football-crazy fan since childhood, Ganguly was initiated into the sport in the narrow by-lanes of north Calcutta where he played para football with his mates. As he grew older, he was fascinated by the mass frenzy that caught the entire city in its grip whenever the Big Two (Mohun Bagan and East Bengal) encountered each other in the Maidan and later at Salt Lake Yuba Bharati Kiridangan. The game itself mesmerised him as did the raw energy and speed that emanated as the players moved skilfully with the ball, dribbled effortlessly and scored goals rhythmically. The movements of a well-orchestrated team has always fascinated Ganguly. His fifth solo show showcases 30 works, both in watercolour and mixed media, and most of them depict his keen observation of the various aspects of the game and postures of the players. 																								When: Till November 2; 4 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture

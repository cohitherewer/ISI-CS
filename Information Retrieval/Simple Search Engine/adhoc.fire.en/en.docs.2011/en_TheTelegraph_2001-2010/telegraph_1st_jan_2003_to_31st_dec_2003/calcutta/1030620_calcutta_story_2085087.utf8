 Friday, June 20, 2003 				 Cat caught in court thrashed
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Crime: Unwelcome entry into a court in session.																								Punishment: Kicked around, hung from a hook and tortured.																								Offender: A cat.																								A stray cat, that made its way into a Calcutta High Court room on Thursday afternoon, found anything but justice. It was caught and thrashed till it was rescued, bleeding and petrified.																								Proceedings were on in full swing and Justice Amitava Lalas courtroom, too, was packed with pleaders, litigants and employees, when the cat made an entry. The proceedings were interrupted for a few minutes as the cat started running around the room. 																								The animal was finally driven out, but a harsh punishment awaited it in the corridors of justice. A section of court employees and some onlookers cornered the animal, thrashed it and pelted it with stones.																								And if that was not enough, some people then caught hold of it and hung it from a hook by its tail. The torture continued till the cat started bleeding from its mouth.																								Lawyer Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee was passing the crowded cruelty corner and was horrified to see what was going on. What do you think you are doing? Will you kill the poor cat? he asked. 																								No one paid heed to his protests. Chatterjee then rushed to the courts registrar-general and sought his intervention.																								The high court police force was alerted and a few cops reached the spot to disperse the crowd, rescue the cat and set it free among the bushes of the Netaji Indoor Stadium campus.

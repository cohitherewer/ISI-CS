	Nandan had been screening World War II classic Taking  Sides for the past week. On Thursday, the staff at the  ticket counter told us that the film would be screened daily  till May 14. Nandan was closed on Friday. On Saturday, the  same clerk said the film had been taken off without any  notice and no reason was given for such arbitrary behaviour.

	Every afternoon at Chandni Chowk Metro station, passengers  spit on the tracks and throw pan masala pouches on  the platform and the escalator. A cleanliness drive is required  immediately.

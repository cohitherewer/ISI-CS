				 Reality check in drama dream  Picture by Amit Datta				 																																																											Sarah Jones, one of the most memorable out-of-towners to have hit the city stage in recent years, was back for her second standing ovation from Calcutta. A disturbing look at women survivors of sexual abuse in Women Cant Wait hit town in 2001 and continues to haunt those who saw it. On Thursday, Jones was back with another piece, this time on the plight of immigrants in the US, entitled Waking the American Dream.				 																																																											We remember, over two years ago, Jones gliding effortlessly from one character to another, changing name, nationality, height, skin colour and appearance with the help of just a scarf and a chameleon-like talent. Thursdays show, presented by Swayam, at GD Birla Sabhagar was similar, but this time, she morphed into male characters as well, without a fake beard or bad make-up in sight.				 																																																											America doesnt look like a blonde girl holding an apple pie anymore, says the US-based artiste, her tall, slender frame adding to a forceful presence. Changing this misconception became increasingly important after the September 11 attacks, and that was when the National Immigration Forum commissioned the work. But Jones clarifies that the issues have been pressing not only in light of the events of September 11, but also of September 10.				 																																																											A poets meet is the forum for the characters  all immigrants in pursuit of the American Dream  to come together. A Pakistani accountant with a bad sense of humour is the master of ceremonies, setting the stage. A Chinese mother, a Vietnamese slam poet, an old German lady, an Egyptian girl, a Nigerian man, a woman from Haiti, a Mexican, a Russian Jew and a 13-year-old Latina who lost her father on floor 107 of World Trade Center are 10 people Jones becomes by just changing a coat or draping a scarf, hunching her shoulders or standing tall.				 																																																											What is nationalism? asks Jones, referring to Arundhati Roys views on the subject. Borders are artificial, proved by the fact that corporations are allowed to move wherever they want, and the result can only be acceptance of a multicultural world. Jones Pakistani character, Mohammed Ali, is a hardcore Republican. A familiar phenomenon, especially in India, after Bobby Jindal stood for office. The right, she says, is always looking for browns, blacks and women as a helpful tool to appeal to an electorate, which is no longer monolithic.				 																																																											Though in the presence of the US consul-general and his wife at the Calcutta show Jones bit back her opinion on the current administration, offstage she made clear her views on the imperial body. She has recently won a fight against the Federal Communication Commission, which censored her feminist song which they had alleged included offensive material.				 																 Its a portrayal of the science of Hindu mythology, thats neither classical nor fusion, but, in fact, confusion. Theres a bit of kathak, combined with some contemporary dance forms. 				 																																																											Kaash is inspired by the physics that is an integral part of Hindu mythology, which has prompted research by many a scientist, explains British-born Akram Khan, the man behind the mission. For instance, US-based scientist David Deutsch has been exploring the Hindu concept of different universes within one, which is basically quantum physics, Khan observes.				 																																																											With sets by celebrated sculptor Anish Kapoor and music by celebrity composer Nitin Sawhney, it has been performed 140-odd times. The Indian tour, organised by British Council, kicked off this month in Mumbai. It was staged in Calcutta on Friday, at Kala Mandir. The five-member international cast includes two South Africans, a Spaniard and a Malaysian.				 																																																											I knew Nitin before he became famous, and we had wanted to work together. But I met Anish through a mutual friend. We hit it right off. Despite limitations, he agreed to work with me, Khan adds. The 55-minute show was a collaboration by the trio.				 																																																											No stranger to India  the former student of Birju Maharaj, among others, trained and performed kathak in Delhi  Khan picked up a passion for both Indian and western styles. After a childhood spent learning Indian classical, he studied contemporary dance at university.				 																																																											Brought up on a cocktail of kathak and contemporary dance, Rabindra-sangeet and folk music (even Shadher lau), Khan, born to Bangladeshi parents, weaves in an out of the complex tapestry. He adds his own touches to every performance because one cannot own a dance form, one can only be possessed by it. Change is essential.				 																																																											Kaash is the first full-length production for the award-winning choreographer. The piece, he says, is suggestive, and doesnt make a point. Divided roughly into three parts, focusing on destruction, preservation and recreation. The first part is on Shiva, the warrior, preparing for battle. Then, its a post-war reflection. Finally, theres recreation, Khan adds. Theres speed, but clarity, and its all about individual perception and interpretation.				 																																									 The region of Kutch in Gujarat is known for its beautiful embroidery, tie-and-dye, prints, patchwork quilts and leather articles  traditional crafts that have been adapted for contemporary tastes and the marketplace. 				 																																																											Kala Raksha, a registered society and trust in Bhuj, that preserves, protects and markets clothes, bags and other utilitarian objects produced by Kutchi women, is holding an exhibition of such crafts for the first time in Calcutta, at Artisana at 13, Chowringhee Terrace (off Gokhale Road).				 																																																											On display are bags of various sizes, shapes and uses, accessories, cases for spectacles, shawls, dyed silks, hand-embroidered kurtas and skirts glinting with mirrors, games of dice, jackets and throws and cushion covers.				 																																																											Kala Raksha is a grassroots organisation headquartered at Sumrasar Sheikh, 25 km from Bhuj and its products highlight three styles of embroidery practised by Kutchi women  Suf, Rabari and Garasia Jatt. Five hundred traditional women artisans, young and old, work in tandem with the trust. Handlooms, natural fibres and vegetable dyes are used.				 																																																											The trust has started courses in basic education and from time to time organises medical camps. There is also a savings scheme for those covered by the projects.				 																																																											Kala Raksha also has a museum for a collection of heirloom textiles that serves as a resource base. These serve as inspiration for producing contemporary pieces.				 																																																											The Kutchi artisans who were here for the exhibition held a workshop of their craft at this outlet of the Crafts Council of West Bengal. Thirty per cent of the prices of products go to Kutchi artisans. The exhibition is on till December 21.				 																																									 It might still be early days, but the start-off signs at Inox, the multiplex on Elgin Road, are good. Shishir Bhaijal, CEO, Inox, recently in town to check things out, says that while the Calcutta venue is one of the smallest, the footfall is one of the highest. 				 																																																											We opened at a good time, during the Pujas, and this is also a holiday season. Plus, Inox is the first multiplex in the city, so it is bound to attract viewers. But, the response has been so positive that we definitely see Calcutta as major investment opportunity, says Bhaijal. Apart from the City Centre project in Salt Lake, another in the pipeline next year is in Durgapur. 				 																																																											The run of movies has been particularly good, he feels, with the top grossers so far being Baghban, Koi Mil Gaya, Kal Ho Naa Ho (no empty seats so far), Finding Nemo (the childrens segment is doing very well), Matrix Revolutions and Chokher Bali. Currently calling crowds are Bombaiyer Bombete, Asterix and Obelix and Kill Bill.				 																																																											The thing about Calcutta is that, like in the South, the local film industry is very strong. Tollywood is doing quite well commercially. Also, this city, unlike a lot of others where blockbuster is the keyword, niche films are welcomed. So, we really have to create suitable time slots for everything, adds Bhaijal.				 																																																											Calcutta is not very English film-savvy, he admits. We often have to sell Hollywood movies here much more aggressively than elsewhere. For that, we are catching on to the contests concept, from SMS to radio, Bhaijal signs off.

 Ustad Shahid Parvez Lalgudi G.J.R Krishnan																								City music aficionados can gear up for a memorable evening today at the Science City auditorium, thanks to Shriram Group Companies that hosts Sur-Milan, a jugalbandi concert featuring two of Indias most talented contemporary classical musicians: sitarist Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan and the superstar of Carnatic music, violinist Lalgudi G.J. R Krishnan. Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan belongs to the seventh generation of the famous Etawah gharana and is the grandson of legendary surbahar and sitar virtuoso, Ustad Wahid Khan. He was initiated to classical music at a very early age and gave his first public performance when he was only eight. He is famous for his outstanding gayaki-style exposition of the raga in its introductory phase, the alaap, and has achieved a remarkable balance between the gayaki (vocal) and the tantrakari (instrumental) style of playing classical music. He is applauded for his technique and creativity without tampering the purity of the ragas. Lalgudi G.J.R Krishnan was born in the lineage of an illustrious disciple of the great saint -composer Shri Thyagaraja and is the torchbearer of the unique and individualistic Lalgudi Bani style. Krishnans excellent command over the violin and his superb style have earned him the sobriquet of Superstar of Carnatic Music. His style embodies pristine purity, lucidity, clarity, melody, perfect rhythm and a deep emphasis on the sahitya (lyrics).

 Wednesday, September 24, 2003 				 Teen suicide after Class X test failure
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Teenager Wasim Khan hanged himself on Monday night from the ceiling of his Shah Aman Lane home, in the Ekbalpore police station area.																								Wasims mother returned home after work to find the bedroom door bolted from inside. When her knocks drew no response, she alerted her neighbours. The door was broken down and Wasims body found hanging. He had used a leather belt for a noose, said N.K. Saha, sub-inspector of the local police station.																								The mother and some other people loosened the knot and lay Wasim on the bed in an effort to revive him. Other neighbours informed us. We reached the spot within a few minutes and rushed the boy to SSKM Hospital. There, he was declared brought dead, sub-inspector Saha added.																								Wasims mother said he had failed his Class X examination this year, which he had appeared for as a private candidate. He was very depressed. Besides, after his father left us and settled elsewhere, Wasim would mostly keep to himself. But he was interested in his studies and keen to fare well, she added.																								I work as a domestic help and hardly earned enough to put Wasim through regular school. Which is why he would study at home on his own. Failing his Class X exams was a big shock for him. Perhaps that is why he decided to kill himself, the mother lamented. Police have ruled out foul play and sent the body for post-mortem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Calcutta
		 Tuesday, August 12, 2003  Star Spot
 YASH MODI																									Is Yash, since he became known as Calcuttas CBSE 2003 (Class X) topper. Decent is how this student of Apeejay School describes the 95.2 per cent he ended up with. But this to him is just a stepping stone to future success, and he hasnt let this academic record get to his head. In fact, co-curricular activities are what this 16-year-old feels is the key to success.																									Mathematics is a fave for Godball as he is known. He scored 97 per cent in maths as well as English and social studies. The all-round excellence was clear right from the time Yash started standing first  way back in Class II.																									Faster on his feet. Yash here has participated in state-level table-tennis tournaments, besides making his mark as the best in inter-house competitions. He used to be an active member of the Bharat Scouts and Guides, and has been on quite a few treks and camps. Formula One races and Kimi Raikkonen keep him glued to the screen. But this karate orange-belt, like almost every other teen in the country, has his heart in cricket, with Manchester Uniteds football coming a close second. But is it a surprise this achiever idolises the most famous achiever in India, Sachin Tendulkar?																									Was what this former tiger reporter for The Telegraph in Schools tried to develop, which he feels has been a great help to his confidence. The way with words comes in handy during the debates he takes part in on the inter-school circuit. You will find him participating in quizzes, plays and prose writing, too. The dude, who stepped on to the stage for the first time at age 10, has taken part in the British Council One-Act Play festival three years running, though was forced to back out this time as it clashed with the school exams.																									Are what Yash still boasts of, unlike most of his contemporaries. Good ol IIT is where he wants to be in the future. The active Interactor with a track record in social service has an interest in computers, and has been taking part in state-level web designing competitions as well as the inter-Apeejay competition held in Delhi.

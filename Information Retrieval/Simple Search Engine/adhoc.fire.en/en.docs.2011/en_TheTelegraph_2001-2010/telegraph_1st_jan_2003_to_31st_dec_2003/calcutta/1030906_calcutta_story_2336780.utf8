 Saturday, September 06, 2003 				 PWD stand on Maidan sought
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Friday asked the public works department (PWD) to file an affidavit stating its stand on the armys proposals for a cleaner and greener Brigade Parade Ground.																								The army, in its affidavit now with the court, suggested that a comprehensive standard operating procedure be framed by the state government after consulting the local military authorities to save the Maidan from decay.																								The division bench, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee, also directed the PWD to state what steps it had already taken for maintaining the greens.																								Appearing for the PWD, state government pleader Rabilal Maitra told the division bench that his client had already taken several steps for Maidan beautification. But the chief justice refused to accept the submission and asked him to file an affidavit in this regard within a week.																								The environmental activist whose petition led to this case, Subhas Dutta, alleged before the court that the government had taken no initiative for the development of the Brigade Parade Ground.																								Dutta suggested a committee to frame a programme for Maidan beautification. The court decided to wait till the PWD made its stand public.

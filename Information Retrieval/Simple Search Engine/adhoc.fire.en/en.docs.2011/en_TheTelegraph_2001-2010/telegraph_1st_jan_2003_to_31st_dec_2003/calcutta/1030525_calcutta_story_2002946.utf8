 Sunday, May 25, 2003 				 Thanga men in town, raids in offing
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Several associates of fugitive Sang Niang Thanga are hiding in the city and its neighbourhoods, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officials said on Saturday. They also talked of conducting raids in different parts of Calcutta, Howrah, North and South 24-Parganas soon.																								Thanga escaped when sleuths raided the first floor of former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) additional director Upen Biswas residence in Salt Lake last Monday. Three Myanmarese and two Chinese nationals were arrested in the drug bust. 																								Several associates of the gang (arrested during the raid) are probably hiding in different parts of Calcutta and its neighbourhood. Once Thanga is arrested we can get information on these associates and conduct raids, R.M. Meena, zonal director of NCB, said on Saturday, after a closed-door meeting with NCB deputy director S. Kumar and other officials. 																								Kumar flew in from Delhi and held detailed discussions with the officials on the developments in the case. Officials said information gathered during interrogation of Biswas at his residence on Friday was also discussed at length during the meeting.																								NCB sources said teams would soon be sent to various Northeast states and other places.																								Thanga is the kingpin and once he is arrested we can get vital clues in the case, Meena said. We have already alerted the authorities in Meghalaya and Customs officials. The governments of Myanmar and Nepal have also been alerted. I have talked to the superintendent of police, Aizawl, and requested the assistance of Mizoram authorities in nabbing Thanga, he added. Thangas wife Gloria Remi and brother Zoliang Thanga have been detained in Shillong. 																								Officials said Thangas photograph and address have been sent to the Myanmarese authorities. However, they said no photograph of international drug kingpin Ah HuaThanga is a member of Huas drug cartelwas available. 																								Meena also informed that Mathani, a Mizoram Emporium staffer, who was interrogated earlier, would be summoned to the NCB office on Monday for further questioning. We will interrogate Mathani once again. However, we are not arresting her as we feel she can provide vital information, an NCB official said.																								The NCB officials, however, were tight-lipped about the five-hour interrogation of Biswas on Friday. We are going through the findings and it is not possible to divulge anything at this stage, N.C. Patra, assistant director of the Bureau, said. NCB officials also avoided queries on whether Biswas would be interrogated further. 																								Biswas, Patra said, had approached the Bureau for personal security. However, it is not possible for us to provide security to someone, he said. Police officials, however, said they have not been approached. If we are approached then we will definitely think about it, Basudeb Bag, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, said.

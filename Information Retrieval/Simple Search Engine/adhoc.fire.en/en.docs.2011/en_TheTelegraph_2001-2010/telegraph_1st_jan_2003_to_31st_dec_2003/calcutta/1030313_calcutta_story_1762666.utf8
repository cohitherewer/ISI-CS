 Medical College and Hospital recently admitted a one-day-old male baby, found in the Amherst Street area (Baby boy dumped on city street, Metro, February 15). Nowadays, we often read about new-born babies (mostly female) found lying abandoned on and around the hospital premises or on the streets. It is useless to hope that this trend of shirking parenthood would stop overnight. In most cases, the police, on receipt of news about abandoned babies, collect and hand them over to hospitals or orphanages. By then, they get infected, being left amid the squalor. If those abandoning the babies directly reach them to the hospitals or orphan shelters, the uncared-for babies will get proper care from the moment they are handed over. The authorities concerned may consider framing the necessary rules for this purpose.Many childless couples want to adopt such babies. Childless couples may collect the newborns from there after completing the necessary formalities. Only good sense and sound conscience will help such babies grow up under proper care and in a good environment. Dinabandhu Mukherjee,Behala.  Cupful a champ (Metro, February 10), it is interesting to note that skipper Sourav Gangulys brother Snehashish and mayor Subrata Mukherjee performed a yagna for Indias success in the World Cup, spending Rs 25,000. Why couldnt they approach astrologers who claim that their predictions are infallible? Indians would have been relieved of their anxieties. Does it seem a foolish proposition to all?Govinda the Dakshineswar temple is receiving a facelift (Central funds for temple restoration, Metro, January 13). Renovating and restoring the ghats on river Hooghly will beauty the area and be a boon for bathers and senior citizens.B.N. well in striking off names of non-performing examiners (115 examiners taken off Madhyamik list, Metro, February 11). Proper assessment of answerscripts is not an easy task. As some examiners are not focused on the job, it is better that they be kept away from an exercise that affects the career of students. Otherwise, the Boards decision to publish results in record time should be discounted as a gimmick.Piyal Mukherjee,Lake Town. bark brigade (Metro, February 14), it is interesting to learn of the dispute between residents of Salt Lake and the district administration over the growing canine population. True that dogs keep nocturnal vigil but people also run the risk of being bitten. Prahlad Agarwala,Majdia, report on Kanika Nandi unnecessarily blamed Nari Seva Sangha (Detected amp; cured, yet deserted, Metro, February 15). When Kanika was diagnosed with leprosy, we immediately started her treatment, but could not give her shelter as we apprehended that her stay will create an impediment in running our activities, due to the social stigma involved, especially among the uneducated. As Kanika is not homeless, we decided to send her to her brothers place, bearing the expenses of her treatment. So the question of desertion does not arise at all. We request the boutique owners to settle Kanika, an excellent kantha worker.Krishna Chakrabarty has perhaps forgotten that the Cabinet has collective responsibility and he himself cannot avoid reproof for traffic snarls (Blame the cops for the car crawl, February 14). G. Bakshi,Address not given.

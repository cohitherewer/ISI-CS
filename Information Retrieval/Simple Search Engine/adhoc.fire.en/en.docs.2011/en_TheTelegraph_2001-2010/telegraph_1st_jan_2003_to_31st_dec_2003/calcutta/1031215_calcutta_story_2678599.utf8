 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Car licence, registration go hi-tech
 A STAFF REPORTER																								News to cheer vehicle-owners. An end to harassment seems in sight, thanks to the modernisation project undertaken by the motor vehicles department of South 24-Parganas at Alipore. 																								To speed up issuing of licences and generate more income, the department is set to overhaul its offices at Alipore. The department will be fully computerised by March 2004. 																								Additional district magistrate (general) Asish Thakur said the Centre has okayed Rs 80 lakh for the department to go hi-tech. After the office is fully computerised, car-owners will get their licences within three days of applying and registration will take just two days. At present, it is a wait of 20 to 25 days to get a licence. 																								The department registers about 900 cars, both two-wheelers and four-wheelers, in a month and 3,000 licences are renewed in the same period. 																								Altogether 16 computers will be initially installed. It has been decided that work will be decentralised among all the employees. Now, a solitary official has to handle several files. Once the office is computerised, there will be no files to pore over.																								In the last financial year, our target was Rs 21 crore but in the present financial year, we want to raise Rs 38 crore. And we require more staff to fulfil the target. At present, the staff strength is only 25, Thakur pointed out.

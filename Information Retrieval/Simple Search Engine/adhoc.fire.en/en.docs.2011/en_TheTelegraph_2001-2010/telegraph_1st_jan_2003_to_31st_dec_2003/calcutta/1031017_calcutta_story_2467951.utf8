 Friday, October 17, 2003 				 The Good, the Bad and the Googly
																								This is a social comedy centering around a Parsi family. Old Bawaji Mr Jamnadas Bandukwala is dead, but not for his family and specially his son, Kantilal Pestonji. Kantilal has a distinct aversion and hatred towards his crazy but lovable son Digambar aka Dicky. Reason: every evening at the stroke of 6, Kantilals father Jamnadas Bandukwalas soul enters Dickys body and Kantilals life turns topsy-turvy. Kantilal had failed to live up to his fathers expectations and Bandukwala was of the opinion that Kantilal was basically irresponsible and irrational. Now Bandukwalas soul never misses an opportunity to criticise Kantilal and even slaps him on his face every now and then. Kantilal feels utterly frustrated because in reality, it is his son Dicky who slaps him. Moreover, he has to bear it all silently; he cannot retaliate because after all, his son is possessed by his fathers soul. Now enters the local MLA Poptalal Parekh and his son, Dr Lalit Parekh, with a wedding proposal for Pinky, Kantilals daughter. They come to the right place but at the wrong time. Its almost 6 pm, time for Bandukwalas spiritual home-coming.... Directed by Dinyar Contractor, this production is part of Signature Theatre Festival, hosted by Showhouse. 																								When: October 17 - 19; 6.30 pm																								Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, March 24, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The chaos near Ultadanga station, off VIP Road, is increasing by the day. Auto-rickshaws for Sovabazar block free passage of commuters. A large number of taxis and autos are also parked on the stretch from the subway entrance of platforms 3 and 4 to the VIP Road bridge. And not a single traffic sergeant is posted in the area.				 																																									Ashutosh Bhattacharjee,				 																																									Dum Dum Park.				 																																									Passersby use the southern exit of Park Street Metro station as a toilet. Their lack of civic sense is disgusting, but why cant the Metro authorities keep a check on their enclosure? A spot fine should be imposed on those flouting norms. 				 																																									T.R. Anand,				 																																									Budge Budge.

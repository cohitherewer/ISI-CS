The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Tee off on the greens with choice of tunes
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 Musical picks for the golf bag																								Next time you are headed for the greens, dont forget to toss into your golf bag a list of latest chartbusters you can pick up at your favourite fairways. MusicWorld, which runs the countrys largest grossing single-outlet music store in the city, is taking its rich repertoire of music and films to Calcuttas clubs in its effort to reach out. And the first stop is Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), the oldest course outside the British Isles.																								Calcuttas club culture is unique and the traditional clubs provide us ready access to a large pool of discerning audience, says MusicWorld general manager Subrata Chowdhury.																								While the MusicWorld Unplugged at Royal is being launched on Wednesday at the Usha Uthup Nite, Calcutta Club  where a test-marketing was done during Sundays carnival  is next on the RPG Group retail chains reach-out radar.																								Chowdhury feels the club campaign fits perfectly into MusicWorlds growth plans for the city where it is eyeing sales worth Rs 1 crore from the Park Street store this month. The club outlets (around 60-100 sq ft each) will be supported by a CRL (customer request log) system, which will enable members/guests to order any title  audio or view CD  of their choice. Our fully integrated backend logistics enable us to service the request real fast, he adds.																								The clubs, too, see great synergy in the in-house music marts. Our recent stress has been on making the club a more happening place, and the MusicWorld Unplugged counter will give members another reason to drop in. While the youngsters would surely welcome the easy access to the chartbusters, it also provides the older members a handy retreat to indulge their passion for movies and music, observes RCGC captain Asit Luthra. While the Unplugged outlet will initially be housed in the clubs Pro Shop, it might later be shifted to the shopping mall the Royal management is planning.																								Calcutta Club too has hailed the idea. It seems to be quite an attractive proposal and a solid value-add for the members. Maybe, they can also set up listening posts and computers to enable sampling of the music before buying, suggests club president Saibal Gupta.																								MusicWorld, which plans to add three more Express outlets in Salt Lake, Alipore and Garia, is in talks with other traditional clubs in the city for more Unplugged counters. If we can move into three to four clubs, we can generate business worth at least Rs 1 lakh from this avenue every month to start with, says Chowdhury. The initial product-mix thrust after going club class would be on Hindi and international music. A few months down the line, we might bring in more regional stuff, our forte.																								The retail chain, which grew 16 per cent last year and has a similar growth target this year (swimming against the national tide of a 30 per cent slump), attributes its success to constant reinvention and being close to regional hearts. Now the clubs are set to provide a fresh push to its city incursion.

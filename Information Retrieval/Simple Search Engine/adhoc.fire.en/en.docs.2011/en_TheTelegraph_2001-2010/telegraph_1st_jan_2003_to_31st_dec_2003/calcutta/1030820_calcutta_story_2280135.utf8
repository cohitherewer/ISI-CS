																																																		On August 27, Mars will approach closer to earth than at any time in the past 59,540 years. Positional Astronomy Centre (PAC) officials said on Monday that Mars will be 55.758 million km away from earth at its closest approach. It will be visible in the eastern sky from the evening till the next day before sunrise. The planet will be visible for the same period during the next couple of months too. The planet will shine brighter in the sky and appear bigger through the telescope than at any time in the past 600 centuries. PAC has planned to take telescopic observations on different visual aspects of the Martian surface. The next such close approach will occur in 2729 AD when the distance will be 55.651 million km. 																																																		Congress leader in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Sailen Dasgupta on Tuesday said that the method in which mayor Subrata Mukherjee was collecting tax dues by pasting posters on private properties, government buildings and shops was an expression of his bad taste. According to Dasgupta, the method was not befitting a prestigious organisation such as the CMC, and dragged the civic body to the level of an ordinary shop. He argued that Mukherjee would surely not appreciate it if retired CMC employees or contractors, who had not received their dues, started pasting similar posters on the gates of the mayors office, accusing the CMC of defaulting. Mukherjee has been pasting posters on private and government-owned buildings, including retail outlets and educational institutions, for failing to pay taxes to the civic body. 																																																		Five persons have been arrested in various parts of the city and the suburbs for power thefts over the past 24 hours. A CESC spokesperson said two people were arrested and 40 illegal connections cut off at Chhota Kalikapur in the Maheshtala area. In another drive in the Thakurpukur area, one person was arrested and 15 illegal connections cut off. In Rishra, two were arrested on charges of power theft, the spokesperson said.

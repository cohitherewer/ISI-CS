  work and play: Students writing the  Madhyamik exam; (Below) A stage performance, now part  of the syllabus It is shocking how nearly one lakh people in 15 wards were drinking contaminated water, with the civic authorities failing to take any concrete corrective steps. (Water impure in 15 wards, Metro, June 7).  The Pollution Control Board (PCB) conducted a random survey of piped water in 35 wards and sounded an alert to the CMC, urging it to immediately repair the cracks in the pipelines. But mayor Subrata Mukherjees refusal to undertake the responsibility of repairing the pipelines is ridiculous.  The lack of sufficient funds, which he offers as an excuse, cannot be accepted either. To carry out all these essential civic functions, the Corporation is empowered to raise taxes on houses, water, trades and professions. Apart from this, the Corporation, like other municipalities in West Bengal, receives substantial grants from the state government. Even with all these sources of income, if the Corporation cannot find the wherewithal to undertake development work, it is its own fault.  The truth is that the councillors spend their time and energy in political bickering and neglect development work for which they have been elected.  Fareesa Ali,  K. C. Sen Street.  The report New-look Madhyamik from 2004 (Metro, June 5) was cause for excitement. For three decades, students have suffered this outdated syllabus which has done them no good when facing competition from their counterparts from other boards.  Kunal Ray,  Howrah.  Apropos the report Madhyamik  platforms to perform (Metro, June 6), it is heartening  to note that the board is thinking of introducing fine arts  in the Madhyamik curriculum. It will provide the necessary  fillip to students who are eager to take up performing arts  as their future profession.  Piyal Mukherjee,  Lake Town.  With regard to the report Steering clear of courtesy, not skill (Metro, May 31), the sarcastic comment about Calcutta drivers by Jason Lee, driving instructor from Singapore, is significant  Here you do not blow the horn to warn others but to assert your presence. There is glory in violating traffic rules rather than following them.  Govinda Bakshi,  Budge Budge. Apropos the report Neglect noose over doctors (Metro, June 6) regarding the plight of patients at SSKM Hospital, it is sad to note the number of cases of sheer negligence that is coming to surface, post-Rajnis Patel. Patients with minor injuries are subjected to defective treatment which aggravates the injuries. Who will compensate their loss?  Debaprasad Mukherjee,  Nayapatty Road.  It is shocking that Calcuttans are drinking coliform bacteria which is available in human excreta. (Bacteria bottled in chilled mineral water, Metro, May 30). Why are the authorities permitting those callous manufacturers to allow bacteria-loaded impure bottled water to be sold in the market?  Abul Fateh Kamruddin,  Chandbati.  The report Paper chase: Thonga wraps up a trip to the Thames (Metro, June 2) was indeed motivating. With recycled plastic endangering human habitation all around the world, use of perishable paper has been introduced by London-based Korak Ghosh. If the thonga catches the fancy of the British, soon the demand for paper may increase again. It is high time that the use of plastic be stopped once and for all. Perhaps plastic industries all over the world will do well to turn into thonga manufacturers to survive.  T.R. Anand,  Budge Budge Trunk Road.  It is distressing to note that promoters are filling up wetlands in the presence of law-enforcing authorities (Blame game over landfill, Metro, May 31). This is rampant at Dum Dum and the surrounding areas.  D.P. Mukherjee,  Address not given.

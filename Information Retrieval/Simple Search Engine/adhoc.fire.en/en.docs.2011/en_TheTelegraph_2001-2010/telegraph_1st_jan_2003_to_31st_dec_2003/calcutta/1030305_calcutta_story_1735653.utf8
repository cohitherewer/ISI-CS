				 																																										Mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Tuesday asked the representatives of an outdoor advertising agency to cough up charges according to the stipulated rate and obtain permission from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) before installing the huge Reliance India Mobile glosign at Reliance House. Civic authorities had pulled it down last Sunday. The outdoor advertising agency that installed the glosign had deposited only Rs 20,000 to the CMC. The company was given permission for a 40 ft x 25 ft hoarding on acrylic sheet, said the mayor. According to municipal commissioner Debasis Som, the advertising agency flouted civic rules by hoisting a gigantic hoarding, 60 ft x 40 ft, on a permanent structure without getting clearance from the CMC. Mukherjee said soon after the CMC had pulled down several glosigns of Hutchison Telecom East last week, the advertising agency concerned met civic officers and worked out the charges for getting permission from the CMC. Spokespersons for some major outdoor advertising agencies in the city criticised the municipal commissioners highhandedness. 				 																																										The West Bengal State Electricity Board (SEB) on Tuesday disconnected power supply to several sewerage and water supply pumping stations in Salt Lake, alleging that the municipality had not paid its dues. Power was restored following a meeting between the officers of SEB and the civic body. Municipality engineers said power supply was disrupted in the township between 4 pm and 6 pm. The municipality has paid a part of its dues and will let us know the mode of payment of the remaining amount, an SEB official said. But Dilip Gupta, chairman of Bidhannagar municipality, said the SEB, too, had not paid a huge amount of tax for several installations in the township. We will discuss the issue in a meeting soon, he added. 				 																																										Traffic movement was crippled at the Lansdowne Road-Rashbehari Avenue crossing on Tuesday morning after a private bus on route 18B knocked down a scooter rider.

The criminals surrounded him, started an altercation and fled on a motorcycle after shooting him. No arrests had been made till Tuesday evening. Police are trying to find out the motive behind the attack.				 																																										A school student drowned in the Hooghly at Gandhi Ghat, in Barrackpore, on Tuesday evening.

Chakraborty said his government was yet to take a decision on the issue.

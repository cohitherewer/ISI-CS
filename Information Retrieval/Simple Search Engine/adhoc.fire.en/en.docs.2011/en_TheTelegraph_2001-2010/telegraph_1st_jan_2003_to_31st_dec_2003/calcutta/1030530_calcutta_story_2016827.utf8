 Friday, May 30, 2003 				 Intruder shot dead by factory security
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A middle-aged man, Akhtar Ali, was shot dead by the security guard of a private factory on Taratala Road when he allegedly tried to sneak into the company compound early on Thursday.																								Deputy commissioner of police (port) Harman Preet Singh said the factory was lying closed for the past couple of years, but had engaged two securitymen to guard the equipment and inventories in the sheds.																								A few minutes after 3 am, Ali scaled the boundary wall of the factory and entered the premises. The thud his feet made when he jumped off the wall on to the ground alerted the securitymen, deputy commissioner Singh said. One of guards, Abdul Hamid, posted near the main entrance, went to the spot to investigate the cause of the thud. 																								It was dark and Hamid could only spot a figure sneaking towards the factory shed, a senior police officer said. Guard Hamid warned Ali to stop in his tracks or he would open fire. Ali ignored the warnings and scampered behind a bush. Hamid then fired a round from his gun, the bullet hitting Ali in the chest.																								The intruder died on the spot. Hamid and his colleague called up Taratala police station. Our officers went to the spot and in the course of preliminary investigations, found that the robber had gone to pilfer equipment from the factory, deputy commissioner Singh said. No action will be taken against the security guard, as he was briefed to prevent robberies and open fire in case of emergency, police pointed out. Alis body has been sent for post-mortem.

	I had submitted my passport to the city regional office,  along with the stipulated fee of Rs1,000, for renewal in  January-end. I applied for the Emigration clearance not  required category, as I had the required qualifications.  But, to my surprise, the office stamped migration clearance  required on my passport. Since then, I have visited the  passport office about a dozen times. The staff at the counter  misbehaved with me and prevented me from meeting the higher  authorities. In March-end, they accepted my passport for  correction, but, within a few days, sent it back without  making any changes. They didnt offer any explanations either.

	Some shopowners of Kidderpore frequently travel to Bangkok,  Singapore and Hong Kong to buy goods for Calcutta customers.  It would be better if the authorities concerned curb such  visits temporarily and also scan their health reports in  the airport itself to check the spread of SARS.

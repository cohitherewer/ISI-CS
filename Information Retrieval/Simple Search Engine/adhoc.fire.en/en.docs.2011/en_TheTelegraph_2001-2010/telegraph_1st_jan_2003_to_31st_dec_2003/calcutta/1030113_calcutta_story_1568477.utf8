 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 Khadims accused arrested
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After eluding the police for a year and a half, Sheikh Naushad, a criminal wanted in connection with Khadims abduction case, was arrested on Sunday evening. 																								Police swooped down on a barbers shop on Ripon Street to arrest Naushad, an accused in the abduction of Khadims vice-chairman Parthapratim Roy Burman. Naushad, an accomplice of gangster Sona, had been declared wanted by the state CID in July 2001. Sona was arrested and is in jail custody.																								CID sources said Naushad figures as an absconding accused in the Khadims case chargesheet. Roy Burman was kidnapped on July 25, 2001, from the Tiljala area. Naushad had fled Tiljala after the arrest of his patron, Mohammad Tasleem, alias Chunnu, in the kidnap case. Police were tipped off that Naushad would visit the Ripon Street barbers shop. A police team waited nearby and stormed in moments after he entered and took a seat.

				 Filmi foothold for first-timers Abhishek Bachchan and Ajay Devgan: Great guys to share  arclights with  A girl sits on the Metro Rail  steps, intently studying a sheet. Her mother comes across  every couple of minutes and dabs the daughters face with  her anchal. A regular run-up to the exam hall, one  would think. Only, its Sunday midnight and the girl is  preparing for a test of different kind  a scene where she  has to cross Ajay Devgans path and walk on. 				 																																																											It is not everyday that Mumbai comes calling and opportunity knocks at the doors of wannabes. So what if it is the casting crumbs that come Calcuttas way in Mani Ratnams yet-unnamed venture. Last Sunday, at Rabindra Sadan, for instance, a Metro crowd was created out of local junior artistes. Metro Rail motorman Bikashranjan Dutta Majumdar took in the dazzling lights and the running around in between pulling into and out of the platform.				 																																																											There was a sequence where Devgan and Simran would walk down the stairs. A crowd would move with them. That scene was shot seven times. So after every take, the others had to run back to their original positions up/down the stairs. He remembers a woman in a synthetic sari all sweat and out of breath after the shot was canned. Our uniforms were soaking in the blaze of the bulbs. I wonder how she managed.				 																																																											At the end of the day, acting is tough work, is Dutta Majumdars sum-up. In a shot, Kareena was dropping a book which Devgan had to pick up. That shot was taken so many times that the book was torn, he exclaims.				 																																																											But most others who got a legit break from books had a great time. Ashwina Daryanani, a 1st year student of Bhowanipur college, went to the Presidency College shoot, as a fan of the cute Vivek Oberoi, but by the end of the two-day stint had shifted loyalties to stunning Abhishek Bachchan. Tilottama Mitra, who played Simrans friend, found the southern star very friendly.				 																																																											There were some peeve points, too. Hours of wait, cancelled shoots, and star tantrums. Ishika Dutta, who got to share an umbrella with snooty Kareena Kapoor in front of Victoria Memorial during a shower, complains how the actress kept the shade firmly on herself.				 																																																											Several post-teens in tank tops and hipsters, who had flocked to Presidency College on Sunday, describe in graphic detail how a hotel was created on the ground floor. We belonged to Ajays gang and had to storm the hotel for a shot preceding, possibly, a fight sequence, one of them says. The other shots, under the eagle eyes of Ratnam and Saathiya director Shaad Ali, were campus scenes  riding on a bike as Abhishek walked by and Ajay ran up the stairs.				 																																																											Their second assignment was at Writers Buildings and Prinsep Ghat. There was a fight between Ajays and Abhisheks gangs in front of Writers, where the crowd went berserk. We got into the act at the second location. The windscreen of a taxi was smashed and the stuntman put on blood. Ajay got involved in a streetfight. We were stuck in a traffic jam trying to figure out the jhamela, with Simran, Ajays girlfriend, with us, recalls Tilottama, who steered the stationery bike on which Simran rode pillion.				 																																																											For the 50-60 people I provided to Madras Talkies, this was a great learning experience, points out Jikesh Shah, the man who co-ordinated the models who made it to the shot. They knew how to get the best out of them. Even if they did not get meaty roles, being part of a Mani Ratnam film will give them great mileage on home turf.				 																																																											  Sudeshna Banerjee				 																																																											On view will be the works of Rituparno Ghosh, Anjan Dutta, Kaushik Ganguly, Partho Sen, Anindita Sarbadhicary, Sandip Ray, Shyamal Sengupta, Prabhat Roy and several others. Ensuring a great amount of transparency in the selection process, the 20 telefilms have been shortlisted from about 110, which got through a tough elimination round. A 15-member panel sat through all the 110 films in one month and picked up 20 films after tabulating their scores. Films which notched up a percentage of 50 and more made it to the final round, explains Forum secretary Rupa Ganguly.				 																																																											An audience survey programme and interactive sessions have been planned to gauge popular response. The Forum is also trying to book a separate slot for a handful of telefilms at the Calcutta Film Festival, beginning November.		 Artistes Forum secretary Rupa Ganguly  and Nandan director Ansu Sur announce the first telefilm  festival. Picture by Aranya Sen				 																																																											Though Korak created a ripple in the city film circuit with his first short Kolkatar Kali, he prefers to remain less of a film-maker and more of a social worker. Over the past one year or more, Korak has been juggling film-making and social work  scripting My Karma while working for Amaar Nijer, a non-profit organisation he floated to help the underprivileged women and children of Metiabruz.				 																																																											For me, film is a medium  and by far the best  to reach people for, and with, whom I have been working all these years. The pain depicted by the actors in My Karma is a reflection of what I have seen while working with these people, says the 32-year-old, whose skinny looks and frail frame belie his age and experience.				 																																																											Koraks character  a dying man  adds a curious twist in the lives of the lead pair (Arjun Chakraborty and Moon Moon Sen) in the film tracing the tale of a lamb sacrificed in the pursuit of a better life. Reborn a rich executive, Arjun finds himself enmeshed in the trappings of the material world. I want to make commercially-viable films to generate funds for Amaar Nijer, is the crux of Koraks cause.				 																																																											Fast and furious, the book is a page-turner in true thriller fashion. The man, at the British Council for a book-reading session, himself says he is quite pleased with the reception Bunker 13 has received. Although quick to deny any resemblance to real life personalities and events, apart from his personal experience at the frontline in Kashmir and in so far as the main character is a scribe, Bahal admits that a journalist writing fiction is in a privileged position and has a special licence.				 																																																											But the proudest part, the current editor of cobrapost.com says, is being compared to all-time greats like Joseph Hellers Catch 22 and Ernest Hemingways For Whom the Bell Tolls. And while the Tehelka scam hangover is not really of any consequence in the West, here it is a deterrent to how the book is doing, claims Bahal. Tehelka was a part of my life and I dont want to forget it, but its in the past. While corruption in the army and in politics is the focus of Bunker 13, Bahal is reluctant to talk about the subject of his next book.

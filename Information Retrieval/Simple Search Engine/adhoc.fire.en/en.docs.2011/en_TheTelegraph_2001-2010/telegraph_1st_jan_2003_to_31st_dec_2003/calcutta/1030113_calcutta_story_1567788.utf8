 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 Tears amp; tokens for braveheart
 							 - Strangers, friends throng memorial meets SUNANDO SARKAR				 	 Bapi Sen: Remembrance																								A curious rule  denying any award for an act of courage off-duty  may prevent Calcutta Police from honouring Bapi Sen.																								But friends and neighbours, not restrained by such quirks of the rule-book, have lined up a posthumous award for the sergeant who died while doing his duty  trying to stop five drunken constables from harassing a girl on the last night of 2002.																								At two separate condolence meetings that ended late on Saturday, two clubs of Behalas Parnasree, where Sen lived, decided on their next course of action to help the bereaved family. The intended private gatherings, however, remained anything but private as over 2,000 people  several from outside the area  turned up to remember and do their bit for the braveheart.																								Skyline Club, one of the three in Behala, has decided to host an annual-day function with a difference this Republic Day. Leading singers like Haimanti Shukla and Indrani Sen will take the stage, but centrestage will be reserved for a cheque being handed over to Bapis family.																								The amount will be collected as donation from neighbours and friends. This will be a posthumous award for Bapis act of bravery and his commitment to his work, even when he was off duty, said Skyline Club vice-president Subrata Mukherjee.																								Another organisation, Parnasree Club, has already given a cheque for Rs 5,001 to the Sens of 27/164 Parnasree Government Quarters. That was at the first condolence meeting of the weekend organised by the Parnasree Government Quarters Recreation Club, of which Bapi was vice-president.																								More than 1,500 people turned up on the grounds in front of the club building that Bapi had helped transform into a concrete structure from a mud-and-tiles one. The dais had a heavily-garlanded picture of Bapi, but his presence was all-pervasive. There were so many people sobbing and many of them had never known him, said one of the club members.																								Among the uninvited attendees were officials from the two schools from which Bapi had appeared for his Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations. The headmaster of Barisha High School was there with the assistant headmaster, while Behala Higher Secondary School was represented by its headmaster.																								The second condolence meeting of the evening, organised by Skyline Club, turned out to be an even more moving affair. Over 400 people assembled inside the club hall to pay homage to the young man who would always go out of his way to help people in distress.																								There were uninvited guests there as well. The entire teaching staff of St Joseph and Mary School  principal Bhakti Sharma is the only one associated with the club as vice-president  turned up and stayed put for over 90 minutes as club members deliberated how best to stand by Bapis family.																								Support has also come from a somewhat unexpected quarter, with the Behala branch of the Life Insurance Corporation having handed over Bapis cheque to his family. At Bapis Government Quarters home, preparations are on for the shraddh of one of Parnasrees  and now Calcuttas  favourite sons, later this week.

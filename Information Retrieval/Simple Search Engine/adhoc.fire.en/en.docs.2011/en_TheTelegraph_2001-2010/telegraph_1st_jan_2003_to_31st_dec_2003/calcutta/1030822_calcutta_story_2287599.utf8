Howrah police during a raid in a hotel on Dobson Road in the Golabari police station area, arrested six persons on Thursday morning, including the owner of the hotel.

A dispute between two clubs, Rabindra Palli and Chirantani, over a game of football turned violent in Muraripukur. The police had to intervene to bring the situation under control. One youth was seriously injured. Police think political rivalry triggered the clash as one of the clubs is backed by the CPM and the other by a Naxalite faction.																																																		The Muchipara police foiled a dacoity attempt when they intercepted an armed group of five on Thursday afternoon at Premchand Baral Street. Police said two youths, Abhijit Ghosh, 21, and Shankho Roy, 23, were arrested while the others managed to flee.

The conservancy department has decided to undertake a drive against encroachers in the stretch between Armenian Ghat and Chandpal Ghat on Strand Road. According to member, mayor-in-council, conservancy, Rajib Deb, the main target will be the roadside eateries, which have been littering the road.																																																		Mayor Subrata Mukherjee asked the conservancy department to wash the major city thoroughfares before the Pujas. Civic authorities feel frequent cleaning will discourage hawkers from setting up shop.

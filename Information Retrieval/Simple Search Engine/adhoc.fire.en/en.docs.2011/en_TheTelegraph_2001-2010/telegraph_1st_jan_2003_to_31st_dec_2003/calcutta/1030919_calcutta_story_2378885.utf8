	With the Pujas round the corner, work at the pandals is  progressing at a frenetic pace. But it is sad to notice  that, like in previous years, several pandals are being  constructed by blocking a large portion of roads or pavements.  Damaged roads and kerbs have already made life difficult  for the citizens; puja committees are just aggravating the  problem with their lack of civic sense. What is even more  strange is that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation chooses  to remain mute.

	While getting off a bus at CR Avenue recently, I found  a young scooterist arguing with an elderly traffic sergeant.  Soon after, the youth started manhandling the officer. A  crowd had gathered by then but no one volunteered to help  the officer out. An elderly person then stepped in and rescued  him. He also forced the youth to apologise. Such incidents  certainly speak volumes about our young generation.

	Car-owners deserve punishment for illegal parking, but  not at the cost of damaging their vehicles. Often one has  to spend a lot on repairing and restoring a car to its original  condition after it has been impounded by the police. Scooters  and motorcycles, parked illegally on the pavements, are  lifted and paraded arounded the city streets. In a bid to  sport a citizen-friendly attitude, the police are actually  resorting to means which cause more harm than good. The  authorities can consider imposing a spot fine on the defaulter  instead.

	Sri Aurobindo Road, in Salkia, always remains strewn with  litter. Heaps of trash are also dumped on the roadsides.  Trucks meant for picking up the garbage park themselves  in the middle of the road, blocking traffic. The civic authorities  can place a vat there. Moreover, the entire stretch of Salkia  School Road, from Bandhaghat to Golabari police station  needs repairs.  
	B.L. Chandak, Salkia.

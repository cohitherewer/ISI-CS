The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Pointless, pricey police protocol
 															- Rs 30 lakh a year to sustain Lalbazar click-and-salute exit show PRONAB MONDAL																								It used to be a protocol. Now, a hundred years later, it has become a problem that everyone wants to get rid of but no one knows quite how to do it.																								The gun-salute for senior officers, a tradition that Calcutta Police clings on to for no real rational reason, is proving to be quite a meaningless drain  of Rs 30 lakh per annum, no less  for a cash-strapped force.																								Everyone in uniform whom Metro spoke to found the practice a pointless, and even embarrassing, throwback to the Raj. Senior officers and junior constables  required to click their heels and stand tall as a superior passes by (more often than not in a car with tinted windows)  agreed that this is one tradition that has outlived its utility. Even the original, Scotland Yard, has passed over such practices. I visited the police headquarters in England some time ago, said a senior officer, but they apparently grew bored of the practice long back.																								Bored is too mild a term for the band of 30 constables of the armed force, made to stand on a 1,200-sq-ft tarmac in front of the armoury for three shifts of eight hours throughout the year. 																								Standing throughout an eight-hour shift, with the heavy rifles, waiting for a superior to pass and then clicking my heels and saluting him is not my idea of a police job, said an exasperated armed force constable. But then, I am no one to question the practice.																								Another constable admitted that he did not mind saluting his seniors. After all, it is part of the discipline that is instilled in us, he said. But the problem starts when it becomes the only job on hand and there is not even the slightest acknowledgement.																								Discipline and tradition are the two words used to defend the practice. But, even here, senior officers who enjoy the attention say it is bleeding the exchequer. This meaningless exercise costs Rs 30 lakh every year, which is spent on the constables, one of them disclosed.																								Every officer, of or above the rank of a joint commissioner, is entitled to get this exit salute. There are seven officers now in the force who are granted this honour. Some defend the tradition, saying it helps keep the armoury under greater scrutiny. 																								Others rubbish this, as the armoury on the Lalbazar campus is heavily guarded, and call for this expensive and slavish show to be scrapped.

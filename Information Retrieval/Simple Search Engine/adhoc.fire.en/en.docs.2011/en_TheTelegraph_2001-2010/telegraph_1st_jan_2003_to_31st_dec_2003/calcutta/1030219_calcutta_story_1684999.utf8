 																											- Oldest management institute to help keep hospitals clean A STAFF REPORTER																								The health department has asked the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management to draw up an action plan to free Medical College and other hospitals in the city of garbage and improve sanitation.																								Institute officials said they would prepare the project report within a couple of months. We will visit some private hospitals, including Ruby General, Peerless and Suraksha in Calcutta, Chennais Ramchandra Medical College and Christian Medical College in Vellore to take note of how the authorities there maintain cleanliness. We shall prepare the project on that basis, said Institute professor S.P. Mukherjee.																								A team of experts will be formed soon and start work from next week. We shall also see what technology these private hospitals employ to keep the premises germ-free. Besides, we shall take into consideration their system of man-management and work culture, Mukherjee said.																								The decision of the government to engage the Institute follows a clamour for cleanliness in city hospitals, where garbage and clinical waste lie scattered in the compound. Despite spending a large sum of money and drafting manpower, the situation has not improved.																								Sanitation in city hospitals has improved now, but we feel there is room for more improvement. We have decided to take up a comprehensive programme for improving sanitation. As the Institute has expertise and experience in the field of health projects, we have entrusted them with the job, said director of medical education C.R. Maity.																								Health department officials said the government spends nearly Rs 13 crore a year for sweeping and cleaning the four medical colleges and SSKM Hospital. Superintendent K.K. Adhikari of Calcutta Medical College admitted that Rs 2.5 crore is spent every year for sanitation. The amount is not too little to keep the hospital clean, but it is unfortunate that it is not done. We need to refurbish the system and change the outlook and system of work, Adhikari said.

																								This is a true story about Satyabati, nay, about all the Satyabatis around us who are rebels and refuse to mould themselves to fit into rigid pre-defined social norms to be normal. And these misfits of society are instantly labelled abnormal and hence they need to be cured, controlled and confined to subjugate them. Satyabati finds her world a difficult place to live in. Her loving and caring parents constantly try to make their maladjusted daughter feel comfortable. Satyabati has an elder brother who wishes he had a normal sister and a younger brother who has never had the opportunity to be well-acquainted with his Didi because ever since he can recollect, Satyabati has been languishing in a mental asylum. Satyabati was an all-rounder  a brilliant student, equally talented in sports. especially in swimming, yet she has been barred from participating in all her favourite activities. Something somewhere has snapped. Her world has turned topsy-turvy and the vivacious girl has slowly and inexorably gone mad. Or has she? Who can define clearly who is mad? A society full of vices and maladies or someone who refuses to toe the line and follow the tenets of society blindly. Based on Olwen Wymarks play and adapted by Rudraprasad Sengupta, this Rangroop production sees the directorial debut of Swatilekha Sengupta, who is also the music director of this play. Actors include Seema Mukhopadhyay and Sohini Sengupta.																								When: Today at 6.45 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

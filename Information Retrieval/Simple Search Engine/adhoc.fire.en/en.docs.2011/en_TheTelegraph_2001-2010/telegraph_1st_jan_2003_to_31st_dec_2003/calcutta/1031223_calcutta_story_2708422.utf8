 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Wipro gets Buddha nod for four acres
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The West Bengal government on Monday formally agreed to provide more land to software major Wipro in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec). Sudip Banerjee, president, enterprise solutions, Wipro Technologies, made the announcement after his meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								We wanted four acres near our upcoming facility in Sector V, and the chief minister agreed to our demand, said Banerjee. 																								The company will kick off operations in the city with BPO (business process outsourcing) activity in March 2004 and follow it up with software development. 																								They now have around 12 acres, and if they want more, they will be provided with it, the chief minister asserted. 																								Banerjee said the company has made some other suggestions, like setting up a fire station and a police station in the area.

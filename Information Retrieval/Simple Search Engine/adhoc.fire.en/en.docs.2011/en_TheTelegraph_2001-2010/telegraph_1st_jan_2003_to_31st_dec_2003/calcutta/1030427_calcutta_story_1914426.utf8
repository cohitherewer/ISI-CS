 Sunday, April 27, 2003 				 Dacoits loot New Alipore guesthouse
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Armed dacoits stormed the guesthouse of a private company in New Alipore on Saturday and went on a looting spree. The gangsters held the security guard of the guesthouse at gunpoint and decamped with two colour television sets, table clocks and bottles of liquor.																								Two of the seven gangsters stood guard, while the others entered the guesthouse. It took only half-an-hour for the goons to complete the operation and walk out without facing any resistance.																								This is the third incident of dacoity to take place in the last seven days in the New Alipore area. Earlier this week, a WBCS officer and his wife were wounded when they tried to resist burglars. Police have so far failed to track down the miscreants involved in the crime. 																								Investigation reveals that the criminals, mostly from slums in Chetla and its neighbourhood, use a common modus operandi. 																								We have intensified raids and netted nearly 50 drug addicts in the past two months, but those involved in the robbery are still absconding, said a senior official.

The 30-year-old had been trying to extort Rs 2 crore from a city businessman. Sanket said he had recently visited his native village Hadsa, in Bihar. On his way back, he bought a local Hindi journal, which contained detailed information on how criminals like Abu Salem and Babloo Srivastava operate. Sanket said he had tried to follow in their footsteps to make some quick money. He made threat calls to the trader from cellphones and several phone booths in the city. A driver, once employed by the businessman, provided Sanket with information. The police are on the lookout for the driver.																																																		Two doctors and three medical students were rounded up on Tuesday evening after All India Democratic Students Organisation, Medical Service Centre and Haspatal O Janaswasthya Raksha Committee members, owing allegiance to the Suci, blocked chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.

 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Civic move to rename lake after braveheart
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Almost a year after the tragic death of sergeant Bapi Sen, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has moved a proposal to name a lake in Parnasree after him.																								The lake, adjacent to the apartment in which Sen lived  and where his family still resides  is under a renovation project taken up by the CMC.																								Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee raised the proposal at the inaugural function of the Parnasree lake renovation project on Saturday. 																								We have not forgotten Bapi, although I am not in touch with his family, said Banerjee. I request the civic authorities to dedicate the project to his memory. If the Sen family requires any help, we are always ready to extend cooperation, she added.																								The Calcutta Police traffic sergeant died after being beaten up by five constables on the last day of 2002. We will name the lake after Sen, mayor Subrata Mukherjee confirmed later. 																								Welcoming the announcement, Sens elder brother, Anup, said: We are happy that my brothers sacrifice is being recognised. 																								The lake-renovation is part of the CMCs environment project, funded by Asian Development Bank. The Rs 50-lakh project would be completed in five months, said Sovon Chatterjee, mayor-in-council, water supply. Smuggled goods seized																								Smuggled electronic goods, worth more than Rs 6 lakh, were recovered from Sealdah-bound Kanchankanya Express on Saturday morning.

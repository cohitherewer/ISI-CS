 Sunday, November 23, 2003 				 Gabbars men on regroup bid held, arms seized
 A STAFF REPORTER																								City police on Saturday morning netted two associates of Rashid Alam, alias Gabbar, from Sandal Street in the Park Street police station area. Two sophisticated revolvers and several rounds of ammunition were recovered from them.																								Acting on a tip-off, a police team led by officer-in-charge of Park Street police station Fayaz Ahmed Khan raided a house at around 11 am during the day and arrested the duo. They had taken shelter and were planning to carry out a dacoity in the afternoon when we intercepted them. One of our constables had got the information and called up the police station. Unfortunately by the time we rounded up the two  Mohammad Rahim, alias Guddu, and Karim, alias Hero  three others had fled, Khan said.																								Gabbar, an extortionist, is presently lodged in Alipore Central jail after being sentenced to life imprisonment for attacking policemen in 1996. He is presently out of touch with most of his aides. As a consequence, these men are trying to regroup by themselves. The arrest is significant as they were trying to shift base and this was their first activity in many months in central Calcutta, Khan added.																								Police hope to catch the other three as well. Those arrested are all residents of the slums of Darga Road in Beniapukur. We are interrogating them and have already got a lead, said an officer of the local police station. Plea on death row																								Dhananjoy Chatterjee, sentenced to death in Presidency jail on charges of rape and murder, filed a fresh appeal in Calcutta High Court, seeking a review of the recent order passed by Justice D.P. Sengupta vacating the stay order on the execution of the capital sentence.																								In his petition filed on Friday, Dhananjoy said that the high court should reconsider the matter as the execution of the death sentence had already been delayed for more than nine years. The convict also pleaded that he had spent nearly 12 years in jail. 																								In a related development, a petition was filed by one of his friends, Ashok Kumar Pande, before the Supreme Court on Thursday seeking to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment. However, the apex court rejected the petition.																								According to sources, Dhananjoys appeal would come up for hearing in the high court early next week. In 1989, the caretaker of a Puddapukur apartment had raped and killed Hetal Parekh, a 14-year-old resident.

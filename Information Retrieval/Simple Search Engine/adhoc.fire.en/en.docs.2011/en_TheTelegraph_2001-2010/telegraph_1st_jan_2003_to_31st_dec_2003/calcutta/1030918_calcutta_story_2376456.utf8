																																																		Students of Jadavpur Universitys engineering and technology faculty on Wednesday threatened to boycott classes for an indefinite period from Thursday, protesting the authorities refusal to meet their demand for introducing a system of holding supplementary exams after every semester. They said they would begin the class boycott programme as a continuation of their movement which rocked the campus on Tuesday. They started the agitation on Monday with the gheraoing of vice-chancellor Ashok Nath Basu and other officials and teachers of the university. The campus was peaceful on Wednesday as the institution was closed for Viswakarma puja.																																																		Calcutta High Court on Wednesday admitted for hearing a case filed by US-based doctor Kunal Saha, demanding interim cancellation of licences of two city doctors, found responsible for the death of his wife Anuradha by the trial court. The respondents were directed to file affidavits. The court, however, declined to pass any interim order on the basis of the petition. Saha, in his petition, contended that the trial court, in its judgment, had held that Anuradha died due to rash and negligent treatment by doctors Sukumar Mukherjee and Baidyanath Halder. The trial court also sentenced the doctors to two months rigorous imprisonment, he pointed out. Sahas lawyer Pijush Dutta submitted before the court that according to Medical Council rules, the licences of the doctors, who were found guilty by the court, should be cancelled. He told the court that the West Bengal Medical Council had not cancelled the licences of the doctors yet.

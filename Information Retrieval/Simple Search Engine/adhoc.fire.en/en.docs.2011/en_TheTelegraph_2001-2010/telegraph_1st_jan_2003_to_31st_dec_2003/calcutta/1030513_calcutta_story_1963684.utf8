																																																											The  expert medical committee formed to oversee the treatment of  SARS patients in the state has decided to monitor the condition  of Jamil Ahmed, a resident of Watgunge, for a few more days.  Ahmed, the lone patient in the special isolation ward at the  Infectious Diseases Hospital, in Beleghata, is serving a quarantine  period after undergoing treatment for SARS. The decision to  defer Ahmeds release was taken after the WHO, through the  Central government, said only Jamils seemed to be a genuine  SARS case. Director of medical education C.R. Maity, while  announcing this on Monday, said the 100-bed SARS ward will  remain in the hospital unless a fresh directive came from  the Centre.

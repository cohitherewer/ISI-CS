 Monday, September 01, 2003 				 Pentamiral
																								Pentamiral, as the title suggests, features the works of five young and upcoming artists: Avijit Dutta, Biswaroop Garai, Samir Ray, Dewashish Das and Kushal Mukherjee. All these artists have their unique individual styles and techniques and are very contemporary as their works reflect their expressions in the current context. Dutta has a unique arrangement of style and composition. He uses different textures for each of his paintings. His works make the viewers nostalgic. One can almost identify oneself with his My Lost Memories. Mukherjees After War depicts ones journey through life which is actually a battlefield, reflecting all the struggle and challenges one faces while passing through the different phases and the sweet taste of victory at the end of it. Garais works in colour pencils reflect his distinct style as is depicted in Crucifixion. Rays Portrait of a Lady pensively captures the myriad moods and expressions of a woman. Das mixed media works have an excellent balance of colour.																								When: Till today; 11 am - 7 pm																								Where: Artists Circle, 46, Circus Avenue

 Friday, September 19, 2003 				 High court order for drinking water
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed its registrar-general to ask the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to supply bacteria-free drinking water to the high court from Friday.																								A division bench of the court, comprising Justice Dilip Seth and Justice R N Sinha, directed the petitioner, the Bar Association of the High Court, to furnish the report of the State Public Heath Engineering (PHE) department stating that the drinking water supplied by the CMC to the high court was found unfit for human consumption. 																								The PHE report furnished in the high court came out in the September 16 edition of The Telegraph. Nearly 6,000 members of the High Court Bar Association panicked on realising that the water they drank was full of bacteria. Executive committee members of the association on Thursday decided to refer the matter before the regular bench dealing with public interest litigation (PIL).																								As the regular PIL bench headed by the Chief Justice could not sit owing to Justice Mathurs absence, the division bench of Justice Seth and Justice Sinha was assigned to hear the case. Sardar Amzad Ali, president of the Bar Association, and veteran lawyer Kashikanta Moitra moved the case before the bench. They demanded a court order asking the authority to supply pure water at the high court.																								The PHE report on drinking water in Calcutta and Howrah was submitted before the high court to carry out an order.

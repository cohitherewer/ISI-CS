The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 A surreal journey
								 				Pablo Picasso had once commented, Painting is a blind mans profession. He paints not what he sees, but what he feels, what he tells himself about what he has seen. Coming from him, the words sound prophetic. Rameshwar Singhs paintings are a reflection of his inner thoughts and are reminiscent of Emile Zolas words: A work of art is a corner of creation seen through a temperament. The world Singh paints is not what we see, but a multi-coloured universe where nature, man and machine co-exist. There is a fullness in the figures  surreal characters, rotund and content men and women and beasts who inhabit a perfectly arranged space. He uses bright basic colours and juxtaposes them against darker, subdued hues, and in the process, achieves a dramatic effect. There is an old-world charm, a kind of a feel-good effect in his works that make viewers ponder, long after having viewed his paintings. There lies Singhs achievement.																								When: Till today; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55, Gariahat Road

 Saturday, April 05, 2003 				 Quartet of teenagers robs man at point of gun 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Four teenage dropouts, all from well-to-do families, were arrested while attempting to rob a senior executive of a foreign bank. The boys surrounded the executive at the AJC Bose Road-Kidderpore Road crossing on Thursday night and snatched his cellphone, watch, wallet and credit cards at gunpoint, before the police intervened.																								Preliminary investigation revealed that the boys had been students of well-known English-medium missionary schools. But all of them dropped out two to three years ago, from Class VII. Since then, the quartet that hails from Kidderpore has developed underworld links, said an officer of Hastings police station.																								At around 10.30 pm on Friday, Shouvik Halder, a consultant with a foreign bank, was on his way back home. Halder was walking down AJC Bose Road from the Academy of Fine Arts, after spending some time at an exhibition. He told us he had not taken a taxi because he liked walking, the officer added.																								As Halder, a resident of Watgunge, took a left from AJC Bose Road, the four boys cornered him. One of them whipped out a loaded revolver and ordered him to hand over all his valuables. Two others whipped out knives, said the officer.																								But fortune favoured Halder, who noticed a police jeep passing down AJC Bose Road. The policemen in the jeep heard Halders cries for help, said Nanda Dulal Pal, officer-in-charge of Hastings police station. As the jeep took a U-turn and reached the spot, the teenagers split into two groups and started fleeing. After a brief chase, the officers managed to pin down two of them. All the articles snatched from the executive were recovered and the knives and revolver seized, said Pal.																								The two boys were brought to the police station and interrogated through the night. Based on the information given by them, we carried out an extensive raid in Kidderpore, from where the two others were rounded up, said the Hastings thana officer.																								Preliminary investigations revealed that poverty was not the driving force behind this criminal act. It seems the four boys wanted to get rich in a hurry. We are investigating how they got their hands on a revolver. More arrests are expected soon, said the officer.

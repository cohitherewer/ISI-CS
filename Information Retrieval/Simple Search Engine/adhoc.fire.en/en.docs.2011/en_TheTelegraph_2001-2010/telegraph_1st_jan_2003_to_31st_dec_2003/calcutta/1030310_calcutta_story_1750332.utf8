 Monday, March 10, 2003 				 Key shift in varsity script scan schedule
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta University (CU) is considering significant changes in the system of evaluating answer-scripts of students at the post-graduate (PG) level.																								The move is aimed at bringing about a uniform pattern of marking PG answer-scripts, following a complaint from the SFI-controlled students union that many meritorious students were being denied high marks because different teachers were being engaged to evaluate the scripts of a single paper.																								Arnab Ray, president, Calcutta University Students Union, said: In a comparative study of the PG results of the past five years, we have found sharp differences in marks scored by two different groups of examinees of the same class. This disparity, according to Ray, could only be explained by the fact that two sets of scripts were examined by two sets of teachers, as the academic merit of the students could not vary so dramatically.																								Student leaders met CU vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee last week and demanded that immediate measures be taken to stop the existing practice of engaging more than one teacher for evaluating answer-scripts of the universitys PG examinees.																								They alleged that the present evaluation system lacked uniformity and awarding of marks depended mainly on the subjective views taken by different teachers examining different scripts of the same paper.																								Officials in the universitys examination department said the authorities were aware of the problem and were already chalking out probable solutions. 																								We have introduced the system of engaging a single teacher to examine the answer-scripts of a single paper of a single batch in many subjects. For example, if 250 students appear for a paper of a particular subject, then all scripts must be examined by a single teacher, said Rakhahari Chatterjee, CU dean of the arts faculty.																								Sources in the examination department, however, said apart from engaging only a single teacher, another option open to them was appointing a group of teachers who would sit at a single venue and examine the scripts together for subjects having a huge number of examinees. This would ensure a certain uniformity even during mass evaluation of scripts.

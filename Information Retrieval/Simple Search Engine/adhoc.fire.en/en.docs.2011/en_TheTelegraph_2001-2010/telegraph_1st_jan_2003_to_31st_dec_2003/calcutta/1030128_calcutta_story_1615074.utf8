				 	ARCHIT JHUNJHUNWALA																	Might have infected Archit, but an antidote appeared, just in time, in the form of squash. On the insistence of his father and brother-in-law, he started sweating it out at the Calcutta Raquet Club from the age of 14. Now the student of Class XII at Don Bosco Park Circus is set to take a bite into the squash circuit.																									At the All-India Inter-School Eastern Region U17 championship in 2001. He put in his best shot at the national edition of the tourney at Indore later the same year. The dude, who is on the rolls of most competitions held at the Raquet Club, has taken a teensy break to finish his university applications and study for the school exams. But come February, Chitty boy plans to live by his New Year resolution to take his game more seriously. No more flitting between sports for the 18-year-old who always participates in basketball, cricket, table tennis and badminton matches in school, and even swept the Class XI commerce chess tournament.																									Is what you may call the guy who has been published in The Best Poems and Poets of 2002 and Dancing in Light (though he says he was completely in the dark about his rhyme), courtesy Poetry.com, after randomly sending in his work to the site. He has since received the Editors Choice Award from the International Library of Poetry.																									Also fascinate Sunny. Like a magnet, he is stuck to his computer, not just to surf the Net and chat, like most. For hours, he designs webpages and makes presentations. His hacking days were nipped in the bud by his folks. So has switched instead to creating Flash animations. Made his first professional site for a city housing complex. No wonder he has won first prize for presentations and web designing at school fests.																									All the time, for the boy who unwinds by thinking, thinking and thinking smore. Though his efforts were not always concentrated on his books, getting the highest in the state in the ICSE economics exam (98%) has convinced him to utilise his potential a little more.

 Monday, September 08, 2003 				 A salute to life
Life is a long and often arduous journey but there are people who take everything in their stride with gay abandon and discover precious moments at every nook and corner to re-live and reminisce later. Sudha Murty, chairperson, Infosys Foundation, is one such exceptional personality. A highly-qualified professional, this spirited lady gave up everything to help her husband Narayan Murty fulfil a dream. During her work for the Infosys Foundation, Murty encountered a cross-section of people: from high society to hoi poloi, simple tribals to charlatans, anonymous donors to headline-hungry politicians. With a natural flair for writing, she had been chronicling her observations in an anecdotal form which were published in newspaper columns from time to time. These memoirs were later compiled in a book form, Wise and Otherwise, A Salute to Life. There are 51 short narrative pieces giving interesting insights into the various facets of life. Now the book has been translated in Bengali Ekti Jiban Anek Mukh and published by Ananda Publishers Pvt Ltd. The book will be launched by Sudha Kaul, executive director, Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, followed by reading excerpts from the book by Anita Agnihotri, director amp; CEO, Roopkala Kendra. Moderator: Sujata Sen, director, British Council.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Oxford Bookstore Gallery

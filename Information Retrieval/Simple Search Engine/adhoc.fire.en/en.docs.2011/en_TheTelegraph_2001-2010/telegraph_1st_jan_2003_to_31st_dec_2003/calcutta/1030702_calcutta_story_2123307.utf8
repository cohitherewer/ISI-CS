 Wednesday, July 02, 2003 				 Salt Lake water tax suit
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Bidhannagar House-Owners Association has moved a petition in Calcutta High Court challenging the recent decision of the municipality on imposing a water tax on residents. Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta on Tuesday admitted the petition and directed advocate-general Balai Roy to appear in court for the July 7 hearing.																								The townships house-owners have described the tax decision as ultra vires to the Constitution and arbitrary, as the civic authorities are already collecting a levy on water along with the property tax. 																								Residents of Salt Lake said the municipal authority does not have a right to levy a tax on drinking water, as it had failed to ensure an adequate supply of the amenity in the township.

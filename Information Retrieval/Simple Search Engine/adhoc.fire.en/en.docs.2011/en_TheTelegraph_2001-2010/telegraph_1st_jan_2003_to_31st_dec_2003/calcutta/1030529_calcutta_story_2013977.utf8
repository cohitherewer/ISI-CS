 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Its time for the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta (IIMC), to go global. From Joka to Dubai and Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, business beyond boundaries is the management mantra this winter.																								The target group is not just students. Come December, the latest brand from the IIMC stable  Long Duration Executive Education  will be available outside the country. 																								As per the plans, the first one-year international advanced management programme for working professionals will kick off with 40 students, 10 each from four Asian regions.																								This will be the first such programme offered by a B-school outside India. The theme will be doing business in Asia, said Ranjan Das, who teaches strategic management at IIMC. 																								The Joka campus has been offering short management development programmes (MDP) outside the country for some time. But a longer programme needs higher commitment, and we are ready for that, added Das.																								Priced at $ 4,500, the year-long course will comprise modules on doing business in South Asia, West Asia, Southeast Asia and the Far East. Each semester will cover one region with five days of intensive classroom training and 85 days of project work and other assignments aimed at cross-cultural interaction, to be completed in the four bases.																								While the other regions in the world are witnessing stagnation, Asia is still witnessing growth. These economies are not only markets, they are also supply sources, and thats why we decided to draw up the teaching modules with Asia as the focus, explained Das 																								The four-semester schedule  three months each in India, Malaysia, the UAE and Calcutta  will have a mix of off-and-on-campus pedagogy. And IIMC is tying up with various industry bodies in these countries for administrative support.

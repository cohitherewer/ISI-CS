The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, June 03, 2003 				 Teaching season in the sun
 Class act: Interactors at work for the Nabadisha project  in Dhakuria. Picture by Pabitra Das  As the mercury soared, sane students  decided to stay indoors, go for an occasional movie or a  cooling swim. But here we were  102 obviously insane Interactors   daring the sun and heat. Schools were closed, exams were  over, what better time to get cracking with some real work?				 				 																															Leading the squad was president of the Interact Club of St Josephs Collegiate School, Mayank Shah. Each one teach one  a project where members of Interact would help underprivileged children from non-formal schools with their studies  was his brainwave. Support was strong, as students from six schools decided to come on board. The contribution made by all the students, including Siddharth Jain, Mohit Agarwal, Sonali Sehgal, Anoushka Pramanick, Anurag Gadodia and Vedika Sipani, was invaluable.				 				 																															Don Bosco Park Circus, St Thomas for Girls, St Josephs Collegiate School, Welland Gouldsmith, Pratt Memorial and St James were some of the schools to sign up. The plan was to teach around 150 students at three different institutions across the city in four batches over a period of four weeks. The schools covered were part of the Nabadisha chain, which works in association with the Calcutta Police and is actively supported by CRY and Vikramshila Education Society. The Rotary Club of Mahanagar agreed to take care of all expenses involved.				 				 																															One of the centres chosen for the project was in Dhakuria, run by the Lake police station. Thirty eager faces assemble here every morning, waiting to learn something new. Equally enthusiastic are the group of eight volunteers teaching them. Seven students of Future Hope School were helping out here. We are really enjoying our time at Nabadisha with these dadas and didis. It is so much more fun than staying home and playing by ourselves, grinned Shubhodeep Haldar and Rupa Mondol. The students were divided into three batches according to age and educational level. Apart from maths and English lessons, dance and drama sessions are also conducted. Toddlers were taught nursery rhymes and told stories to engage their interest.				 				 																															The Interactors also worked at a school in Beniapukur, called Devendra Vidyapith. The group here was larger, with 80 students on the rolls. They were taught poetry, art, maths, English, dance and drama. When the holidays are over, I will be very sad as we have our old teachers and lessons back, mused Tabassum, one of the tiniest in the batch. The third of these institutions was in Bowbazar, where the students were mainly working children, speaking Urdu and Hindi. Besides English, Hindi and maths, Christine, a French lady, pitched in to teach the youngsters how to dance.				 				 																															As a grand finale, a movie show has been organised for all the kids on June 6, giving them a well-deserved break from academics. This will be followed by a cultural programme at St Josephs on June 15 where the youngsters will display their talent and perform the nursery rhymes, songs, poems, dances and skits that they have been taught during the summer.				 				 																															For all of us, the project was rewarding and enjoyable and involved interacting in the truest sense of the term. It was an amazing experience, said Mohit Agarwal of Don Bosco, while for Shagufta from St Thomas, it was important to make a difference in someone elses life. 				 				 																															In fact, we were all glad that we could reach out, teach one and touch one.				 				 																															 Surjo Deb				 				 																
	 Youth power				 				 																															The Agragami Tarun Dal of Amherst Street, including around 20 students from City College (day), organised a youth festival on June 1, on their club premises. The socially conscious fest featured a voluntary blood donation camp, a medical camp for the underprivileged and the launch of a mobile medical unit to operate within city limits.				 				 																															The social welfare committee of the club decided to explore avenues of public life where youth could play a greater role. As part of this agenda, it has also taken a decision to start an old age home in the future.				 				 																															While Mukul Sengupta, deputy inspector-general of police (vigilance), West Bengal, did the inauguration, ex-Olympian Sailen Manna was the chief guest at the day-long event. Leading professionals from the fields of medicine, development, media and the law were in attendance.				 				 																															Doctors dropped by to give free medical check-ups and advice, after which a discussion was held on the social activities planned by the committee. Society must take a supportive stand, was the consensus, and youth has a greater responsibility to fight injustice. More people should come forward to donate blood and help fight the killer thalassaemia, said Tamoghna Ghosh, a young member of the committee.				 				 																															The day ended with a cultural programme, with a stunning magic show conducted by D. Surojit and teen performances, upping the tempo.

	 Smoke alarm				 				 																															Students of Don Bosco Park Circus were out fighting the smoker fire on May 31. If ignorance is a nicotine junkies bliss, the Interactors were determined to do away with it.				 				 																															The boys took to the streets, armed with posters and pamphlets, taking on those smoking on the streets, asking them to put out their cancer sticks if not for good, at least to honour the No-Tobacco Day. The awareness rally covered Camac Street, Park Street and Shakespeare Sarani, spending around three hours spreading information about diseases like lung cancer.				 				 																															While most people the patrol encountered were very positive in their response, others who did not know of the ill effects of tobacco products like cigarettes and gutkha, refused to consider what the student activists had to say.				 				 																															 Siddhartha Saraogi				 				 																															President, Interact Club, Don Bosco, Park Circus The Global Institute of Convergence Studies, Noida,  organised a seminar on creativity and the business  of entertainment last week. City-based media professionals,  specialising in radio, film, music and news, spoke at  the day-long meet. Performing arts personality Devajit  Bandyopadhyay, actress June Maliah, film-maker Subrata  Sen and Siddhartha Shankar Ray of the band Cactus took  the podium. Picture by Aranya Sen				 				 																															Dream grant				 				 																															In aid of organisations supporting the use of technology to improve the lives of youth and helping bridge the digital divide, Samsung Electronics has pledged US $ 600,000. Live Your Dream is the Korean electronics majors theme for year 2003, and the focus is the youth all the way.				 				 																															India, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore are the countries participating in this scheme. To choose the recipients of the grant, Samsung is forging bonds with youth agencies across the region, with the help of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Unescap). An independent judging committee has also been set up to evaluate grant applications from charities, NGOs, educational bodies and development institutes. Both on-going and new youth projects will be in the running, with all awards to be announced on August 11.

	 Figure it out				 				 																															Imagine doing a tough long multiplication in a variety of methods  from left to right and right to left, by adding, subtracting or dividing. In other words, in a way other than the tedious procedure. Well, thats what Vedic maths is all about  increasing speed, accuracy and analytical power. One calculation done through several methods, with room for more. A three-day workshop on the subject will be held at Padatik, on AJC Bose Road, from June 9, from 4 pm to 6 pm.

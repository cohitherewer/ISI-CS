 Sunday, August 31, 2003 				 Money motive in murder
 OUR BUREAU																								The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Friday arrested Dulal Chakroborty, an employee of Kanchrapara railway workshop, on charges of murdering his sister-in-law Rita Chakroborty, 47, and making an attempt on the life of his niece Phalguni on July 28 night. 																								Ritas body was found on Kalyani Expressway near Halisahar. Her daughter, too, lay on the road with serious head injuries. Phalguni was taken to R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital where she is recuperating.																								The case was initially started with Jagaddal police station the next day. A week later, the CID took over. R.K. Mohanty, additional director-general of police, CID, who interrogated prime accused Dulal, said on Saturday the probe was delayed as the sleuths could not question the girl who was in a coma for over three weeks. Dulal confessed to having committed the murder for money.																								Ritas husband, Badal, who also works at the railway workshop, had kept Rs 1 lakh at home to buy land, against the wishes of his wife and daughter. Badals brother, Dulal, had run into a debt of over Rs 70,000. He knew that Rita was aware of the place where the cash was hidden. Dulal was also aware that Phalguni was desperate to become a model. So, he told Rita that she should carry the money with her and accompany him on July 28 to fix a modelling assignment for Phalguni.																								Dulal hired a car and along with Rita and Phalguni left Halisahar to reach a fictitious ad agency in Murshidabad. On their way, Dulal stopped the car near Paltapara in North 24-Parganas and asked Rita and Phalguni to accompany him to an eatery. Dulal first attacked Rita and killed her on the spot. Phalguni survived, but with serious injuries.  Station drive: Howrah station  authorities will crack down on unregistered porters on Sunday.  Flooded with complaints from passengers, the authorities  have decided to launch the drive against unlicensed coolies.  Security has been beefed up at the station to counter porter  unrest.

	For the first time in my life, I went to see a match at  Eden Gardens last month. It was the final of the TVS Cup  between India and Australia. I was astonished how a crowd  of one lakh plus could sit and watch a match in such a disciplined  fashion. There were enough water pouches to be bought and  enough counters to prevent long queues. Though India lost  the match, the crowd sportingly appreciated the performances  of the Aussies. While leaving the ground, it struck me that  if we are capable of such smooth organisation, why is this  discipline lacking in other facets of life?

	While depositing municipal taxes at south Dum Dum municipality  at Nagerbazar, I found that the persons entrusted with the  task of receving the money had not arrived even at 11 am.  I had to wait to wait for another half hour, as a consequence  of which I missed an important engagement. I appeal to the  municipal authorities to take remedial action.

				 Hari Narayan Sahani 																								Honesty may be the best policy according to the book, but in real life things may turn out to be quite different. Hari Narayan Sahani, a fortyish taxi driver, has been in the news since December 16, after he found jewellery worth a lakh in his vehicle and deposited it with Jorasanko police station. The passenger, who had left behind the wedding jewellery, had tried to show his gratitude by handing out a measly tip. The police were more generous and gave him the princely sum of Rs 1,000.																								Otherwise, little has changed in the hand-to-mouth existence of this man from Madhubani district in Bihar. He still sleeps on the pavement in Prinsep Street and has his meals in a hotel. Forced to live away from home, he has been unable to give his three sons a proper education. The eldest of them is 13 and already a drop-out. 																								Sahani, an only child, had lost his parents very early in life. He came to Calcutta when he was about 15 and worked as a contractors labour in a jute bag factory. Many of his relatives and people from his village, Dalokhar, were cabbies, and from 1982 he has been driving taxis himself. He does 12-hour shifts everyday, and at the end of 130-140 km rounds, he pockets about Rs 100.																								But even before the December 15 incident, life was not totally uneventful. In 1985, when another vehicle hit a child, and the mob started throwing stones, Sahani happened to be inside his parked taxi. A stone crashed through the windshield and hit his face, disfiguring it. He was hospitalised for three months and went broke footing the bills.																								Then, five passengers from Watgunge, who made him drive all day till 10.30 pm, turned out to be criminals. Three of them were arrested and Sahani, in spite of his innocence, had to spend two months in the clinker. Subsequently, after running from pillar to post, his kinsmen bailed him out. He was shattered and went back home.																								But poverty forced Sahani to take up position behind the wheel once again. On December 15, he picked up two passengers from Chitpur. They wanted to be dropped at a dharamsala nearby. The next passenger noticed the duo had left behind a bag inside. Sahani and the passenger drove to Jorasanko police station. After handing over the jewellery Sahani drove back to the dharamsala.																								But the duo had left. He found them at the police station. Sahani identified the two men and they were given back the jewellery meant for a wedding. The passenger offered Rs 200 to Sahani. He refused to accept it. Later, police came looking for him.																								Sahani was a happy man the next day when the police honoured him, and though he attracted media attention the cold pavement is still his bed.

																								Samskriti Shreyaskar presents Khoi Nadi, a Kathak rendition of a story spun around a little girls search for a lost river  an allegorical reminder to teeming humanity of our existential relationship with the elements, water being one of them. Kathak - Anek Rang is a series of compositions that seeks to discover in a new light the popular facets of Kathak as a dance form. The music is innovative; forays are made into several genres without disturbing the essentially classical base that includes Shumaar, Ninaad, Labbaik, Tarang, Jhula, Trivatt, Pravah and Tarana, culminating in the crescendo of Aakanksha. The duet by the dancers is mirrored through a jugalbandi based on Raga Mishra Anandi that facilitates the development of music through movement and movement through music. The choreography is by Rani Karnaa and the music has been composed by Ustad Sabir Khan.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Kala Mandir

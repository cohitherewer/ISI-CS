 Monday, September 08, 2003 				 Hospital lifts back in action
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Forty-eight hours after a young doctor picked up the courage to demand why the lifts at Nilratan Sirkar Medical College and Hospital were not working  and got beaten up in the process  most of the lifts were found to be functioning on Sunday.																								Three of the six lifts in the building that houses the gynaecological ward, where the showdown between group-D staff and the doctor had taken place on Friday, were in order. Officials said they were enough to handle the rush on a holiday.																								The hospital has 12 other lifts on campus, most of them in the academic building and the emergency wing. More than half of those lifts were working as well, officials added.																								Doctors and patients said they were coming to terms with the new order of things. It will take us a few days to get used to lifts which do not stay rooted on the ground floor, an emergency-ward doctor said. They may again become stationary in a few days but, till then, it is a boon for patients, her colleague added.																								On Friday morning, group-D staff assaulted a hospital house-staff member when he questioned the liftmans arrival on duty at 11 am after finding a senior state health department official (from Bankura) waiting for the lift to go up for a cardiac check-up.																								Hospital superintendent Shyamal Rudra said on Sunday that he had gone through the complaints; the group-D staff member, too, had complained against doctors, he explained. I will submit my report to the assistant engineer (NRS division) of the public works department on Monday, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, June 16, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	A few days ago, I had boarded a Tollygunge-bound train  from Esplanade Metro station around six in the evening.  The public address system inside the train was quite inaudible,  producing a jarring metallic sound. Several commuters, who  do not travel by Metro regularly, were a bit confused. The  snag needs to be corrected.

	I had gone to the Free School post office last month to  send some letters through Speedpost. It was 10.45 am, but  the staff told me to come later, as they were busy with  something else. How can they be so unprofessional?

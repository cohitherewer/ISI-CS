 Wednesday, July 30, 2003 				 Report slams NRS morgue
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The appalling condition of the morgue at Nilratan Sirkar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital has upset the Assemblys standing committee on environment, forests and tourism. The committee, led by Mursalin Mollah, submitted its report on Tuesday.																								The terms of reference were limited to an inspection of the overall conditions and the removal of human and biomedical wastes at five state hospitals, including Calcutta Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) and NRS. The committee was silent on CMCH, but slammed the conditions at NRS. Irregular removal of wastes has created an unhygienic condition on the campus, it noted. Only one of the six mortuary chambers is functional, where rats prevent the preservation of bodies.																								The committee also noted lapses on the part of employees in the segregation of biomedical wastes for their proper disposal.

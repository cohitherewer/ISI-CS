 Friday, November 14, 2003 				 Salt Lake in a bind over sex ring rerun
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The busting of two flesh trade rackets within a month has forced the police and civic authorities of Salt Lake on the backfoot. Unable to check house-owners from letting out their premises to complete strangers, officials are chalking out plans to revive regular interaction with the townships block committees.																								Salt Lake police on Wednesday arrested six persons, including four students of a private engineering college, for their alleged involvement in a flesh trade racket. A similar incident had occurred here a month ago, said additional superintendent of police (Salt Lake) Ajay Nand.																								With local residents scarcely keeping any track of what goes on in their neighbourhood, the township has turned into a haven for criminals, said officials. We are drawing up plans to increase interaction with the block associations, so that people can verify the identities of their prospective tenants, Nand added. 																								The Salt Lake civic authorities have also expressed concern over Wednesdays incident. We are worried that such incidents are occurring at a regular pace, said chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality Dilip Gupta on Thursday. He alleged that in spite of repeated requests, house-owners were not too forthcoming in recording the details of their tenants.																								People are avoiding our appeal in order to save taxes, but such suppression of facts can land them in serious trouble, Gupta explained.

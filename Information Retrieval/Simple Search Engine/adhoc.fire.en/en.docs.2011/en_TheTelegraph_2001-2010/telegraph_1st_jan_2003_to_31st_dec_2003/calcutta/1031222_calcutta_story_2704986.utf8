 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 50 patients refuse meal
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Fifty patients at MR Bangur Hospital boycotted lunch on Sunday. For the past few days, there had been murmurs of protest about the quality of food supplied by the hospitals caterers. On Sunday, things spun out of control.																								According to patients in ward no. 4 of the hospital, the rice was half-cooked, the dal stale and the egg curry rotten. How can one eat such food? a group of patients shouted at a few catering personnel in the ward. 																								When the protests yielded no official intervention, the patients told the hospital staff to take the food away. 																								When news of the boycott reached Writers Buildings, director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee ordered superintendent Debasish Halder back to the hospital. Halder asked the caterers to boil the rice again and serve it. 																								There are over 450 patients in the hospital and only 50 of them complained. There was nothing wrong with the meal, apart from the rice, which was cooked again and served, Chatterjee said. 																								The hospitals private caterers have been asked to improve the quality of food, he added.

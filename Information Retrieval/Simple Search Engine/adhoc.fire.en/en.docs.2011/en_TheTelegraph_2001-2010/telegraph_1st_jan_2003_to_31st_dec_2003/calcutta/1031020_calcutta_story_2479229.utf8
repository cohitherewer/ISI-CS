The showers brought down the temperature by around two degrees Celsius. Sharp showers were also reported from Howrah. Officials at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore said the low-pressure formation hovering over the Andaman Sea over the past three days had moved closer to the coast late on Sunday afternoon, causing the showers, and now lay over the west-central Bay of Bengal and adjoining coastal Andhra Pradesh. Also, a low-pressure trough is extending from the north-west Bay up to the Bengal coast. 																																																		Nana, a local trader, was abducted on Sunday morning from a minibus stand on Topsia Road. District police said the abduction may have been masterminded by Sanjay, of Tantibagan, in the Phoolbagan area. Late in the evening, a shop-owner of Topsia claimed to have received an anonymous call demanding Rs 5 lakh for Nanas release. The caller identified himself as an aide of Sanjay. Nanas family told police that Sanjay and his gang had raided his office last week and beaten him up for refusing to cough up extortion money.

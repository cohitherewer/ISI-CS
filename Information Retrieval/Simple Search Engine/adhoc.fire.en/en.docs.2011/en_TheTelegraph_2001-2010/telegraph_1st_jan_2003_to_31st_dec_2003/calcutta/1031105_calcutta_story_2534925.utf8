 Wednesday, November 05, 2003 				 Bose slur shocks Bar
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Four days before the date set for hearing the contempt case against Left Front chairman Biman Bose, two lawyers associations of Calcutta High Court on Tuesday condemned his remarks on Justice Amitava Lalas restrict-rally ruling. The court will hear contempt proceedings on Friday, and the Front chairman has been asked to be present in court.																								The Bar Association and the Bar Library Club, in separate resolutions, expressed shock at Boses observations and announced their unstinted faith in the magnificent role of the judiciary in protecting individual, as well as collective, freedom.																								Government lawyers spent Tuesday chalking out a strategy to combat the contempt notice slapped on the Left Front chairman. A meeting of left lawyers, held in the chamber of government pleader Rabilal Moitra, was attended by advocate Bikash Bhattacharya, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah and additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami.																								The case will be heard by Justice Ashok Ganguly in courtroom no. 12, and police at the high court expect quite a heavy turnout. Justice Ganguly had, on October 16, admitted the contempt case against Bose, on the basis of a petition filed by Idris Ali and others, and ordered the Front chairman to be present in the court during the hearing.																								The Bar Association, with a membership of 4,500 advocates, appreciated the role of the media in projecting the issues of fundamental freedom of the people.

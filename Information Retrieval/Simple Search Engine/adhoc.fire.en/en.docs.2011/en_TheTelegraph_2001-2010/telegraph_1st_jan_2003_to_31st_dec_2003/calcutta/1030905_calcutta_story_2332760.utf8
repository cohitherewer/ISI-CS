The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, September 05, 2003 				 Maker mystery in ammo chase
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The 25,000 rounds of AK-47 bullets seized from a truck in the parking lot of the port area on Wednesday may not have been manufactured in any official ordnance factory.																								Army ammunition experts at the Eastern Command headquarters arrived at this conclusion after inspecting the bullets closely. They found the ammunition different from conventional AK-47 bullets used by defence personnel and conveyed this to Soumen Mitra, top cop of the detective department.																								Mitra later told Metro that some bullets have been sent to the forensic science laboratory for examination. The report will tell us where exactly the bullets were manufactured. There is however, no doubt that these are AK-47 bullets, he added.																								A team from Eastern Command rushed to Lalbazar late on Wednesday evening after Calcutta Police requested it to take a look at the bullets, which had no manufacturers stamp.																								The bullets were of the same calibre (7.62 mm) as the ones used in AK-47 rifles, but they had more rounded tips than the ones manufactured in ordnance factories of China, Belgium or the Czech Republic, said a senior army official.																								When the bullets were slipped into an empty AK-47 rifle, they fitted perfectly. The bullets have definitely been manufactured for AK-47 rifles, but they do not belong to any defence force, the army confirmed.

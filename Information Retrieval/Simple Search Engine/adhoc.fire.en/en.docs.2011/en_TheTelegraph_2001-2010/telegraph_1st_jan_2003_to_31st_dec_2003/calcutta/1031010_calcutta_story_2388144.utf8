The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 10, 2003  Firmly present in the past
 Walking down Rabindra Sarani, Soumitra  Das discovers how history lies embedded in this street In no other street is the synchronicity  of the various chapters of Calcuttas brief but colourful  history so evident as in Chitpur, renamed Rabindra Sarani.  Perhaps no other street can be as clearly demarcated as  this into three distinct sections that are coloured by the  cultures and lifestyles of its inhabitants. If we begin  from Baghbazar, deep north, the stretch up to Ganesh Talkies  bears an unmistakable Bengali stamp. From then onwards up  to Mahatma Gandhi Road, it could be in the heart of Rajasthan.  And the smell (of biryani and attar) and look  of the third and last section are redolent of Islamic culture. The owner of a medicine shop at  the Jorasanko end says although this is where Rabindranath  was born, the area has never been developed. Except for  the tram tracks it could not have looked much different  in his time. Opposite Raja Rajballabh Street is a heap with  a clock. Only its dial exists. In Chitpur, however, the  hands of time have never been idle. Artist Aditya Basak, whose family  has lived in Brindaban Basak Street for generations, says:  It is not safe to play chess on porches any longer. It  used to be the peoples favourite pastime. Marutis whizz  past. Malai barf is no longer sold by men who carry  it on their heads. They cart it around. Dark shops are gone.  They dazzle with lights. After Kumartuli is Lakshmi Apartments,  one of the several such concrete boxes that have appeared  of late in Chitpur. Clearly visible on a signboard next  to the entrance is the legend: Shree Lakshmi Flour Mills  Limited, that, as local people confirm, was demolished to  make way for the block of flats. The existing entrance itself  is too ornate and old to be the contemporary of the dwelling  house. A narrow jerrybuilding opposite  Lohia Matri Sewasadan has quite obviously supplanted a grand  house. The remains of a towering wall tells it all. Banamali Samanta, 52, stocks bellmetal  and brass utensils like 14 other shopkeepers of Natun Bazaar  next to Pathuriaghat Street. He produces a trade licence  that says the date of commencement of business was 1871.  His is the biggest such shop, and not surprisingly, he uses  electronic scales. He can afford high tech. Next to this is another stretch  where they sell wooden utensils for pujas and moulds for  sweets. Sunit Datta, 70, has been longest in this trade,  while Narayan Chandra Das, 43, runs the oldest establishment.  Besides the butterfly and lobster moulds for sandesh  they also display what look like wooden bowls but are actually  dies that give shape to the Bengali equivalent of Darby  and Joan in khowa. It is surprising that so much  of quintessential Chitpur has survived despite the onslaught  of thermocol and paper utensils. Opposite these shops is a sooty  signboard of the famous sweet shop K.C. Das that should  date back to the time when they created the rosogolla  by sheer chance. Opposite Charles Allen Market  is a busy offset printing press. The signboard, however,  says photogravure is done here. Chitpur is where the Bengali  publishing trade originated and it was once famous for its  litho presses and Kansaripara prints. Bookshops like Kalikata  Town Library and Diamond Library were synonymous with Bat-tala  publications. Their repertoire ranged from religion to the  risque. Now they subsist on transcribed jatras immensely  popular in the rural belts. Gopal Chandra Datta, 91, used  to be a master engraver. Now old and infirm, he is living  history. The two quaint women, Rama Nath, a maiden lady,  and sister Sandhya Ghoshal still ply their fathers trade,  block-making and engraving, though there are no takers. Interlinked with Rabindra Sarani  are Kumartuli, where clay deities are born, and the infamous  red-light district of Sonagachhi. Both spill into the street.  During festivals the pavements turn into artisans studios.  A few grimy brothels still exist in Sethbagan opposite Natun  Bazaar and next to Charles Allen market. The former house  of ill repute is a cage. The girls inside, incongruously  dressed in Western clothes are visible through a grate in  a grocery beneath their workplace.  But where does Rabindra Sarani  begin? From Baghbazar, or further down at the Galiff Street  intersection where the tram line terminates? Nobody seemed  to know. Then Kanchan Kumar Das, 75, steps down the marble  staircase of his dilapidated but picturesque house with  a Mohit Maitra Sarani address and explains that Rabindra  Sarani begins at the Baghbazar intersection. The entire  street up to Chitpur Approach Bridge was known as Upper  Chitpur. Much later, the tailend, Baghbazar onwards was  renamed after comrade Mohit Maitra. Das asked me if I had seen the  temple of Chiteswari, the goddess after whom Chitpur was  named, and to whom the dacoit Chite would pay obeisance  before going about his business. Bibibazar, where the temple  is situated, is separated from Baghbazar by half an hour  (on foot) of Cossipore Road. The thana is Chitpur.  Trucks and autorickshaws hurtle down the road like loose  cannons. The four-armed, fire-red image of Durga riding  a lion that resembles a unicorn is unmistakably Bengal but  the noise that passes for bhajan is in Hindi. Like  the neighbourhood, there is nothing Bengali about the shrine  save the script on the marble plaque. Chitpur is where the most spectacular  stately homes are situated but survival strategies are at  odds with gravity. Mullick Bhavan is better known as ghariwalla  Mullickbari because of its highly-visible clock that doesnt  work.  A family member has opened a medicine  shop under the thumping pediment. Fair-skinned, he sits  inside, dhoti hitched up to the knee. Inside, the  thakurdalan has been cut into as many slices as there  are family members. Only one slender column belonging to  another era has survived. The man-size vases and china elephants  inside a tiny room, too, speak of past prosperity. Shops selling bontis, the  kitchen knives gradually making their exit from Bengali  homes, and tin boxes encircle Jorasanko Rajbari. The faded  images of gods and goddesses straight out of late 19th century  oleographs are painted on the thakurdalan walls.  The building, with a section meant for residence hidden  from public gaze, is not in good shape. Pritindranarayan  Roy, 63, himself a lawyer like most of the descendants of  Raja Ramchandra Roy originally of Posta, admits they are  crippled. They lost their zamindari in 1953 and in 1981,  the state government took over the slums of the Rajabazar  that they owned. Lohia Matri Sewasadan may be a  maternity home now. But once it belonged to Haren Sil of  legendary profligacy. In keeping with his character the  house resembles Raj Bhavan complete with the imperial lion. Close to this end is the milk  market. Vans and canisters occupy the road and pavement.  A spindly Marwari girl in bottom-hugging jeans runs out  of Halwasiya Road and jumps on her boyfriends motorbike.  Just another facet of the prism that is Chitpur.

 Saturday, April 26, 2003 				 Green suit on Brigade sparks row over control
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Who controls the Maidan  the army or the police? This was the crux of the debate when the issue of pollution at Brigade Parade Ground came up for hearing in the high court on Friday.																								Appearing for Fort William, advocate Uttam Majumdar told the court that there were several documents to prove the ground fell under the jurisdiction of the army. The division bench, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice J. Biswas, then asked the state government, the city police and the army to file affidavits on their stand relating to the issue. The matter will come up for hearing again after four weeks, the court said.																								Environmental activist Subhas Dutta filed the case, alleging that Brigade was losing its charm because of a lack of proper maintenance. Dutta, in his petition, alleged that many of the trees had been felled, and anti-social activities were carried out there at night. He sought the intervention of the court to save the Maidan. 																								The army had shown special interest in the matter and said that it, too, wanted betterment of the ground. 																								Meanwhile, some non-government organisations working for the betterment of the city have expressed their desire to become parties to the case. 																								One of them, however, has made a proper application before the court in this regard. Forum for Calcutta, a welfare organisation, has asserted that the  heart of the city should be saved at any cost.

 Wednesday, July 23, 2003 				 College plan at Jadavpur TB hospital
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Non-resident-Indian doctor K.P. Chowdhury has expressed interest in setting up a 100-seat medi-cal college on the 62-acre grounds that house state-run Kumud Shankar Roy TB Hospital in Jadavpur. Director of medical education C.R. Maity said on Tuesday a memorandum of understanding will be signed on July 25. Chowdhury runs a hospital in the US and another in Malaysia.																								Health officials said another UK-based group had backed out of a similar pact signed with the government two years ago.																								Chowdhury proposes to set up a medical college with a 300-bed hospital in the TB hospital compound. The government will lease the land to him and the project has been estimated to cost about Rs 100 crore. However, a portion of the TB hospital will remain as it is, an official said.																								Chowdhury has visited the site twice and submitted a project report to the government.

 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 Lawyer meet to protect protest rights
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Advocates across the country have decided not to give up their rights to launch democratic movements, including strikes, to pressurise the government into conceding to their demands. 																								A decision to this effect was taken at a two-day meeting convened by the Bar Council of India in New Delhi, starting February 9. It was also decided that bar councils of all states and bar associations of all courts across the country would file petitions before the apex court seeking revision of a recent judgment by the Supreme Court which banned lawyers from either resorting to ceasework or strike.																								Members of the Bar Councils Bengal unit had to withdraw its 46-day-old strike to protest the court fee hike in the wake of the apex courts judgment. They also faced flak from state minister for law and judicial affairs Nisith Adhikari and other government officials for continuing the strike for such a long period.																								West Bengal Bar Council chairman Amiya Chatterjee, a participant at the Delhi meet, said on Saturday that a few bar associations from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh had already filed petitions before the apex court, demanding the withdrawal of the judgment delivered on December 17. All the members were vocal against the apex courts verdict. We want the court to reconsider its directive, he said.																								nOffice raided: Miscreants raided a businessmans office in Hare Street and snatched Rs 1 lakh at gunpoint.

 Wednesday, May 21, 2003 				 Malign blitz, says Biswas
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 H. Lalawizaura, Mizoram House receptionist, was detained by NCB officials for questioning on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) additional director Upen Biswas has accused critics and vested interests of hatching a conspiracy to malign him. The arrest of five foreigners from my house on charges of drug-running is not a conspiracy. But the subsequent statements of certain persons smacks of it, he added, on Tuesday. Biswas named former Bihar chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, alleging he was in violation of the Supreme Court in demanding Biswas arrest after the raid.																								Laloo has compared his role in the fodder scam with that of mine in this case, violating a condition slapped on him by the apex court when he was given bail, Biswas alleged. According to Biswas, the apex court had directed Laloo Prasad not to make any public reference to the merits of the fodder scam. He appealed to the CBI to move the Supreme Court to quash Laloos bail.																								Biswas said he had fulfilled all the regulations in renting his house. He had not verified San Niang Thangas antecedents as an employee of Mizoram Emporium, named Mathani, had brought him to the house several times. Thanga, said Biswas, had introduced himself as a trader who would buy materials here and send them to Shillong.																								The former CBI man had not noticed the five mens activities. He stressed it was not his duty to keep tabs on them, adding that he had seen Thanga on the morning of May 17, but when sleuths raided the house that afternoon, he had vanished.

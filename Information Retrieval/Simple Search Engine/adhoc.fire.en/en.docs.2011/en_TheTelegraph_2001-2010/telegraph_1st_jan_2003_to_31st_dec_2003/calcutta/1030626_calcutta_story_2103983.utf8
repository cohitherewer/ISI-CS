 A STAFF REPORTER																								Tension ran high at Bidhannagar Government High School, in Salt Lake, as students of the school prevented those from elsewhere from submitting admission forms for the science stream in Higher Secondary (HS). The students demanded those among them who had scored above 75 per cent in Madhyamik and wanted to study science be given admission on priority.																								The agitation was launched on Tuesday. It took a turn for the worse on Wednesday, when some students of other schools forced the authorities to accept their admission forms. 																								Some of our students raised objections. They wanted their quota to be extended, admitted headmaster Bibhubhushan Talapatra. However, our institution is directly controlled by the government and we have to abide by its admission rules, he added.																								The school has 96 seats for the HS science stream, with 48 seats each for internal and external candidates. Nearly 35 internal students, who had scored above 75 per cent, did not get admission forms. They demonstrated outside the school on Tuesday and forced the authorities to stall the admission process. 																								On Wednesday, they blocked external students from submitting their forms. But the angry guardians of the external students demanded that forms be received. Some students and guardians forced me to accept the admission forms outside the receiving counter, Talapatra said. The schools students said it was unfair not to allow them to take up science.

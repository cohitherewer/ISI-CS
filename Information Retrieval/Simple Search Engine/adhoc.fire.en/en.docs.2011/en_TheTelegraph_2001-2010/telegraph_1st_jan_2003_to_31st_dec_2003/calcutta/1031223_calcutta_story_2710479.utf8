 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Annual call for creative fun
 A war of words in progress at Xavotsav. Picture by Pabitra  Das  It was that time of year once  again, when the call for creativity was sent out and responded  to enthusiastically by the youth of the city. The occasion  was Xavotsav 03, the annual fest of St Xaviers College,  Calcutta, held on the college campus, from December 20 to  22, by and for the students.

The fest was inaugurated on December 19  in the auditorium. The first event was the Turncoat debate.  The prelims were held on the topic of a uniform civil code  being necessary and possible in India. Six top teams qualified  for the finals in a battle of wits and words on the issue  of Indian democracy being a pseudo system.				 				 																															Up next was Mind Your Tongue, a medley with the usual rounds of spin-a-yarn, skit direction and dumb charade. The final on-stage event of the day was Mere Dhun Tumhare Geet, the antakshari, with a maximum participation of three students for each team.

	Right words ECPAT International, in association with PLAN India, had organised an Orientation and Validation Seminar Against Commercial and Sexual Exploitation of Children in India, in New Delhi, on December 18 and 19. The two organisations are launching pilot projects in four affected countries of Asia  India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Indonesia. These nations had acceded to, and in most cases ratified, the Convention of Child Rights (CRC) about a decade ago.				 				 																															This project on legal reform and research will monitor the implementation of international instruments like the UN, CRC, optional protocols and Yokohama Global Commitment. It will also research the implementation of the laws of these countries. Natasha Sen, legal consultant of ECPAT, said: The ultimate aim is to identify gaps and areas in need of enhancement in order to make recommendations for legal reform in these countries.				 				 																															A panel discussion on commercial and sexual exploitation of children in India saw NGOs talking about their work, the problems they face and the good practices they follow. Prerna from Mumbai, Sanlaap from Calcutta, Haq from Delhi, Association of Gandhian Studies, Hyderabad, Indian Committee of Youth Organisations, Delhi, and Equations from Bangalore narrated their experiences during rescue, repatriation and rehabilitation of children. 				 				 																															In an open discussion, a participant pointed out that the problem is not just restricted to children from red-light areas. During a session on legal and social barriers, Ashley Verghese, a lawyer from Mumbai, and Tapati Bhowmick from Calcutta briefed everyone on the legal routes. It was surprising to know that the judges themselves were often not aware of new laws and amendments.				 				 																															The last discussion was on law enforcement, legislation and policy, with panellists comprising representatives from the police, National Human Rights Commission and NGOs. Chhaya Sharma, a policewoman from Delhi, spoke on how the police needs proper sensitisation.				 				 																															Day II began with a recap of the previous day. Mark Erik Hecht from ECPAT identified partnership, implementation, enforcement and coordination as the solutions. Natasha Sen gave the methodology of the legal research project in India. Considering children as partners, a session on childrens consultation, was also held. It was decided that a national task force would be formed to organise these meets. A working group for legal research and childrens consultation was also organised.  Sangeet Shirodkar,

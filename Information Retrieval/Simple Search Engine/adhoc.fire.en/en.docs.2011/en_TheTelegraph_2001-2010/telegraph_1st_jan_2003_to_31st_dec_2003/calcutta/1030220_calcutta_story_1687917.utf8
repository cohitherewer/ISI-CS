The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hayavadana
 Girish Karnads Hayavadana appears on the Calcutta stage once again, this time in a multi-lingual interpretation from Theatricians. The quot;visually stunning quot; play, put up by students from city schools and colleges, is the first professional production for many of the actors. While there are some lines delivered in Bengali and Hindi, apart from minimal editing, the play stays true to Karnads text, exploring themes of identity, friendship and love through the title character Hayavadana, a man with a horses head. Running at a little over two hours, this is a first directorial venture for Prithviraj Choudhury, a post-graduate student of Jadavpur University.When: Today at 6.30 pmWhere:  Copyright

				 FREE NO MORE: Morning-walkers on a stroll  by Rabindra Sarobar 				 																																																																				 Incidents of patients missing from hospitals, specially from government hospitals, have become frequent nowadays (Patient missing, City Diary, Metro, January 2). Once a patient is admitted, it is the duty of the hospital authorities to keep him or her under proper protection. In no case can the hospital authorities deny their responsibility for a patient going missing after admission. Some strict measures need be taken immediately to put an end to incidents of such disappearances. I have certain suggestions in this regard: 				 																																													2A distinct mark may be put, preferably on the forehead of a patient, at the time of admission.				 																																													2Patients should not be allowed to use the lift unless accompanied by doctors or nurses. At the time of admission or release, the relatives may accompany a patient in the lift, if permitted.				 																																													2The patients should have no access to the roof of the hospitals.				 																																													2In front of each stair case on the ground floor and exit point, security officials should be posted round the clock.				 																																													2In case of any suspicion, security officials should have every right to interrogate the patients.				 																																													This may help in minimising cases of patients disappearing from hospitals.				 																																													Dinabandhu Mukherjee,				 																																													Behala.				 																																																																				While appreciating the recent move by the Central and state governments to declare Rabindra Sarobar a national lake, we are dismayed to learn that there are plans to introduce an entry fee (Fork out a fee for a whiff of fresh lake air, Metro, December 28). The Maidan has already shrunk considerably and introduction of entry fees will prevent many from enjoying their daily stroll at the lakes. This will also make it difficult for organisers to hold sports and other recreational activities, which have been a part of the lakes since the early 30s.				 																																													Rabindra Sarobar Nagarik Committee,				 																																													Pratapaditya Place.				 																																													lWhose brainchild is this joggers path? This is nothing but a clever ploy to impose an entry fee on morning-walkers. The day is not far off when the government will charge a fee for a view of the Hooghly.				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Apropos the report New borns found dead and dying (Metro, December 28), it is shocking to note that so many babies have been abandoned in recent months in the city. It is an irony that when childless couples are craving to adopt abandoned babies, some barbarous couples forsake parenthood to save themselves from social stigma.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 				 				 																																																					Apropos the report Hitler after all these years (Metro, December 30), it is heartening to note that Santigopal is reappearing on stage in his famous role in Biswatrash Hitler after nearly two decades. His performances as Hitler and Lenin are still vivid in our memory. It is really surprising that an actor of the calibre of Santigopal has kept himself aloof from the public for such a long time. We are however eagerly awaiting his portrayal of Rabindranath Tagore in the days ahead.				 																																													Rabindranath Kar,				 																																													Sankar Ghosh Lane.				 																																													lI had the privilege of watching Santigopal in Tarun Operas Hitler and Lenin palas during my stay in Jamshedpur, where jatras were a must during the Pujas. Kudos to the jatra legend for staging a comeback at 65.				 																																													B.N. Bose,				 																																													Dum Dum Park.				 																																																																				It is distressing to note that the recently published revised JEE syllabus is full of printing mistakes (Board booklet of bloomers published, Metro, December 31). 				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																													Lake Town .				 																																																																				Apropos the report Turned down (Metro, January 2), the family of Sonali Bose, a medical college intern killed by the police on Agra-Mathura Road in July, have done the right thing by declining to accept a cheque for Rs 25,000 from the UP government. The amount of the compensation is actually an insult.				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia.

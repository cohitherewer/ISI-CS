  Chock-a-block: A routine rally on  city streets Apropos the report Mob fury hurts hospital published in Metro on April 14, it is distressing to note that an errant mob ransacked the outdoor department of Assembly of God Church Hospital while demanding the release of the body of a patient who succumbed to stab injuries.  It was made clear by the hospital authorities that since the fatal stab on the body of the patient was the reason behind his death, the body could not be handed over without the concurrence of police. But the angry demonstrators turned a deaf ear to the reasoning of the hospital authorities and went on a rampage spree.  This unfortunate episode is the glaring example of the deteriorating condition of the law and order in the city where miscreants hold sway. The situation has reached such a nadir that people take the law in their own hands under the very nose of law-enforcing authorities.  The incident points to the imperative need of taking necessary remedial measures. Otherwise this irrationality among the masses may spell doom for the law and order condition of the state which the present government boasts of.  Piyal Mukherjee,  Lake Town.  The report Minister in rally jam rescued by traffic commandos (Metro, April 11) was of great interest to us. Henceforth, the honourable minister will know how teeming millions have to daily suffer the traffic snarls caused by rallies brought out by his partymen.  Govinda Bakshi,  Budge Budge.  Ministers are fortunate creatures  who can be hurriedly escorted out of a traffic jam by commandos.  The youth wing of the leftist party will surely allow a  minister of their party to pass by but will compel a patient  to die in waiting ambulances. Is this not double standards?  Debaprasad Mukherjee,  Nayapatty Road.  lIt is such a regret that when  a minister is stuck in a traffic jam, the newspapers highlight  the incident. But the motive of the rally for which the  entire garments industry is fighting was not even worth  a mention.  Sandip Raja,  Address not given.  Bravo to the obedient police force  which was spurred into action on a rally-choked Park Street  to rescue minister Asok Bhattacharya stuck in the stagnant  sea of traffic. Rallies, we are told, are a democratic right  of politicians, giving them the right to choke the city  for long hours. Long live such rights as long as the leaders  are not at the suffering end themselves.  Mohan Lal Sarkar,  Budge Budge.  The report Flyover debut spells doom for arteries (Metro, April 9) was thought-provoking. Larsen amp; Toubros promise to open the AJC Bose Road flyover to traffic on August 15 is a relief but what about the state of the roads below? Sufficient funds should be provided to repair them simultaneously.  T.R. Anand,  Address not given.  Apropos the report Father conned in school entry (Metro, April 19), the sordid episode bears testimony to the fact that a section of guardians belonging to the creamy layer of society is ready to do anything to get their wards admitted into reputed schools.  Prahlad Agarwala,  Majdia, Nadia.  Apropos the report 500 private buses enter CSTC routes (Metro, April 11), it is a real surprise that though Calcutta is crowded with traffic, permits for 500 more private buses are being issued. The proposal, if implemented, will create further chaos after so many auto-rickshaws were allowed on the roads. Although it may appear that the permits are being issued on public demand, this step might just be a sop before the panchayat elections for party workers as employment opportunities in other sectors look grim.  Tathagata Kar,  Kailash Bose Street.

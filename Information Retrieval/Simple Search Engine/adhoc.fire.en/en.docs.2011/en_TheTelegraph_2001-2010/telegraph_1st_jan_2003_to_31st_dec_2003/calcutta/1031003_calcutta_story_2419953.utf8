The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 03, 2003  Sing a popular paean to peace 
 If the world was a pandal,  it would have been a happier place to live in. Metro  picks the principal theme of the Pujas and catches a glimpse  of other focal points, from movies to mining, feminism to  the futuristic 
	Peace reigns this Puja, at least in the pandals.  Mohammad Ali Park leads the peace pack, with gun-toting  asuras  mingling with contemporary faces of  evil (Osama bin Laden and all that)  surrounding  the goddess. But what shines through are the messengers  of peace in pristine white. The theme is reinforced  with the pandal resembling a Kampuchean Buddha temple.  Peace is the paean at several other puja destinations   Barisha Sarbojanin in Sabornopara, where a 24-ft-high  Buddha towers over the pandal, Mahisasura begs for  forgiveness and a benign Durga stands with folded  hands; FE Block Sarbojanin Durgotsav, Salt Lake, where  Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne ask Juddha kore korbi  ki ta bol; Ekdalia Evergreen Club, Babubagan  Sarbojanin the list of peacemakers goes on. Om  Shanti, Shanti, Shanti Sheldon  Colliery, pit no. 9; Shaft D.C; Avg production: 180  tonnes a day. At Aaikatan, Selimpur, the lift screeches  up with another load of coal and the ropeway carries  it off to the storehouse.

Barisha  Sahajatri picks 13 films with a puja connection  from  Pather Panchali to Anushandhan, Paroma  to Devdas. The puja site is a studio floor, complete  with reflectors, camera and trolley. The puja is being  shot and screened live, along with a 90-second film  created using clips from the chosen films  Its  yesterday, today, tomorrow, at Palli Asar, New Alipore.  Three Durgas, placed side by side, from three time zones.  Durga 1953 is a diminutive ekchala model, the  traditional mother figure, complete with a haarikath  for sacrifice and a live goat tied to it. Durga 2003  strikes a pose, with intricate designs in clay making  up the sari and the ornaments. Durga 2053, on the October  page of a calendar 50 years later, is confined to a  place on a garage wall. Theres no other space for the  goddess left in tomorrows world Womans  emancipation is the theme at Tarun Sangha, Dum Dum Park,  where a sylph emerges from a large luminous globe surrounded  by demons. On the walls, Durga  in true Maqbool Fida  Husain style  is depicted as ordinary women, but all  with the third eye. The curvaceous pandal, vaguely resembling  a womans body, is supported by 51 pillars, symbolising  the pithasthans

 Monday, March 17, 2003 				 Pavement patch-up in Metropolitan makeover
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								As the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) gets ready to give a new lease of life to Metropolitan Building, on Chowringhee, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has promised to do its bit. 																								We will do up the pavements and keep hawkers behind the barricade to be put up around the building, promised mayor Subrata Mukherjee. 																								The LIC has sanctioned a fund of Rs 5 crore to restore the architectural beauty of the building, after applying to the CMC for permission to barricade the pavements on Chowringhee and S.N. Banerjee Road.																								More than a century after Mackintosh Burn constructed Metropolitan Building, it has been entrusted with the task of restoring the Esplanade landmark that gives the areas skyline its character. 																								Six years of tug-of-war between the CMC and the LIC have ended in the latter engaging Mackintosh Burn to rejuvenate the building, making it the third major city landmark  after the Town Hall and Currency Building  to be given the makeover.																								The restoration work will be complete within 18 months, said architect Dulal Mukherjee; Dulal Mukherjee and Associates has been appointed a consultant by the LIC for the project.																								The job will follow the standards set by the mock-restoration work done on part of the facade on the southern side of the building, abutting on S.N. Banerjee Road, say officers.

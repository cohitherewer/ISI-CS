 Saturday, September 27, 2003 				 Initiative for cut flower supply boost
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Calcutta-based floriculture firm has started commercial production and a research facility for tissue culture plants and cut flowers. Elegant Flower Companys 2500-sq-m, climate-controlled greenhouse has been set up with technical support from Netafim, an Israeli firm. 																								Technology like drip irrigation, fogging and overhead mist will be utilised to grow cut flowers like gerbera, anthurium, carnation and dendrobium orchids.																								Most local cut flowers come from Bangalore, Pune, Coimbatore and Cochin, catering to the eastern region demand for over 20,000 flowers a day. The local initiative should bring down the prices by between 30 and 40 per cent, claimed company officials. 																								The company has tied-up with concerns in Holland, Thailand and Japan to market hybrid tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumbers and English vegetables in the eastern region.																								West Bengal ranks third in flower production in India and is poised for advances in floriculture, said Sailen Sarkar, minister for food processing and horticulture, after the company announced its plans on Friday. 																								Elegant has also begun producing a variety of bananas poised to hit the market, and is researching into the commercial prospects of medicinal and ornamental plants locally.

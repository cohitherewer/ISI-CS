 Friday, November 21, 2003 				 Mother killed like father 11 months ago
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The 34-year-old daily labourer killed his father 11 months ago. He murdered his 65-year-old mother in a similar manner on Wednesday night  by dropping a stone slab on her chest. 																								Balia Rana is known in his locality as a mentally-deranged person. A resident of Atal Sur Road, in Tangra, Rana had been freed on bail only a month-and-a-half ago. He was arrested on January 12 after he had smashed his fathers head with a stone slab on being refused pocket money.																								On Wednesday night, at around 9.30, Rana, in a fit of rage, killed his mother, Champa Devi Rana. 																								Surprisingly, he did not flee, but stood close to his mothers body, with a vacant look, till the police arrived, nearly half an hour later, and arrested him, said Minta Devi, Champa Devis sister-in-law.																								Kiran, Ranas nephew, who lives in the same house, said he was at a game of carrom with his friends when he heard a thud, followed by a shriek from his house. He ran in to find his grandmother lying limp on the floor and Rana staring down at her. I called my friends and locked the door from outside till the police arrived. A doctor was treating Rana for some time for depression, Kiran said.																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said Rana is mentally deranged. The motive for the murder is not revenge or anything else, only anger, he said.																								Rana has been remanded in judicial custody till December 4.

 Sunday, May 25, 2003 				 Leeds peers, not govt, mourn Amit
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Oh my God! This is terrible news. He was so helpful. May his soul rest in peace  Angela, Leeds University.																								Hundreds of e-mails and condolence messages are flooding the Dalmia residence from Amits friends abroad. But not a line from either Reliance Infocomm or the state government reached the household on the day of the 25-year-olds shradh ceremony.																								Twelve days after Amit Dalmia died while driving down Camac Street, relatives and friends thronged the Dalmia residence on Ritchie Road to pay homage to the youth. Amits life was cut short by a Reliance Infocomm metal strip, jutting out of the road, that pierced through the bottom of his car and ripped his lungs and heart.																								From early morning, father Santosh Dalmia, mother Kusum and brothers Vishal and Ashis, received visitors. It was a quiet affair confined to the near and dear ones, said Vishal. Special prayers were held during the day.																								No one from either Reliance Infocomm or the state government bothered to pay a visit or send a condolence message to the bereaved family. We havent received any message from them and we dont even want anything from them at all, said Dalmia. 																								Ashis and Vishal talked of the hundreds of e-mails from Amits friends. The messages from his friends at the Leeds University Business School are overwhelming, said elder brother Vishal. Amit, who had just returned after completing his MBA in finance, was planning to go abroad again. His friends called to say how helpful he was. They were all looking forward to catch up with him again. But destiny played a cruel joke, added Vishal.																								On May 28, the government will initiate a dialogue with Reliance and the Corporation to discuss the issue. But Dalmia is not impressed. This is none of my concern. I am going ahead with my plans of fighting for my dear son. I will consult my lawyers on Monday, he said.

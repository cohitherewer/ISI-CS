The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, March 15, 2003 				 From cell on cell, a goon rules roost
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								After Aftab Ansari, its Jishu Jain. Officials have stumbled upon the fact that Jishu, last arrested in 2000 and with several charges of murder and extortion against him, has been running his business from behind bars in Alipore Central jail. Using several dozen cellphones  mostly belonging to the people who have been visiting him in prison  Jishu has been networking with his men spread between Calcutta and Mumbai.																								A special investigation team, set up in February 2001, has found out, mostly from tapped calls, that Jishu has distributed 32 motorcycles and 51 cellphones among his aides in the three years he has spent behind bars.																								Between petitioning the Supreme Court for bail  the plea was turned down in January this year  and fretting over the cases the police have lined up, Jishu has found time to monitor and facilitate operations from Shakuntala Park, in Behala, to Mumbai, say officials.																								Most of the motorcycles were stolen and had documents regularised from transport department offices in Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa, the officials said. The cellphones were commandeered from businessmen and promoters, they added.																								Two of Jishus associates have a large office, supplying building material, at Shakuntala Park, in Behala, say police officials. We are aware that Jishu is a partner in the company but cannot take any action as nothing is documented, South 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Singh said. Officials say Jishus mother, Sadhana, is in charge of operations in Mumbai. 																								The investigation team, which has followed Jishus operations from prison for the past two years, was set up after it was discovered that the trail of a murder  that of a Barisha High School employee on the campus in February 2001 (a couple of months after his arrest)  ultimately led to Jishus cell in Alipore Central jail. It was Jishu who sent two aides to kill Golak Sen, a senior South 24-Parganas official said.

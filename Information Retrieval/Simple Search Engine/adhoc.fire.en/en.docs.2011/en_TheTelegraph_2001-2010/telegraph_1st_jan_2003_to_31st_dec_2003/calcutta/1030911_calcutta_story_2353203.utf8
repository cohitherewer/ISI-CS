 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcuttas dream of floating the countrys first underwater tracks  a Metro Rail route linking the east of the city to the west at Howrah, cutting through the Hooghly  inched closer to reality on Wednesday.																								A team from the Japan Economic Trade Organisation (Jetro)  a wing of the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation  met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings on Wednesday to discuss two projects, one of which is the Metro Railway scheme. The proposed Metro line, running beneath the Hooghly, will connect Ramrajatala to Rajarhat. 																								Representatives from Pacific Consultant International (consultants for the project) were among the nine-member Japanese team, which had also discussed the projects with chief secretary S.N.

The underwater tracks, running along 17.09 km, start from New Town, cut through Salt Lake, Phoolbagan, Narkeldanga, Sealdah, Bowbazar, Dalhousie, Howrah station, Howrah Maidan, Kadamtala and Dasnagar, finally ending at Ramrajatala.																								A feasibility study on the Metro Railway will start on Thursday, according to chief minister Bhattacharjee.

The Japanese government is showing great interest in both the projects, the chief minister added.																								The other project, a bridge linking Calcutta to Haldia and making connectivity between the two places possible within an hour and 15 minutes, is almost complete, except a few technicalities like the mandatory clearance from the environment department, said chief minister Bhattacharjee. 																								The feasibility study on the bridge between Raichak and Kukrahati across the Hooghly had been completed before schedule.																								The state government has formed a committee, led by the chief executive officer of Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), to co-ordinate the projects with the Japanese team. The team is scheduled to visit Calcutta in December again.																								The transport department, CMDA and Metro Railway had presented a report to the Japanese team when it visited the city in April this year.

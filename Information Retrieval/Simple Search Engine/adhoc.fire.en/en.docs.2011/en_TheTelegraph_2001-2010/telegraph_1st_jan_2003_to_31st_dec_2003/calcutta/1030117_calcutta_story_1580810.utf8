 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 Autonomy push for health schools
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government is planning to make institutes like the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER) more autonomous for smoother functioning. This was stated by health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra at a function to mark the 46th anniversary of IPGMER in a hospital on Thursday. The government will give more emphasis on the decentralisation of the health system.																								Our plans for creating more centres of excellence in city hospitals and institutes like the IPGMER will receive a big boost once they enjoy more autonomy, said Mishra.																								The government has drawn up elaborate plans to construct state-of-the-art laboratories exclusively for the use of government hospitals. 																								Later, director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said an existing laboratory on Kyd Street will be revamped to establish a super-speciality lab for conducting all clinical tests in future.																								A tie-up between Westbank Hospital and SSKM Hospital to open a centre of excellence in plastic and reconstructive surgery at the latter hospital is on the cards. 																								Although, the MoU is yet to be signed, the final round of talks are on between the two parties, Chatterjee added.

																																																		The death of Meena Dutta, 45, at MR Bangur Hospital sparked trouble between the hospital authorities and the patients kin on Saturday night. Dutta was admitted to the hospital last Wednesday for a gall bladder operation. On Saturday evening, her condition took a turn for the worse half an hour after the surgery. She died around 11.30 pm. A little after midnight, Duttas family found a police team in front of the operating theatre. Soon after, Dutta was declared dead. Her family alleged that the authorities had deliberately delayed informing them of her death. An altercation started between the family and the hospital staff, which soon snowballed into a scuffle. Later, the family left with Duttas body.																																																		Voters can check their names on the draft roll at local polling premises from Monday.

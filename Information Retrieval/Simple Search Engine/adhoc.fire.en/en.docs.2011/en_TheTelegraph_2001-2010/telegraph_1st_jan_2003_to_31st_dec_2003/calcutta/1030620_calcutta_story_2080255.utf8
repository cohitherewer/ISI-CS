The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, June 20, 2003 				 Fashion address on the wild side
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 NIFT creations on the ramp: Check em out on the racks																								Designer clothes, body piercing, tattoos and mocktails For now. Pub F is all set to bring the fun n freaky to fashion, at a pocket-friendly price.																								Lifestyle is the key at the fashion hangout, slated to open in July. Young National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) graduates, an event manager and a businessman  all based in Calcutta  have put together the concept that will be launched small, at a 350 sq ft place at Chakraberia Road, before stirring things up elsewhere in the city, as well as in Bangalore.																								After testing the Calcutta waters with the smaller outlet, another is to follow, on Russell Street, which is set to shake things up on the party circuit. Though the management is wary of revealing too many details before the unveiling, a new concept in club  blending fashion, music, dance and flair bartending  is what they promise.																								Fashion may be central to Pub F, but to guests, it will appear to be almost incidental. Designers will be available by appointment only, explains Vijay Bokadia of Moksh Events, which is behind promotions for the stores. Also involved in the venture are designers Indhranil and Devarati Ray, and businessmen Pawan and Nikunj Rajpuria.																								A few garments  with Japanese fabrics to be the signature touch  will be casually draped around the outlets. There will be no hovering salespeople, anxious to seal a deal.																								If you want, explains Vijay, you could buy something. Or else, just get a drink and chill out on a bean bag. That doesnt mean sales wont be a priority. If you hang around, you will experience the clothes, and chances of a buy will be greater. To suit the teen market usually on the lookout for a bargain, Pub F promises designer clothes for as low as Rs 400 or Rs 500.																								Every weekend, there will be an event to keep the crowds hooked. It could mean body tattoos, or the less dramatic (and more permanent) mehndi will be part of the package. Piercing, hair styling, makeover magic The idea is to get even the most reluctant and stuffy to let their hair down.																								Intoxication, a Delhi-based bar-tending institute, has been roped in to teach the guys behind the bar how to mix things up in style. From having bottles flying through the air to flaming chasers lit up once the shot is in your mouth, Pub F is straining to take a walk on the wild side.

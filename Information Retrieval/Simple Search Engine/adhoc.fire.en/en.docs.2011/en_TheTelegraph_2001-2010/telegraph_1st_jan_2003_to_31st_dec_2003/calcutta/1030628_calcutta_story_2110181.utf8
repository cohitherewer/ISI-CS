 Saturday, June 28, 2003 				 College shuts out headmaster
 																											- Principal takes legal path after lobby flouts panel, party order TAMAL SENGUPTA 																								A college in south Calcutta is headless because its governing body, controlled by the CPM, will not allow a principal appointed by the West Bengal College Service Commission from joining duty. Bikash Ghosh, a professor of physics who had been chosen by the Commission as principal of Dinabandhu Andrews College, in Garia, last April, has moved Alipore court accusing the governing body of blocking his entry into the college, in defiance of the Commissions directive as well as an order from the CPM leadership.																								We have informed the college that we stand by our recommendation in favour of Ghosh, said Ajit Banik, chairman of the Commission. He has an excellent track record and possesses strong academic credentials, which makes him suitable for the post of principal. We have recommended the appointment of principals in 39 college and, as far as I know, Dinabandhu Andrews is the only college that has blocked our recommendation, Banik claimed.																								The CPM members on the governing body are bent on keeping Ghosh out, though that means violating directives from education czar Anil Biswas and Left Front chairman Biman Bose. The college governing body is believed to have withheld the appointment order, which forced Ghosh to move court. 																								The principal claims he made every possible attempt to get hold of the appointment letter. Even after his meeting with Politburo members Anil Biswas and Biman Bose, the college authorities did not forward him the appointment letter. Ghosh was informed by the College Service Commission of his appointment as principal on April 4 last year. 																								The authorities of the college had approached the Commission in 2001 requesting help for filling up the vacant post of principal, after Haraprasad Samaddar left the college to join the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education as its president. 																								The Commission recommended Ghosh. But the college authorities turned down the recommendation and wrote to the Commission, asking it to reconsider its decision. The powerful CPM lobby in the governing body wanted vice-principal Tarun Gupta to head the college. 																								Banik said the Commission had ignored the college appeal for a reconsideration of its decision recommending Ghosh, who had duly applied for the post and passed the screening test.

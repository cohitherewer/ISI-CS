The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 09, 2003  Song sung true
 An Eye on Calcutta / Barry  O Brien Its that time of the year again  when rosy-cheeked Tibetan ladies come to Calcutta to sell  even pinker pullovers and sweaters. Its that time of the  year again when the decibel level at the Alipore Zoo rises,  as migratory birds twitter away in their temporary home.  Sadly their decibel level decreases as that of the city  goes up. Its that time of the year again when the once-a-Calcuttan-always-a-Calcuttan  brigade comes home to raise a toast to family, friends and  fellowship.  Truly, theres no place like home   particularly if home is Calcutta and the time is December.  Everything adds up  the numbers that tell the mercury story  and the numbers that tell the nativity story. Everythings  just right.  Everything was just right a couple  of days ago on the grounds of the oldest cricket club outside  England, the CC amp;FC. A 50-strong choir had come down  from their home in The Childrens City to bring joy to the  city that is already known by that three-letter word. Before  I tell you how and how much joy they packed into that one  evening, lets dwell on why Kalimpong has deservedly earned  the sobriquet, The Childrens City. It all began in 1900 when a Scotsman  picked up six helpless children and took them home. In fact,  he built one for them  on the hillside of Kalimpong dominated  by the eternally snow-topped peak of Kanchenjunga. A hundred  and three years on, the home, a 500-acre magic maze of  greenery, has daughters, sons, and flowers, all growing  in perfect sync with nature and with one another. Over the  last century, Dr Grahams Homes has been home, nursery and  school to some 10,000 children who have blossomed into caring  people who can look life straight in the eye, with a smile  on their lips.  It was with a smile on their lips,  courage in their hearts and punch in their voices, that  they made the evening so extraordinary at The Childrens  City in Concert. They flowed from the beat of Harry  Belafontes Banana Boat Song to A.R. Rehmans Shakalaka  Baby with as much ease as they swung from the rhythm  of Bombay Vikings Tera Mera Pyar to Oh! Happy  Day from Sister Act II. The repertoire was Tendulkaresque,  the grace Laxmanish, the timing Gangulian. In the audience,  Russi Modys piano-sharp fingers played notes on his knees  and a few thousand others spent some to support a cause.  The cheese from the DGH farm and flowers from its greenhouse  sold out before you could say, Encore. Shane Saviel, self-taught  and super-talented, conducted the choir as it experimented  with Ronan Keatings If Tomorrow Never Comes before  signing off with every childs Christmas signature, Jingle  Bells.  The spirit of the Homes will jingle  all the way as long as it has Santa Claus incarnations giving  continuous and consistent support. Michael Robertson, Chairman  of the Homes, honoured a few of these Santas in mufti as  he inducted Philip Magor of Williamson Tea, Subi Sanyal,  former sheriff of Calcutta, Sumit Mazumder of TIL, and The  Telegraph as ambassadors of DGH. As Aniruddha Lahiri,  Managing Director, ABP Ltd., walked on stage to receive  the honour on behalf of The Telegraph, two incredible  little champions came to mind: Pooja was a five-year-old  looking for her next meal from the same garbage dump that  her parents were picking rags from; Toofan was lying in  a gutter, pus oozing from every sore, dying  surely!  Anamika Gupta, a teenager who  couldnt look the other way, brought Pooja to us at The  Telegraph Education Foundation; Sister Cyril, a nun who  never looks the other way, picked up Toofan and took him  to a caring Doctor at the Calcutta National Medical College.  As Poojas rag-picker mother prayed for a miracle to take  her daughter away to a life worth living, Toofan was nursed  back to life, having lost a kidney. Pooja and Toofan, who  give the term street fighter a different connotation altogether,  were spontaneously adopted by DGH at The Telegraph School  Awards for Excellence ceremony a couple of years ago. Today,  Pooja is an intelligent bubbly girl in Class V; she loves  going for long walks, talking to friends and flowers alike.  Toofan is just that  a storm! On stage hes Michael Jackson  doing the moonwalk, on the playing field hes Michael Jordan  doing his wiz-tricks. Teachers and cottage parents dote  on Pooja and get carried away with Toofan, just as they  do with so many other special children in the Home carved  out of a barren hillside by Dr John Anderson Graham. Young singers from Dr Grahams  Homes in Kalimpong perform at 
 The Childrens City in Concert at CC amp;FC We too could play our part by  adopting a Pooja or a Toofan. Lets go across to Birkmiyre  Hostel on Middleton Row, the Homes Calcutta Office, or  log on to www.drgrahamshomes.org, the Homes website. Lets  share the responsibility; and then share the joy.  Speaking of sharing, let me share  with you what I have lined up for this week. Maybe youd  like to line up in front of me. This afternoon at three,  theres a panel discussion at Apeejay School, Salt Lake,  on a topic close to our hearts: Vision Calcutta  Blueprint  For the Future. Come along and thrash it out. On Friday  the 12th, its the Advertising Clubs big night at the Hyatt.  Hustle an invitation and let your spirits fly high.  On Saturday Im doing the Indo-British  Quiz organised by the British Deputy High Commission as  part of the Kolkata Festival. See you at the Millennium  Park at 4 pm. On Sunday, Im going to be on Chowringhee  from 2 to 4.30 pm at the spectacular Thames-style parade.  Hit the road!

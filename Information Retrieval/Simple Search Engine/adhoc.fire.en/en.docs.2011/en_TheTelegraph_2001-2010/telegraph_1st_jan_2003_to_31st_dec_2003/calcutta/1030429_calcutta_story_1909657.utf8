		 Rommel Majumdar																									Is the national junior league round count for this 10-year-old golfer. But Rommel remains as cool as the cap he putts under. Having teed-off his fledgling career on a hockey ground in Port Blair just two years ago, he has since won five national-level titles.																									For one of the tourneys due to his school exams, but the number one on the under-11 national golf merit list still managed to bag three seconds and one third in the five tourneys he didnt top.																									For this army boy who has lived in as many places as he has travelled to. But his first real golfing experience was at the Fort William golf course, now his home. The Tiger Woods and Ernie Els fan has been from Chandigarh to Gurgaon and Delhi to Mysore to play golf, with his coach, his army colonel father, guiding him all the way.																									Reckons Rommel, setting aside more than three hours every evening for around 150 drives and 200 putts after school, wielding golf clubs as tall as him. This is followed by a two-hour study break before dinner.																									Finds him feasting on training tips from Woods and Els, besides gorging on Spiderman and Superman at the dinner table, after homework. Despite the long hours on the greens, the Class VII student of Army Public School likes giving education equal measure.																									Robbing Rommel of the chance to strut his stuff in his first international championships at Jakarta next month, for which he had government sponsorship. But the dream of turning pro, someday, somewhere, is driving him towards a scholarship to a golfing school in Florida, where academics and training are both taken care of. But megabucks is where the problem lies for the winner of the DLF Golf Club and Golden Greens competitions, with a golf club blowing a Rs 10,000 hole in the pocket. But a determined father, his dedicated son and the love of the game should surely tackle this handicap.

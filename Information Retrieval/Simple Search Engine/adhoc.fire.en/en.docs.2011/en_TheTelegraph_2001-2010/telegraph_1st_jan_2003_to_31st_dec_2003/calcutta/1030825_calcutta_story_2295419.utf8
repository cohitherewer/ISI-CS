	The Circular Rail is a boon for residents of Bongaon, Krishnagar  and Ranaghat. Commuters will benefit if the last Bongaon-bound  train leaves at 8.30 pm from BBD Bag. The authorities can  introduce a train from BBD Bag at around 3 pm, as there  is a long gap between 1 pm and 5.05 pm.

	Distribution of power on Dover Road is extremely inconsistent.  The houses connected in phase I, from Ballygunge Circular  Road up to 28, Dover Road, have rarely suffered power cuts  in the past six months, while those towards Hazra-Panditiya  Road have been undergoing prolonged cuts.

  finned friends:  Ornamental fish score high on popularity scales I am surprised and pained to know about the 125 van fog machines that the civic health department has planned to procure at an expenditure of Rs 35 lakh (Mosquito machine, City Diary, Nov. 27). Our city fathers should concentrate on their job of maintaining cleanliness. Not only then will the mosquitoes gradually disappear, but the hygienic condition of the city will also improve. This in turn will tell on the general health of Calcuttans, thereby bringing relief to our ramshackle healthcare system. Its high time that Mamata Banerjee, Subrata Mukherjee and their ilk steered clear of gimmicks like these expensive machines, which are left to rust soon after.  The root of all our problems is the civic departments, overstaffed with a callous workforce, with little supervision and no accountability. The Trinamul Congress has failed to run the mini government (Calcutta Municipal Corporation) as promised when seeking votes. As a senior citizen, I feel distressed at the deteriorating condition of our city. In all fairness, Calcuttans should be allowed to vote for a non-political organisation to take care of our civic affairs. A radical step is overdue.  Sunita Wadhwani,
 SR Das Road.  With the rapid growth in demand for ornamental fish, a permanent market is the need of the hour (Fetch a fighter from Galiff Street, Nov. 24). The utility of these delightful fish in giving relief after a hard days toil cannot be exaggerated. They can boost our foreign exchange earnings, too. But for that, problems like availability of bank loans and incentives to exporters should be addressed.  Piyal Mukherjee,
 Lake Town.  Apropos the report A lakh and more to pull out teeth (Nov. 20), one cannot help suspect a nexus between the hospital and the employee to fabricate such an absurd bill. If the employee was not covered by a medical reimbursement scheme, would he have paid up without a fight?  Sunil Banerjee,
 VIP Road.  The report is a glaring example  of how medical reimbursement schemes are exploited by private  hospitals in full collusion with the employees. The companies  should be more alert.  Govinda Bakshi,
 Budge Budge.  It is surprising that the states advocate-general, Balai Roy, appeared to defend police officers charged with foul play to cover up a murder case (Law stands in defence of law-benders, Nov. 27). Politics has infiltrated almost every aspect of life. This is just another example of the shady state of affairs in Bengal.  Kunal Saha,
 Ohio, USA.  Apropos the report Salt Lake litter fire draws bitter blow (Dec. 1), the Bidhannagar Municipalitys plan to impose taxes on plot-holders who are yet to start construction is not logical. They are not responsible for the garbage accumulated on the vacant plots. Neither are the plot-holders enjoying the civic amenities provided by municipal authorities.  Rabindra Nath Kar,
 Sankar Ghosh Lane.  Given that Sanskrit is being taught half-heartedly in West Bengal, I request the government to make the language compulsory in Madhyamik (English sermon and slokas, Nov. 29).  Prahlad Agarwala,
 Majdia, Nadia.  I agree with governor Viren J.  Shah about the importance of English. Lack of knowledge  of the language will drastically reduce employment opportunities  in the competitive scenario.  Debaprasad Mukherjee,
 Nayapatty Road. Apropos the report Hospital drive (City Diary, Nov. 27) on the failure of a canine sterilisation drive, NGOs are of great help but the awareness level in our country is awfully inadequate.  Anil Kumar Sen,
 Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.  Three cheers for Metro. Its anti-pollution campaign against fairs on the Maidan has paid off with a shift to a location off the Bypass being ordered.  T.R. Anand,
 Budge Budge.

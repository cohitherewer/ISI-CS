  Pricey Passage: The Keoratala burning  ghat  Apropos Marx vs miracle myth (Metro, October 21), it is well-known that communists do not believe in miracles, and vehemently oppose describing such events as acts of god.  Recently, an ardent follower of Mother Teresa has stated that she considers the beatified nun to be a spirit as her healing touch cured her from a tumour. The West Bengal unit of the CPM is contemplating a study on these miraculous events on a logical and scientific basis so that misconceptions in this regard may be removed and the truth revealed. Although major studies have been carried out in the fields of science and technology, the majority of the people in India have a deep faith in their religion. Sometimes, events occur in this earthly world which, they claim, cannot be explained by mere logic.  The Marxist leaders of Bengal were earlier averse to the idea of participating in the Pujas but now their followers are involving themselves in this grand festival, presumably for fear of losing votes. Would they do a volte face this time, too?  Debaprasad Mukherjee,
 Nayapatty Road.  The report Mayor eyes fee hike for cremation of outsiders (Metro, Oct 23) will be deemed by devout Hindus as a hurdle in the path to salvation of the rural poor who are unfortunate enough to die in city hospitals. It is desired that the mayor, who can find Rs 20 crore to try and build a fancy Calcutta Gate, must secure resources from other sources to meet the running expenses of the city crematoria.  Govinda Bakshi,
 Budge Budge.  The report of the Anish Majumdar panel (Zone-wise tax recast report next month, Metro, Oct. 24) will be welcomed by most Calcuttans. But it is feared that it would not extend relief to all sections of financially-pressed middle-class and lower-middle class householders if geographical zones are rigidly adhered to. All householders in the city proper are not rich, especially with rents in many areas fixed at pre-historic rates. The CMC would do well to keep this in mind while implementing the suggestions of the report.  Ajit Kumar Chatterjee,
 Becharam Chatterjee Road.  Shantanu Biswas and his wife Dali deserve to be applauded for donating the eyes of their drowned son (Sacrifice gift of sight, Metro, Oct. 25). Others should follow the humane example of the couple.  Prahlad Agarwala,
 Majdia, Nadia.  Three cheers to the children of Assembly of God Church Hindi-Medium School who excelled in studies overcoming their poor background (Deprived kids who dare to overcome, Metro, Oct. 25). It should be an eye-opener for students from affluent families.  T.R. Anand,
 Budge Budge.  It is heartening to note that  kids from very poor families are doing well in their studies.  The school is doing a yeoman service.  Piyal Mukherjee,
 Lake Town.  The report Dead baby lost in hospital (Metro, Oct. 23) left us devastated. The condition of hospitals is deteriorating day by day. The RG Kar superintendent says that an inquiry is on. Why cant he think of a new excuse?  Kunal Ray,
 Santragachhi. The death of an inmate of the Dhakuria home for vagrants after sunset became a nightmare for the authorities due to legal complications (Sunset death vagrant woe, Metro, Oct. 20). The state law ministry should arrange for an on-the-spot magisterial inquest, so that such bodies can be cremated on the same day to avoid health hazards for the other inmates.  Mohan Lal Sarkar,
 Budge Budge.

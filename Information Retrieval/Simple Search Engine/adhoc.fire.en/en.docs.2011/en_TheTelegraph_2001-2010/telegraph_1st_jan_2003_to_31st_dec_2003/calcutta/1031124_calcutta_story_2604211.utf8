 Monday, November 24, 2003 				 Middle path for Dalai Lama
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Dalai Lama, head of the Tibetan government in exile, regretted that there had been no improvement in his homeland. The Buddhist monk arrived here on Sunday morning from New Delhi on a two-day visit.																								We think a more direct approach is important ( in building a healthy relation with China). I have renewed my ties with the Chinese government last September and decided to tread the middle path, the monk added to mediapersons at the airport.																								The Dalai Lama will attend Mondays inaugural function at Rabindra Sadan of the year-long golden jubilee of the department of Indo-Tibetan Studies. The programme, organised by Visva-Bharati, with K.J. Somaiya Centre of Buddhist Studies in Mumbai, will start at 11 am. 																								A dialogue on The Concept of Suffering in Buddhism will also be held. Swami Prabhanandaji Maharaj, secretary, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, will be chief guest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, October 15, 2003 Ramkumar Chattopadhyay								Singer																																							These days people go out on the streets in huge numbers, but that is only to see the pandal. There is no interest in or devotion for the Devi. Things have reached such a pass that even after idols are immersed, the pandal is kept intact for people to visit. And that they actually do, so what if there is no thakur on the bedi. It is less of Durga puja, worship of the goddess, and more of Durgotsab, a celebration.

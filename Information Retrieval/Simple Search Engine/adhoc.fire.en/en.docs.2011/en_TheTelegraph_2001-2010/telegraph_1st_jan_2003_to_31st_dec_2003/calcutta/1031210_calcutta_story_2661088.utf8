	The prices of essential commodities, especially fruits  and vegetables, skyrocketed during the month of Ramazan,  for no apparent reason. This made it difficult for a lower  income-group family to enjoy iftar. Such unethical  practices by a section of businessmen must be checked by  the authorities. At the Bright Street crossing, local clubs  allowed a daily market to be set up. However, the members  of the clubs collected money from the hawkers, making the  prices of the goods soar for customers.

	Whenever petrol and diesel prices increase, private and  mini-bus owners tend to hike the fares. However, the buses  are often unfit for travel, from leaky roofs and windows  that dont open or close, to old, patchy tyres and no bars  for standing commuters, giving passengers a rather rough  ride. The vehicles should be properly maintained if prices  are to be hiked. Also, fares should not be increased more  than twice a year.

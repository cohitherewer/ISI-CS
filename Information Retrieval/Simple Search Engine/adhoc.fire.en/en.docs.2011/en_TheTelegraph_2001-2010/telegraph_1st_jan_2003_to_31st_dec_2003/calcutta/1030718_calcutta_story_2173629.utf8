 A STAFF REPORTER																								A week after the state government announced its decision to charge higher fees from medical students, the Students Federation of India (SFI) demanded a scale-down. The student wing of the ruling CPM threatened a sustained campaign against the government decision to charge Rs 1,000 as registration fee per student of medical courses.																								That apart, the SFI on Thursday also urged the government to take proper measures against a section of state-aided schools, which, they claim, charge a huge amount from students by way of development and admission fees, in violation of government rules. 																								Apurba Chatterjee, SFI state committee secretary, said his organisation will soon meet health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra for a discussion. We understand the need to raise tuition fees to some extent, specially in the wake of the funds crunch due to the central governments decision to reduce education grants. But we think the fee structure fixed by the government is too high, Chatterjee said.																								To create awareness among students, the SFI will organise a series of rallies and meetings across the city from next month. The campaign will end on September 19, with a convention in the city, to be attended by students from all over the state.

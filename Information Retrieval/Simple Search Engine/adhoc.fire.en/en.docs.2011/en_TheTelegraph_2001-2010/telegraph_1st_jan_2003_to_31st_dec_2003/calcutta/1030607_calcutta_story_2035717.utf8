				 Be Feluda in fact, not fantasy At wits end: The inspector at the scene of the murder.  (Above) Sabyasachi Chakraborty: Investigator as anchor  The man on the street on the scent  of a crime, acing an ace police inspector. Isnt that what  the grey cells labouring languidly on the para rock  would love to do? A novel TV show, tentatively titled Goenda  Iskool, promises to give just that chance to every Bengali  to do a Feluda. And every viewer a Satyajit Ray; well, almost.				 																																																											Visualise this scene: The victims body hangs from the ceiling. In his clutch still are locks of brown hair. There is no toppled stool or any support nearby to indicate that the man had taken his own life. So, a surefire case of murder. At least, Inspector Sutradhar Sharma (Rajatabha Dutta) deduces as much.				 																																																											The action unfolds on the screen in front of the audience as well as the participants in the studio. And as the all-knowing over-smart inspector reaches a dead end, it is up to the sleuths to bail him out, with reel-life Feluda Sabyasachi Chakraborty guiding them as anchor. We will halt the action at interesting junctures to pose questions to the participants who will have to use their powers of observation and logical deduction to come up with the answers. It will be an interactive show, with the prime suspects sitting in person in front of the participants. The sleuths can actually accuse them on the floor, giving them a chance to defend themselves with alibi, explains Sougata Roy Burman of Moviewallah Communications, producers of the ETV Sunday show.				 																																																											We are showing all the clues explicitly so that there is no surprise sprung on the audience. People with moderate analytical powers should be able to crack the cases, said Sibendu Guha Biswas, director of the fiction part. The participants who score the highest points get a shot at the final whodunnit question. The winners name will be advertised in the papers, with a suggestion to the officials of the police station under which he lives to use his deductive powers, Roy Burman adds.				 																																																											Moviewallah is targeting the show at the campus crowd. To add to the viewers concept of sleuthing, Sabyasachi will speak on fingerprints, forensic reports and autopsies at the beginning of each show. We will also try to bring in a top police officer to discuss celebrated cases cracked by Lalbazar or Scotland Yard or FBI, adds co-producer Sudipto Bhowmik.				 																																																											Another innovative idea is to invite plots from the audience itself. While celebrated science-fiction author Adrish Bardhan and Balmiki Arnab have penned the first 13 episodes, the producers expect the remaining stories to come from the viewers. There is a dearth of original detective stories in todays market. We hope to seek out the Hemendra Kumar Roys and the Nihar Ranjan Guptas. A panel of authors will screen the story ideas that come in.				 																																																											There is more in store. Detective clubs will be formed wherever there are viewers interested in the genre. We will arrange for a monthly meeting place and perhaps take a well-known author along to give shape to the clubs activities, be it adda comparing Sherlock Holmes with Kiriti Roy or a discussion on the murder reported in the days paper, says Roy Burman.				 																																																											As Sabyasachi Chakraborty, who lapped up the offer because of the detective link, sums up, Bengalis are a sharp lot and love to analyse every issue under the sun, from the thinning of the ozone layer to Raveena Tandons choice of roles to reasons behind the cricket teams defeat. So the concept is cut out for the local audience. But at the same time, one wonders whether in todays Rambo culture which worships brawn more than brain, Lalmohan babus Prokhor Rudra, with his 42-inch chest and six-feet-four-inch height would have been the idol rather than Feluda.				 																																																											 Sudeshna Banerjee Jazz n blues set the tone for a  sellout concert for a cause. Peace made a comeback on  Thursday, when Pam Crain, Nondon Bagchi, Anjum Katyal  and others took the stage at GD Birla Sabhagar for Blue  Moon, the first fundraiser for PeaceWorks, a movement  led by school students to promote harmony. Picture by  Aranya Sen				 																																																											This is an English-language film that we are making on a shoestring budget. An NRI producer will take care of the finances. He has evinced a lot of interest in my script, says Rajat, armed with a Masters degree in comparative literature from Jadavpur University. The camera called out to him some five years ago when he took time off from studies to act in the ETV telefilm Bhalobasha Theke Jay. Then on, he started to stay put in Hyderabad to assist in Hollywood movies like Crocodile, Nightfall and Panic. The Bollywood brush happened when he got to work with K. Ravishankar in Kuch Tum Kaho Kuch Hum Kahein, starring Fardeen Khan. Right now, Rajat is busy chalking out the details of his dream debut.				 																																																											Dwipantarer Bangali will be on air Fridays in BBC Bengali Services morning transmission starting at 6 am, and again in the night transmission at 10 pm. The programme is also available in real audio on the BBC Bengali Service online site, bbcbengali.com.

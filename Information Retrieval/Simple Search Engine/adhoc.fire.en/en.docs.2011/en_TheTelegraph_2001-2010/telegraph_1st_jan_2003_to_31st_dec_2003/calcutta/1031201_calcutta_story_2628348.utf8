The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, December 01, 2003 				 Dim roads, deadly manholes
				 	 ASHOKA MONDAL, Trinamul Congress councillor of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) ward no. 119, met residents at 15/1, Sahapur Main Road, to reply to their queries. Participants included Manik Ghosh, Anup Kujur, Ashoke Kumar Das, Bhupesh Chandra Chakraborty, Smritish Bhowmik, Tapan Haldar, Soumen Haldar, Chandan Goswami, Pradeep Sarkar, Laltu Mazumdar and Jiban Chakraborty				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Chandan Goswami: The condition of SN Chatterjee Road is abysmal. The manholes are placed in such a manner that they pose mishap risks. Two-wheelers, specially, are inconvenienced. I myself narrowly escaped death on one occasion. Can the manholes be levelled with the road surface? 																																																			You are right. Such manholes dot some parts of the area. Actually, when engineers put the manholes in place, they have to keep in mind the position of the sewerage line, as the manholes are linked with it to ensure smooth drainage of water. The manholes are laid according to suggestions from the executive engineer or the deputy engineer of the department concerned. Regarding repair of the road, I assure you that the work will be taken up in December.																																																									

Pradeep Sarkar: Residents of Diamond Harbour Road suffer a nightmarish time in the monsoon due to a faulty drainage network. The drains here flow at a level much higher than our houses. The situation is so bad that water enters our premises even after a moderate shower. Something needs to be done immediately.																																																			These drains were laid by engineers of the public works department (PWD). Hence, it is their duty to rectify the defect. However, I shall take up the issue with the PWD, so that work starts before the monsoon sets in.																																																									

Pradeep Sarkar: The streetlights of our area are quite sadly insufficient.																																																			The PWD instals streetlights in your area. The onus to keep them in proper condition lies with it. But, of course, if it cannot carry out its duties, it can ask us for help. We are ready to help. 																																																									

Pradeep Sarkar: We are given to believe that the Mondal Para shantytown will be turned into a model slum. Is that true?																																																			What you have heard is quite right. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) surveyed some slums in the area and has taken up Mondal Para in the first phase of its revamp project. The ADB has told me that this slum will be developed in such a manner that everyone will be able to lead a decent life, with proper drinking water supply, sanitation, road and lights and every civic amenity.																																																									

Laltu Mazumdar: I live on Sahapur Main Road. The areas open drains are in a shambles. Can you have them covered and lay a proper sewerage system?																																																			I am aware of the problem you are facing due to the surface drains. I shall soon visit the area and also ask the executive engineer whether a proper underground sewerage system can be laid. 																																																									

Jiban Chakraborty: There is no community hall in our area, where people can organise cultural programmes and family functions, like weddings, can be held at a cheaper rate. Will you please adopt an initiative for such a hall?																																																			We do not have the space to build a community hall. I can move the Corporation for one, if you provide me with the space.																																																									

Jiban Chakraborty: Why is it that we do not have any CMC-maintained park in our area? 																																																			It is true that there is no CMC park in your area, but there are others that are built and maintained by different bodies, including the local residents. Though, of course, all of these badly need to be developed.																																																											(Concluded)

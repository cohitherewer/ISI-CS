 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Jailed after murder over toilet tussle
 A STAFF REPORTER																								All eyes at the Alipore fast-track court on Tuesday were trained on three persons, sentenced to a life term for killing two family members after being denied first use of the toilet at Dakshin Bainchtala in Tiljala, five years ago. 																								Bhishmanath Pramanik and his cousin Bhuban were killed on May 18, 1998, allegedly by six relatives. Five of the accused were their cousins (Ashu, Dashu, Ajay, Jagannath and Jhantu Pramanik) and the other (Biswanath Baidya) was a member of the extended family.																								The family  comprising at least 30 members, including retainers  had only one toilet to share. Consequently, every morning, there used to be quarrels. On the fateful evening, Bhishmanath and Bhuban were having tea at a stall when they were accosted by Ashu, Dashu and Ajay. Biswanath, Jhantu and Jagannath allegedly stood guard a few metres away so that they could not escape. The two were shot from close range, public prosecutor Dilip Santra told the court.																								Judge Ajit Kumar Das found the three, accused of shooting the two cousins, guilty of murder. The other three, accused of abetting the murder, were acquitted.																								Three others  Samir Sarkar, Debasis Ojha and Amit Mahato were awarded a similar sentence after being convicted of killing a sex worker in a fit of drunken rage in 2001.

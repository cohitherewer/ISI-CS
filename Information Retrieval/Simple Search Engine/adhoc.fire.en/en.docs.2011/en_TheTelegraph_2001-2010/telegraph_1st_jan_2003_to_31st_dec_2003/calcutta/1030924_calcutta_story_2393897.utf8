 Charity, they say, begins at home,  and what better way to do it than work for a noble cause  and get all those relatives, friends and well-wishers involved  in the project? Calcuttans are familiar with Mothers Care  montessori house, especially young parents who send their  little children to this institution to get them initiated  into the world of the three Rs ever so lovingly. Imparting  bookish education is not the only aim of this montessori  house. Its effort to help widen the horizon of the lesser-privileged  children by providing them with a platform to showcase their  talent and also induct them in the mainstream is laudable  indeed. Todays programme of songs, dance, drama and recitation  features the students of Mothers Care and the children  of New Light (a registered charitable organisation running  a creche and night shelter for underprivileged children  in Kalighat) as they meet for a pre-Puja celebration. When: Today at 10 am																								Where: Mothers Care montessori house, 18C Mandevilla Gardens

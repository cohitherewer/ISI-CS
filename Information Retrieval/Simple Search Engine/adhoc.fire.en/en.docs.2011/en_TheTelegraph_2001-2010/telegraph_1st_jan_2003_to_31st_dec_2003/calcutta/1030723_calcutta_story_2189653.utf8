When Jaitley evinced interest in the matter, the state government sent a formal proposal to the Union ministry, said chief ministers principal secretary Arun Bhattacharya. 																								According to the proposal, the city office may have provisions for filing cases and counter-affidavits, provide information on cases pending in the Supreme Court and offer certified copies.																								The branch may serve a limited purpose, but even then, it will save people a number of trips to the Capital on court-related matters, said a senior official of the state law department.

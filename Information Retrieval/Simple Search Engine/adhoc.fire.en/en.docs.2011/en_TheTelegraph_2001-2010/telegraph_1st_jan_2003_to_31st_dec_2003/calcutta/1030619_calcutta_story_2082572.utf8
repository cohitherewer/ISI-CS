																																																																																		The Calcutta Tramways Workers amp; Employees Union (CTWEU) said on Wednesday that allegations of losses incurred due to non-availability of tickets in trams were baseless. They claimed that the circulation of the revised fare chart from the transport department reached them on June 6, which is why they did not have the time to introduce the new fare. The CTWEU alleged that people with vested interests were campaigning against the company. Quoting official figures, the union claimed that the company had earned a profit of Rs 50,000 between June 7 and 12 during which time tickets were not available.

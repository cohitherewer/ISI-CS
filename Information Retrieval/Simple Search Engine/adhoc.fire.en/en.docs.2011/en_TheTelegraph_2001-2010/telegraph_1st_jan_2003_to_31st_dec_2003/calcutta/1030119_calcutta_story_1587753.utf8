 A STAFF REPORTER																								At least 30 persons, including women and children, were injured when a private bus fell into a ditch on Diamond Harbour Road in the Magrahat police station area of South 24-Parganas, on Saturday morning. Of around 35 people in the bus, two have been reported missing.																								Ten of the injured were admitted to the Diamond Harbour sub-divisional hospital, where the condition of three people was stated to be critical.																								According to police, the bus was on its way from Amta to Hotor when a cyclist came in the way. In a bid to bypass him, the bus spun out of control and fell into the ditch. 																								While a few passengers managed to wriggle out of the bus on their own, several others trapped inside were helped out by local residents. Things would have been worse had the doors of the bus gone under water, a resident said. The search is still on for the two missing passengers.																								In another incident on Saturday morning, one person was seriously injured after a minibus collided with a state bus on the Howrah bridge, police said. The driver of the state bus was admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, while the minibus driver managed to flee. Both buses have been impounded by the North Port police station.

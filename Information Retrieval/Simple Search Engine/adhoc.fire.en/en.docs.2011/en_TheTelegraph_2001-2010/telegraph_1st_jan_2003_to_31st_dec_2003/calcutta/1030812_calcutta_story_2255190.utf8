 Tuesday, August 12, 2003 				 Agent dupes depositor
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A racket was busted on a complaint by a depositor, who alleged that he had been cheated by a licensed agent of the Topsia post office. Bapi Dey said in his complaint that a Kisan Vikas Patra, worth Rs 6.4 lakh, was delivered to him by Duryodhan Mishra, which proved to be forged when Dey went to the post office on Christopher Road to encash it on Monday. Mishra, a resident of Hatgachhi, is absconding.																								As he was a licensed agent, we never doubted him until Dey came to us this morning. Mishra has worked for us for years, said a post office official.																								Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Soumen Mitra said Mishra is suspected of involvement in several cases. We have detained his nephew for questioning. He, too, is believed to deal in fixed deposits of private companies. Mishra was also handling recurring deposit accounts for others. But he would pocket the money.

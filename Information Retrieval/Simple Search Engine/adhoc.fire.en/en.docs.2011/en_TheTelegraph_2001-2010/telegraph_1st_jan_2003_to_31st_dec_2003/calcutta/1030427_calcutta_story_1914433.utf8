 Sunday, April 27, 2003 				 Open varsity floats radio channel
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Netaji Subhas Open University on Saturday launched an FM radio channel to broadcast educational programmes for students studying undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the open and distance learning systems. The broadcast is likely to start from the second week of May.																								The open university will run the radio channel in collaboration with Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), which has already launched similar radio stations in seven cities across the country. The system of imparting education through radio, TV and online modes will increase interactions between the open universities and learners, said IGNOU vice-chancellor and chairman of Distance Education Council H.P. Dikshit, while inaugurating the channel at a city hotel during the day.																								University officials felt the channel would benefit students in the districts. But government officials were not so optimistic as the channel has a transmission capacity of only 80 km.

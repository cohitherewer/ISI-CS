 Sunday, January 12, 2003 				 Education showcase for Australia
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Australian government is showcasing its country as a prime educational destination with counsellor of Australian Education and Training Quentin Stevenson-Perks in the city to woo students Down Under. The Australian High Commission is participating in the International Education Fair which started on Saturday. 																								There are a lot of stereotypes in our perception of each other which need to be cleared, Stevenson-Perks said on Saturday. The Australian government attaches maximum importance to ensuring that overseas students have access to accurate and comprehensive information about the opportunities of studying in Australia, he added.																								Stevenson-Perks said his government had passed a legislation which ensured that only educational institutions with fixed norms of instruction and high quality would open. Presently, there are about 8,500 Indians studying in Australia. 																								Australian institutions are not lagging behind those in the UK, Europe and America in academic excellence. Education is a lot cheaper in our country, Stevenson-Perks said.																								Banu Sidharth, education promotion officer at the high commission in Delhi, said unlike in other countries, Australia-bound students need not sit for any entrance examination or aptitude tests. Our colleges select candidates on the basis of their academic records only, she said.

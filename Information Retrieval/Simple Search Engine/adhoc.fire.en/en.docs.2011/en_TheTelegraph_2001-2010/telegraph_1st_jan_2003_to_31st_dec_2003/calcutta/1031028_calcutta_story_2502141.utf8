 Tuesday, October 28, 2003 				 Pay property tax at bank from next month
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Paying civic taxes will be less of a bother from next month. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is set to introduce an electronic collection system (ECS) of tax through banks. 																								Preparations are underway to print new property tax bills with a bar code. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has instituted a four-member task force, headed by joint municipal commissioner D. K. Chakravorty, to finalise the process with the banks.																								Four nationalised and private sector banks have already expressed their keenness for a tie-up with the CMC for the facility.																								By the ECS, rate-payers can deposit their property tax without having to queue up at CMC counters. They can deposit their dues in any branch of the specified banks, said the mayor.																								Two types of ECS are on the cards, said Shaktibrata Ghosh, officer on special duty to the mayor. Those who hold accounts with the banks can issue their branches standing instructions to debit the tax of every quarter from their accounts. In that case, the bank will credit the amount to the CMC in due course.																								In the second system, those who do not hold accounts in the banks can deposit the tax in cash at the specified branches.																								A tax-payer gets a rebate if he pays the bill within 15 days of it being raised by the CMC. In the new system, the rebate will not be mentioned separately in the bill. According to officer on special duty Ghosh, house-owners interested in depositing their tax through banks can do so from the current quarter itself (October-December). The system will be flagged off in November.

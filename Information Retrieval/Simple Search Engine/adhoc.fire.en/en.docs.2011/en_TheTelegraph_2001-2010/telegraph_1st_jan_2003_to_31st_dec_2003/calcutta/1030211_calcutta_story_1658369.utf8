The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, February 11, 2003 				 Surgery of knee no cause for concern
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Lack of exercise and an indisciplined lifestyle lay behind the alarming rise of knee problems among Calcuttans.																								The observation was made in the city on Tuesday by surgeon P.K. Banerjee, head of the department of orthopaedics, Peerless Hospital and B.K. Roy Research Institute. He admitted that a rise in cases of knee problems was a cause for concern, but Calcuttas doctors were prepared to deal with the situation. 																								It is unfortunate that people still believe they cannot get proper treatment here. The fact remains that we alone have completed over 1,500 successful knee replacements, 800 of them of the mobile variety. All the patients are just fine, said Banerjee.																								Apart from Peerless, other private and five government hospitals of the city also receive an average of 200-300 knee replacement cases every month.																								The surgeon took the initiative to form the Peerless Hospital Arthoplasty Learning Centre in 1994, and conducts research on joint replacement surgeries from time to time to give a fillip to research. The department of orthopaedics received a further boost when the National Board of Examination officially recognised it as one of the best ortho-teaching centres in the country. 																								A knee replacement, which requires Rs 3 lakh outside the state, is available at our centre at only Rs 1.5 lakh. The results are the same and, at times, better, Banerjee added.																								Specialist Somnath De said that even mobile-bearing knee implants are done at a reasonable cost. He urged Calcuttans to have faith on city doctors.																								Of late, orthopaedic surgeons have stressed the need to replace knees with the mobile variety (mobile-bearing knee), which is the latest in artificial joint implants, and provides greater mobility, stability and longevity to patients.																								Apart from patients in Calcutta, Peerless also caters to patients from Bihar, Orissa, Northeastern states and Bangladesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Missing motive: beau or Bollywood
 															- Sleuths trace one of two girls who disappeared from same college OUR BUREAU																								A whiff of romance, the lure of good life and Bollywood dreams are some of the angles the police were pursuing on Sunday after rescuing one of the two teenaged girls who went missing a fortnight ago from their north Calcutta college campus.																								Police said Raimoni Ghosh and Joya Roy, aged about 19, went missing within 48 hours of each other in mid-December. Both had last been spotted in college.																								Raimoni was traced on Sunday to Tehatta, in Nadia district, 130 km from Calcutta, along with her 25-year-old fianc, but there is no sign of Joya yet. Her boyfriend, meanwhile, told investigators that he knew nothing about her disappearance. In a bid to track down Joya, police are probing various possibilities, including that of a man promising her a career in Bollywood. We have learnt from her friends that she was hooked on to Hindi films and might have harboured hopes of a break in Bollywood, said an officer, while not ruling out the handiwork of a girl-running racket, either.																								On December 16, Joya, a IInd year BA student in a Rajabazar college, left her Shitalatala Lane residence in Narkeldanga but never came back. She was last seen in college. Two days later, Raimoni, a resident of Durgapur, went missing from the hostel of the same college. During investigation, the detective department picked up the trail of a girl who matched Raimonis description, who had been spotted with a youth at Plassey, on the Nadia-Murshidabad border. A police team moved in on Sunday and finally picked up the fugitive couple in Tehatta. Police said that Raimoni and her fianc, who were planning to get married, are being brought to Calcutta.																								Sheikh Abdur Razzak, officer-in-charge of Narkeldanga police station, admitted they had so far drawn a blank on Joya. We are carrying out a separate inquiry, apart from the one being conducted by the detective department, he added. Photographs of Joya  a shade under five feet, of fair complexion  have been sent to the district police authorities.																								In the process of searching for Joya, her parents found that she was close to 26-year-old Rehman Mandal, alias Raja, a constable of the third battalion of Calcutta Armed Police. Raja was often spotted waiting outside the Rajabazar college on a motorcycle. The two (Joya and Raja) would often go out together, along with Susmita Haldar and Michael De, Joyas father Ramendra Narayan said in the FIR.																								Joya left home at around 10.30 am on December 16 for college. She was last spotted with Raja around 11.45 am by one of her friends. Susmita and Michael denied any knowledge of Joyas disappearance. When we finally managed to meet Raja last week, he, too, denied having any clue about Joyas whereabouts, Ramendra Narayan told Metro on Sunday. Joyas father also alleged that Rajas brother Kalu was pursuing the friend who had stated to the cops that she had spotted the two on December 16.																								We are looking into all possible aspects of the case, said P. Ravi, deputy commissioner of police (north).

																																																		 The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) roads department submitted its observations on the draft route proposal of the Rs 4,000-crore Metro Railway link planned between Rajarhat and Ramrajatala, in Howrah. The railway link is slated to go under the Hooghly. The report was submitted at a meeting convened by the state transport department at Writers Buildings on Monday. Representatives from the railways, CMC, Howrah Improvement Trust, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the police were invited to look at the route proposals, prepared by the Japanese consultants. Funds for the proposed Metro Railway link will be provided by a Japanese bank as a soft loan.																																																		The city police arrested a Bangladeshi national at Mechuapatti, in the Jorasanko police station area, on Monday evening and seized 120 fake Indian currency notes of Rs 100 denomination. Timir Bhattacharya, officer-in-charge of Jorasanko police station, said Mohammad Raju, the arrested man, was trying to buy fruits with a fake Rs 100 note. During the course of interrogation, Raju confessed that he had collected the fake notes from a Kathmandu-based businessman. He used to visit the city frequently by crossing the Indo-Bangladesh border illegally, carrying hundreds of fake Indian currency notes. We are looking for the Calcutta agents linked with Raju, Bhattacharya added. 																																																		Two women were run over on Monday in separate incidents. There was tension on BT Road, in Cossipore, when Sikha Chakroborty, 45, was killed by a truck on Monday afternoon.

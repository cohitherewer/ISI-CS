 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Chic shift for simple jute
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The ever-resilient jute is simply refusing to be written off and the comeback crop finds a new face this Christmas.																								Over 15 retail outlets across the country, starting with one on Camac Street to be inaugurated on December 25, will display a range of products made from the versatile fibre. Ballyfab  The Jute Shop, the Kankaria Groups jute retail brand, is attempting to change the common mans perception of jute. 																								Cloth in over 60 colours can be used for furnishings, upholstery, garments and bags, apart from the standard commercial purposes. To develop the retail market, the 450-sq-ft outlet will also stock bags, to be followed by other products, including shoes and handicrafts.																								Earlier, jute was perceived as a fabric used for grain bags. Now, it has some exclusivity, explains Abhishek Kankaria, executive director, Kankaria Group, which has plans to set up exclusive showrooms in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chandigarh and Chennai, as well as some smaller cities. 																								It already has an outlet in China and has plans for one in the UK, where it has an existing export network. Because of the export thrust of most jute manufacturers, the domestic market has been neglected. There are customers here who want jute products, too, but what is available currently is either too expensive or of low quality.																								With the price tag reading as low as Rs 15 for a small bag, the target is the mass market. The plunge into the organised retail sector is complete, and talks are on with a leading national chain to carry the Ballyfab range. Raymond has already moved away from plastic shopping bags to the jute variant, for which it has tied up with the Kankaria group recently. National fashion designers and leading hospitality players, including the Taj group, have shown interest in working with the Calcutta-based company, which has collaborated with the National Institute of Fashion Technology on a jute symposium.																								The attempt to woo customers has shaped brand initiatives, including customised colour orders, for even small shipments and delivery of bulk purchases. To spread awareness about the ill-effects of plastic, the group has already joined hands with Calcutta Police, distributing jute bags at Victoria Memorial.

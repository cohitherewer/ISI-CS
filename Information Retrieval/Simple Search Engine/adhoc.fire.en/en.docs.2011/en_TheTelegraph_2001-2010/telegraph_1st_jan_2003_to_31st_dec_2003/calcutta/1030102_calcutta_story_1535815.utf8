				 ANYTHING FOR A BUNDLE OF JOY: Unscrupulous  doctors thrive on the urge to carry on the family line 				 																																																																				 Apropos the report HS teachers on contract published in Metro on December 4, it is quite interesting to note that the Left Front government has endorsed the policy of appointment of part-time teachers in educational institutions on a contract basis although they have vehemently opposed the appointment of contractual teachers all through its regime. It is a welcome relief for students as most government-aided educational institutions have been suffering from acute shortage of staff because the present government is reluctant to provide full-time teachers due to the cash crunch. Presumably, the empty coffer has prompted the government to change its stand and deviate from the professed ideologies.				 																																													However, it is pertinent to point out that the proposal of allowing part-time teachers to take private tuitions may frustrate the basic objective of curbing the practice. The sudden change in approach indicates that the leftists have succumbed to the process of liberalisation so long opposed by them.				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee, 				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																																																				It is shocking that amoral physicians are exploiting childless couples, throwing ethics to the wind (Crackdown on infertility clinics, Metro, December 3). How could the state health department issue clinical licences without proper checks? It is ironic that it plans to seal the clinics after the wolves have already devoured many a sheep.				 																																													Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge. Getting a grip It is heartening to note that  the Medical Council of India has formulated a code of ethics  which is to be followed by physicians (Ethics leash on errant  doctors, Metro, December 2). It is surprising that  some doctors can stoop to such a level in order to extract  a pound of flesh from patients.				 																																													Tathagata Kar, 				 																																													Narendrapur.				 																																																																				It is heartening to know that a unit for cerebral attack will be opened at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital (Speciality stroke unit at Medical College, Metro, November 23). Due to changes in the social structure, problems in daily life have increased. So cerebral problems, too, are on the rise.				 																																													B.N. Bose,				 																																													Dum Dum.				 																																																																				It was great to know of Srayan and Antariksha, two city students, who went to Pakistan to take part in the annual Saarc Radio Quiz (Teen duo takes quiz route to Pakistan, Metro, December 4). Quizzes make students smart and savvy, but many ignore their studies to prepare for such contests. Hope these two do not do the same.				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia.				 																																													lKudos to Antariksha and Srayan for representing India at Islamabad in the Saarc Radio Quiz. This will give them a chance to learn about the country at first hand. We wish them best of luck.				 																																													Bhupendra Nath Bose,				 																																													Dum Dum Park.				 																																																																				The report Showbiz tonic for Tollywood (Metro, November 30) was indeed a tonic of sorts for Calcutta cinegoers. With Bollywood heading downhill with mediocre performances in 2002, hit films like Annadata, Saathi and Bangali Babu do put Tollywood in front in the race. The only question is whether the chief minister will be able to control the union menace that plagues all industry sectors here.				 																																													T.R. Anand,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Private pitch for city hub carpark (Metro, December 2), it is hoped that if the proposal is implemented, Dalhousie Square, the nerve centre of the city, will wear a different look. 				 																																													Piyal Mukherjee, 				 																																													Lake Town.

 SANJAY MANDAL				 	 Sundari sleeps secure at the Medical College and Hospital, one of whose Group-D staff is waiting for a court order to adopt her																								Spending a night on the pavement and lying there helplessly until a providential rescue by Bowbazar police station officials, and then ending up in Medical College and Hospital (MCH), life was a journey through hell from the day she was born.																								Destiny, however, has smiled on Sundari, with first the hospital taking good care of her and then a couple pleading to the family court for her custody. According to MCH officials, the hearing is complete and the final order is expected soon.																								Kajal Saha, a Group-D staff member of the hospitals ENT and OPD departments, and her husband Amal, appealed in court in the last week of October for the custody of Sundari.																								The principal judge of the family court has heard the case of change of custody of the child. We plan to hand over Sundari to the couple once we receive the order and some formalities are completed, says Pranab Mukherjee, social welfare officer of MCH.																								Sundari was found abandoned by the roadside in central Calcutta. Residents alerted the local police, who took her to the Medical College authorities on October 20.																								Now, the final paperwork permitting, she is headed for a new home, a new life in Santragachhi. I cannot express my happiness. I cannot wait to take her home, says Kajal. Married for 19 months, the couple is childless. I suffered two miscarriages and we have been craving for a child, she adds.																								Amal, who has been out of work for the past five months, cant wait for the day his daughter comes home: We have purchased dresses, toys and a cradle to welcome her.																								Kajal had initially planned to adopt an abandoned male child, from the hospital. Unfortunately, the child died and she was left heartbroken.																								Then she heard of Sundari (a name given by doctors and nurses treating the infant) and approached the MCH authorities with her adoption plea. I had my heart set on adopting any abandoned child from this hospital, where I have been working for eight years. It has finally happened, smiles Kajal.																								It is good that Sundari has found a home, says MCH superintendent R.N. Chattopadhyay.																								According to a hospital official, Sundari was the only abandoned child in the past six months to be adopted. The abandoned and unclaimed children are otherwise sent to the juvenile welfare court and then to some childrens home, says social welfare officer Mukherjee.

 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Howrah consumer court in a shambles
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Several lawyers of the consumer court in Howrah are up in arms against the administration for not bothering to shift the court from the dilapidated building, declared condemned by the public works department (PWD) more than five years ago. 																								In 1997, a PWD notification said the pre-Independence building was unsafe and suggested that the court be shifted.																								Large chunks of the roof cave in almost every day. It is really risky for us to attend court here. The entire building may collapse any time. But the administration is deaf to our requests for alternative accommodation, said Buddhadeb Saha, who has been practising in the court for over 15 years																								 Howrah District Consumer Redressal Forum sources said the consumer affairs department had agreed to pay the Howrah district administration Rs 11 lakh for 3,000 sq ft in the new Collectorate to house the court. But the plans came to nought, said advocate Chatterjee.																								The consumer affairs department entered into an agreement with the Howrah district administration on shifting the court in 1997. But since then, nothing has been done and the money has not been paid by the consumer affairs department, either.																								It is claimed that Rs 1.65 crore from the Centre meant for the shift, had to be sent back for non-utilisation.

				 																																									Thousands of visitors gather with their friends and relatives on Christmas and New Years Day at the Alipore zoo to see the inmates and have fun. The entrance fee has now been increased to Rs 10, which makes a visit for a family quite a costly proposition. However, many cages are still lying empty. Moreover, the zoo should be kept neat and clean, and more flowering plants should be used to give the place a cheery look. Alipore zoo is the pride of our city. Why not bring some rare animals and give us our moneys worth?				 																																									B.N. Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.				 																																									 There is a regular launch from Bally to BBD Bag, via Bagbazar, which returns on the same route. The launch leaves BBD Bag at 4.45 pm and 5.55 pm. The authorities should organise for another departure at around 7 pm, so that more people can avail of this service and not be forced to take the train. The launch journey is much more comfortable.				 																																									Sarbananda Gattani,				 																																									Cossipore Road.

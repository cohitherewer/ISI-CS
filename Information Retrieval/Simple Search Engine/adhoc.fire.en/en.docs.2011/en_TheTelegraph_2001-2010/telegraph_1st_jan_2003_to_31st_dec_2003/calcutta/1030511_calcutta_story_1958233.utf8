 Sunday, May 11, 2003 				 Revised HS syllabi next year
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Students seeking admission to Class XI in 2004 under the Higher Secondary (HS) board will have to handle an updated curriculum. 																								President of West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education Jyotirmoy Mukherjee on Saturday announced that the revision of the HS curriculum, undertaken by the Council three years ago, was almost complete and the revised syllabi would be put into effect from the 2004 academic session.																								Mukherjee was addressing a seminar organised by teachers and heads of the citys ICSE and CBSE schools at Agrasain Balika Siksha Sadan, an ICSE institution in Howrah.																								The proposed HS syllabi, according to Mukherjee, will be different from the existing one in several ways. The revised syllabi will be value-based, something which the existing curriculum is not, he observed. 																								We will upgrade the syllabus, making it as compatible as possible with that of the ICSE, CBSE and other state education boards, he said. The proposed syllabi will feature fresh contents, especially in science and technology.																								During the day-long session, teachers, officials and heads representing the citys CBSE and ICSE schools put forward suggestions to upgrade the syllabi of their respective boards. Discussions revolved round the need to reduce the syllabus, greater focus on teaching literature and the languages, and introducing a judicious evaluation system.																								They emphasised the need to bring the courses of the state boards on a par with those followed by other boards across the country. 																								Mukherjee, however, argued that the HS course was more scientific as students were required to learn the syllabi of both Classes XI and XII when they appeared for the HS examination, while CBSE and ICSE students answered questions only from the portion covered in Class XII. 																								nCPM leader dies: Veteran CPM leader, a member of Rajya Sabha and editor of Desh Hitaishi Patrika, Sudhangshu Dasgupta, died in a city nursing home on Saturday night. He was 91. Party sources said his body would be kept at Peace Haven till Monday, when his funeral will take place.

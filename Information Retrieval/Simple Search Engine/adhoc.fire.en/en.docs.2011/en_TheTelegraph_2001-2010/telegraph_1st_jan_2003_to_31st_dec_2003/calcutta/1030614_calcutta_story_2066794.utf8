The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, June 14, 2003 				 Lewd world of Tina logs on to Lalbazar
 A STAFF REPORTER COP PORN: Tina invites  Lalbazar to her world on its website 																								Hi, my name is Tina. I am 19 and currently a student in New York City. I like to show off on my webcam when my folks are not at home. Come and see me  live on my webcam.																								Welcome to Tinas World  its just a click away. And its not a pornographic site you have to log on to if you want to catch a glimpse of the virtual smut world. The address simply is www.calcuttapolice.com.																								One of the two official websites of the citys lawkeepers has been hacked, leaving a red-faced Lalbazar scrambling for a fig leaf. Though the other  and more recent website (www.calcuttapolice.org.in)  is still safe, officials admitted that till late on Friday, the technical resource team had failed to tackle Tina.																								Friday the 13th began on a curious note for officers at Lalbazar logging on to the website. Enjoying pride of place on the left half of the screen was a scantily-clad woman. The right half of the screen had the alluring message, with directions on how to enter Tinas World.																								And if anyone doubted that the virtual world was for real, there was an assuring one-liner: Hi, I am real! Click here now to see me live! From here to Tinas World was just two steps: filling up the verification form and entering a credit-card number.																								From the history of Lalbazar to the rogues gallery to information about the newest police station set up in the city, everything had been sucked into Tinas World. And the single Lalbazar telephone line just refused to stop ringing. Every caller  senior IPS officers from other states to junior computer-savvy Calcutta Police officers  had one query: How did it happen again? The again referred to the other hack-job about 18 months ago.																								But this time, the hacker was tracked down to Canada. He/she was working from Canada and a service-provider based in that country had been used unwittingly for the job, deputy commissioner (detective department) Soumen Mitra said.																								We have got in touch with the Canada-based service-provider and have asked it to do the job for us, an officer disclosed. Tight-lipped about the implications of the hacking and how it could affect more sensitive government websites, all that a Lalbazar officer said was: We were using a security system called Firewall and thought it was good enough... But Fridays incident may force a rethink.

 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Strike now a year old, no shift in court fees 
 TAPAS GHOSH																								A year ago, on December 26, 2002, the Bar Council of West Bengal withdrew its 72-day-long strike on an assurance from law minister Nisith Adhikari that the decision to hike court fees would be reconsidered within two months.																								Council chairman Amiya Kumar Chatterjee had announced that members of his organisation would go for a fresh movement if the government failed to keep its word. Twelve months have elapsed since, and there is no sign from the governments side for a revision of court fees.																								The situation has prompted a section of lawyers to turn vocal against the councils executive committee. Some of the committee members, who were against withdrawing the strike, now openly criticised the role of the chairman and his supporters.																								Last year, the government, by an amendment bill, had hiked court fees, which sparked off a continuous strike by the state Bar Council. From October 13, 2002, a total of 26,000 lawyers across the state joined the movement.																								As a result the jails started overflowing, because the accused were not getting bail, in the absence of lawyers. The situation forced the government to agree to revise the fees for some items. But the council was not happy with that. Minister Adhikari then gave a written assurance about considering a rollback. 																								We knew the promise was hollow. That is why we wanted our leadership not to withdraw the strike, said executive committee member Dibyendu Biswas.																								Executive committee chairman Uttam Majumdar rued: It is very unfortunate that the minister has failed to keep his word. He may be a minister, but he is also one of our members.																								Majumdar said that instead of scaling down the fees, the minister was trying foment fresh trouble by deciding to place the Pre-Conciliation Litigation Bill in the Assembly in its next session. This is pressure tactics. Adhikari knows the new Bill will snowball into a bigger issue, and the court-fee scaledown din will be drowned, he said.																								Council chairman Chatterjee, however, says the lawyers had no option then but to call off the strike. The Supreme Court had ruled that lawyers could not strike work. How could we flout the apex court order?, he asked.

		 WASTELAND: Dum Dums dumping ground  at Pramodnagar. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhurySudip Banerjee: What steps have you taken to keep the municipal area garbage-free?																																																													We have engaged two contractors and we have arrangements for dumping the garbage in a designated spot. However, this has run into a problem. When the Circular Railway was being constructed, occupants of the area were settled on that plot. Their health is at risk. Moreover, after it rains, the garbage dumped there begins to rot. So, local people are creating obstructions and as a result, dumping operations have been disrupted. Moreover, the vats and waste material dumped at different places cannot be cleared. If all the systems work properly, there will be no accumulation of garbage. Of course, the government has offered us an alternative site for a dumping ground.

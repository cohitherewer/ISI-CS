																																																		Paresh Mukherjee, a tout, was arrested on Friday for cheating the parents of a six-year-old patient at Medical College and Hospital. During interrogation, Mukherjee admitted that he had contacted Krishnapada Das, a resident of Dum Dum, with the promise of getting his sons MRI done at the hospital. Das son Sourav, who was admitted at Bangur Insititute of Neurology, was asked to get an MRI done by doctors. Das was approached by Mukherjee at Medical College and Hospital when he went there to inquire about the MRI rates a few days ago. Later, Mukherjee informed Das that he had arranged for the MRI at a 50 per cent discounted price of Rs 2,000. When the medical officers asked Das to procure a few more medicines after the MRI on Friday, Das said he had already paid Rs 2,000 through Mukherjee. The authorities said no payment had been made. The police were alerted and Mukherjee was arrested.																																																		Iqbal Ahmed, alias Langra Guddu, was found guilty of attempted murder by the fast-track court at Sealdah on Friday. He has been sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment. The court also fined him Rs 3,000 and another six months imprisonment if he failed to pay the fine. Ahmed, who would extort traders of the Entally and Phoolbagan areas, had demanded protection money from Subhash Agarwal of Chhatubabur Bazaar. On October 10, 2002, Ahmed cornered Agarwal in a grocery shop and shot at him.

Sengupta of Calcutta High Court passed an interim order on Friday, staying the proceedings against the accused in the Chandan Sen murder case in Nadia.

An interactive session between puja organisers and the police, fire brigade and CESC on Friday took an ugly turn after fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee announced that organisers found guilty of not having the required permissions would be booked under the non-bailable offences section.

 Piety path: Puja samagri being sold  in front of Kalighat temple				 																																																																				 Apropos the report Free health coverage for poor mother and children published in Metro on March 3, it is interesting to note that several organisations have undertaken an ambitious plan to provide life insurance facilities to about a lakh poor mothers and safeguarding them against fatal diseases. 				 																																													If this scheme sees the light of the day, it will open a new era in providing relief to the poor and distressed in our country. 				 																																													In this context, it is pertinent to point out that when a major section of the people is suffering due to lack of shelter, food and education, providing insurance coverage to the people from the donations of others may be considered a luxury. 				 																																													The government can undertake such a scheme after meeting other priorities. If there is some political motive behind giving privileges to a section of the partys stooges, this effort, however noble, is bound to be frustrated in the long run.				 																																													Tathagata Kar, 				 																																													Kailash Bose Street. 				 																																																																				It is a pleasure to learn that researchers of Jadavpur Universitys department of food technology plan to manufacture high quality Kalighat temple prasad for export (Food of goddess, far amp; wide, Metro, February 22). It is true that the temples prasad is very popular among devotees abroad. But common people are forced to buy unhygienic and poor quality peda and sandesh from shops inside the Kalighat temple. If the hygienically manufactured prasad is available locally too, it will rescue devotees from the mercy of sellers outside the temple.				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				It is interesting to learn that Japanese Sumo wrestlers will appear in the city next winter (Weight and see big men in big bout, Metro, February 25). Physicians warn us that fat people become easy victims of diseases. I wonder what message those Sumo giants would deliver to the spectators.				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala, 				 																																													Majdia, Nadia.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Milk major whips up quality-skim scheme (Metro, March 3), it is interesting to note that in order to ensure quality and quantity of milk, the dairy has formed a team to supervise the retail outlets across the state. If the check is regularly carried out, it will reduce chances of deterioration of the standard of milk. 				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee, 				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																																																				The report Allies in war, foes in flannels (Metro, February 22) was interesting reading. The challenge was in the spirit of the match in the film Lagaan. Why do the two embassies not make a practice of it in other countries, too, to popularise the game? The chief minister may also challenge the Opposition in the same manner to infuse politics with the spirit of cricket.				 																																													T.R. Anand,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				Where there is a will, there is a way. Deepali Sinha is a perfect example of this adage. The lady who has taken part in almost every conceivable adventure sport has even climbed the Chaturaubhi peak at age 57. The report 50-plus holds her own in a mans world (Metro, February 26) will inspire young girls. We wish her success in her forthcoming endeavours.				 																																													Bhupen Bose,				 																																													Dum Dum Park. 				 																																																																				I was surprised to find myself quoted in the report Revival hopes go up in smoke (Metro, March 14). I vehemently protest against this publication and deny that I ever said what has has appeared in print to any of your reporters on the fire since I was not present on the spot. This blemishes my reputation as a trade union leader.				 																																													Aniruddha Sen Gupta,				 																																													Birati. Metro replies: We stand  by our report. One of our reporters contacted Anirudha Sen  Gupta at his residence over telephone on March 13 afternoon  and his quotes used in the report are based on the telephonic  conversation. Sengupta did mention that he could not visit  the spot because of his illness. But he had not mentioned  during the conversation that his reaction should not be  used in the report. We had not mentioned his illness and  his inability to visit the site as this was not relevant  to the article.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A writ petition was filed before Calcutta High Court on Tuesday demanding judicial intervention to spare commuters the trouble they face due to the utter mismanagement of traffic.

Mathur.																								Let the matter come up for hearing. We will make our stand clear in court, said advocate-general Balai Ray, when asked about the NGOs petition.

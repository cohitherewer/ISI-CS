A youths body was found with several stab wounds on his chest and neck in an abandoned police barrack in the Watgunge area on Monday morning.																								Deputy commissioner of police (port) H.P. Singh said the youth had been partying with friends on Sunday night. The barrack is on the banks of Tollys Nullah, off Dahighat. He was brutally stabbed.

At Udaynarayanpur, in Howrah, Gopal Mondal, 42, killed his neighbour Buddhadeb Mondol by hitting him on the head with a sharp weapon. Gopal, a fisherman, suspected Buddhadeb of having an affair with his wife.																								A 36-year-old man, Anchan Chakraborty, is suspected to have killed himself after a quarrel with his family in his D.L. Roy Street home, in the Amherst Street police station area, on Monday morning.

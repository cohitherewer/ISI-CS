	Long-distance buses from Babughat and Howrah often carry  passengers on the roof. Some vehicles also ferry a lot of  luggage. Are these vehicles strong enough to carry so much  weight? Or are the authorities just waiting for another  mishap to happen?  
	K. Asokan, Salkia.  
	Behala post office frequently runs out of postcards, money  order forms and other stationery. A few weeks ago, I was  refused two money order forms, as they did not have sufficient  stock. Another man did not accept a speed post, as the office  did not have receipts of acknowledgement. 
	R. Gupta, Behala.  
	Last Sunday, in front of National Library, I saw an ambulance  trying to make its way through the opposite traffic. A driver  even abused the ambulance staff while speeding off, keeping  the van waiting while it passed. Is this civilisation?  
	S. Banerjee, Jodhpur Park.

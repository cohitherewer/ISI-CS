 Thursday, June 05, 2003 				 Facelift plan for canal embankment
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A major plan has been drawn up to restore the embankments of Tollys Nullah. The plan, prepared by Habitat Center, an organisation working on environment issues, foresees tree-lined banks and canal-side thoroughfares to beautify Tollys Nullah.																								Saplings will be planted and a walkway laid along the Nullah from Kalighat to the Hooghly banks via Alipore Zoo, explained Habitat Center executive director K.P. Bhattacharya on Wednesday. This can be a part of the citys green corridor, which will subsequently extend to east and north Calcutta, he added. Plans were afoot to plant nearly 150 saplings along the 15-kilometre stretch. 																								The Center will hold talks with the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on the facelift. Since most of the land on which we plan to implement our scheme belongs to the CPT, we have to involve them, Bhattacharya said. Let them send us the proposal and we will examine the details, a CPT official said.																								The technical design of the project will be carried out by the Centers planning cell. The project involves an expenditure of Rs 1 lakh for every kilometre.

 Thursday, May 15, 2003 				 Wanted criminal in garb of petty thief
 A STAFF REPORTER																								He spent five days in police custody, posing as a petty thief, using a false name and address. On Tuesday, hours before producing him in court, the police realised his real identity  Mohammad Shamim, a notorious criminal who had slipped out of cop clutches last month and was being hunted by various police stations and the detective department till his (unknowing) arrest in a snatching case on May 8.																								Shamim, 27, is better known as Antony in crime circles. He almost pulled off an audacious stunt by posing as a petty criminal who would have been released on bail, had his identity not been revealed at the last moment and landed him behind bars till May 25.																								Shamim was caught red-handed on Lovers Lane on May 8 while trying to snatch some valuables from a plainclothed policeman. The officer, in kurta- pyjama, pinned him down and alerted the thana, said Nanda Dulal Paul, officer-in-charge, Hastings police station.																								During interrogation, Shamim identified himself as Mohammad Tanveer, a resident of B.K. Road. There seemed nothing really wrong in the information he was giving us. We went to the address given by him at night, but found the house locked, said Paul. So, we produced him in court as Tanveer and the chief metropolitan magistrate remanded him in police custody till Tuesday.																								But when the Hastings police circulated a photograph among neighbouring thanas, an officer of Metiabruz recognised Shamim, wanted in several criminal cases in the port area. The officer rushed to the Hastings police station hours before Shamim was to be produced in court and identified him. We then started interrogating him again, till he disclosed his real name and address  Fatehpur Village Road, in Garden Reach, said Paul. We told the court about the trick played by Shamim. The magistrate remanded him in police custody till May 25. 																								The officers of Metiabruz and Garden Reach police stations will soon file their petitions to take Shamim into their custody. The officers of the detective department have also contacted us and they will interrogate him soon, added Paul.

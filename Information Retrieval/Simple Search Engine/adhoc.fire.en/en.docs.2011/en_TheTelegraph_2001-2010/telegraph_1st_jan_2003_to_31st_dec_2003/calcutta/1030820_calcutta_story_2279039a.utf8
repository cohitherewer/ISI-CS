 Coach, East-Bengal Money is not the factor. What  is important is the will to do the job. The Cricket Association  of Bengal does not charge the spectators for maintenance,  yet look at Eden Gardens! The government may have a funds  constraint, but it is not in such dire straits as to lack  money for a good job. The government may ask the IFA to  keep Rs 2 from the price of, say, a 10-rupee ticket. Or  it may add a Rs-2 maintenance fee on the ticket. Yet, charging  a maintenance fee will not ensure actual maintenance of  the ground, unless the will is there.

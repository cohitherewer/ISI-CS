The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Every street corner is a mound of filth
		 Dump that: Bhowanipore  has a grouse about its garbage. Picture by Kishor Roy  Choudhury Champa Mukherjee: I live in a slum area. Here, you will find garbage dumped at every street corner all day. The civic workers clean up the previous days waste by 10 in the morning but my neighbours start tossing out their kitchen waste after noon. The CMC has removed a vat that it had installed earlier. Can something be done about it?																																																													The problem is not that you live in a slum area. Its just that people in your area lack civic sense. We have got to help them realise that dumping garbage is not the right thing to do and for that, I will try and approach the residents and ask them to desist from the nuisance. If need be, I will print leaflets and distribute them to all the houses in the ward. Even after these attempts, if residents continue to dump their garbage on the roads, I will have to slap a fine on them. 																																																													 Vats are no longer allowed on city streets, by a law. Hence, I cannot do anything on that front.

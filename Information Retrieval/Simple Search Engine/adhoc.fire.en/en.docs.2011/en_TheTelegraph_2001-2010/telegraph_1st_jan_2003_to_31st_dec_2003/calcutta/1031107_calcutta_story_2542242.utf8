																								Moscow Classical Ballet, as the company is popularly known, is one of the worlds best-known ballet troupes. Its repertoire of excerpts from classical ballets, as well as choreographic miniatures, draws deeply on the traditions of the Moscow School of Classical Dance. It was set up in 1966 to tour the then Soviet Union and other countries, and perform Russian classical ballet in its traditional form. The arrival, in 1977, of Vladimir Vasilyov and Natalya Kasatkina as art directors transformed the stature of the ballet company. A theatrical approach to the traditional masterpieces of Russian ballet and the incorporation of modern choreography gave Moscow Classical Ballet a new artistic direction. The concluding evening of the present tour includes a performance of the celebrated ballet, Giselle, by the State Academic Classical Ballet Theatre, Moscow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Safety sieve for printed word
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should an independent censor board be set up to vet novels before they go to print? More letters will be published next week				 Salman Rushdies  effigy being burnt after the publication of The Satanic  Verses  Masood Nehaz, 
																		Ismail Street.																																																														A novel should be free from any controversial opinion. There is a need to set up an independent censor board to check a novel before it goes to print so that there is no cultural or racial abuse in it which could hurt sentiments. We look forward to seeing such an institution come up.									

Piyal Mukherjee, 
																		Lake Town.																																																														It is for the readers to judge whether to accept or reject the writings of a novelist. So an independent censor board vetting novels is an unnecessary and time-consuming process. Moreover, it may amount to infringement on the democratic rights of writers. However, if a book contains ideas that can vitiate the social atmosphere, the government may ban the book to safeguard peoples interests. 									

Sandhya Banerjee, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														An independent censor board should be set up to check novels if they seem to be harmful for readers. Literary works hold up a mirror to society. Writers inspire us with their free and fair reasoning. On the other hand, novels may also incite the reader. So if there are doubt, they should be censored before printing. 									

Sunil Banerjee, 
																		VIP Road.																																																														Writers draw their material from life and their portrayal truly reflects society, be it in good or bad light. Besides, it is tough to draw a demarcation line between what is obscene and what is not. Setting up a censor board for vetting novels before they go to print is not only unjust but would also be an awful blow to the writers. Their liberty should never be restricted, because novels are like mirrors, in which we can see our faces.									

Md Tanweer, 
																		Park Circus.																																																														If a man is so wicked with religion, what would happen without religion? To err is human and it is the prophets who rectify our faults. Writing against them means creating anarchy in society and misguiding innocent people. My suggestion to authors is to rectify themselves before trying to rectify others. Religion-based books of any caste or creed should be thoroughly examined. If there is too much freedom of expression, there will be no fear of god in man.									

Govinda Bakshi, 
																		Budge Budge. 																																																														The move will definitely lead to censoring obscene novels before they go to print. But in a democracy, freedom of speech and expression has been guaranteed in the Constitution. Naturally, setting up a censor board is an unnecessary proposition. 									

Anirban Mandal,
																		Itachuna. 																																																														A novel is written for readers. So, the readers should be the judges whether a novel is good or not. If novels are censored before publication, their essence may get diluted. So, I think it will not be a just decision. 									

Tapan Mukherjee, 
																		Address not given. 																																																														No, an independent censor board is not needed. Every novel has its own statement to make. If things are deleted after vetting novels, then novels will lose their statements.									

Arnab Chattopadhyay, 
																		Dhakuria.																																																														Every author has the right to express his agony and ill feeling towards society through his writings. A mere law cannot put him down. Rather, any interference gives his writings free publicity. The recent hullabaloo over the novel Dwikhandita by Taslima Nasreen shows how truth is abhorred by people as well as the government. They dont want their drawbacks to be highlighted. Same was the situation when Samaresh Basus Bibar and Prajapati were released. The censor board can only ban a printed novel. But it cannot stop Taslima from giving vent to her views otherwise. Even if she is obliterated, more Taslimas will emerge, writing more novels highlighting religion and sex. So, it would be best to hand over the right of judgement to the public.									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
																		Behala. 																																																														The recent order of the government banning Taslima Nasreens Dwikhandita once again raises the question. Religion has become a sensitive issue and should be avoided. If a book is banned after printing, the publisher faces financial losses. Again, writers may feel uneasy to freely express their thoughts if a condition of prior approval is attached. It will, therefore, be better if the writer takes the responsibility not to intentionally hurt the feelings of any community. The publisher should also be alert on this point. 									

Satyen Biswas,
																		Behala.																																																														Yes. But who will bell the cat? Those who will screen these novels should have profound knowledge of those subjects, and be able to carefully read between the lines, because it is a question of prestige for both the author and the censor board.									

Md Ayub,
																		Bright Street.																																																														Yes, an independent censor board should be set up to vet novels before they go to print. The Central government should form the censor board with some IAS officers, senior sportspersons and social workers. The censor board should control vulgarity and monitor sensitive issues to maintain communal harmony. 									

Ujjal Bhattacharyya, 
																		CIT Road, Entally.																																																														The need is definitely there to curb such controversies that are a blot on our literary heritage. Bengali literature is rich in quality, graceful and sober. Therefore, controversies and bans are definitely undesirable. These cause losses for publishers and booksellers. The practice to vet novels will surely protect the reputation of writers, publishers and our culture. Such a body can check unauthorised publications as well.									

A.F. kamruddin, 
																		Collin Lane.																																																														The system is not only chaotic but will also take us back to the black days of the Emergency. But there are some writers who intentionally hurt peoples sentiments for the sake of publicity. So it is best if the writers form a body which will warn such authors.

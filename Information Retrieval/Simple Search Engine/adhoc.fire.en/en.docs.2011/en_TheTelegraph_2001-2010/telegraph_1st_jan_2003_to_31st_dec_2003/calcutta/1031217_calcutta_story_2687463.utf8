The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, December 17, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Censor stink on flow of ink
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should an independent censor board be set up to vet novels before they go to print? More letters will be published next week Between the lines: Let readers be the final judge  Anil Kumar Sen, 
																		Ramchandra Chatterjee Lane.																																																														The authorities are doing the right thing by stopping certification of novels which distort social reality. But in some cases they are bound to act in their own interest and withhold permission for novels even if they are not controversial. The best way to deal with such a situation is to set up an independent censor board instead of unnecessarily raising a hue and cry. 									

P. Pramanik, 
																		Santoshpur Avenue.																																																														A novel is the free expression of a writer. Yet the idea of forming a censor board to vet novels before they go to print is not bad provided the board members are knowledgeable, broadminded and free from prejudice.									

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury, 
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														If books have to pass censorship tests, it would limit the writer. Novels shall lose their originality. Autobiographical works, especially, need to depict facts and the writers own state of mind. Rather, publishers should ensure that the novelist depicts the true story in case of biographical works. Since various types of magazines flood the market and are accessible to all, why should only novels pass through censorship?									

Biman Saha,
																		Lake Town.																																																														Some authors write objectionable or obscene things simply for publicity. Some authors write to give vent to their anger on people who have harmed them in some way. Censoring is absolutely necessary as such writing may affect people, particularly adolescents. In such cases, there should be censoring but with a practical outlook, as in some cases explicit accounts help unfold unpleasant truths or unmask corruption. Therefore, an independent censor board may be set up to vet novels. But such a board should consist of persons with no vested interests. 									

Bishal Neogi, 
																		Address not given.																																																														Novels and essays are a documentation of the writers thoughts. It may be an imaginary outburst, based on todays socio-political contradictions. It could be a reckless abuse of a cult or an ideology. To me, the pen should float at length by virtue of its masters elegance. It has every right to question so-called traditionalism and values. The society should be bold enough to meet the challenge. So, no matter what independent censor board is invented (if at all), the question of its relevance looms large. Readers act as a censoring body by accepting or rejecting a literary work. 																																																														Admittedly, censorship could be a sharp rap for todays Rushdie or Nasreen, but it would fail to prevent the making of a future Pasternak! 									

Diptimoy Ghosh, 
																		Salt Lake.																																																														The formation of an independent book censor board (like a film censor board) will, perhaps, be logical. This system may restrict unwanted/ undesired contents which may spark a controversy. Any matter endangering national integration, destroying communal harmony, creating a scandal and showcasing vulgarity should be discarded. If necessary, some books be marked A (for adults) as we find in films. We have to follow such norms so that nobody, especially minors, feel embarrassed to read a book. 									

P. N. Pal, 
																		Karaya Road. 																																																														Such a system is, indeed, inconceivable in a civilised society. Education broadens the mind and enables it to identify the good from the evil. A literary creation, however provocative, cannot corrupt an educated and liberal mind. Any creation that goes against fundamental principles of society is bound to be rejected. In fact, the educated conscience of the people is the real censor of a novel. Review of a novel by any censor board will not serve any purpose other than betray a suspicion of the peoples conscience. 									

Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, 
																		Barasat.																																																														Preposterous idea. It is sheer madness, an affront to novelists. Readers are the best judges of literary works, not any censor board. It is like asking couples to appear before a medical board before procreation. 									

Sudeshna Ghosh, 
																		Address not given. 																																																														Yes, because only an independent censor board can remove the unhygienic stuff from a novel and serve to the readers a plate with proper food value. When a novel appears to be antagonistic towards religion, society and culture, hostile ripples of objection and controversy are created. So, such disputed issues that lead to communal strife or vulgarity must be censored for the sake of promoting refined taste among our budding generations. 									

Anandarup Ghosal, 
																		Baguiati.																																																														No, because writing is the only way through which an author can express himself. We have no right to suppress his voice. If we do so, we would suppress the truth. Who is the government to ban a book? Let the people decide what is right and what is not. It is easy to censor or ban something but it is tough to create something. I am dismayed at the recent decision of the Bengal government. 																																																														To vet a novel before publication is questioning creativity. It also goes against the spirit of our Constitution. The government claims that Bengal is progressing. But a ban on a novel takes us back to the dark ages. 									

Madhusree Gupta, 
																		Anil Roy Road. 																																																														From time immemorial, books have been banned on political, religious and moral grounds. But the irony is that these books enjoyed a larger circulation because they were banned. But a ban on a book is often unjustly issued. If an independent censor board could be set up then perhaps we could expect some justice for books and authors. 									

Chandan Ray, 
																		Sarsuna.																																																														It is not at all desirable to pass novels through an independent censor board. Novels are works of literature. If portions are chopped off, the characteristics of a book will be lost to the readers.

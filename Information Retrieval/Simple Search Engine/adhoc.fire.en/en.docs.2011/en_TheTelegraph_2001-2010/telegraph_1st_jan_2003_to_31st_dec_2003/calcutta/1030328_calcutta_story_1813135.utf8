 Friday, March 28, 2003 				 Injection haul in factory swoop
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) swooped down on a Sonarpur factory manufacturing injections without a licence from the drug controller on Thursday. A huge quantity of fake drugs was seized. Police investigation indicated that the injections were spurious. 																								Special superintendent of police Manoj Malviya said 500,000 injections were seized from the factorys store. The injections were packed in 50 boxes and ready for delivery to medical stores in and around the city. According to CID officers, each box had about 10,000 injections. A large number of the injections carried labels of a popular drug, police said. 																								We arrested Gopal Tarafdar, who had set up the factory in mid-2002 and started producing and marketing the drugs about six months earlier, Malviya said. Quoting Tarafdars statement, he added that more than 1,000 cases of injections had already reached the market in the city and the suburbs. CID officers said the seized boxes of injections had been sent to the drug control laboratory for tests. 																								According to Malviya, the CID was tipped off by sources in the citys medical fraternity that spurious injections were being manufactured in the Sonarpur factory. 																								Deputy superintendent of the special operation group Tanmay Roy Choudhury conducted a raid with a big team on Tuesday morning. Tarafdar was then supervising the packaging of injections. Sleuths said two Matadors were parked at the gate waiting to take the boxes to medical stores.																								Police said there were 22 persons working in four rooms of the single-storeyed house. There was a laboratory in one of the rooms, where people in aprons were preparing the injections. In another, some labourers were engaged in pasting the labels on the injections, a sleuth said. Tarafdar had even set up a branch in Canning with the help of an associate.																								Police raided the place on Thursday afternoon and arrested manager-in-charge Sreedam Mondol, Malviya said. Tarafdar and Mondol were brought to the CID headquarters at Bhabani Bhavan for interrogation.

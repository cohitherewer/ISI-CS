 Saturday, May 17, 2003 				 Mumbai man is kidnap accused, confirms CID
 AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR																								The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Friday confirmed that Nur Mohammad Sheikh, currently in Mumbai Police custody, is Shahbaz, one of the accused in the abduction case of Khadims vice-chairman Parthapratim Roy Burman. 																								He is Shahbaz, one of the four criminals present at 11.30 am on July 25 outside the CN Roy Road warehouse, from where Roy Burman was kidnapped. He had shot the industrialist while dragging him out of the car, disclosed additional director-general of police (CID) Ranjit Mohanty.																								Mumbai Police passed on Sheikhs snapshots to the CID on Thursday evening. Armed with the photographs, sleuths went to Presidency jail on Friday morning and interrogated Aftab Ansari. Along with Ansari, co-accused Abdur Rehman and other associates identified Sheikh as Shahbaz, said a senior CID officer, who was a part of the team. 																								Sleuths said a police team contacted Swati Pal with the picture and she, too, confirmed that the man in the picture was Shahbaz. 																								Last week, acting on a tip-off from Andhra Police, Mumbai Police crime branch officers arrested Sheikh from Malad. Over phone from Mumbai, inspector Pradeep Sharma told Metro that Sheikh was involved in two blast cases there and during interrogation, had confessed to being hired by Ansari to kidnap Roy Burman. Sharma said Shahbaz had several aliases, like Aurangzeb, Nur Ahmed and Shahbaz.																								CID sources said on Friday that Ansari had confessed to sleuths about hiring Shahbaz for Rs 1.25 lakh to kidnap Roy Burman. He admitted that he had been looking for professionals for the job and slain militant and associate Asif Reza Khan had introduced Shahbaz to him, an officer added.																								Ansari claimed that Shahbaz, Maroof, Wazed and Aslam went to the Haroa hideout with Roy Burman, where Asif Reza Khan joined them. Shahbaz left for Mumbai from Haroa. Ansari disclosed that Shahbaz hailed from Malegaon and worked for the underworld on contract. 																								Deputy inspector-general of police Raj Kanojia is leaving for Mumbai with investigating officer Rashid Khan on Saturday. Some key accused are still absconding and we hope Shahbaz will provide information on their whereabouts, added additional director-general Mohanty. The CID will move court to bring Sheikh back on transit remand.

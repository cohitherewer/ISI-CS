 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 DA dues agitation cloud on campus
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Academic activities in universities and colleges across the state are likely to be hit, with teachers and employees threatening indefinite agitations in early 2004.																								Irrespective of their political leanings, teachers and non-teaching employees unions of universities and colleges have decided to launch indefinite movements against the government on a common grievance  non-payment of enhanced dearness allowance (DA).																								University employees and teachers are peeved over the fact that those working in state-aided educational institutions still draw DA at the old rate of 41 per cent, while that for state government employees has been raised to 45 per cent in July. According to government norms, the teaching and non-teaching staff of state-aided educational institutions are entitled to DA on a par with employees of government offices, claimed the teachers. 																								Administrative work in all Calcutta University departments is likely to be disrupted in January, when more than 2,800 non-teaching staff of the institution will hold a chain of agitations under the CPM-controlled Calcutta University Employees Association. We have waited for more than six months, hoping that the government will release the enhanced DA. Now we have resolved not to wait any more, said Siddheswar Ghosal, a leader of the union. We will start a weeklong agitation from January 1. If our demand is not met by then, we will be compelled to go in for an indefinite strike.																								In support of the cause, Jadavpur University (JU) teachers have threatened to start a sustained protest against the government from January. We have long been requesting the government to let us know why JU teachers were not being paid the raised DA. Now, we have no option but to launch an agitation, said Chittaranjan Mondal, general secretary of the anti-CPM Jadavpur University Teachers Association.

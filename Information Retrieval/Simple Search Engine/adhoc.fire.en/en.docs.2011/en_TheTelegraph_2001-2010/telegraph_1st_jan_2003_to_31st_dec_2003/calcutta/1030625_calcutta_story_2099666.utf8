 Wednesday, June 25, 2003 				 Unknown trio lynched for dacoity 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Three young men, suspected to be dacoits, were lynched early on Tuesday. The police failed to identify them. 																								On Monday night, 10 armed men stormed the house of Jagai Sardar, a local trader, at Makrampur, and looted cash and jewellery worth a lakh of rupees. They threatened the family at gunpoint not to raise an alarm. 																								As soon as the dacoits left, Sardars family hailed the local vigilantes. The patrol saw some young men fleeing the area and ran after them. The dacoits opened fire from country-made revolvers and hurled bombs to scare away their pursuers.																								On reaching Nabasan, in Shikari Para, the vigilantes and some residents grabbed hold of three members of the gang and started to beat them up with iron rods and bamboo poles. After the trio slumped senseless, the local police were called in to take the youths to hospital, where they were declared dead.																								The incident sparked resentment among residents, who complained that criminals had free and easy access to the area. Thefts are regular, but the police dont bother, they alleged. 																								On Sunday, a gang raided a Vivekananda Pally house but failed to carry off the dacoity as the inmates woke up. One dacoit died in a fall from the roof. Later, it was found that he was drunk.																								Monday nights dacoity was reported to senior police officers, and additional superintendent of police (industrial) R.K. Singh visited the spot. Singh said: We are trying to identify the gang. All police stations have been alerted. I have asked my officers to recover the goods stolen by the gang.

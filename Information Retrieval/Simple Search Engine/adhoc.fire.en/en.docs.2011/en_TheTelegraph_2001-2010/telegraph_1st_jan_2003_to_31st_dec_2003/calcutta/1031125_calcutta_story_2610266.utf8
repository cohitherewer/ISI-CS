The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, November 25, 2003  Wish list 
 An Eye on Calcutta / Barry  O'Brien Ive always wanted to hear the  charismatic Somnath Chatterjee sparring with a senior journalist  in an open forum; Ive always wanted to sit in the front  row and allow the voice of Shubha Mudgal to take me through  India, both rustic and real; Ive always wanted to hear  a corporate professional praise a minister behind his back. All three wishes were fulfilled  at Infocom 2003 last week in Calcutta. The respected Parliamentarian  and WBIDC Chairman didnt take The Telegraph editor  Aveek Sarkars comment, What India thinks today, Bengal  may think tomorrow, too kindly. Shubha Mudgal set The Oberoi  Grand Ballroom alight on the second night; and a dynamic  IT professional, an old friend who prefers to be anonymous,  filled me in on facts about Manabendra Mukherjee, the States  IT minister, who spends hours sipping coffee at Coffee Pai,  discussing projects with his crack team till late into the  night.  Judging by the tremendous response,  Infocom is well on its way to becoming the countrys most  talked-about IT conference and exhibition. Organised by  Nasscom and BusinessWorld, it showcased 100 stalls  and the viewpoints of a galaxy of politicians, journalists,  IT professionals and corporate gurus. If the movement gathers  momentum and Bengal stays focussed, heres a prediction  that may blow your minds: five years down the line, the  cyber capital of the country could move from Hyderabad and  Bangalore to Calcutta. Stranger things have happened in  the IT world.  Thank you for the music Reliable sources and an occasional  night out at Dublin  Calcuttas newest chill-out zone for  young grown-ups and grown-ups who feel young  tell me that  ITC Sonar Bangla only goes to bed when the cock crows on  the Bypass. Then things get quiet. Silence, service and  sophistication fill the air. Evening comes and its time  to rock once again. So the cycle continues and gains momentum  by the night.  Ten days ago, the cycle remained  the same, only the time zone went awry. It was at nine oclock  on a weekday morning that Pritika Malhotras nimble fingers  on the piano sprung the banquet hall to life 12 hours ahead  of schedule. She was in concert and the silent, sophisticated  crowd applauded  a gentle, genuine applause it was. Pritika isnt an experienced classical  pianist on a world tour. Shes a nine-year old Calcuttan  whose passion is Western classical music. A student of Akshar,  Pritika, like many other children and teenagers, sent out  a strong message that morning: Calcutta continues to cling  to its love for music, every which way.  The event was the inaugural Young  Talent Contest organised by the Calcutta School of Music,  perhaps the countrys earliest and most distinguished home  for Western classical music. Its story goes back to 1915,  when Dr Philippe Sandre, a distinguished musician of the  time, founded it to foster an interest in European music  and motivate musicians to take their art to the public.  As music critic extraordinaire,  Kishore Chatterjee, records: Soon the Calcutta Symphony  Orchestra was formed, the bands  Army, Police, Barrackpore  and the Governors  merging into it. Conducted by the  likes of Gerald Neil Craig and Bernard Jacob, maestros like  Yehudi Menuhin and Isaac Stern have performed with the Orchestra. Calcuttas rich heritage of Western  classical music has its roots in the fact that many professional  teachers came over to impart music lessons to the wives  of English civil servants. Bored and homesick, these ladies  befriended instrument and teacher alike, and many a lovely  afternoon was filled with music and mystique. Long before  that, in 1781, the charismatic Nabakrishna Deb hosted a  dance to Western music, to celebrate the birthday of one  Miss Wrangham, the most beautiful Englishwoman in town at  the time. In 1803, 50 years after Handels death, his oratorio  Judas Maccabeus was performed here by church-goers  and amateurs.  The popularity graph of Western  classical music went up with the Wednesday Music Forums  hosted by Indira Debi Choudhurani, the Sunday music sessions  of Anil Gupta and the Tuesday Club of Dr Adi Gazder. And  how can one ignore Satyajit Rays great romance with Western  classical music? A founder-member of the Calcutta Gramophone  Society, he was a serious listener who encouraged others  to develop a ear for it.  Over the years, the Oxford Mission  in Behala, under the baton of Father Matthiessen, has produced  musicians by the score. As its mission continues, the Calcutta  Foundation Orchestra, patronised by Shamlu Dudeja, takes  on the mantle. Today, from Raj Bhavan to Taj Bengal, the  CFO is pulling at the heartstrings as it adjusts keys from  Tchaikovsky to Tagore.  Chief guest Kathy Hall (extreme right)  with some of the winners of CSMs Young Talent  Contest  Like Ray and Matthiessen, there  were others too whose umbilical music cord could never be  detached from the magic of Mozart and the brilliance of  Bach. As a child, I watched in awe the likes of Brian Conway  and Caro Basil decipher every note of every classical piece  played at quiz contests in the 70s. As an adult, last week,  I watched in awe as young Calcuttans let the piano and their  violins voice their love for classical music.  While Lee Alison Sibley, Anita  Mehta and Rev. Noel Sen judged the classical category,  Gopa Ghosh and Ian Zachairah ranked the performers in the  popular category. A fitting finale saw Usha Uthup singing  I Believe in Music with a one-time accompanist of  hers, Cyrus Tata. Cyrus and Nondon Bagchi, like Garney Nyss,  Carlton Kitto and Lew Hilt before them, are members of CSMs  popular music faculty. Hitting the right classical chords  with its 750 students, is a truly-skilled team of musicians  led by the principal, Tanusree Deb.  With connoisseurs Dickoo Nowroji  and Sam Medora heading the governing committee, one things  for sure  CSM will show the way as it trains the young  in music, dance, elocution and communication skills. Lets  raise a toast to CSM and let the music play on!

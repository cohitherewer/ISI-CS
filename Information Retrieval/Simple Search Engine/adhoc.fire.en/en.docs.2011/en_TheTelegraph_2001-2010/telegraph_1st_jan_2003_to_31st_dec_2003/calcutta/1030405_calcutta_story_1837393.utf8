Take heart  the fare on the small screen, and imports on the large screen should tide film buffs over for a while.The words all that jazz will never quite be the same once you catch Chicago.

But if you havent seen the first part, make sure you take a navigator with you.The action is non-stop with Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson in Shanghai Knights, which follows Shanghai Noon, playing at Jyoti. The martial-arts action comedy is set in London after its predecessor tamed the Wild West. Also, wait and watch out for The Recruit starring Al Pacino and Colin Farrell.If the sweltering summer is keeping you indoors, no sweat, as the stars are shining big and bright. If you didnt catch one of last years biggest films, Bend it Like Beckham, another chance is knocking on your couch. This Sunday, 9 pm, the Gurinder Chaddha superhit, starring Parminder Nagra, will be kicking up a storm on Star Movies.More melody, more masti from last years favourite musical.

The latest to join the battle bandwagon is the International Young Artists Organisation currently holding an exhibition at Chemould gallery to protest American aggression. A press release claims they are a world-wide organisation that has several shows to its credit in Calcutta and Dhaka. If the current show, entitled No War, is anything to go by, the organisation should either stop holding exhibitions or should pull up their socks immediately. There are about six participants with 22 works on display. The weapons of war and destruction are supposedly suggested by something that resembles a home-made, upright rocket dating back to the days of the Sputnik and torn newspaper headlines highlighting the carnage of civilians and children in the war on Iraq. Dummies wrapped like mummies lie on the floor next to the missile. Could we think of more half-baked ideas about war and violence? And why was an attempt made to create an installation at all? Only to be with it?The other paintings, if they deserve that appellation, are whorls and dashes of dark colour, structureless and formless and executed without any finesse whatsoever. The participants must have been compelled to contribute anything that came to mind. Or else why should roll and Afro jazz from none other than choreographer and dextrous dancer Shiamak Davar.

But Anjana Basus romance with the written word had continued for too long for her to abandon the pen. So 21 long years ago, she had switched to advertising. And on Thursday, her first novel will be launched at Seagull Bookstore. The idea of Curses in Ivory came to me when my grandma died. Women of that generation led such amazing lives, suffering so much in silence, says the adviser to Wysiwyg, an advertising agency. Curses in Ivory is a richly textured tale of three generations of women who live under the spell of an ancestral curse, brought upon them by the smashing of a statue of Goddess Durga. I finished the story around six years ago and passed it around among my friends for their comments. She kept making alterations till she thought the manuscript was ready. For a pro with over 20 years in advertising, was it not tough to switch from pithy prose that ad copies demand? I kept hoping I wouldnt catch the style, laughs the author, who started life at HTA and counts the ITC Classic campaign and the Wills Made for Each Other yearbooks as her favourite assignments.But the novel has not been a sudden leap from copywriting, either. My first published work was for a newspaper at age 12. Then on, I have been writing poems and short stories, she points out.Orient Longman brought out some of Basus short stories in 1994, while BBC World Service broadcast one (Smoke gets in your eyes) in 1999. She was also featured in Penguin Indias anthology of poems In their Own Voices. Thursday evening promises to be more than a launch (by filmmaker Rituparno Ghosh).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, November 24, 2003 				 Reckless vendors, callous factory
		 A factory blocks the main road in ward  119. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhurySoumen Haldar: I live on a stretch of Diamond Harbour Road that falls in your constituency. Here, a local market has turned into a nuisance. The adjacent drain is totally clogged as the vendors dump all their refuse in it. A small factory close to the market is adding to the pollution. Repeated complaints have failed to yield any result.																																																													The market you mention has come up illegally and the vendors are creating a lot of trouble. It speaks of a total lack of civic sense. In this regard, as a peoples representative, I seek your cooperation. I have received several complaints against the factory. No one has the right to ply a trade by blocking a thoroughfare. I shall talk to the authorities concerned to clamp down on it. 																																																													In that area, I faced a lot of problem when I went for a desilting drive. Otherwise, in my ward, garbage is collected on a regular basis. I myself request everybody to deposit their litter at a particular spot.

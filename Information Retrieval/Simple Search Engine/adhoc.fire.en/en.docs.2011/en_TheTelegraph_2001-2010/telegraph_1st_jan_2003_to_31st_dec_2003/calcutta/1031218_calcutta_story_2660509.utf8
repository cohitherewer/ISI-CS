The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Hide hub flouts shift
 SUNANDO SARKAR AND SANJAY MANDAL																								Under the nose of a host of state agencies and supremely oblivious to apex court directives, the pollutant-spewing tanneries are carrying on work in the Tangra-Tiljala belt, turning Calcutta even more toxic by the day.																								More than one in four of the tanneries in the neighbourhood of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, asked to go off production (for the first time in February 2002) several times by the apex court in the country, are still operating in a supposedly secret manner. Though they try not to attract too much attention, a visit to the area reveals how little they have done to hide their illegal activities.																								Care has been taken to stop all work in only the tanneries that are along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. But, inside the lanes and bylanes, nothing much has changed. 																								Only the private roads, which pedestrians are usually allowed to use, have now been shut (with the help of large iron gates). But these, too, are thrown open to outsiders wanting to make use of the old short-cuts from the heart of Tangra to the thoroughfare  the pretext used in this case to get behind the gates.																								The Supreme Court prods came and went but, despite the governments admission that all tanneries have shifted from the Tangra-Tiljala belt, around 125 units are still working there. From early morning till late in the afternoon, there is a whirr of machines and activity centres around the boilers in almost every Tangra and Tiljala bylane. 																								It is likely to make you forget that between now and February 2002, the Supreme Court bench convened several times to impress upon Calcuttas leather merchants and the state government the necessity to cease operations in the area and shift to the Calcutta Leather Complex at Bantala, a few kilometres from the site of the old tanneries.																								When no Supreme Court order could restrain the citys leather-makers, the sprawling belt (officially) played host to 525 tanneries, an Indian Leather Tanners Association spokesperson said. Besides, there were nearly a hundred more tanneries that functioned without government sanction, taking the total number of leather-making units in the area up to 600-plus, he admitted.																								Officially, the association maintains that no tannery is working in the area. Only old stocks are being cleared now, an association spokesperson said, insisting that tanning of raw hide  using chemicals extremely harmful to the environment  had stopped. But there was no response to queries about what the association was doing to ensure that all its members were adhering to the rules.

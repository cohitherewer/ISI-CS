 																											- Ex-employer held, Trinamul wants beauty parlour sealed A STAFF REPORTER																								An 18-year-old girl, who arrived in Calcutta from her village in search of her husband, was raped, allegedly by her former employer, on Tuesday morning.																								A 50-year-old local businessman, Mohammad Salauddin Huda, alias Fateh, was arrested on Tuesday morning at his residence in Kashinath Mullick Lane, in the Jorasanko police station area, for allegedly raping the girl, who earlier worked in his house as a domestic help. 																								Agitating Trinamul Congress supporters demonstrated in front of the police station and later, blocked Mahatma Gandhi Road for about half an hour to protest the rape. Huda owns a beauty parlour on the road and also runs a transport company. 																								The girl used to work as a domestic help in Hudas house before her marriage to Sheikh Sikandar Ali. After her marriage, she left the job, and instead, Ali was employed in Hudas transport business as a labourer, said officer-in-charge of Jorasanko police station T.K. Bhattacharya. 																								She arrived in Calcutta on Monday from Pandua, in Hooghly, to look for her husband, who had not returned home for the past five days. She approached Huda to find out whether he knew where she could find her husband. 																								According to the victim, Huda asked her to follow him to the transport company godown, where Ali worked. The man took her to the roof and allegedly raped her.																								When Ali came to know from his friends that his wife was in Calcutta and looking for him, he hunted around for her and arrived at the godown. There, he found her in a sorry state and was told what had happened. Immediately, he went and lodged a complaint with the local police station.																								We sent his wife to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital for a medical check-up. When the doctors confirmed the rape after preliminary examination we arrested Huda, said an officer of Jorasanko police station.																								Local Trinamul leader Ashok Jha demanded the closure of Fatehs beauty parlour. That is a place for all kinds of illegal activities. Shady characters frequent the place all day, Jha alleged. Bhattacharya pointed out that a separate complaint would have to be lodged against the beauty parlour.

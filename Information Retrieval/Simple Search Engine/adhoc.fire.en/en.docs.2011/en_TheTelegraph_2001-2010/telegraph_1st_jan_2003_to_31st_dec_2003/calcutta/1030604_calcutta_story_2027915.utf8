 Wednesday, June 04, 2003 				 Madhyamik monitor for correct marks
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education is extra cautious about not repeating the Madhyamik 2002 fiasco this time round. A committee, comprising senior teachers, has been formed to cross-check the discrepancies in the answer-scripts of Madhyamik examinees. 																								Last year, over 2,000 examinees moved court, demanding justice in awarding marks. The high court had directed the Board to re-examine the scripts which showed doubtful marks and the score of more than 200 students was enhanced. 																								The committee will verify the scripts of students who have obtained doubtful marks. For instance, if a student fetches 75 in life science, 85 in mathematics, 72 in geography but 12 in history, we will label the last score doubtful. In such a case, the committee will re-examine the answer-script and mark it accordingly, explained Board president Dibyendu Hota. The panel will also verify scripts marked with a zero or absent. 																								We have come across inconsistencies in some of the scripts, where the score of a particular paper does not tally with that of the other subjects. The committee is cross-checking such answer-scripts and carrying out the corrections. I hope the process will be over within a week and, soon after, the results will be declared. I do not mind if the results are a bit delayed, but I want to make the process foolproof, the Board president said.																								At a meeting with the Board officials, school education minister Kanti Biswas has advised them not to hurry in publishing the results. We do not want to rush and announce results replete with mistakes. Rather, the Board may take a few more days and publish error-free results, Biswas said. According to Board officials, all formalities for publishing the results are in the final stage. As the results are likely to be published on June 10, the committee is working overtime to finish the task.																								Admitting that the mistakes could have been averted, had the examiners and officials been a little more careful last year, Hota said: The Board has taken all steps to remove discrepancies in awarding marks. But despite that, if students detect errors or feel they deserve more marks, I request them to first approach the Board and not the court. The Board will definitely look into the matter.

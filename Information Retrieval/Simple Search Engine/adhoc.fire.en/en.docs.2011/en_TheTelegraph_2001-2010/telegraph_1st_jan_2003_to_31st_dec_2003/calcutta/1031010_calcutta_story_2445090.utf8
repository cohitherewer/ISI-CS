The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 10, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	I live in Sarsuna township, meticulously planned and built  by the West Bengal Housing Board with all the amenities.  But some ills undo the good. There is a vat at the west  bank of a local jheel which is seldom cleaned. Scavengers  fly over it. During rains, water from the vat flows to the  jheel. There is no bus route till Tollygunge Metro station.  It was heard long ago that buses plying between Behala Chowrasta  and Jadavpur would terminate here. That also has not happened.  The Dakshineswar-Joka Metro extension has been shelved.  Someone must have decided we have too many amenities. 
	 Pijush Banerjee, Sarsuna.  
	People who draw kerosene with their ration cards get half  a litre per card. Earlier, they used to get one litre every  alternate week. In a month with five Sundays, kerosene is  not issued in the fifth week. Since consumption of oil stays  the same what are people supposed to do that week? Buy from  the black market?  
	Fakhre Alam, Tiljala Lane.

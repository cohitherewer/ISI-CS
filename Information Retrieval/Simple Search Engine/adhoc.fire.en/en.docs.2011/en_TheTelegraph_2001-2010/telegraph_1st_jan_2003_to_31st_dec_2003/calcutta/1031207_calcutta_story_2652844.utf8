 Sunday, December 07, 2003 				 Five held with arms cache
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A major dacoity bid was foiled with the arrest of a gang of five in Tiljala on Friday night. A cache of firearms, including three sophisticated pistols and 44 rounds of ammunition, was found on them. The arrested were remanded in police custody by a district court on Saturday.																								The five miscreants have been identified as Mohammad Ansamul Haque, alias Ansar, Mohammad Inamul Haque, alias Bablu, Mohammad Manwar, Binod Kumar and Mohammad Sajid. All of them are residents of Topsia Road.																								Additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Kumar Singh said a 10-member police team, led by officer-in-charge of Tiljala police station Subir Chatterjee, rounded up the gang after receiving a tip-off. We had information that a major robbery would be conducted in the area at midnight. The team lay in wait for nearly an hour near Tarikhana More on GJ Khan Road. The criminals were supposed to come in small groups and meet there. As soon as they assembled at the spot, the policemen rounded them up, Singh said.																								Preliminary investigations revealed that the gang was organised. All five had cellphones and were constantly updating each other about their moves, said a police officer. But the mastermind behind the operation has yet to be traced. Investigations are on to find if the five have any criminal records.																								Forty-four rounds of ammunition of different bores, two 9-mm pistols manufactured in Italy and China, a six-chamber revolver of Italian make, seven country-made revolvers, two extra magazines and five mobile phones were recovered from the gang. We are trying to trace the calls that have been made from their phones. This, we suppose, will lead us to the ringleader, the officer said. Actor dies																								Actor Kamu Mukherjee died at his CIT Road residence on Saturday evening. He was 72. Mukherjee had been suffering from rheumatoid arthritis for the past 10 years and was almost bed-ridden. He is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter. Mukherjee is remembered for his roles in Satyajit Rays Sonar Kella, Nayak and Joybaba Felunath.

 Road crossing has been missing for quite some time. A resident of the area has stuck a bamboo pole into the open hole to alert passersby. The road gets waterlogged even after a mild rain. Besides, pedestrians, including schoolchildren, cross the road in a hurry during peak hours. Accidents are imminent, unless all open the rise. Plainclothes police must board the buses to check the practice. B.N.  Copyright

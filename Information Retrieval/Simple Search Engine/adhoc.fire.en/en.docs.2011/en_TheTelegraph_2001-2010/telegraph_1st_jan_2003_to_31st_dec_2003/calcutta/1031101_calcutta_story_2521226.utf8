																								This thought-provoking comedy centres around Mallika. She is desperately looking for a job. Her constant strife has embittered her somewhat and made her a little cynical. During her endless search that end in futility, she encounters a youth, Sourav in an office where she has come to meet the director of the organisation by appointment. Sourav, through a series of hilarious and touching situations, succeeds in transforming Mallika. He helps her see the beauty (Sunder) inherent in everything and everybody around us in the universe. He, in his own small way, confirms the eternal truth that life will always be beautiful for those who know how to see beauty around them. This Choop-Katha production in Hindi is based on Mohit Chattopadhyays play, and directed by Dolly Basu featuring award-winning actress Doyel Basu in the lead. Hosted by Spandan.																								When: Tomorrow at 6.30 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch

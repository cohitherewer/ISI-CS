 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Special force at pandals 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A day after officials of city police and civic authorities began a joint inspection of city roads and major puja venues, deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Soumen Mitra announced that security will be beefed up during the festivities in and around the city. All major pandals will be manned by special branch personnel.																								Sleuths will be deployed at several major junctions and at least eight teams of plainclothesmen will do the rounds at any given time. Earlier, our men used to come out on city roads during the stand down (after the duty hours of the regular police force deployed for law and order problems) at the dead of night. But this time we will be there all evening as well, Mitra said. Mitra refused to disclose if there was any specific information on terrorist outfits planning to strike the city during the Pujas.

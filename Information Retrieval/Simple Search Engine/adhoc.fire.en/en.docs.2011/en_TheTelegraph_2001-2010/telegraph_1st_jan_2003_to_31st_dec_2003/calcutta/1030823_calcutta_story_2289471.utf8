 Saturday, August 23, 2003 				 Twin deaths in spurned love
 																											- Youth slashes throat of employers teenaged grand-daughter, kills self A STAFF REPORTER																								Unrequited love claimed a teen-aged girls life, and that of her 20-year-old paramour. Unable to win over 13-year-old Neelam Sau, Man Singh, in a fit of rage, first slit her throat and then slashed himself in a small apartment on Narkeldanga Main Road, in east Calcutta, early on Friday. Singh succumbed to his injuries at NRS Medical College and Hospital after battling for life for over seven hours.																								Residents of the area woke up to a gory sight around 6 am, when they spotted blood-soaked Neelam lying with her throat slit. Beside her, Singh was writhing in pain, with a gaping wound on his throat. They were rushed to NRS Hospital, where Neelam was pronounced dead and Singh taken in. Doctors said he died because of heavy blood loss.																								We are still in dark about the motive behind the deaths. Neelam used to be such a sprightly girl, recounted Ram Narayan Barui, an elderly neighbour, who claimed to have known Neelam for quite some time.																								According to Barui, Neelam lived with her grandfather, Bhagaban Sau, who owns a roadside eatery on Narkeldanga Main Road. Singh worked there as a helper. They hail from Varanasi.																								Investigators probing the twin deaths appeared baffled during the day. Investigation would have been easier if the youth had survived. A preliminary probe reveals that Singh killed the girl after she spurned his love. We are also probing if the youth had raped the girl before killing her and attempting suicide, said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, eastern suburban division. 																								Neelams mother, Lakshmi Sau, still in a state of shock, recalled that her younger son Bipin first saw Neelams body. Bipin slept last night in the same room with Neelam, myself and my younger daughter. He came running to tell me about his Bahinji lying in a pool of blood. Singh had threatened him with dire consequences if he raised an alarm. I rushed to the room to see Neelam dead. Close to her, lay Singh, blood oozing out of a gash on his throat, Lakshmi said.																								Neighbours said the youth had fallen in love with Neelam while working in her grandfathers eatery. 																								Singh would meet Neelam quite often and developed a crush on her. But her grandfather did not approve of the affair, which may have led him to this spurt of violence, said Sandip Mahato, a neighbour.

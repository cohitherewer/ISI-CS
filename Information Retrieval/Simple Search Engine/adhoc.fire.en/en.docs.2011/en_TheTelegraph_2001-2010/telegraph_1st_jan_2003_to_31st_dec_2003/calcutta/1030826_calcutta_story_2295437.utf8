The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, August 26, 2003 				 Changes scripted on stage
 Bikram Ghosh and Mrinalini Sen in a scene from The  Changing Room. Picture by Amit Datta  Actions, they insist, speak louder  than words. The theatrical exploration of Ovids work Metamorphosis,  a collection of Greco-Roman mythological tales from 20 BC,  began with no script and a motley crew of amateurs and pros.  After a three-week-long workshop, organised by the British  Council, it ended in a powerful depiction of the evolution  of nature and man.				 				 																															Staged on August 22, at Kala Mandir, Kinaetmas The Changing Room was the result of a workshop conducted by three professionals. National Award-winning actress Konkona Sen Sharma, Calcutta girl Royna Mitra, actress and dancer and now a faculty member of the theatre department of the University of Wolverhampton, UK, and Nigel Ward, also a teacher of drama at the University of Wolverhampton, led the way. The rest were 12 ardent amateurs and students, selected from a preliminary round after registration.				 				 																															The group took four stories from the 250 in Ovids epic, starting off with Creations, about how God makes the world, creating order out of chaos. The tale of Echos doomed love for Narcissus and his obsession with his reflection; Pygmalions passion for his ideal woman sculpted in ivory; and Myrrhas struggle with her conscience to curb the desire for her father, followed. With no costumes and using text, physical action and impersonation, they addressed thought-provoking and often-disturbing human emotions.				 				 																															While Bikram Ghosh and Mrinalini Sens performance of Pygmalion and his statue raised a few eyebrows, the duo claimed that the comfort and camaraderie between the participants, including the three teachers, meant no inhibitions and breaking down of barriers. Bikram has just finished Class XII from Calcutta International School (CIS) and is a member of the theatre group Red Curtain. Mrinalini, a Class XI student of La Martiniere for Girls, has performed in school plays and with the Utpal Dutt Foundation. But for both, this was an entirely new experience and quite unforgettable.				 				 																															Roohi Khanna, a Class XII student of CIS, has so far only taken part in school plays, while Samapendra Banerjee, 28, is studying drama and has performed in numerous public productions. But the two had no problems getting along, and there were no generation gaps. Because no one told us what to do, we came up with everything ourselves, says Roohi.				 				 																															The best part about these kids was that they were so completely dedicated, committed and hardworking, smiles director Nigel Ward. It was a pity we had so little time, but the youngsters gave all their time and energy. You would never see that from students in the UK. And although Royna Mitra has never done a theatre workshop in Calcutta before, she says the experience was much more than we had expected. I would come back in a flash to do another, given the opportunity.				 				 																															As for Konkona, I think I speak for everyone when I say Im really going to miss the workshop. It was such great fun to do. There were moments of nervousness and panic, but in the end, it was all worth it.  Nisha Lahiri				 				 																
	 Answer time				 				 																															The indoor stadium at Jadavpur University (JU) came alive on Saturday afternoon as nearly 70 teams matched wits at Qriosity 2003, the competition organised by the JU quiz club, Enquiry. The participants were selected through a preliminary written round. The 30 questions included the identification of three audio and four visual clips. Eight teams stood up to the challenge and qualified for the final.				 				 																															The super eight racked their brains to answer the teasers tossed by quiz-master Debkumar Mitra of Derek OBrien amp; Associates. The finals consisted of eight rounds  visual, buzzer, straight questions, two innovative connection segments and one on AIDS awareness.				 				 																															Questions like what is the connection between Salvador Dalis painting and Gregory Peck left many flummoxed. But the gap was bridged for the audience by the top quizzers  the famous painter created the dream sequence in Alfred Hitchcocks movie Spellbound and the Hollywood actor was a member of the cast.				 				 																															After eight rounds of frantic quizzing, The Doors of Perception, comprising Amit Dey, a member of the JU team at BBCs University Challenge programme, Debarghya Das, from IEM Salt Lake, and Anirban Chari, from the University of Middlesex, UK, clinched the coveted cup. The event was a quiz enthusiasts delight and the exhilarating competition kept the audience on the edge of its seats all the way.  Aritro Ganguly,

	 Street smart				 				 																															Dont cry for Park Street, just yet. True, Calcuttas fun street and heritage symbol seems to have lost much of its old charm, but an effort is on to get it right back on track. Recently, under the guidance of People United for Better Living In Calcutta (PUBLIC), founded by Bonani Kakkar, the Nature Clubs of Don Bosco Park Circus, Ashok Hall, La Martiniere for Girls and St James carried out a massive project, over three days, with the express aim of reviving good ol Park Street.				 				 																															Students worked hard to remove the posters of films, concerts, magazines, etc, that have made a mockery of the walls. Buckets of water and tireless scrubbers finally attained the impossible  cleaning the long stretch of walls and ridding them of their unseemly look.				 				 																															We also planted saplings at certain spots. Seniors and juniors, be they from Class VI or IX, worked side by side, digging up the sidewalk with their muddy fingers and planting the saplings. Later, we visited the neighbourhood shops, offices and restaurants with letters requesting their co-operation in giving Park Street a facelift before Durga Puja.				 				 																															We spent three holidays  Independence Day, Sunday and Janmashtami  working in the sultry heat, but the rewards were more than satisfactory. Several pedestrians stopped to admire our work and some even joined in the vigorous clean-up. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has promised to be with us during our next Park Street project. Public awareness is increasing, thanks to PUBLIC and some enthusiastic student volunteers.  Inam Hussain Mullick,

 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Two bank robbers named
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sleuths investigating the dacoity, which left the Kidderpore branch of Central Bank of India poorer by Rs 85 lakh on Tuesday, have identified two of the six members in the gang. They were also part of the gang that raided the Gariahat branch of Punjab National Bank (PNB) in June.																								The two persons were identified  the only development in the case so far  by the bank employees who picked out the two from among the photographs that the police showed them.																								The two miscreants are the same persons identified by the PNB employees. It seems that the duo masterminded both raids but employed different associates, said an official of the detective department.																								A police official investigating the case said a team went to Jharkhand to track down the culprits after the Gariahat robbery. The miscreants were from Jharkhand. We even traced the route they used to escape from the state, he added.																								But they failed to make a single arrest and returned with photographs of some Jharkhand-based criminals. 																								The PNB employees later identified two of the miscreants when they were shown the photographs. The Kidderpore bank staffers, too, identified the same duo. So it is now clear that these two persons are the masterminds behind both raids, he said.																								The investigators came to know that the gangsters had escaped through the Calcutta-Mumbai Road-Lodhashuli Jungle-Jharkhand route. The same escape route was used after the PNB robbery, said the official.																								The officials working on the case are also busy tracking the local contacts. Though the culprits are Jharkhand-based, it would not have been possible for them to loot the banks without involving local criminals. In both the raids, the culprits had surveyed the adjoining areas of the banks meticulously, said an official.

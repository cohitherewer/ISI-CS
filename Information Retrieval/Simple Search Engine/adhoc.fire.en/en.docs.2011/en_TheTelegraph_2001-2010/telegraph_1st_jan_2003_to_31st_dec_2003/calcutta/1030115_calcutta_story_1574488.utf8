 Wednesday, January 15, 2003 				 A wide angle view of child labour
																								Photography is a fascinating art. The chiaroscuro created by light and shade often make the known world a strange place and vice versa. When 16 children of various ages, ranging from 11 to 17 years, joined a week-long workshop, organised by Save the Children Fund (UK) in collaboration with The Seagull Foundation for the Arts, little did they know that the opportunity provided them with the key to a new world altogether, and a gamut of experiences awaited them. Aimed at creating awareness of children in hazardous occupations, the workshop used photography as a means of focusing on this issue. During the week, participants were taught the basic principles of black and white photography, and shown film on the subject. Later with the help of NGOs, they were taken to interact with children engaged in labour, shoot them on location and document their individual experiences in diaries. The outcome of the workshop is currently on view. Titled Contact, the exhibition constitutes monochromes, testimonies, diary entries and video footage taken during the course of the workshop and is a learning experience for all indeed.																								When: Till January 16; 2 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

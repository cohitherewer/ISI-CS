 															- Year-old tech school sends out first batch of interns, unveils growth plans A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A classroom at Institute for International Management and Technology, at Ffort Radisson, Raichak 																								A year old and growing fast. The Institute for International Management and Technology (IIMT), based in the Ffort Radisson resort in Raichak, has sent out its first batch of 38 students on year-long internships in India and abroad, and is gearing up for the next batch. And this time, there will be four half-scholarships on offer.																								The Institute, the second after Gurgaon, started off last year with three-year degree courses in hotel management and the hospitality industry, in association with Radisson Hotels International, Edwardian Group, Unitech Limited and GGL Hotel and Resort Company Limited. The academic partner is Oxford Brookes University, of the UK.																								The basis of the course is supervised work experience in the second year of study. From here, we have sent half the batch abroad, 10 to the UK and some to Malaysia. We are very happy with their work and are now going to expand in Bengal, said IIMT director Kamlesh Mishra.																								The plans include introducing a business programme for students and offering the facultys services in corporate training and consulting. Besides this, the Institute is also in the process of recruiting more teaching staff, expanding the infrastructure and increasing the number of foreign placements, during the work experience and after graduation.																								And, in the next few years, we hope to be able to offer scholarships to all those meritorious students who cant afford the study cost of Rs 340,000, Mishra added.																								However, the next step is to register with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). The government was supposed to bring out the forms in May. As soon as it does, we will apply. And we are confident of being accepted, Mishra summed up.

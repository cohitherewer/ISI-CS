 Sunday, January 05, 2003 				 Mechanic held for making bombs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a pre-dawn raid on Saturday, the city police picked up an employee of a reputed automobile company from its Kyd Street office, in the Park Street police station area, for manufacturing bombs. The employee has been remanded in police custody.																								Preliminary investigations revealed that Sanjit Das used to supply bombs to criminals in various parts of South 24-Parganas. Sanjit was a resident of Bishnupur, in South 24-Parganas. We are probing if he had any links with the firearms business, said officer-in-charge of Park Street police station Prabir Das.																								The Park Street police had been tipped off about Sanjit, a mechanic of the automobile company, who had been manufacturing bombs on the office premises for some months.																								The room, where Sanjit used to make and store the explosives, is on the third floor of the office building. The company authorities used it for stacking air-conditioned machines and spare parts. Sanjit would often stay there during night shifts, sources added.																								Accompanied by company officials, the police stormed the building on Saturday. We rummaged the third-floor room and stumbled on an iron chest in a corner. The bombs were stashed in its locker. Raw materials for manufacturing bombs were also retrieved, Das added.

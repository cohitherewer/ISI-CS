 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 A blood test in progress: Labs have come under flak for delivering conflicting reports																								Fluctuating blood-glucose estimations given to the same person by different labs are quite possible and shouldnt cause confusion or concern, feel pathologists and diabetologists in the city.																								Its not fair to always blame the testing laboratories for delivering different results, since values may vary on account of a number of factors, says senior pathologist Subir Kumar Dutta of Scientific Clinical Research Laboratory (P) Ltd.																								The former professor of Calcutta Universitys department of pathology was reacting to frequent allegations of poor quality control levelled at labs by consumers cross at divergent blood sugar assessments delivered by different testing centres. 																								The patients preparation and level of co-operation with the doctor or the lab technician often leaves a lot to be desired, feels Dutta. Diabetics often dont take their tablets on the day the sample is drawn, or deviate from their restricted diet to experiment before a post-prandial (PP) estimation. Besides, stress, infections or concomitant use of other drugs can also lead to fluctuating values.																								The issue recently came into sharp focus following state fire minister Pratim Chatterjees outburst against city labs for delivering conflicting reports on his blood-glucose level. The minister returned fasting glucose readings of 241 and 180 at two different centres, and launched a scathing attack on the error-prone facilities.																								If there is confusion over findings, the three Ps  pathologist, physician and patient  should meet again and discuss the possible reasons for the heterogeneous estimates, observes Dutta. 																								Labs should be prepared to listen to complaints, recheck values and maintain good practices to minimise error and patients should provide correct inputs to aid an accurate estimation.																								Rajat Mukherjee of S.R.L. Pathology Clinic says even the same blood sample given to four different labs can produce four different readings, due to an inherent measurement error in all methodology or the coefficient of variation. The values here can vary within a five-to-10 per cent band. 																								But when there are wider fluctuations, the patient could well be responsible. Not taking the pill or unwittingly consuming spurious medicine, failing to reach the sample collection centre at the appointed time, suppressing the truth to mask unexplained hunger  all contribute to differential readings, says Mukherjee.																								Diabetologist Subhankar Chowdhury cites different techniques used by labs as another reason why reports often dont tally. While plasma or serum glucose is now accepted as standard procedure, a few labs still estimate whole-blood glucose. This could lead to varying values, observes the vice-president of Diabetic Association of Indias Calcutta branch.																								We often come across diabetics who experiment with sweets on the day of the test or provide the fasting sample after morning tea and biscuits. They come back with values that are useless and dont help us in adjusting the dosage of medicines, complains Chowdhury.																								The denial factor among patients also worries doctors. Some just refuse to accept they have diabetes, even if the PP value touches 500. Sadly, its a condition that cant be wished away and these patients are only harming themselves when they shy away from the truth, says Rajat Mukherjee.

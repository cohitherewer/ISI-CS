																								Small is beautiful indeed. Indian art in the medieval period is famous for miniatures. Kangra paintings and Mughal art are fascinating case studies of the development and growth of miniature art. Western influence expanded the horizon for artists and they began using huge canvases to express their thoughts and ideas. For obvious reasons, these canvases are expensive. But art should not be confined to the rich mans drawing room alone. It should be released from its stifling confines and made available for all art lovers. With this view in mind, Vikalp Art Shop at Swabhumi struck upon a novel idea: it commissioned renowned artists to draw and paint on a small format. The current exhibition is a revelation for viewers. The participants, who are used to working on huge canvases, have now confined themselves to small formats. Yet their individual styles have remained intact. Each painting is typical of the artists work. Participants include Paritosh Sen, Shanu Lahiri, Rabin Mondal, Prakash Karmakar, Isha Mohammad, Sanat Kar, Ramananda Bandopadhyay, Shuvaprasanna, Dipali BHattacharya, Tapas Sarkar, Shipra Bhattacharya, Samir Biswas, Dilip Choudhuri, Ashoke Mullick, Sekhar Ray, Subrata Gangopadhyay and Sekhar Kar.																								When: Till May 15; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Vikalp Art Shop, Swabhumi

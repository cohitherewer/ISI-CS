 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 Arrest breaks kidnap deadlock
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Saqi Sareng La, 35, an employee of a private firm, was picked up from her Park Street office on Saturday morning on charges of abducting two boys from their Sonarpur home, on the citys southern fringes. The arrest is likely to shed light on the whereabouts of the children missing since January 2002.																								Sukanya, the mother of the two boys, had moved Alipore court in early 2002, demanding custody of her children after being separated from husband Indranil Das, a resident of Gariahat. 																								During the hearing, Sukanya alleged that her husband had married another woman, Saqi Sareng La, who lived in Kurseong. The court then allowed the children to live with their mother. Since then, the two  students of a reputed school in the city  had been staying with Sukanya.																								According to Sukanyas lawyer, Indranil had forcibly dragged the children out of their Sonarpur home in early January 2002. Sukanya, then, lodged a first information report with the Sonarpur police. A criminal case was subsequently started in Alipore court.																								Sukanya moved another petition before Alipore court in 2002, seeking divorce from her husband. Meanwhile, Indranil had appealed before Calcutta High Court against the order of the trial court granting custody of the children to his wife.																								A division bench of the high court, after hearing both parties, directed Indranil to attend court with the two children. But as Indranil failed to obey the order, the division bench asked the police to produce Indranil in court.																								The officers-in-charge of Gariahat and Lake Town police stations, however, failed to trace Indranil and his sons. The court then asked deputy inspector-general of CID, S.I.S. Ahmed, to find out the whereabouts of the absconding persons. 																								Subsequently, the CID and the detective department of the city police informed the court that Indranil was absconding along with two sons and Saqi Sareng La.																								The high court, then, asked the investigating agencies to contact Interpol to trace them, in case they had left the country. The court also directed the CID to flash the photographs of the children on television and in newspapers.																								On the last date of hearing, the lawyers representing the investigating agencies had told the court that all efforts to trace the four had failed.

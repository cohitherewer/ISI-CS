The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The emotion of music
  When music spews life and energy, yet is soothing and caressing, it combines the best in the experience. When we can actually let it waft over us, without losing any of its precision and dynamism, that is when music reaches enviable heights. Manfred Leuchter combines all this and more in his creations on the accordion and through his band, a group of renowned jazz musicians. Leuchters fingers ripple through the keys, deftly moving his listeners from the agony of Manhattan streets to the steamy mangrove swamps of Louisiana, then upto the snow-clad peaks of the Himalayas, and then helping them traipse through exotic Arabian spaces. He is a dynamic storyteller, who gathers all his emotions in his music, and the collective virtuosity of the band produces fascinating melodies. Max Mueller Bhavan and Oberoi Grand , in association with Congo Square, present this jazz quintet from Germany in an unforgettable musical sojourn. When: Today at 6.30 pmWhere:  Copyright

	The Centre has published postage stamps on several institutions  that have completed 60 years or more. Surprisingly, no commemorative  stamp has yet been issued on some of the most prestigious  and old institutes, like Presidency College, Hare School,  Hindu School, Shibpur Bengal Engineering College and Calcutta  Madarsa. These certainly merit such an honour. 
	 Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake.  
	Just about three years ago, our old residence at Southend  Park, near Rabindra Sarobar, was razed and a new building  constructed in its place. An electric pole with overhead  wires stands in front of the main entrance, obstructing  vehicular movement towards the car shed. We had approached  the CESC for shifting the pole by about two feet and paid  service charges of Rs 8,856 last year for this. In spite  of our repeated requests to the maintenance engineer concerned  to start work, no action has been taken to date. The pole  is still there even after a year.  
	Subir Sen, Address not given.

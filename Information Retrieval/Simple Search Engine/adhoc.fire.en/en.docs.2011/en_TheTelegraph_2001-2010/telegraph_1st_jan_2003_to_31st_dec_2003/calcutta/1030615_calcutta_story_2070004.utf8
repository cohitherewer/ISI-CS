 Sunday, June 15, 2003 				 False-name mask for cop
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sergeant Pijush Chakraborty  arrested on Friday on charges of snatching a businessmans gold chain  told sleuths on Saturday that he had used a false name while committing the crime. 																								Chakraborty introduced himself as Shankhashuvro Majumder after intercepting the businessmans car at the Shyambazar five-point crossing early on Wednesday. We failed to trace him initially. Fortunately, the businessman had noticed the number of the sergeants jeep. When we went through the duty roster, Chakrabortys name surfaced, said an official of the detective department that caught him red-handed and is probing the case.																								Chakraborty initially threatened to slap a fine of Rs 2,000 on the businessman for driving under the influence of alcohol. When the businessman protested, he tried to settle for a bribe of Rs 1,500. The offer, too, was turned down by the businessman. Chakraborty, then, snatched his gold chain and said he would return it only if the businessman paid Rs 1,500. The sergeant directed him to meet him in front of an eatery on Park Street on Friday evening with the money. Once out of Chakrabortys clutches, the businessman lodged a police complaint.																								Bankshal Court remanded Chakraborty in jail custody till June 27 during the day. But the wireless section of Calcutta Police, Chakrabortys own department, is yet to take any action. Deputy commissioner of detective department Soumen Mitra will submit a report on Monday. The sergeant will be suspended and a departmental inquiry will be initiated only after we receive the report, said K.L. Tamta deputy commissioner of police, headquarters. According to a government norm, Chakraborty was automatically suspended on Saturday as he had spent more than 24 hours in police lock-up.																								Surprisingly, no public prosecutor attended court during the day to oppose Chakrabortys bail plea or to seek police custody for him. He will not be able to wriggle out of the charge as we have a number of evidences to prove his guilt, said an official probing the case.

In 1982, Latin American litterateur Gabriel Garcia Marquez won the Nobel Prize for literature for his moving creation, One Hundred Years of Solitude. Marquez, the revolutionary writer, continued his crusade against tyranny and exploitation as he witnessed, close and upfront. And his works like General in his Labyrinth, Leaf Storm, and Autumn of the Patriarch, bear witness to Marquezs own brush with state anarchy. This Shilpayan production is based on Marquezs well-known novel, No One Writes to the Colonel, is influenced by Indias empathy with the South American political system to an extent that Indians consider the latters social turmoil as their own. This was first staged at the Sayak drama festival where it was adjudged the best produced and directed play. Dramatized by Rabishankar Bal, the play is directed by Ashis Chattopadhyay.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Madhusudan Mancha

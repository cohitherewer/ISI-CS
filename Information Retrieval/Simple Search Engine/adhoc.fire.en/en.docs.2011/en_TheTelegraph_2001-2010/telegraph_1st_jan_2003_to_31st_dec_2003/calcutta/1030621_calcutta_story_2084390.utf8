The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, June 21, 2003 				 When the twain meet
		 Pramita Mallick (left),  Lee-Alison SibleyAccording to popular belief, the East and the West are like magnetic poles, which can never meet. But history shows the progress of civilisation is marked by a reciprocal exchange of ideas, thoughts and deeds in all spheres including the sciences, arts, literature, music and philosophy. The reformation and refinement of cultures have been possible only because of a healthy exchange and acceptance of things good and beneficial. Rabindranath Tagore, perhaps the last of the great philosophers of Bengals Renaissance, has moulded and homogenised elements from the West in his works. In a very special programme this evening, well-known Rabindrasangeet exponent Pramita Mallick will sing with Lee-Alison Sibley, wife of the US Consul General in Calcutta. Ms Sibley is a highly qualified professional soprano singer and has been mesmerising audiences with her performances ever since she came to the city. The two singers will render Rabindrasangeet, both solos and duets, including such all-time favourites Aami chini go chini tomarey and Pran chaye chokkhu na chaye (by Sibley). The programme will also feature the works of another revolutionary lyricist, Pete Seeger, and Sibley and Mallick will sing together If I had a hammer and We shall overcome. Eight accompanists, including members of the Calcutta Foundation Orchestra, will provide the background music.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

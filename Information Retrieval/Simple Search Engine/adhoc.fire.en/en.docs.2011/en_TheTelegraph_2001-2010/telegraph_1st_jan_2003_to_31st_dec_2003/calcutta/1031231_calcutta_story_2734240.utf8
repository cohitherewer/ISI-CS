 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Rain rein on highrises to check water misuse
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								To stop misuse of piped water, the government has decided to make it mandatory to introduce the Rainwater Harvesting System (RHS) in all residential and commercial complexes and highrises in the city and its suburbs.																								According to the system developed by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), rainwater will be collected on rooftops and open spaces of any complex in a scientific and planned way and will be used for various purposes other than drinking. 																								The WBPCB has convened a meeting on January 16 with officials of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, chairmen of different municipalities, reputed builders and organisations involved in construction activities, to make them aware of the new system. A workshop will be held that day on the systems technicalities.																								We are making two models of the RHS at Poura Bhavan (office of the Salt Lake municipality) and Bidhannagar College. The models will be demonstrated before participants of the meeting and workshop, officials said. A separate rainwater pipeline in the building will carry the water to a reservoir on the ground. Water that accumulates will reach the reservoir through a separate pipeline. The water stored in the reservoir will be pumped to different floors. The rainwater can be used in the toilet, in the garden and to wash utensils, cars and floors.																								Our move is aimed at reducing wastage of drinking water. People use it to wash cars and clean toilets and even wash their rooms with fresh water. On the other hand, huge quantities of rainwater are wasted. The new system will help save fresh water by utilising rainwater. People use at least 50 per cent fresh water for different purposes, which can be substituted by non-fresh water, said WBPCB chairman Hirak Ghosh. The new system had been developed in consultation with experts and engineers. There should be a stop on using fresh water for any purpose other than drinking, bathing or cooking. Some people use fresh water to wash their cars or water gardens, whereas some will not get any water for drinking. Huge quantities of fresh water can be saved once the system is fully introduced in the city, Ghosh said.																								The new rule is effective from February 2004. It is mandatory for any complex having a total area of 60,000 or 100 flats. We shall not issue environment clearance for any complex or highrise (it is mandatory) if the RHS is not complied with, the WBPCB chairman said.

 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Baby boy left to die in Tiljala litter bin
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Not all babies born on Christmas are wanted by their parents.																								An infant, barely a few hours old, was found in a garbage bin on Tiljala Road on Thursday morning. No one would touch him; some kind-hearted resident simply called up the police around 9.30 in the morning. 																								By the time policemen responded to the call and came and took the baby boy to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, he was dead.																								We arrived on the spot within half an hour of the call and found the baby wrapped in a piece of cloth. No one had picked it up from the garbage bin and it lay motionless in the trash, a Beniapukur police station official said later in the day.																								Our men recovered the body and sent it to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, where the baby was pronounced brought dead by the attendant doctors. We tried to find out the childs parents but not one resident of the area could give us a satisfactory answer. We also made inquiries in the neighbourhood nursing homes, but could find no leads, the thana official added.																								Local residents were clueless and claimed the baby boy did not belong to anyone in the locality. We neighbours know each other well and if the baby belonged to one of us, we would have found out the culprit. It is beyond our imagination how anyone could throw away an innocent baby, exclaimed one of the residents of the slum area.																								Police, too, echoed their view. It cannot belong to anyone from the locality. The area is dotted with private clinics and nursing homes and it could be that someone had come to get rid of the baby. It was tossed into the bin at night when there were no witnesses, the official added.																								Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) H.P. Singh said the body had been sent for post-mortem and Beniapukur police have been asked to find out how the baby reached the garbage bin. There is only a slim chance of getting to know the babys parentage, given these circumstances. Usually, people do not desert babies at a known spot as there are chances of being recognised by a passerby. It must belong to someone from another locality, Singh said.

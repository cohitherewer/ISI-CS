The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
You Answer Dinesh dakua  Minister-in-charge, tourism, government of West BengalThe question should not arise. Tramcars are still heavily used. Few other cities in the country have a tram network. Like the Metro and unlike the Darjeeling toy train, it is higher on use value than on tourist value. But that does not take away from its tourist attraction. We know that many people who visit the city take a tram ride for its novelty. This is why we have started the luxury tram service. If there are more takers for the heritage ride, we will increase the frequency.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Illegal car parks face police red light
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND PRONAB MONDAL				 	 A policeman marks a car parked in a no-parking zone. A Telegraph file picture																								Like every other day, Ajay Malhotra had parked his Santro on Rabindra Sarani, taken a car park slip and whistled off to work inside Tiretta Bazaar, without realising that cops were waiting nearby to tow away his car. Malhotra created a ruckus when he found his car gone, but did not realise that the parking lot, where his car stood, was illegal and the police were in the right.																								After a crackdown on jaywalking, Calcutta Police have made elaborate plans to put an end to illegal parking lots in the city. 																								The city streets will never improve if such illegal parking lots continue to exist, Banibrata Basu, joint commissioner (traffic) said. 																								We have identified areas where we have given permission for only one side of the street, but cars are parked on both sides, resulting in traffic congestion, he added.																								From Ganesh Avenue to Bentinck Street, SP Mukherjee Road to Shyambazar, illegal parking lots are on the rise, throwing a spanner in the schemes of the citys traffic planners, who are keen to make the traffic flow smoother.																								With over 450 road accidents reported every year, many of them on busy roads where cars are parked illegally on both sides, Calcutta Police conducted a survey a few weeks ago.																								The results are in, with illegal parking , allegedly under the patronage of local political leaders and toughs, figuring high on the cause catalogue. 																								A list of roads where cars are illegally parked is being drawn up. Targets in the first phase of action include Canning Street, Bhupen Bose Avenue and stretches leading to Shyambazar five-point crossing, Tiretta Bazaar and parts of Rabindra Sarani, lanes inside Chandni Chowk, Bentinck Street (right) and Ganesh Avenue (left).																								But the operators are unlikely to give up without a fight. If you have the right contacts, the police cannot touch you. We have to pay several thousand rupees to run this business, said Md Shamim, the car park agent on Bentinck Street.																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has the right to earmark roads for parking vehicles. Once the roads are identified, the CMC sends a letter of permission to the police. In many cases, we find that a parking lot cannot be allowed in the area mentioned by the CMC since it would lead to congestion, a traffic department officer said.																								But that is often not enough to keep the roads clear. For it is here that the local toughs step in. The parking lots pass on to their hands and are put on auction. 																								Often the bids soar to Rs 50-70 thousand per parking block. And once the deal is sealed a new car park is in place. The political leaders are there to take care of the local police and residents, who dare to raise objections, the officer added, on conditions of anonymity.																								However, with Calcutta Police now surging ahead with its traffic agenda, illegal parking may well be given the red signal.

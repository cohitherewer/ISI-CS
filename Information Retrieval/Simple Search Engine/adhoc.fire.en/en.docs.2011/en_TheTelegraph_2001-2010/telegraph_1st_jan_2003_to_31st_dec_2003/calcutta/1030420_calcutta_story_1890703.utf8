 Sunday, April 20, 2003 				 Confession turn to doctor murder
 OUR CORRESPONDENT IN RANAGHAT																								Apurba Sanyal, one of the prime accused in the Chandan Sen murder case, was produced before the Ranaghat sub-divisional judicial magistrate on Saturday to record a confessional statement. Sanyal, who turned an approver for the case, was arrested on April 16 from Barrackpore by CID sleuths. 																								The accused had been absconding after surgeon Chandan Sen of Ranaghat sub-divisional hospital was murdered on the night of February 26. Shortly after Sen arrived to attend the party, the killers overpowered him and covered his head with a plastic carry bag, suffocating him to death. The next morning, police recovered the body from a pond in the locality.																								Police said Sanyal, like Sen, was an invitee at the house of Sunil Ganguly, a head clerk of the hospital, who had hosted the dinner to mark his retirement. 																								CID officials had taken Sanyal to their headquarters in Bhabani Bhawan where he was interrogated. He was produced before the court for the first time on April 17 when he was put in segregation by magistrate H. Bhutia.																								According to assistant public prosecutor K.C.Bhawal, the accused was grilled for over an hour before the magistrate. The CID will be the only authority to scrutinise Saturdays confessional statement. They will see whether the statement, under Article 164 of the Indian Constitution, is consistent with his statement before the CID officials in Calcutta. If both the statements look commensurate, the CID would consider making the accused the prime suspect, said Bhawal. The court therefore remanded Apurba in judicial custody.																								The post-mortem report reveals that Sen was first suffocated and then a handful of rice was stuffed into his mouth to pass off the death as a result of suffocation over food. Dark blood clots on both of his wrists indicated that his killers had held him tightly while a third person had probably covered his face with the plastic bag. 																								The report convinced the police that Sen was murdered. Subsequently, a hunt was launched for the killers. The CID took over the case and found out that Sen was planning to expose corrupt practices reportedly involving some doctors and hospital staff.																								Two other arrested persons, Subharanjan Khara, an ENT surgeon of the same hospital and his physician wife Arundhati, had also been invited to the party. Later, the CID also arrested Gangulys son Goutam.

	Diwali, for several elderly people and heart patients,  is not a very pleasant occasion, as the festival is linked  with the spectre of ear-splitting noise. Over the years,  the noise has crossed the decibel limit. The law-enforcers  need to be stricter.

	The civic body does not accept house tax by cheque in the  first year. Those paying tax in denominations of Rs 500  and Rs 1,000 have to submit the serial numbers of the notes,  as the cashiers are not trained to check if the notes are  fake or not. People, as a result, prefer to pay in denominations  of Rs 100, which only delays the process. 
	 Jagdish Kumar, Chittaranjan Avenue.

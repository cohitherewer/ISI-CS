 Tuesday, March 04, 2003 				 Burns victim of Cup victory rally 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An 18-year-old boy injured by cracker splinters while celebrating Indias victory against Pakistan died on Monday at Mahestala hospital. 																								Four others, including a five-year-old child, are still under treatment at the hospital. The victim was identified as Sushanta Ghosh, a resident of the same locality.																								According to police, after India won the match, supporters and members of a local club in Mahestala took out a victory rally and burst banned crackers. Sushanta, along with his neighbours, came out from their houses to join the victory rally.																								Deb Kumar Ganguly, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said the club members tossed the crackers around. Sushanta and the others received burn injuries when the crackers exploded near them. The victim sustained burns on his abdomen and chest, said Ganguly.																								Neighbours rushed all the injured to the hospital. The doctors kept Sushanta under observation but their efforts proved futile on Monday afternoon.																								According to Ganguly, no one has been arrested in this connection yet. Most of the members of the club are still at large. A search is on to track down the culprits, he added.																								Ganguly has initiated a probe into the incident. I have told Mahestala police station officers to find out how the club members got hold of the banned crackers. Evidently, a section of local traders are involved in selling banned fireworks, he said.

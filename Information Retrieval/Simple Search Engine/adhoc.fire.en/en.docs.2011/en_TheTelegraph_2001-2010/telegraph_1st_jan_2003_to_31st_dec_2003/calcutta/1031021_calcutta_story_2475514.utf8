The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, October 21, 2003 				 Off with formula film fare
 Out of the box: Lets have more off-beat films like  this Aamir-Saif-Akshaye starrer  With the city waking up to its  first multi-film, multi-timing multiplex and small proving  both big and beautiful when it comes to the movies, it was  Time to Talk about: Dil chahta hai less formula sob  stories, more movies for the young and trendy. The response  from Young Metro readers is a shout  we wanna break free  from form and formula. More out-of-the-box demands for filmmakers  next week.				 				 																															Maths is boring, thanks largely  to Bollywood films. Love triangles, quadrangles and a host  of other oft-used formulae is what is mostly served to those  looking for quality entertainment. Dil chahta hai  less sob stories, more food for thought and fodder for creativity  and imagination. Constant over-use of formula-based movies  must be given a cut and happening stories given a new take. Arihant Bhandawat,
 Class XII, Don Bosco, Liluah Dil Chahta Hai started  a trend of movies for the young. These types of films concentrate  on matters that the teens of today can identify with, instead  of the usual dancing-around-trees routine. The films are  sober, cater to the tastes of the college crowd and are  often met with a favourable response. This is the new generation  of movies and should be encouraged. Vinay Poddar,
 Bhawanipore College The formula sob stories bore the  audience. Directors should make trendy movies. For this,  they should keep in mind the likes and dislikes of the youth,  since, after all, young people are the larger section of  the audience. Hits like Ishq Vishq Pyar Vyar, Jhankar  Beats and Rules Pyar Ka Superhit Formula are  therefore appreciated.				 				 																															Sananda Sen The younger generation would say  that masala movies are the in-thing, and people need  to get over the extra-emotional family dramas. But these  GenX movies are instilling western ideas of whats hot  and cool in todays adolescent. At least the typical Yash  Chopra-type movies make us aware of our traditions and culture.  Dil chahta hai a balance. Nidhi Dokania,
 Class XI, Ashok Hall Dil chahta hai less formula  sob stories. Formula films have been churned out for too  long. The youth of today do not want to see movies with  the same melodramatic storylines. They want films that portray  the spirit of young India. However, a change is taking place,  gradually. Experimental cinema can create a great impact  on the youth and bridge the gap between commercial and arthouse  productions. They reflect the dilemmas, problems and aspirations  of the present generation. Koyel Basu,
 Jadavpur University Love, family rejection and an  unhappy ending has become the common picture. With adversity  a part of daily life, people are hankering for films like  Dil Chahta Hai and Koi Mil Gaya, which take  us to a world free of worries and full of laughter. Sharmistha Dan,
 Shri Shikshayatan				 				 																															
	 Dramatic debut				 				 																															Shakespeare, as always, is where it all began. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead is a line in Hamlet, announcing the death of two minor lords, cursory characters who float in and out of the play, without much impact on the characters or the audience, before unceremoniously exiting the sombre world of Elsinore.				 				 																															That is where playwright Tom Stoppard picked up the thread of his story, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. Here, we catch them off-stage, making their minor appearances in Hamlet, but, for the most part, waiting for the call from a world that does not need them. Will they die, or will their fate change, are questions that one has to watch to find out.				 				 																															The other central characters in Stoppards story are the players, the performers of the mousetrap play in Hamlet. Now, they are a down-and-out group of actors who work as part-time prostitutes to make a living.				 				 																															In Theatrons first English production, directed by Trina Nileena Banerjee, which will open early in November, the groups has built its own story around Stoppards text. In this version, put together by students from Jadavpur University, St Xaviers College and some schools, Guildenstern is a woman and Rosencrantz is a young homosexual, both trying desperately to make sense of the rules of the world they have been excluded from.				 				 																															Then, the Player enters their world  a swaggering dude, a performer, an artist who sells to the open market. Sexual, inviting, knowing, consumer savvy, cool. Theres period costumes, pantomime and, above all, performance. Innovation is the key with a mix of the subdued and the spectacular, says Trina, who has just appeared for her MA exams.

	Chipping in Towards the aim of reaching computer literacy to the masses, several organisations have come together to make it a reality. On October 21, the NGOs Children in Pain (CHIP) and SOS Village, in association with Aptech Computer Education, SSI Education and Computer Society of India (CSI), will open two new computer centres to cater to the young underprivileged.				 				 																															Aptech and CSIs countrywide programme, Akshar, kicks off in Calcutta with the inauguration of a new centre, with three machines, at CHIPs Tangra home, as well as one in SOS Villages Salt Lake office, where vocational training is provided to economically backward youth. While the computers have been bought by the NGOs, Aptech will provide the technical training, faculty, course materials and certificates.				 				 																															At CHIP, the courses will be run three days a week, for a total of 22 hours, for around 140 children. The classes will be offered at subsidised rates. It will be free for a few meritorious students. Aptech will also stock a library with computer books, in addition to giving some away to Rotary Clubs, as part of Project Saraswati.				 				 																
	 Riding a wave				 				 																															A few fish have been making a big splash in town this week. Finding Nemo, Pixars latest animated film, is finally here, with a grand entrance. Several treats have been lined up at Inox, at The Forum, to coincide with the new arrival on Diwali.				 				 																															Besides the banners and popcorn boxes, Nemo-themed meals will be available at the restaurants for as long as the film is running. And to go with the food, there is the blue mocktail, served in a transparent plastic glass, with a Nemo sticker.				 				 																															From October 24 to 26, its a three-day Nemo festival, with a sit-and-draw competition, fancy dress, on-the-spot games and a treasure hunt, before the dance floor opens up with a DJ spinning the tunes. A tattoo artist will be doing the body painting, while a juggler will provide the entertainment.				 				 																															This apart, meet Nemo in all his glory during the festival, or enter the radio and SMS contests to win Nemo gizmos.				 				 																															On a more serious note, while Governor Viren J. Shah watched the film with a bunch of underprivileged children at Raj Bhavan on Monday, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital screened a special show at Priya, on Sunday, to raise money for the NGO Save a Childs Heart.

	Stylish trio It was a music, style and power-packed  evening in Mumbai, with three of Calcuttas own grabbing  the top honours. Glitz and glamour went hand-in-hand with  fashion and panache on October 18, at the Lycra MTV Style  Awards.				 				 																															Although the Big B was undoubtedly the maha icon, a trio of young Calcuttans did its bit to boost the show. While model-turned-actress Bipasha Basu was declared the most stylish female in films, tennis champ Leander Paes was chosen the most stylish person in sports.				 				 																															And, of course, Sabyasachi Mukherjee won the Designer of the Year category. During the ramp show, with each designers collection fashioned on the theme of Desi Cool, he dazzled the audience with his usual mix of creativity, originality and wearability, through his Maid in India range.				 				 																															To catch them in action, tune in to the show on November 1 and 2.

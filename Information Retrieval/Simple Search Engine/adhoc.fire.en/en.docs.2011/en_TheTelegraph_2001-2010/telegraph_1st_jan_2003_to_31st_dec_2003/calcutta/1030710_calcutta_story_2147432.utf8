 Chin up in grief, for others sake
  Laxmi Sundaram Shes a ventriloquist, a traveller, a Bharatanatyam dancer and Carnatic singer. Laxmi Sundaram might be in her mid-60s, but she still enjoys driving and cooking. However, her joy in life and what keeps me going is social work, some through organisations, others on her own.It all began in 1972, when the mother of three got involved with the Ramakrishna Mission Pratisthan by chance. Since then, shes worked on various projects as president of the South India Club ladies section, treasurer of the National Indian Womens Association, which funds education projects, and president of the Rotary Midtown Inner Wheel.The grandmother of two believes in taking the initiative. The saddest moment of my life, is how Sundaram describes her husband passing away, just after she became president of the Rotary club. But she bounced back with the help of her friends, opening a school for streetchildren in Jadu Babus Bazar. Now, there are three.Some of her attempts were successful, like the time when she took little Gauri and Shekhar Shivaram under her wing after their father, a local shopkeeper, died.

There were loads of volunteer teachers and I had got Rotary to allot me funds for equipment. I even used my own money to buy food for them. But even after knocking on doors to ask people to send their servants, there was no co-operation. So, I had to shut it down, she sighs.It was after her husbands death that loneliness hit her. My sons are abroad and my daughter is in Mumbai. I wondered what would happen if I fell ill. So, on the request of members of the Mumbai wing of Dignity Foundation, she started off the Calcutta chapter in 2000 and still serves as its president. My husband was my one champion. He taught me how to drive and got me a car as early as 1968, smiles Sundaram.One of her favourite activities is organising and participating in cultural programmes for fundraisers. Dancing might not be an option anymore, but singing is still a passion. My classical and Usha Uthup reditions of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star are very popular, she laughs. One regret is all she has: After 45 years in Calcutta, I still dont  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, July 24, 2003 				 Of fond memories
Oft in the stilly night,/ Ere slumbers chain has bound me,/ Fond memory brings the light/ Of other days around me.....  Thomas Moore																								Bengalees have not been able to get over the death of their favourite matinee idol, Uttam Kumar 23 years after he left for his heavenly abode on July 24. For misty-eyed cine goers, he still remains the evergreen romantic protagonist whose charm neither time nor age can wither. Today, on his 23rd death anniversary, a host of programmes has been chalked out by both individual fans as well as star-struck organisations. Jhumur Kala Sangam, Entallys Smritir Aloke Uttam Kumar begins at 9.30 am at Uttam Udyan (near Howrah Ferry Ghat) where dignitaries will garland the statue of the Mahanayak. In the evening, the organisation will honour the recipient of Uttam Ratna Purashkar at Moulali Yuva Kendra at 5.45 pm. Also, a cultural programme interspersed with fond recollections by both veteran and contemporary Bengali cine artistes who will share their fond memories of Uttam Kumar with the audience. Durbar Kalam hosts a four-day solo exhibition of paintings on Uttam Kumar by Ranjay Ray Choudhury at Gaganendra Pradarshasala (Calcutta Information Centre). To be inaugurated at 5 pm, the paintings capture the myriad moods of this multi-faceted actor. To mark the first anniversary of the launch of the website, www.uttamkumar.com, a series of programmes will be held at Nandan II at 6.30 pm including a quiz show on the life and works of the star to be conducted by actor Chinmoy Roy. Soumitra Chatterjee will reminisce the matinee idol.

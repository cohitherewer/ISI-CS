 Monday, June 09, 2003 				 Rights probe in neglect death
 							 - Hospitals to maintain roster of critically ill A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rajnis Patel: Benefit match for the bereaved																								After the police, it is now the turn of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission to probe the death of Rajnis Patel. The 17-year-old cricketer from Bhowanipore died due to medical negligence in the orthopaedics ward of the SSKM Hospital last Monday.																								The rights panel has initiated a suo motu case to investigate all allegations of rights violations in the Rajnis Patel case and has asked SSKM Hospital superintendent Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay to furnish details of the case immediately, for necessary action. 																								It does seem that doctors have violated all possible human rights norms while treating Rajnis at the hospital. We will, however, get a clear picture once we receive the case details, a senior member of the rights panel told Metro on Sunday.																								The Bhowanipore police, meanwhile, interrogated relatives of Rajnis on Sunday and cleared their doubts regarding the case. We were told that they have been asked to speed up investigation and they were preparing a report to be sent to the detective department in Lalbazar, said a relative.																								Rajnis tragic death, meanwhile, continued to spur the government into initiating various health reform programmes. Director of medical education C.R. Maity declared on Sunday that each department in a government hospital would have to maintain a daily roster of critically-ill patients. Maity said the government has instructed all hospitals to make mandatory arrangements, failing which strict action would be taken against them. This way, the hospital authorities and the health department would also know how the patients in a critical condition are doing in the hospital.																								In addition, health department teams will carry out weekly inspections in every government hospital to keep an eye on how doctors are performing their duties.																								Former Bengal captain and ex-national selector Sambaran Banerjee, meanwhile, has decided to organise a cricket tournament this season to pay tribute to the budding pace bowler. Rajnis spent long hours practising at Vivekananda Park, where Sambaran has a coaching centre.																								I had a talk with Rajnis coach Bulan Mukherjee, who expressed his eagerness in organising a tournament and also a benefit match for the bereaved family, said Sambaran, who coached Bengal last season.																								The two coaches on Sunday discussed the modalities of such a tournament and worked out the possibilities of a benefit match featuring some leading stars of Indian and Bengal cricket. I will speak to Sourav (Ganguly) to find out whether he can join us in this noble cause, said Sambaran, who remembers watching the young pacer running in full tilt at Vivekananda Park almost every morning.																								His death has come as a shock to all of us. I have also called on health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and told him that the sporting fraternity will support the government decision to punish the guilty in this case, Sambaran added.																								Bulan Mukherjee, who had coached Rajnis for the past four years, said he was waiting for Rajnis family to return from Uttar Pradesh before finalising the details of the tournament.

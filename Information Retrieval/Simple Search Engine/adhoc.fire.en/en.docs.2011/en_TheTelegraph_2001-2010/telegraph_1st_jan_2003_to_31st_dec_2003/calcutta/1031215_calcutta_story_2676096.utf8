																								There is never a moment when the painter can say, I have done a good days work and tomorrow is Sunday.... You can never write the words The End  Pablo Picasso																								 How true is the observation of a genius! Once the creative urge grabs an artist, nothing can be an impediment to his/ her creativity. Death, decay, sorrow, joy  all these are relative terms that cannot restrict an artists creativity. Indranath Bandyopadhyay is a veteran water colourist who paints on paper to emphasise the predominance, purity and tranquility of the transparent medium. The white of the paper radiates even beneath the dark tones of other colours that are sometimes flat and at other times heavily textured. Bandyopadhyays present series of water colours titled, Tahader Katha, traces a predominantly feminine world. There is a strong, definitive feminine presence in his paintings on nature. Depicted as a woman, a mother, she is perennially engrossed and quite content in her own universe. The lives and objects around her seem to compliment her and participate in the various rites related to fertility cult.																								When: Till December 17; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Gaganendra Art Gallery

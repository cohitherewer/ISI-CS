 Saturday, April 19, 2003 				 Six held in hotel flesh trade bust
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Police busted a flesh-trade racket at a hotel near Calcutta airport on Friday afternoon. Additional superintendent of police (Salt Lake) Ajay Nand said six persons, including two girls from a city college, were arrested.																								Residents of the area tipped off the police that young boys, accompanied by girls, were frequenting the hotel on Jessore Road. We kept a watch on the place for a couple of days to confirm the time when youths arrive and also found out how long they occupied the rooms, Nand said. On Friday morning, policemen in plain clothes waiting near the hotel spotted three girls, accompanied by three boys, getting into the hotel.																								We allowed them some time, and then walked up to the reception and asked for the manager. We identified ourselves and the manager gave us the room numbers, said an officer who was part of the raid. The manager was arrested, along with another person, who the police say is the kingpin of the racket. Investigations revealed that the girls would skip classes to spend time at the hotel. 																								Nand said the youths were booked under the Immoral Trafficking Act at Dum Dum police station. We have decided to call their parents to the police station. We are also on a hunt for the owner of the hotel who, neighbours claim, is the key man behind the racket, he added.

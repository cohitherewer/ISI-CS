 Friday, December 05, 2003 				 Bail denied in bride torture case
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail prayer of Salt Lake-based heart specialist Dipak Biswas and his wife Gita after their daughter-in-law Nilima accused them of cruelty and torture.																								The court had asked them to produce their son Debabrata Biswas, a doctor based in Germany, before the court. When he failed to appear on Thursday, anticipatory bail was denied.																								Debabrata and Nilima, said public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami, had apparently met some years ago. Debabrata was, at the time, attached to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan, where Nilima was working as a nurse. They became romantically involved and got married on February 8, 2001.																								Soon after his marriage, Debabrata got an offer of both service and higher studies in Germany. The condition of the job was the candidate should be married. Debabrata accepted the offer and went to Germany, leaving his wife with his parents in Salt Lake, the prosecutor added.																								Goswami said her in-laws regularly subjected Nilima to torture. They would, allegedly, tell her that they had spent more than Rs 10 lakh educating their son to be a doctor and that Nilima was not an appropriate match for him. They tortured her physically, he said. They also forced Nilima to leave her job as nurse.																								Continuous torture prompted Nilima to leave her in-laws house and return to her parents at Serampore, in Hooghly. Meanwhile, Debabrata returned to Calcutta from Germany on a vacation. When Nilima went to meet him, he refused to see her. Nilima had no other option but to file a case before the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court in Serampore. At this, Dipak and Gita Biswas, apprehending arrest, prayed for anticipatory bail, said Goswami.																								The Biswas bail petitions first came up for hearing on November 27. After hearing Nilimas complaint, the division bench, comprising Justices Amit Kumar Talukdar and Narayan Chandra Seal, directed the petitioners to ask their son to appear in court on December 4.																								But on Thursday, when the case came up for hearing, the petitioners counsel Puspal Satpathi told the court he had received a fax from Debabrata stating that it was impossible for him to come to Calcutta. According to the agreement between him and the company he is serving in Germany, he cannot come here, the lawyer argued. He added that the court should consider Debabratas situation and his clients should be granted bail despite the no-show.																								But the prosecutor urged the court to think of Nilimas plight, having lost everything by marrying the doctor. 																								The husbands presence is essential at this moment. If the petitioners get anticipatory bail, Debabrata will never come to country. Nilima has, apparently, not filed for divorce yet. She believes that her husband will not support his parents and relations between her and Debabrata can be normal again, the prosecutor said. Suicide: Samir Sengupta,  61, committed suicide by jumping on the tracks in front  of a Sealdah-bound train near Belghoria station on Thursday  morning. According to GRP officials, Sengupta, a resident  of Belghoria , was suffering from depression due to some  family problems.

 Monday, July 21, 2003 				 London flights in the lurch
 OUR AIRPORT REPORTER																								British Airways (BA) flight BA-147, from London, scheduled to arrive early on Sunday, was cancelled after airline staff in the British capital resorted to a wildcat strike. The official word from the BA officials, however, was that the flight had been cancelled because of some problem.																								With no information forthcoming from the BA office, where the telephones went on ringing through the day, anxious family and friends of passengers who were supposed to have arrived on Sunday morning were left clueless as to their whereabouts or their travel schedules.																								Confusion also clouded the status of the London-bound BA-146, scheduled for departure at 7.50 am. Till late on Sunday, there was no confirmation from the airlines. 																								Sundays BA-147 passengers are expected to arrive from Delhi and Mumbai on Monday.

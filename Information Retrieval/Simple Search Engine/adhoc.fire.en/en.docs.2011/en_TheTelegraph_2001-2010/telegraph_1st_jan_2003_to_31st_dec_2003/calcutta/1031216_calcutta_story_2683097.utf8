 Tuesday, December 16, 2003 				 Paper leak woman aide in net
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 26-year-old woman was arrested in connection with the fake students consultancy firm case on Monday. Sangeeta Agarwal was rounded up from a relatives house in Dum Dum. She is a key associate of Sandip Ghosh, arrested earlier for his alleged links with Ranjit Singh, who was netted by the CBI in Delhi last month for his role in the leak of CAT questions.																								Agarwal had fled to Rajasthan and was on the run ever since she heard that Ghosh was in custody for duping a city youth with hopes of admission in a Birganj medical college. The police found a diary with Ghosh, in which Ranjit Singhs name and phone number were scribbled.																								We believe Agarwal can shed a lot of light on the case and lead us to other persons, said a senior officer of Bhowanipore police station, linked to the probe. A hunt is on for the friend who sheltered Agarwal for the past few weeks and is also a partner in crime. 																								In Mondays raid, police recovered yet another diary, this time from Agarwal, which, too, contained the phone numbers of Ranjit Singh. It seems they were in frequent contact, the officer said.																								Sandip Ghosh was arrested on November 28, on a complaint lodged by Sambit Sinha Roy of Baguiati, who alleged that even after payment of Rs 5 lakh, he could not get admission in Birganj Medical College, as promised by Ghosh. 																								Later, police learnt Ghosh had duped several other students with false hopes of admission in colleges in Nepal.

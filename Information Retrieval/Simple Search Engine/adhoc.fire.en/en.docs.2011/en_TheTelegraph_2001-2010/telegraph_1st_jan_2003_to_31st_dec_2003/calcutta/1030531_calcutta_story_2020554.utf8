The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, May 31, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Brooke ShieldsYou like spending time with children. You are much too involved with your family. Too much of change and variety scares you. You will get some very valuable and genuine advice from superiors. There will be new career opportunities. Some emotional involvements will see you through hard times. If you are single, you may be introduced to someone very interesting and attractive. If married, romance is rekindled.  Kusum Bhandari

		 The CESC transformer off  the Ripon Street - Sudder Street junction, which residents  of the area say is a life threat because it periodically  bursts into flames. Picture by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryMustafa Ahmed: You must do something about the transformer set up by the CESC at the Ripon Street-Sudder Street crossing. It frequently bursts into flames, endangering the life of residents of that area. Hardly any maintenance is carried out on it.																																																													That is not my job. I cannot order the CESC to remove the transformer from the area and instal it elsewhere. You must also realise that if the transformer is removed from the spot, you will suffer more power cuts, like you did earlier. Anyway, I will talk to CESC officials about it.

 Thursday, September 11, 2003 				 SSKM dolls up for inspection
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The state health department is gearing up for the Medical Council of India (MCI) inspection team that is likely to visit SSKM Hospital and University College of Medicine (UCM) on Thursday.																								According to the plans chalked out by the authorities on Wednesday, the first floor of a condemned building just across the hospital  on the plot where senior physicians have their quarters  will be showcased as the boys hostel. 																								For the girls hostel, a waiting hall for patients, to the north of the indoor emergency ward of SSKM Hospital, has been earmarked.																								Also, four single-bed cabins in the hospitals general female ward have been demolished to increase the size of the ward. The space now houses 16 beds, officials said. 																								The MCI visit to SSKM and UCM follows a similar inspection at Midnapore Medical College and Hospital (MMCH) on Wednesday.																								This inspection comes in the wake of the state governments failure to get the MCI permission in August for the introduction of undergraduate seats at MMCH, UCM and SSKM. 																								The inspection, admit officials, is very important for the government. 																								A green signal to introduce undergraduate courses  the government is hoping for at least 150 extra berths  would mean that it can admit students who have applied for berths against fees this year.																								With state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra promising that the enhanced-fee students would not be accommodated at the cost of the merit-only students, the administration is not sparing any effort, government officials said.																								Critics feel the hospital administration would have been better placed had the authorities concentrated on improving the infrastructure. 																								The government could have utilised its time in doing something beneficial for the hospitals, instead of indulging in cosmetic changes, said spokesperson for All-Bengal Medical Students Action Forum, Mridul Sarkar.

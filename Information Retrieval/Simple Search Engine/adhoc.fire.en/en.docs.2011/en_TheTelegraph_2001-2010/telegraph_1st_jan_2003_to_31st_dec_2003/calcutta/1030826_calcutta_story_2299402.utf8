 Tuesday, August 26, 2003 				 Fire fright near airport
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A fire broke out at about 1.30 pm in a chemical factory at Kaikhali, just outside the Dum Dum airport enclosure, on Monday morning. The dense fumes sparked rumours that flights were being diverted. However, airport officials confirmed that none of the flights was affected.																								Seventeen fire engines from Barasat and Maniktala brought the fire under control after two hours. This is the third time a fire has broken out in the factory. We may have to cancel its trade licence as the airport authorities have expressed the fear that repeated fires in the area may affect operations, said Tapas Chatterjee, chairman of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality, under whose jurisdiction the factory operates.

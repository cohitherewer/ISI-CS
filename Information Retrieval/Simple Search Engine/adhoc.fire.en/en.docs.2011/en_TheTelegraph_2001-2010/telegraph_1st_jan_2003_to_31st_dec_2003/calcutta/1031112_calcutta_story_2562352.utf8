																																																																																		Senior health department authorities met superintendents of non-teaching hospitals along with heads of gynaecology and surgeons of these hospitals at Writers Buildings on Tuesday. According to the director of health services, Prabhakar Chatterjee, the hospital authorities have been asked to give an estimate to the health department on the repairs required at their hospitals. The funds may come from HUDCO. Authorities of non-teaching hospitals have been asked to submit their list by November. They have been asked to inform the health department about the equipment they require. The health department discussed the possibility of linking one hospital which has few beds with another hospital with more beds to handle the pressure in maternity wards. This way, Indira Matri Sadan, for example, may be linked to RG Kar Medical College. Patients would be advised to go to the hospital with more beds and specialists along with a card, Chatterjee said.

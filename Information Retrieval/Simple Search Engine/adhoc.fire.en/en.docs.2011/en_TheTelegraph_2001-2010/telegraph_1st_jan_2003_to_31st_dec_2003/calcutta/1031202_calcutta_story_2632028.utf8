 Tuesday, December 02, 2003 				 Court tosses out plea for HS re-test
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Monday dismissed a petition filed by a Higher Secondary (HS) examinee, challenging the state HS councils decision denying him permission to appear for HS 2003, held in April this year.																								The court has also directed the petitioner to pay a fine of Rs 850 to the council.																								The student, Indranil Das, appeared for HS 2002 as an examinee from a reputed government-run school in central Calcutta. He was unable to clear the examinations, as the authorities found he had adopted unfair means for answering the questions in one of the papers.																								The examiner assigned to vet Indranils answer-script in economics found he had managed to steal some blank sheets bearing the invigilators signature from the examination hall after the completion of one of the papers.																								Investigations revealed that he had written the answers of some probable questions in economics on the stolen answer-scripts at home. The next day, when he came back to write the (economics) paper, he found that some of the questions matched the answers which he had written on the stolen scripts. 																								Indranil attached the stolen answer-scripts with the scripts that were distributed on the day of the exam and submitted them to the invigilator.																								The examiner assigned to correct his paper detected the foul play and referred it to the head examiner. The head examiner forwarded the case to the council authorities, who ordered an inquiry.																								The inquiry committee, after investigation, confirmed the offence. As a punitive action, the council disqualified Indranil, saying that his participation in the examinations would not be valid. 																								The council also denied him permission to appear for the 2003 examinations.																								Dismissing Indranils plea, Justice Indira Banerjee described the act of the student as a heinous crime. Upholding the councils decision, Justice Banerjee observed that the council had taken the right decision. Students appearing for any board examination should learn a lesson from the exemplary action taken, Justice Banerjee observed.																								nGherao: Sealdahs divisional railway manager Radheshyam was gheraoed at Naihati station, on the northern fringes of the city, where he went to open a railway ticket counter on Monday. Local CPM parliamentarian Tarit Topdar and MLA Ranjit Kundu were part of the demonstration, demanding the shift of the ticket and parcel booking counters. They said the queues at these counters disrupt traffic at the busy crossing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 23, 2003 David Topno								Chief operations manager, Metro Railway, Calcutta																																							The Metro move has been very successful. The stains of paan spittle on the walls have vanished. My stations are cleaner now. We had posted advertisements in the media and on our close-circuit televisions. But it is only after we started the drive that people took note. To date, 400 people have been fined while those who could not pay had to wash. As for enforcing the rule across the city, it will be tough to keep watch over every nook and corner. Such is the peoples mindset here that unless a rule is enforced, they do not take heed of awareness messages.

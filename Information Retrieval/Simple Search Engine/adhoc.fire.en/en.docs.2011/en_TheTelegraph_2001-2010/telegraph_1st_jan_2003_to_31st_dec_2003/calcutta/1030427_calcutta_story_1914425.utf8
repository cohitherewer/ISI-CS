 Sunday, April 27, 2003 				 Phones dead
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Twenty telephone exchanges and over 20,000 lines have gone out of service since Friday night after a fibre-optic cable line was found mysteriously severed near the Piyali-Kalibari area in Durgapur.																								The Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and the Asansol Durgapur Development Authority (ADDA) are blaming each other for the collapse of the network. The fibre-optic cable has been severed by ADDA workers repairing a water line, said BSNL deputy general manager, Tapas Pal. ADDA chief executive officer M.N. Prasad, however, shot down the allegation.

																																																																																		Classes at several educational institutions in the city and elsewhere in the state are likely to remain suspended on Thursday, as the Students Federation of India (SFI), the CPMs student wing, has called a nationwide strike protesting the privatisation of education and demanding central legislation granting more powers to state governments in controlling the internal affairs of private institutions.																																																		After a futile bid to pull down obscene billboards three years ago, the civic authorities have again decided to take action against them. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said although it was difficult to distinguish between obscenity and decency in visual publicity, he had directed municipal commissioner Sajal Bhowmik to take steps against billboards that have drawn complaints from citizens. There are over 5,000 billboards in the city.																																																		Calcutta High Court admitted a petition on Tuesday that alleges violation of environmental norms by the Lexpo authorities, hosting the annual leather exhibition on the Maidan, beside Victoria Memorial. The petition was filed by Subhas Dutta. A division bench of Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice S.P. Talukdar fixed Wednesday for the hearing.																																																		Sudip Das, 22, an auto-rickshaw driver, succumbed to his burns on Tuesday morning at MR Bangur Hospital, while his 59-year-old mother, Tapati, is fighting for her life. On Monday evening, Tapati and Sudip suffered serious burns when lubricants stored at their Vivekananda Park residence caught fire and the two were trapped inside.																																																		More than 25,000 lawyers across the state went on a protest on Tuesday. Rallies were organised, demanding that the Centre modify the National Tax Tribunal Act and Company Law Tribunal Act, and that the state government alter the proposed Block Level Pre-litigation Conciliation Bill. Representatives of the state Bar Council handed over a memorandum to governor Viren J. Shah. Work in the subordinate courts was paralysed due to the absence of lawyers, but the high court functioned normally.																																																		Air Commodore Devdas Banerjee, officer, Command Advance Headquarters, Eastern Air Command, died at Command Hospital on Monday, at around 8.30 pm, the Indian Air Force (IAF) said on Tuesday. He was commissioned in the fighter flying pilot stream of the IAF in 1969. Banerjee commanded a Jaguar squadron and was the chief operations officer of a wing. He had a successful tenure as a flying instructor with the Egyptian Air Force. He was also president of the Air Force Selection Board and the air officer commanding base at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad. He is survived by his wife and two sons.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, July 22, 2003 				 Every bit the boy next door
 A young reader with a coveted copy  on the day of the launch at a city bookstore The response to our Time  to talk question Is Harry a hero or is Pottermania all  hype? was passionate in its defence of the wizard-in-training  we all know and love. We need a little bit of Harry, and  the magic he brings, in all our lives. Here are the first  few letters, with many more to follow: In a world repeatedly being  torn apart by the Voldemorts of this day, where nations  are being beaten and caught as the prized snitch, and where  no defence is proving to be enough against the dark arts,  Harry Potter is neither a hero nor a product of hype. He  is not meant to be worshipped as a hero. In Harry, Rowling  creates a fellow human being, who represents an urge to  survive, and help others survive  an urge present in all  of us. His drawbacks increase his credibility and help him  become a real-life friend. His victory over Voldemort isnt  a cakewalk, and is accomplished not with the aid of super-human  intelligence, or striking heroism. He wins with a bit of  love, a bit of loyalty, a bit of vengeance, some amount  of luck, and of course, as Dumbledore says, his ability  to choose between what is right and what is easy.				 				 																															Harry is not the picture of perfection as, lets say, anyone from Blytons Fatty to the ever-present Holmes. He falters at examinations, is a genius of a rule-breaker, doesnt ever get a top grade in homework, and values friendship and hanging out. And havent we been able to identify with him? What is hype? Are we talking of the midnight queues, and Potter parties? Doesnt that take us away from the basic reality? The reality of the relevance of Harry and Hogwarts in todays world? There is a craze, no doubt, that drives children to Potter, but that is because they have never been able to identify with a character in so many respects, in the history of childrens fiction. Feluda is an idol, the Find-Outers or Famous Five are nice friends, but Harry teaches a lot and yet remains the boy next door. The wand-waving in this context is secondary.				 				 																															Harry the hero, or Harry the hype, whatever it is, Harry will have to be put through the test of time. But till then, let him fight the Slytherins and the Dark Lord. Let us not go berserk over a party, let us not throw the book away, let us learn what we can. And we, too, must fight by his side. Because in the world today, as power continues to cloud vision, there is a Voldemort inside all of us.				 				 																															Ranjana Das The Harry Potter series  is a beautiful creation, and deserves all the success that  it has achieved. Rowling may not be a Tolkien, but her creation  is good enough to stand the test of time, and find a place  in peoples hearts. It might be a childrens book, yet  it is one of the best youll ever read. Dont go by what  the critics say; read the book to judge it. Yes, there is  MAJOR hype, but it is the content that has led to it. Remember,  you cannot fool kids for too long with mere publicity stunts! 				 				 																															For a change, lets appreciate something for how good it is. Always dismissing anything that is a commercial success, denying that it is a work of art is wrong. Harry Potter is genuinely good, and there is no denying that. Kanak Gupta,
 A Potter fan to the core Due credit should be given  to J.K. Rowling for creating a character liked equally by  readers of all ages. Harry may get the support of his friends  Hermione and Ron, but at the end of the day, he himself  has to fight the odds to defeat evil. So, in this regard,  Harry is no less than a hero. His boyish charm and humane  qualities make him a delightful everyday hero. His huge  fan following and the craze he causes can only be proof  of this. Pratyay Banerjee,
 Class XII, Patha Bhavan It isnt either all hype  or just hero worship for Harry never-make-a-mistake Potter  (who, thankfully, acted less superhuman in the fifth book).  The addiction is pure and strong, but it is so for the stories  Rowling weaves. Fans can identify with the characters, they  can live the situations. Pottermania isnt hype; its life   complete with ups and downs!				 				 																															Adwaita Das That Potter is just marketing  hype and that people buy it simply out of curiosity are  some of the allegations levelled by critics. But most of  them never have, and claim they never will, read a Harry  Potter book. Judgments based on others views are not needed.

	 Battle of biz brains For the Facches  (1st year students) at the Indian Institute of Management  Calcutta (IIMC), it was time to show off funda in finance,  merit in marketing and strength in strategic issues to their  seniors and announce their arrival at the hallowed turf.				 				 																															Kautilya 03, the annual consulting event, organised by the IIMC Consulting Club and sponsored by Bangalore-based Erasmic Consulting this year, was a huge hit with students queuing up to register for the event. The campus was abuzz with activity and the excitement and energy levels were contagious.				 				 																															The Consulting Club customised the events layout to test the all-round consulting aptitude in the current crop of first-year students. And the response  with over 200 students logging in and close to 70 teams fiercely fighting it out for over four hours on July 16  made it a huge hit on the Joka campus.				 				 																															Prodigon, comprising Subrangshu, Sushant and Sushil, emerged winners in the most admired company game, while Arthshastra, with Abhinava, Shashi and Vibhash, knocked others out in the business strategy game. Not only analytical skills, the event also acknowledged creativity. The Wise amp; the Otherwise and White collar, blue collar and the brains in the khadi kurta were adjudged the two most creative names. Malavika Mitra shows students a few  kathak steps at the Spicmacay convention. Picture by  Aranya Sen Art for all The state convention of  Spicmacay was held on July 19 at Mahadevi Birla Girls High  School, with students from a number of school chapters pouring  in. Special guest Malavika Mitra performed a breathtaking  recital in kathak, taking time to explain the nuances to  the uninitiated.				 				 																															Anubhuti, a presentation on Pandit Bhimsen Joshi and other maestros, helped the audience understand their art that much better. Spicmacay tries to imbibe love for our own culture among the youth, who have a leaning towards the fast life. It was decided at the convention that Virasat, the annual festival of the arts organised by Spicmacay, will be held in the second half of September.  Soma Dey

	 Question mark The Assembly of God Church  School hosted the first-ever Patton Mark Buntain Memorial  Quiz, dedicated to the memory of its founder, Dr. D. Mark  Buntain. Held at the Mark Buntain Education Centre of the  schools Park Street campus, the event saw 33 schools put  up 102 teams on July 18.				 				 																															The 1,000-strong crowd was kept entertained by quizmaster Barry OBrien. The guest list included names like Sanjay Budhia, managing director, Patton, Sister Cyril, principal of Loreto Day School, Sealdah, footballer P.K. Banerjee, Sabyasachi Chakraborty and educator Neil OBrien.				 				 																															The quiz, based on India, saw a fierce battle in the elimination round. Eight schools were selected to rough it out to the end. Ballygunge Siksha Sadan was the only girls team, facing opponents from Don Bosco Park Circus, St James, St Xaviers, St Thomas Boys, Vivekananda Mission, Birla High and the hosts.				 				 																															Solomon Wong, head of administration of the Assembly of God Church Group of Schools, made a presentation on Mark Buntain who, in 1964, started the school in a structure that was no bigger than a tent. His other ventures were the Mission of Mercy Hospital next door and the open kitchens for the homeless, which feed 12,000 a day.				 				 																															Eight final rounds were not enough to decide the winner. A tie-breaker between the top three schools ended in St James carrying home the Champions Trophy, followed by St Xaviers Collegiate School and the Assembly of God Church.  Madhumita Das
 Class XII, St Thomas Girls School On July 18, HelpAge India  organised a regional inter-school quiz at the State Youth  Centre, before an audience of the inhabitants of an old-age  home in Tollygunge. Schools like Lakshmipat Singhania Academy,  M.P. Birla, Ashok Hall and St James signed up for the event,  battling it out through the tough prelims. Six teams qualified  for the finals. Shubhojit of the band Cactus conducted the  quiz, which saw Ashok Hall beating M.P. Birla to the winners  trophy. Nihar Jain,

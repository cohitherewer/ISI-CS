The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
You Answer  Nilanjana ChakrabortyJewellery designerDefinitely. If policewomen are in plain clothes, they can be mistaken for any unaccompanied woman. So they can be used as bait. I myself was shadowed by louts at the Purna Das Road-Deshapriya Park crossing about two years ago. I got them to follow me home and later handed them over to cops with help from my husband (actor Arjun Chakraborty). So while women should be trained to combat critical situations, it is important that they are not alone. There must be a back-up system.  Copyright

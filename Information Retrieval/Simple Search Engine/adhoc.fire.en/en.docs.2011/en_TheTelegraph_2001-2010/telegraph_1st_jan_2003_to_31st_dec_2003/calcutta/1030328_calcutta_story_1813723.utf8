				 																																									The  Chandni Chowk market has become extremely crowded of late,  with shops of electronic goods and clothes, pavements occupied  by hawkers and autos and scooters parked on the roadsides.  Walking along the stretch is a very difficult task. The police  should earmark a parking zone to reduce the congestion. 
 A.F.K. Ahmed, 
 Rabindra Sarani. 				 																																									One  can get a new telephone connection from the public sector  in a couple of days, but getting a new meter from the CESC,  a private sector unit, is a hazardous experience. Besides  coughing up a hefty security deposit, one has to wait for  a minimum of three to four months. The CESC should make the  procedure for flexible and also slash the security amount.  For new buildings, the power utility can initially instal  meters for all flats in the promoters name and later shift  them to the flat-owners. CESC will also benefit from this  in terms of operational cost and efficiency.
 Jagdish Kumar, 
 Chittaranjan Avenue.

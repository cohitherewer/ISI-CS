 Saturday, January 04, 2003 				 Fun streak in rogue cops
 AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR																								New Years eve was not the first time the five rogue constables, who nearly beat sergeant Bapi Sen to death, were stalking the city streets for some fun. This was revealed by their colleagues on Friday, hours after the five allegedly admitted to interrogators that they had teased the girl and lost their cool when confronted by Sen, who they did not realise was one of us.																								According to their colleagues in the police barracks of Sulekha Buildings on B.B. Ganguly Street, the five  Madhusudhan Chakraborty, Sridam Bauri, Pijush Goswami, Sekhar Bhusan Mitra and Mujibur Rehman  were erratic and indisciplined, with a penchant for city life  their way of describing the quintets walks on the wild side.																								Last year, on at least three occasions, they were caught returning drunk to the barracks by the supervisory inspector. They often stayed out late and had been warned repeatedly by seniors to watch their step, a colleague recounted on Friday.																								The five constables of the B-Company of the Reserve Force are from Nadia, Murshidabad, Burdwan and Purulia. Records with the Lalbazar police headquarters reveal that they had joined the service around three years ago. An assistant commissioner of the Reserve Force, quoting from their track records, hinted that the five constables were considered efficient in law-keeping, but extremely erratic and indisciplined otherwise.																								Some of their colleagues at Sulekha Buildings stitched together an argument for their frequent nights out. They would confide in us that it was extremely depressing to stay put in the dingy barracks after duty hours, they said. The five constables were among many who had complained to their superiors about this.																								The constables in question told investigators on Friday that this was their first New Years eve off since joining the force. So, they decided to embark on a joy ride. We had heard so much about the night life on Park Street and its surrounding areas on December 31 that we wanted to see it for ourselves, Chakraborty apparently told sleuths.																								Bowbazar police officers said on Friday the five admitted to teasing the girl on a motorcycle and being enraged when Bapi Sen tried to stop them. The constables told interrogators they had not realised that Sen was a policeman.																								The constables are currently in jail custody till January 16. Deputy commissioner of police, Zulfiquar Hasan, said the Bowbazar police prayed for revision of the jail custody to police custody at the chief metropolitan magistrates court on Friday.

	The Beleghata canal, cutting across the heart of the city,  was cleared of all encroachments about a year ago to get  financial aid from the World Bank. It was decided then that  both flanks of the canal would be beautified with garden  strips and ferry services launched. But now the canal banks  are sporting a shabby look, especially in the Ultadanga,  Maniktala and Beleghata areas. Moreover, shops, godowns  and residences adjacent to the canal are dumping garbage  on the banks. The canal will revert to its original shape  in no time.  
	Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake.  
	Two unauthorised factories have come up in the backyard  of a property in Unique Park, Behala. Inflammable material  like acid and petrochemicals have been stocked in one of  structures. If there is a fire, the outcome would be disastrous,  as this is a very congested area. Besides, lorries, Matadors,  autos and private cars parked in this narrow lane eat up  most of the roadspace. We have approached the Corporation  several times but to no avail.

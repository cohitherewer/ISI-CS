 A Reliance Infocomm metal strip stands ominously tall  on Bhowanipores Justice Chandra Madhab Road. Cars  speed by, veering to avoid the death trap. Picture by  Pradip Sanyal. METRO seeks an explanation from the men  who matter 
	FLASHBACK
 10.30 pm. May 12. Camac Street. Amit Dalmia, 26, drives  over a four-foot-long metal strip, raised dangerously at  an incline of about 10 inches from the road. The two-inch  wide metal strip, 10 mm thick, pierces the cars undercarriage  and, rising sharply with the impact, tears through Amits  clothes before ripping his lungs and heart. By the time  he is extricated from the car and rushed to SSKM Hospital,  he is dead.
 I don't want anyone dying like this for the callousness  of a company, Amits father Santosh Dalmia had  cried, blaming Reliance Infocomm that had laid the metal  strip covering its optic-fibre cables and the civic authorities  who had failed to notice the death trap.
 
	RELIANCE RETORT
 I dont know of the Reliance cable-cover that is allegedly  lying exposed on Justice Chandra Madhab Road. Nor have I  been informed by my officials of any recurrence, anywhere  in the city, of the situation that led to the mishap that  killed a young man a few weeks ago. But I was given a list  of places, where repair jobs were needed on cables or the  road under which they were buried, by Calcutta Police some  weeks ago for inquiry and follow-up action. We sent our  teams out to all the places mentioned on that list and our  officials have submitted a detailed report to me. According  to their findings, either the Calcutta Municipal Corporation  or some other agency was responsible for the protrusions.  Reliance Infocomm official
 
	MAYOR MISSIVE
 I have received complaints about some more Reliance cables  jutting out of road surfaces. But this specific complaint  is news to me. I cannot wait to see the Metro picture on  Wednesday morning, but I have already decided to send a  team of engineers to the spot to check the situation for  themselves. Their report will be taken to chief minister  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, if necessary. No businessman can  be allowed to endanger public life for his own profit. The  utter disregard they appear to have for public safety speaks  of an extremely callous approach on their part. How many  lives will Reliance cables and their covers take, before  the men who run the show wake up to what they are doing?

	COP COUNTERPOINT
 Ensuring safety on roads in situations like this is, primarily,  the responsibility of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.  I will definitely inform the CMC higher-ups of the development  on Justice Chandra Madhab Road, so that they can ask the  agency concerned to take corrective measures. But I do not  think I need to talk to Reliance directly. I think they  should be responsible for their acts and not expect other  agencies to follow up on what they do. It is Reliances  moral responsibility to ensure that no one is hurt as a  consequence of its activities on public property. I am going  to send a team of officials to the area to conduct an inquiry,  most probably on Wednesday.
 Deputy commissioner (traffic) M.K. Singh

 Wednesday, May 21, 2003 				 Feelings of the hidden mind
																								Chitralekha Kanjilal has no formal degree in the fine arts. She is an honours graduate in science and loves to paint in watercolour and acrylic on silk. She is conscious of the fact that her paintings are not the outcome of her conscious mind. Kanjilal is also interested in poetry and literature and loves to listen to music. She draws considerable inspiration for her paintings from nature, her surroundings and feelings, and allows them to precipitate in her subconscious mind. All these contribute to her artistic creations. The forms seem familar, the colours are same, but the subject or essence or the dark narrow lane through which they came, remains always hidden, untouched even to me. This is the beginning. I dont know where this flow will end or when shall I be able to change from a silent spectator to an active participant. 																								When: Till May 25; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, West gallery

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Several houses, mainly shanties, were damaged after a 150 ft-long stretch of metalled road along the Kestopur canal embankment near Gobindanagar and Santimoy colonies caved in on Friday night. Traffic movement in the adjoining areas was hit for several hours on Saturday. 																								Huge cracks had developed in at least 60 houses and nearly 300 people were affected, sources said. The area falls under ward 15 of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality and is within the New Township project.																								Local CPM councillor Subir Mondal felt the irrigation departments dredging operation on the lower Bagjola canal had caused the cave-in. The fact that local residents had removed a lot of soil from the half-dug canal has also contributed to the incident, he said. Trinamul Congress MLA Tanmoy Mondal also admitted that removing soil from the embankment had become a regular feature in the area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, January 10, 2003 				 Post-mortem breather for doctors
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government on Thursday started unravelling the medical mystery behind the death of Shiv Kumar Ram at Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday, soon after being administered a pain-killing injection.																								Quoting the post-mortem report, Medical College principal Jayshree Ghosh confirmed that the 11-year-old boy had died of pulmonary embolism (blockage of the artery by fat cells coming out of the bone marrow and entering the blood stream following a limb injury).																								The post-mortem report proves that there was nothing wrong in the line of treatment of the boy. He appears to have died of pulmonary embolism, which is one of the major causes of death in case of orthopaedic patients, Ghosh said.																								She elaborated on the treatment administered to the boy, admitted with a sprain in the leg on Monday. He was given Calmpose (sleep inducer), Rantac (antacid) and Voveran, a common pain-reliever, Ghosh stated, ruling out the possibility of any drug or injection being spurious. She, however, added that the final picture would emerge only after the committee probing the death submitted its report.																								Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said at Writers Buildings that the post-mortem had been carried out with the permission of the boys family. Chatterjee claimed the infrastructure at the hospital was adequate to deal with the rush of patients, but admitted that occasional non-cooperation from a section of nurses and employees was a problem.

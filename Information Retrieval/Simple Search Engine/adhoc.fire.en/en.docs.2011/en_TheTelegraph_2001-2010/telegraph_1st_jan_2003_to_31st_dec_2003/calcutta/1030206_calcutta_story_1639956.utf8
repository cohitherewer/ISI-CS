																								Photographs are frozen moments. These are recordings of that one rare fleeting moment in spatial time that is lost otherwise in the dark annals of history. However, there is a distinct difference between news photography and pictorial. News photography focuses on the incident or event itself, at times at the cost of aesthetics. But beauty is the very essence of pictorial photography. This can, in fact, be termed as an extension of painting. A look at the Photographic Association of Bengals (PAB) 7th Biennial International Colour Salon along with an exhibition of 50 prints (still photographs) by PAB members will enhance this view further. The show is one of the most glamorous slide salons in Asia. It features a selection of colour slides of the highest artistic values in all subjects from leading photographers all over the globe; amateurs as well as professionals. Photographers from 32 countries with 917 entries are participating in this exhibition. After a rigorous screening, 137 works were selected by the international jury. The works show artistic excellence of the very highest order. Also, an exhibition of some 50 remarkable photographic prints, the creations of PAB members, bears testimony to the high standards of training imparted by PAB to perfect the techniques of serious enthusiasts who are keen to take up pictorial photography.																								When: Till today; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Asutosh Birth Centenary Hall, Indian Museum

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

				 Watch out for brand, not bill Yana Gupta, brand ambassador for Christian Dior, at  the launch of its range of watches. Picture by Pradip  Sanyal  Its the battle of the brands,  not prices, in the watch wars. With prices from Rs 500 to  Rs 5 lakh, an international range of designs and the launch  of new names, choice and availability are no longer an issue  in the mega mart in town. And the consumer, too, is changing  with the times and trends. Substantial disposable incomes  and label and design awareness mean the Calcutta customer  is not willing to settle for anything less than the best.				 																																																											At the launch of the Christian Dior watch range in the city recently, LVMH Watch and Jewellery regional managing director Ravi Thakran explained that although the line was being launched simultaneously in six cities in India, focus would be on the Calcutta market because of its promising retail development scene. Mumbai and Delhi have stagnated in the retail sector, and despite the hype, they each have only one large shopping mall to speak of. But Calcutta already has three, with more on the way, said Thakran.				 																																																											And the price range of Rs 13,000 to about Rs 150,000 is not daunting. The company that also markets Omega, Zenith and Rado amongst others, sees a promising future in India, but particularly in Calcutta. The reason  The artistic sense of Calcuttans, which has made the city the seat of art and culture in the country, according to Thakran. Hence, the need to associate the brand name of Christian Dior with this city, because those who have money, as is the case in some other cities, need not necessarily have taste. So, we have to woo this city first. 				 																																																											Titan and Piaget, Raymond Weil and Mont Blanc, are all in competition, and anything upto Rs 50,000 is in popular demand, for private collections or anniversary gifts, says Nandini Dasgupta of the Titan showroom on Park Street and Suranjan Sen, sales executive of BC Sen Jewellers. And its a floating customer, with a love of a variety of brands.				 																																																											If someone has a fascination with Omega, they will definitely buy one. But the next piece will inevitably be something different, because they want diversity, observes Sen. Besides, one piece is rarely enough for people who buy such expensive watches. It wasnt the case a few years ago, but people are definitely changing. Now, the average age group of customers is 25 to 30, and they come in knowing exactly what they want. Not just the brand, but the sub-category as well. What they look for first are the label and the design. The most popular ones at our showroom are Mont Blanc, Raymond Weil and Omega.				 																																																											But its the home-grown variety thats worth watching out for, according to Thakran, with Titan being the giant in that area. 				 																																																											People are very aware of fashion trends and whats available, and its true of all socio-economic strata in society, explains Dasgupta. Everything between Rs 500 and Rs 50,000 is competition for us, because the customer is quite fickle, and shifts loyalties every two or three months, particularly when something new enters the market.				 																																																											Of the 10,000 watches that Thakran hopes will be the minimum to sell in India in the next couple of years, at least 1,000, he feels, will be from Calcutta. With sales down by anything between 30 and 80 per cent in Southeast Asia in the last financial quarter because of the Iraq war and SARS, and more losses expected in the coming months, India could very well become our focus. And we have big game plans for this city, he winds up.  Nisha Lahiri Samit Dey (right) with Manjit Bawa at a painting workshop  in Delhi. Dey was among a group of eight artists from  Bengal participating in a chain of workshops on acrylic  on canvas and paper, organised by the WelcomGroup of  Arts, in Delhi and Jaipur. The sessions were coordinated  by Ina Puri. 				 																																																											It is divided in six chapters, beginning with the introduction. The second chapter is on dwelling houses and mandapas or roofs of temples. The third is all about rathas or chariots, the fourth is about the images of deities, the fifth on ornamental doorways and the sixth on miscellaneous wood carvings such as the brishakastha, thrones, wooden dolls, the wooden bulls that used to guard the portals of Shiva temples, musical instruments, wooden chests, beds, puppets, the craft of making boats and palanquins. This is an invaluable reference book illustrated as it is with a profusion of rarely seen photographs, some taken by Santra during his peregrinations. 				 																																																											My primary outlook was to find a project that was not run of the mill, explains Bikram. The urban film about the exploitation and degradation of women appealed to the artiste. I related to this film pretty strongly. There will be a few songs, for which the musician is in talks with lyricists. Recording is to start by June 10. There should be a lot of percussion. Indian cinema has not explored tabla as background to its fullest extend. It can be used even to express subtle emotion, feels the tabla exponent.				 																																																											If all goes well, Bikrams work may be heard in Bollywood as well. He is currently in talks with Govind Nihalani for an upcoming project. He is already working on a Hindi pop album, with a Bangla one with Sony Music lined up for Puja release. He has recording dates scheduled with Sivamani for a joint project with a strong element of percussion, which is also to have musical numbers.				 																																																											His world music group Rythmscape is leaving for a tour of the UK. We will be playing at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on July 24. That is an honour many musicians dont have, he signs off.

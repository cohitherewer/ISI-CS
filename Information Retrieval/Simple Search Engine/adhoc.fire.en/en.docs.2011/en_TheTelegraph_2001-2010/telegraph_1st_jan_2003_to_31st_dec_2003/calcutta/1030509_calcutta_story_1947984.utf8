The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, May 09, 2003  Heres where it all began
 In the second half of a two-part article,  Soumitra Das walks down the most depressed stretch  of Strand Road  Old Mint to Nimtala One of my first memories of Posta  is the intensely rancid odour of rotting potatoes that used  to assail ones nostrils as the bus took a turn from Kali  Krishna Tagore Street to enter Strand Road. So I was taken  by surprise when I discovered the other day that that stink  is gone. Anarchy still prevails on the thoroughfare where  thousands of trucks and labourers are engaged night and  day in fervid activity, but the nauseating smell is no more.  Deodrant? No. Sailendranath Choudhury, an employee of a  godown, has the answer. Being slowly pressure-cooked inside  the tobacco godown without a single fan on, the lean 76-year-olds  dhoti was hitched beyond indecent-exposure limits. Potatoes dont come here any  longer. So no smell. Earlier, people came from all over  to the wholesale mart here. Now they can buy everything  from district centres. If they carry cash they run the risk  of being mugged. Most warehouses have changed hands. They  belong to non-Bengalis today. The volume of traffic has  increased several-fold and pavements are fast disappearing,  says Choudhury. Strand Road from Rajakatra, off  the Brabourne Road flyover, is a melancholy concourse of  godowns and buildings, many of them very handsome examples  of masonry that are either decayed or have fallen into disuse.  These streets and pavements have been the home of thousands  of labourers, who, for generations have been breaking their  backs loading or unloading trucks. So as countless men with  glistening torsos carry huge loads on their heads in the  relentless sun, there is a sense of great physical turmoil.  Change their costume from loincloth to Mr Toodles canvas  suit abundantly besmeared with coal dust and oil and this  could be Dickensian London. The sense of anonymous humanity  toiling away to further the mercantile interests is certainly  there. But whereas mid-Victorian London held the hope of  a better tomorrow, Calcutta gradually slides into the slough  of despair. The legacy of architectural excellence it had  inherited from the British has been willingly forfeited.  Nothing could be more depressing than taking a ride in the  circular rail as it snails past shantytowns, relieved by  occasional glimpses of grandeur-turned-rubble.  Mayo Hospital, constructed in  1874, looked splendid to the last. The state government  had sold it off some time ago, and the huge concrete cage  that has replaced it stands testimony to the aborted attempt  at building the Eastern India of Medical Science amp; Research  Hospital, as a large signboard declares. The structure stands  amidst a wilderness of vegetation growing unchecked, debris  and garbage, so typical of a depressed area such as this. The Doric columns and the pediment  are still intact. But this resthouse that Rani Rashmoni  had built for those who wanted to breathe their last half-immersed  in the holy waters  antarjali yatra guaranteed safe  passage to heaven  has become a timber godown (part of  the chain in Nimtolla) with a pissoir attached. This is  the area where it is conjectured that Job Charnock had landed  over 300 years ago. Yet nothing could look so ground-down. The Gujarati numeral on the best-kept  building in Nimtolla announces the origin of its inhabitants.  R. Thakore, who has lived in that house off and on for 40  years (in-between he would be away in Orissa where his manganese  mining interests lie), says: There never used to be much  traffic. However, for the past 15 years transport offices  with storing capacity have opened in every house in every  street and lane here. People have given their courtyard  and ground floor to store commodities. Trucks two to three  deep stand on the road. They start coming in around 10 at  night to 2 in the morning. The movement starts again at  4 am. Labourers eat and sleep here. And eateries and teashops  have sprouted everywhere. The rot has set in. But nobody  is bothered. The tragic consequence of neglect is embodied  in the Old Mint. When it was conceived and later constructed  in 1826, the architect may have had the Parthenon in mind.  But the powers that be arent impressed by the 40 massive  columns. Once, some years ago, cracks that had developed  were crudely cemented over. But now it is disintegrating,  the process hastened by the trees that have grown on the  pediment. Will it get engulfed in a jungle like what is  known as Rajabagan thana now? Or will it sink into oblivion? The staff quarters (there are  two buildings, one built in 1907) in an enormous plot on  the opposite side of Strand Road are in pretty bad shape.  The cats cradle of Howrah Bridge looms above them. The  flats are like playfields, and the breeze that wafts across  the river whips up a gale inside. The stairs are well lit  although the first-floor banister is missing in one of the  buildings. Adjacent to one of these buildings is a series  of single-storeyed flats in a similar state of disrepair.  These quarters are somewhat better maintained than the Old  Mint because they are partially occupied. But the banalities  of domesticity dont go very well with them. This is  painfully evident in the low rises. How can Doric columns  -- and there are eight of them -- cohabit with formica tops  and plastic flowers?  Although it bears no comparison,  it would not be irrelevant to take a look at the carcass  of a behemoth of a warehouse next to Dalpatti, formerly  Patal Posta. Flocks of pigeons thrive on the grains that  fall by the wayside. If Amar Mandal, 74, a prosperous fourth-generation  merchant of pulses in that market, is to be believed, it  used to be the godown of a leading commercial firm. But  after it was abandoned, thieves came and stripped it bare  of its tin roof, fragments of which still exist. The sky  peers through the windows at least five storeys above the  ground. There is nothing behind to block the view. But the  godown is still in use. The new buildings that have come  up look so poorly that one wonders if the same people had  constructed, say the Niyamatulla Mosque close on Nimtolla  Ghat Street, close to its intersection with Strand Road.  Whatever happened to our aesthetic sense after the Fifties?  Vinayak Complex opposite the non-existent Mayo Hospital  comprises two stunted towers. The glass windows make it  airtight. Posta Masjid looks like the builders  were in a tearing hurry to slap it together. The over 75-year-old  Nageshwar Baba temple opposite Strand warehouse close to  the flyover, will soon emerge in a new avatar as the apotheosis  of kitsch. Thankfully, in the midst of such  chaos gems still exist. The walls of the tiny Ganga shrine  in Rajakatra gleam with hundreds of exotic blooms on the  tiles. A elderly matron, who still bears the traces of beauty,  climbs down the spiral staircase planted in its midst, tea  tray in hand. She could have been the deus ex machina.  Calcutta will be liveable so long as such vignettes exist.

 Thursday, August 21, 2003 				 HC prods cops on parking violations
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed the traffic police to intensify vigil on roads marked no-parking zones, in response to a petition moved by an advocate on traffic congestion in the metropolis.																								Justice Maharaja Sinha passed the order during the day after Ujjal Kumar Dutta, a high court lawyer, filed a petition alleging that taxis and private cars parked in the citys no-parking zones led to a traffic chaos. 																								In his order, Justice Sinha asked the city police to ensure safety, particularly that of schoolchildren, during peak hours at road intersections where traffic snarls are a regular affair. He also directed the police to take stern action against motorists violating traffic rules.																								Filing the petition, Dutta drew the courts attention to the regular traffic congestion at a four-point crossing in the Tollygunge area and sought the judges intervention to ensure smooth traffic flow. The area has three schools and the roads are a nightmare for children.																								The petitioner alleged that though Jadavpur police, on the basis of his complaint, put up a no-parking notice board in the area to avert traffic congestion, the situation has not changed at all, much to the disadvantage of schoolchildren.																								Taxis and private cars are regularly parked in the no-parking zone, in violation of traffic rules, he observed.																								S.K. Roy, lawyer on behalf of the petitioner, requested the court not to consider it a stray case, as parking of vehicles, particularly taxis and private cars, in no-parking zones is on the rise. If this trend continues, the city will never be free from traffic jams, he added.																								Roy called upon the court to direct the police to chalk out a comprehensive scheme to regulate the citys traffic system in a more scientific manner, in view of the increasing number of vehicles. 																								Welcoming the courts directive, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) M.K. Singh said in the evening that this would encourage his men to enforce traffic rules in a more stringent manner. 																								I am told that some people are regularly leaving behind their private vehicles in the no-parking zones, causing further congestion. I have made an appeal to the people to inform either any of my traffic guards or myself if they come across any vehicles parked in the no-parking zones, he said. 																								Singh announced that he would undertake a special drive against people abandoning their vehicles in no-parking zones.

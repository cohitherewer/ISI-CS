 Thursday, April 03, 2003 				 Satta racket busted off Park Street
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police stormed a single-storeyed house in congested Collin Lane, in the Park Street area, to bust a satta racket on Wednesday. Two bookies were arrested.																								Assistant commissioner of police Brajo Bhattacharya said the posse seized board money to the tune of Rs 80,000 and several incriminating documents. He claimed it was the biggest satta racket in the city since the days of central Calcutta don Rashid Khan, now in jail after a blast ripped through his Bowbazar house in December 1992.																								Officer-in-charge of Park Street police station Fayaz Khan said his men had been keeping tabs on a few people suspected of links with the racket. On Wednesday, we were tipped off that some bookies had assembled at 14, Collin Lane and were collecting satta money, Khan said.																								Officers surrounded the house and stormed in to find four men and a couple of women collecting money from bookies. As the house was in a congested lane, others must have seen the team arrive and fled.																								We managed to net key linkman Zahid Hussain, Khan said. Investigations revealed that the racket was being run by Maulavi Afzal Hussein for the past year.																								We have evidence that Husseins bookies and pencillers were active in New Market, Taltala, Lindsay Street, Ripon Street, Alimuddin Street and the surrounding areas, Bhattacharya said. The names of more than 35 persons on Husseins payroll were seized. Hussein himself is absconding.

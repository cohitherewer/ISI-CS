The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, July 26, 2003 				 Potshots over killer craters
 OUR BUREAU MIND THE  GAP, FIND THE ROAD
 As the blame game  continues over the state of the citys roads, Metro  focuses on two potholes that are potential killers.  (Left) At the crossing of Park Street and Chowringhee.  (Right): At Babughat, off Netaji Indoor Stadium. Pictures  by Aranya Sen 																								The blood of a Calcutta Police sub-inspector on the citys potholed paths prompted chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to see red on Friday, while the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) chose to blame the victim, not the ill-maintained road, for the mishap.																								This mishap has once again exposed the state of the citys roads, Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings, referring to Thursdays death of Arun Majumder. The 45-year-old cop died hours after his motorcycle hit a pothole on CIT Road, late on Wednesday.																								Calcutta is lagging way behind (other cities) in this respect (roads), the chief minister admitted.																								With Bhattacharjee steering the way, the killer roads of Calcutta found themselves under renewed official scrutiny  from Writers Buildings, Lalbazar and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) headquarters  on Friday.																								With the sharpest indictment of the roads that claimed 457 lives in the last calendar year coming from Bhattacharjee  who negotiates his share of perilous potholes on his weekday rides from Palm Avenue to Writers Buildings  the CMC found itself in the harshest focus.																								More than 1,500 km of Calcuttas roads falls under the CMC purview. After scurrying, on Friday, to cover the pothole that had claimed the sub-inspectors life  a thorough pitch-and-bricks job after Thursdays rush patchwork  the CMC administration chose to play the blame game, rather than be browbeaten.																								Mayor-in-council member (roads) Anup Chatterjee did the tough-talking, going to the extent of blaming Majumder for Wednesday nights accident. It was very clearly the riders fault, Chatterjee said on Friday. There was, he claimed, a three-inch pothole on the road but, more towards the boulevard. The sub-inspector who died was driving at a very high speed and could not control his two-wheeler, he alleged.																								Chatterjee did not stop there. I have been to Mumbai, he said, adding that even Andheri roads were pretty bad. It is not possible to ensure that all 1,500 km of roads are without potholes, he fired his final salvo.																								Calcutta Police, however, is not convinced. Regular pleas to the CMC and also the Calcutta Tramways Company (which maintains the tracks and a part of the road along them) have met with no response, alleged deputy commissioner (traffic) M.K. Singh.																								The police on Friday initiated a case of death due to negligence for Majumders tragic end. But there was no entry against the name of the accused.

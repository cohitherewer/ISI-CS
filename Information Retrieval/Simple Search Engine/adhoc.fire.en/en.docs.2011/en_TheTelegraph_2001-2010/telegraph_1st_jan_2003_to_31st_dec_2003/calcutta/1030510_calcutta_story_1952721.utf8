The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, May 10, 2003 				 An evening of ghazals
 It is said of Vibhas Kichlu that he is twice-blessed  with a voice that is mellifluous and soul-stirring and with a lineage that is the envy of many a light classical and ghazal exponents. Son of the legendary Pandit Ravi Kichlu, doyen of the famed Agra gharana, Vibhas has been performing on stage since the age of 12. Mostly in accompaniment to his father while he was alive, together with his older brother Neeraj. Later, after his father expired, he went solo. From his doting father and guru, Vibhas inherited a veritable treasure-trove  original ghazals and folk-songs composed and set to music by the maestro himself. Drawing upon this rich and priceless resource, Vibhas has, over the years, emerged as a stellar solo performer, mirroring his fathers vibrant and full-throated singing that repeatedly has had audiences crying mukraar. The evening of ghazals will begin casting its magic spell with three promising new talents selected from the Tolly Trillers of Tollygunge Club  Bratati Bhattacharya, Mohua Majumdar and Ahona Pal Chowdhury. As the night grows headily romantic, Vibhas will take the stage and weave a multi-coloured tapestry of melody and poetry into a magnificent skein of ghazals which will imprison the heart of ghazal lovers, forever. Irshaad.																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: The HSBC Hall, Tollygunge Club

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Trash trucks a Euro mockery
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) officials pressed the panic button on Thursday, seeking mayor Subrata Mukherjees immediate attention to the nightmarish state of conservancy trucks, owned by both the civic body and its contractors. 																								The trucks, they pointed out, are diesel-guzzlers and violate all pollution norms.																								The civic body deploys over 300 trucks a day to remove 2,500 metric tonnes of trash generated by 10 million citizens. Of the 300 trucks, about 150 are owned by the CMC. Not a single one of them conforms to Euro-I auto emission norms. 																								Now, after the Calcutta High Court directives, if all vehicles that are not fitted with Bharat Stage II engines are to be yanked off the streets from April 1, then no truck will be available to remove the citys garbage.																								I am scared to visualise the scene post-April 2, 2004. All the garbage dumps will be spilling over and dogs and pigs will forage merrily. The stench will turn the city into a huge vat, said mayor Mukherjee.																								Mayoral council member in charge of conservancy Rajib Deb said an investment of Rs 30 crore would be required to replace the 300 trucks now in service in the CMC. 																								The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has allotted Rs 57 crore to tone up the civic conservancy department, as part of its Rs 1,518-crore loan towards Calcuttas environment improvement project, Deb admitted. But the amount cannot be spent only on buying new trucks, he pointed out.																								According to chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar, contractors who had been asked to buy new trucks have expressed their financial inability to do so. Instead, they urged the CMC to arrange for soft loans for them.																								The CMCs project officer for ADB schemes Uday Chand Sen said as part Calcuttas environment improvement project, the conservancy department will get four bulldozers, 60 dumper-pressure trucks, 300 containers and 30,000 trash bins. 																								The loan of Rs 57 crore allotted to the department is item-specific and cannot be altered without consulting the bank authorities in Manila. 																								We will not allow a diversion of the ADB funds for the purchase of trucks, asserted CPM legislator and councillor Sudhangsu Sil. The mayor will have to make alternative provisions to replace the old trucks. That is more urgent than the construction of a Calcutta Gateway, at an expense of Rs 20 crore, the councillor added.

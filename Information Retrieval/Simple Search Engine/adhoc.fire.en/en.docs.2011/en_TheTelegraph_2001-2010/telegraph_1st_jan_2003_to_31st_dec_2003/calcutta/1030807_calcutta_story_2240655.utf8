  Causes for worry: The transport minister  and the belching vehicles Kudos to Metro for the series of campaigns it is running to raise awareness among people to keep Calcutta clean. Of all the campaigns, what has stayed in our mind is the picture of the gentleman urinating in public and the smiling civic official gently patting his back, as if he was meeting a friend after a long time, all at a moment when the lethal camera zeroed in on the embarrassed offender (Blame game on streets of squalor, June 19). The gentleman would repent the act all his life. Even if he forgets it, his friends, neighbours and family members would remind him. If civic officials continue to raid different places along with cameramen of newspapers, it could prove a sufficient deterrent for habitual offenders.  Years ago, the police department had adopted a unique way of punishing such people. A friend, not a habitual offender, was urinating at the Esplanade bus terminus. Suddenly a policeman appeared, caught hold of him by the scruff and pushed him inside the van with petty criminals. But when the van reached the police station, the officer became apologetic and offered him snacks and drink. The stunned fellow could not stop himself from asking the reason for the sudden change in behaviour. The officer replied that he had no intention to put him in jail or produce him in court but the way he was dragged to the thana would constantly remind him not to repeat the mistake.  I wonder how people take urinating in public so casually. This cant be part of a civil society. The Corporation, the police, the media along with the public should launch a crusade against nuisance-makers with the aim of keeping our city clean.  Govind Das Dujari,
 Diamond Harbour Road, Behala.  The report Subhas steers smoke engine (Metro, July 7) is a glaring example of the West Bengal governments lackadaisical attitude in implementing Bharat Stage II norms. The state transport ministers logic in favour of pushing back the changeover is nothing but a clever ploy. How could New Delhi and Karnataka implement BS-II within the stipulated time? This is only possible through political will.  Mohan Lal Sarkar,
 Budge Budge.  How long can the honble minister  keep mouthing the old excuses! Over the years, he has been  saying that old vehicles will be scrapped, but in a phased  manner. All he can do is scrap a few government buses, which  are under his control. What is the report card of his performance?  Enough is enough. Please leave your chair, and allow a fresh  face to take over.  S. Basu,
 Address not given.  It is shocking that transport  minister Subhas Chakraborty is still dilly-dallying to implement  BS II norms for auto-emission. He should remember that judicial  directives for the sake of public health is of far greater  importance than pretexts harboured for six years to avoid  a certainty (Six-year stall on smokestreet, Metro,  July 8).  Govinda Bakshi,
 Budge Budge.  The report Barge of tooni lights for Thames festival (Metro, July 8) is a tribute to the highly-skilled craftsmanship of Chandernagore electricians like Sridhar Das. People who will see this barge studded with 1,35,000 tooni bulbs will come to know of this art which deserves worldwide renown.  Bhupen Bose,
 Dum Dum Park.  Kudos for highlighting one of  the pioneers of tooni lights, Sridhar Das of Chandernagore,  and Calcutta-based curator Nandita Palchaudhuri who are  being commissioned by the Mayors Thames Festival to design  a ceremonial barge. It is a rare honour.  Sunil Banerjee,
 VIP Road. The report Delhi board debuts script suit (Metro, July 10) should help students of the ISC board. Anthony Pritish Nath has moved court, but there are others who, due to lack of means, are unable to do the same. Discontent regarding marks prevails even among students of the ISC and ICSE boards, myself being a victim.  Kunal Ray,
 Santragachhi.  In the article Civic brakes on progress path (Metro, July 11) the reporter, Shankar Mukherjee, has imputed certain comments to me as ex-director, PVD, and a member of the Pollution Control Committee. But the reporter neither met me nor spoke to me. The conversation that he quotes is imaginary.  T. V. Venkataraman,
 Salt Lake.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								With the West putting a credibility crimp on herbal medicines, the interest in herbs and herbal medicines in the country has been on the up for the past few years. From personal care products to medicines for critical diseases, herbs are being used today as never before.																								Recognising the trend and taking note of a growing interest in herbs, the Agri-Horticultural Society of India (AHSI) has joined hands with Jadavpur University (JU) to offer a one-year post-graduate diploma course in herbalogy, billed as the first in this part of the country. A memorandum of understanding has been inked between the 184-year-old society and the university.																								There are various courses on ayurveda, pharmacy and agriculture, but herbalogy isnt taught anywhere in the country, apart from Gujarat University. With various forms of price pressures on allopathic drugs, people are turning towards herbal medicines and we see a boom in this market after 2005, for which we want to create the manpower to support the industry, says Anupama Mitra of AHSI.																								According to Mitra, coordinator of the programme on behalf of AHSI, classes will start in February 2004 and facilities have already been created on the Alipore greens, where both the theory and practical sessions will be conducted. The curriculum, prepared in consultation with faculty members at JU, has already been drawn up for the seven-paper course, priced at Rs 10,000. From hands-on training in growing medicinal plants to practice of cultivation organically and collection and analysis of business data and doing business with overseas clients, the course is said to be comprehensive.																								In the first year, 30 students will be enrolled, but we plan to raise the numbers. We have an affiliation with JU, which will screen candidates and offer the diplomas, said Mitra. Anyone with a science degree (chemistry is a must), may apply for the programme, which will also include project work and internship.																								Besides research fellows and scientists at AHSI, faculty members from JU, the Botanical Survey of India and industry experts will take classes. The university and the society have plans to offer placement assistance to students, but the corporate tie-ups are yet to be firmed up. 																								We expect a lot of jobs to be created, with more companies entering the herbal medicine market. The programme has been designed keeping in mind the employability factor, signed off Mitra.

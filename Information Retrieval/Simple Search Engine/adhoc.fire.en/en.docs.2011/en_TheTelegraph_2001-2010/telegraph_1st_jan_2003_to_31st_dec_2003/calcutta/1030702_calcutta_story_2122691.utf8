	The civic authorities must check out Lower Rawdon Street  after a shower. The road has been dug up at several spots  and the underground drains, probably choked with refuse,  are brimming with filthy water. Civic workers have tried  to cover some of the craters with bricks, which has made  matters worse. Bricks are also lying on the footpaths. After  a moderate downpour recently, the water level on the road  rose to a foot. In such circumstances, it becomes difficult  for rickshaws to pull their vehicles. The condition at Woodburn  Park is no different.

	It seems Calcutta Police is trying hard to check pedestrian  movement at busy intersections. At several places, I have  spotted cops using a rope to barricade pedestrians from  jaywalking. But this is definitely not an intelligent move.  As the rope is dropped on the ground and picked up again  to block peoples movement, ones clothes get soiled by  the dirty rope in the process.

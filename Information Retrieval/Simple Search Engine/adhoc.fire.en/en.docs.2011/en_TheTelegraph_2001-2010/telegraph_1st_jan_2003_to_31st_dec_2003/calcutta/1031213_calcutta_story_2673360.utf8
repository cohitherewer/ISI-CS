The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Back-to-back beam blackout
 															- Writers huddle over early CAS rollout as Siti yanks out STAR A STAFF REPORTER																								The day Writers Buildings sent out clear signals that it was all for an early rollout of CAS in the New Year, the urgent need to fast-track the addressable system was underlined with yet another bouquet blackout as the STAR wars took a turn for the worse.																								The three joint-venture partners of SitiCable yanked the STAR channels off their network on Thursday midnight to protest the 100 per cent numbers revamp sought by RPG Netcom, which distributes the STAR signal in the city. The fresh STAR stand-off meant more than 200,000 cable homes fed by Siti joined the 300,000-plus Manthan viewers denied their STAR fare since Tuesday over a payment dispute with Netcom.																								While the back-to-back beam blocks on two different networks have fuelled discontent among consumers, the government on Friday gave CAS a thumbs-up, expressing keenness to roll it out at the earliest. 																								In a reconnoitre conclave with city representatives of all major broadcasters, Arun Bhattacharya, principal secretary to the chief minister, requested them to keep any rate hike in abeyance in the lead-up to CAS, which he hinted, was on its way. Pay broadcasters were also asked to run an awareness campaign on CAS.																								Behind-the-scene CAS confabulations notwithstanding, two of the service providers most vocal in favour of the system have fallen out most bitterly on the ground. How can they (RPG Netcom) seek a 100 per cent connectivity hike at this juncture? Its unethical business practice and we wont accept any revamp before CAS. After all, I have to protect my small operators, who will be wiped out by such high-handedness, fumed Suresh Sethia, a partner of SitiCable.																								Sethia added that the Siti camp was prepared to shrug off viewer clamour for the popular soaps and movies for any length of time to prove a point. Netcom CEO Amit Nag countered: Let us see who blinks first. The revamp proposal is absolutely justified. Siti had been kept out of the August revamp, which led to a 66 per cent mark-up on an average. So their operators have been enjoying a ridiculously low purchase price, which cant continue.																								Federation of Consumer Associations, West Bengal president Mala Banerjee termed the blackouts grossly unfair on the viewers, saying the federation would strongly advocate early rollout of CAS  the only solution  at the first meeting of the implementation panel on Monday, at Calcutta Information Centre.

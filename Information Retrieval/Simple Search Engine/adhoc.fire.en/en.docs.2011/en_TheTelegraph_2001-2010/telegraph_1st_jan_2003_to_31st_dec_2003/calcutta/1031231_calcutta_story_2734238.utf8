																								Aristotles saying, A wise man is he who knows where to stop, is humourously demonstrated in this play, presented by Howrah Dakshinayan. Bhuto, a timid fellow, is terrified of his tyrannical boss. His colleagues spend their days flattering the boss, who enjoys the oppressive power he holds over them. One day, Bhuto gets into serious trouble at work owing to a punctuation error that he has made. His error of inserting a stop in the wrong place earns him the bosss wrath and leaves him on the brink of losing his job. His whole existence, too, seems to be at stake. However, all is well when it turns out that Bhuto has put the stop in the right place after all, though by mistake. Thus, ironically, by virtue of his mistake, Bhuto proves himself wiser than the others, revealing through this wonderful comedy, lifes way of putting things right in its own way. The play is written and directed by Kunal Mukhopadhyay.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Sisir Mancha

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, February 10, 2003 				 Music mosaics
																								The citys brief affair with winter is almost over and Calcuttans are grudgingly accepting the prospect of another long, monotonous summer looming nearby. The blues mood has set in. To offshoot this mood, Congo Square is hosting a Rock-Jazz-Fusion bonanza this evening featuring Jonas Hellborg, Shawn Lane and Andreas Marchesini. Referred to as the best musical jazz-fusion unit, the trio are talented musicians individually. In fact, Hellborg is a bass guitarist of imposing technique, and his vast artistic resume includes time with his hero, guitarist John McLaughlin, as well as working with dynamic drummers including Tony Williams and Ginger Baker. The Swedish super-basist has travelled extensively, recording a variety of musical combinations and is equally at ease playing both intimate acoustic music as well as loud rock and heavy metal stuff. Hellborg is a monster player and holds the reins. Lane pushes things into six string ovedrive while Hellborg digs deeper. Much like Hellborg, Lane comes to improvisational music via hard rock. In fact, he is one of the fastest great guitarists we have now. Inspired by a creative urge, the trio combine their musical traditions to set the stage afire. A must-see for all music lovers.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Nazrul Manch

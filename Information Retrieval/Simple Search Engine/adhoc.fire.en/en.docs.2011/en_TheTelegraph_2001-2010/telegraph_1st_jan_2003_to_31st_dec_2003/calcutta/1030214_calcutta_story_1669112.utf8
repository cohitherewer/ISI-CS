 Friday, February 14, 2003 				 Kidnap gang kingpin held in MP
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A team of sleuths from the state, Agra, Jaipur, Bilaspur, Durg, Bhopal and Patna coordinated investigations and tracked down Joginder Singh, kingpin of Indias most wanted kidnapper gang, in Morena, Madhya Pradesh, on Wednesday night. Police records say Singh is wanted in 29 cases of high-profile, inter-state kidnappings and murder.																								Special superintendent of police, special operation group of the CID, Manoj Malaviya, said Singh is wanted for the abduction of six industrialists and businessmen in Calcutta and its adjoining districts. 																								He was in the city with Umesh Singh and associates to kidnap Exide chairman S.B. Ganguly and businessman Sajjan Jalan a few years ago, Malaviya said. The CID claimed Singh was the last of the five-member gang that had kidnapped Ganguly and Jalan.																								Durgs superintendent of police Ashok Juneja told Metro that sleuths on Joginders trail were tipped off on Tuesday evening that he would arrive in Morena on Wednesday and stay overnight at a friends place.																								Joginder has been on the run since the state CID netted Umesh Singh and Mohan Rao, alias Anant, in the past two months. CID officials said Joginder had threatened three city industrialists and extorted several lakhs from them, late last year. 																								Additional director-general (CID) S.I.S. Ahmed said Umesh Singhs arrest from a Patna hideout was the turning point in investigations.																								Singh divulged vital information about Joginder and Mohan Rao, Ahmed said.

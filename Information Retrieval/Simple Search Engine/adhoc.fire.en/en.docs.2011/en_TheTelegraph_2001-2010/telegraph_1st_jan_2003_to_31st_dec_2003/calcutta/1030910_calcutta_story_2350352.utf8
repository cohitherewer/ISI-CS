The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, September 10, 2003  Kanti Biswas Minister-in-Charge, school  education, government of West Bengal																																							Educational institutions play an important social role. They should not be made to pay any taxes. Moreover, there is no point in collecting taxes from a school or a college which is being aided by the government. This will mean government money going back to government coffers, which is a useless exercise. But the private institutions which fleece the students and do not pay the teachers well, should not be spared.

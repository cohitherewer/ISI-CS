 Tuesday, May 27, 2003 				 Expressions of beauty
I see them all so excellently  fair,/ I see, not feel, how beautiful they are   S.T. Coleridge																								Arundhati Sarkars exotic Ikebana flower arrangements are instant attention-grabbers. A familiar name in flower shows, Sarkar is an enthusiastic member of Wafukai chapter, Calcutta. She learnt the finer nuances of this complex yet exquisitely beautiful form of flower arrangement from Kazuko Nigam, head of the Wafukai chapter of Ikebana, Calcutta. Now a qualified teacher from the Wafukai school of flower arrangement, Tokyo, Sarkar has been working tirelessly to popularise this Oriental art form and teach those who are keen to pursue this art form. In the on-going exhibition, her flower arrangements express the various painted themes of Bageshree Dutta, a city-based talented artist, whose excellence in Indian style of painting has fetched her the prestigious Indra Dugar Award initiated by Vichar Manch, Academy of Fine Arts. The current exhibition showcases Duttas landscapes and various festivals of India.																								When: Till June 1; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery

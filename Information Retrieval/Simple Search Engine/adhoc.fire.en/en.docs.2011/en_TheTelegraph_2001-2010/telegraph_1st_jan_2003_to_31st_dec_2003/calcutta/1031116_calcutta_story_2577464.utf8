 A STAFF REPORTER																								Residents of Elgin Road foiled a daring abduction bid on a seven-year-old on Friday night by chasing away three armed miscreants.																								The incident occurred at around 8 pm when Sankalpa Shankar Das, 7, was walking down Elgin Road with his tutor Somabho Roy Chowdhury, a resident of Asutosh Mukherjee Road. 																								The boy, a Class II student, had gone to a local health centre with his tutor. They were in front of a fast food centre when a taxi screeched to a halt in front. Three men got off and surrounded the duo, said an officer of Bhowanipore police station.																								The men tried to drag the boy into the taxi.

A complaint of a kidnap bid was lodged with Bhowanipore police station. No arrests have been made.

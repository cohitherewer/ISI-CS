 Monday, March 31, 2003 				 Mob keeps body for TV cameras
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A mob refused to let go of the body of a 63-year-old maid, Arati Pramanik, found hanging at her employers residence on Charu Avenue, till a TV channel team arrived on Sunday. 																								The people, who claimed they were domestic help, abused former Presidency jail superintendent Kamal Banerjee (at whose residence Pramanik used to work) and heckled policemen who wanted to take the body to the morgue.																								Pramanik had been unwell for some time and Banerjee had advised her to go back to her sons, police said. One lives on Deshapran Sashmal Road and the other in Garia, and Pramanik was not sure she would be welcome there.																								Banerjee discovered Pramaniks body hanging on the first-floor balcony. He had gone to the market and his wife is not in town. He called in the police but the mob arrived before they could reach. The mob held the body back till the TV crew arrived. Police persuaded them to leave.

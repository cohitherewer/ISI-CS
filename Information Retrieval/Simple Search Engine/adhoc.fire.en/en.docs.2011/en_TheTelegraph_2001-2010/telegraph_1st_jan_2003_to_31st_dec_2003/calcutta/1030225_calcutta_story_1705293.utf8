 Tuesday, February 25, 2003 				 Private boost for health welcomed
 A STAFF REPORTER																								State health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra has invited more collaboration in the health sector to boost revenue and research in the government institutions. At the foundation day function of the School of Tropical Medicine (STM) on Monday, the minister stressed that private participation in government hospitals was the order of the day. The successful running of the CT scan machine and the MRI tests at the STM proves the point, Mishra said.																								He indicated that private participation was also welcome in the STMs upcoming, state-of-the-art laboratory. The new lab will be equipped to handle complicated tropical diseases. The STM proposal for a new lab received the nod few weeks ago.																								On medical textbooks, the minister said teachers should ensure that students are taught in detail about localised problems and diseases that plague the state. The syllabus should be easy to understand. Recently, the government decided to issue a separate textbook for MBBS students, which would deal with problems like snakebite, diarrhoea, malaria and other tropical diseases.																								Director of medical education C.R. Maity, who shared the dais with Mishra, rued that enough research work was not being taken up at the STM of late. Why dont you conduct research on molecular epidemiology here? We will provide you with all the support, Maity assured the audience.

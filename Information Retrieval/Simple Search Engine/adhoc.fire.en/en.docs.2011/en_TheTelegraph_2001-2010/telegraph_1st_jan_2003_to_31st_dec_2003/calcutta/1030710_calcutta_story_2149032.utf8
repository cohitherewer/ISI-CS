 Thursday, July 10, 2003 				 Amateur hand in housewife murder
 A STAFF REPORTER																								No professional was involved in the murder of Gunjan Tanwani, 25-year-old wife of a motor parts businessman, resident of a highrise in Baguiati. The killing took place not during the day, but between 7 pm and 9 pm on Monday, said Supriyo Das, officer-in-charge of Baguiati thana.																								Gunjan was gagged and slashed to death and her body was found in front of the toilet. Police recovered some plumbing tools and a blood-stained shirt from the room. They have already contacted their counterparts in Bihar and Hyderabad. We will send a team to Hyderabad soon to question the victims relatives, said Das.																								Police suspect that the plumbing tools could be mere red herrings. They are on the lookout for the plumber, who was seen by the maid entering the flat on Monday afternoon.																								The victims husband, Ramesh, returned home around 7.30 pm, round about the time when it is suspected that the murder took place. 																								Police are surprised that Gunjans mobile phone is missing. The suspect must have stolen it. He might have called her up before coming to the flat. So, we are contacting the cell-phone connection provider and verifying when Gunjan spoke to the suspect for the last time, police said.

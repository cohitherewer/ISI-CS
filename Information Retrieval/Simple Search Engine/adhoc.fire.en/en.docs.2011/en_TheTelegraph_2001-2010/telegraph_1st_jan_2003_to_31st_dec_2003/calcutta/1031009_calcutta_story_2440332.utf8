																								Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of arts/ And eloquence 																								Paintings, they say, reflect the artists inner soul. They are reflective, ruminative, yet in everything they carry the creators imprint. Anju Chirimars maiden solo exhibition of paintings in the Tanjore (picture alongside), Vrindavan and miniature styles speaks of the artists tremendous aptitude for this fine art. She started learning miniature painting at the tender age of 10, and after a hiatus of a few years, took it up again, together with the Vrindavan style. For the last eight years, she has been a consummate teacher as well. While Tanjore hails from the south and Vrindavan from the north, Anju tries to marry them in her miniature creations. The colour schemes vary from soft pastels in the miniature style to the bright, vibrant hues in the Tanjore and Vrindavan styles. The focus in all these works is basically divinity, mostly Krishna.																								When: Till October 14; 10 am - 7 pm																								Where: Chemould Art Gallery, 12 F, Park Street

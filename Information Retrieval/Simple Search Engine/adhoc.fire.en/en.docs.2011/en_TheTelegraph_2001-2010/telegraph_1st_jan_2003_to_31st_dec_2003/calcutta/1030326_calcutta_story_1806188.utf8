				 																																										lChief minister Buddhadeb Bhatacharjee on Tuesday said the government will provide maximum protection to the employees of the state-run Great Eastern Hotel before its privatisation. An Intuc delegation led by mayor Subrata Mukherjee met Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings to inquire about the progress towards hotel privatisation. The chief minister told us that the government will not do anything against the employees interests. We are glad to know that Bhattacharjee has taken personal initiative for the betterment of the hotel, the mayor said. The chief minister told us that discussions are on with four private parties. But nothing has been finalised yet. We urged him to talk to the trade unions before finalising an agreement with a private party, Mukherjee said after the meeting. Moves to privatise the state-run hotel have run into rough weather over the last few years following protests from employees. Neither the Citu nor the Intuc is in favour of privatisation by retrenching existing employees. The government is facing similar problems in privatising Mainak Tourist Lodge in Siliguri, where the Citu blocked the governments privatisation bid. However, the trade unions have softened their stand, after they were assured that employees jobs will not be at stake.				 																																										The Association of Health Services Doctors will meet on Thursday to discuss its course of action over the assault on Dr N.C. Das at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital on Sunday. The junior doctors who had called a ceasework in the outdoor department on Monday to protest the assault on Dr Das and some other staffers, allegedly by Co-ordination Committee members, resumed work on Tuesday, following assurances by state government officials that the guilty will be punished. CPM activists had beat up Das and a few junior doctors on Sunday evening after a patient died. No one was arrested on Tuesday. Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said an inquiry was on and the report will be available in a few days. 				 																																										The condition of Left Front chief whip in the Assembly Laksmi De has improved slightly, Medical College and Hospital sources said on Tuesday. According to attending doctors, De was responding to treatment. He was admitted to hospital on Monday morning after he complained of chest pains. A team of four doctors is treating De. 				 																																										The state government has decided to disburse pending salaries of ESI doctors. The Indian Medical Association had staged demonstrations and hunger strikes to protest the governments apathy towards more than 1,500 ESI doctors who did not receive their salaries since July 2002. The deadlock was broken after a three-member team from the IMA met Central ministers in New Delhi.				 																																										Five persons, including a woman and a child, were injured after a wall collapsed at Tiljala. All the injured were taken to Nilratan Sirkar Medical College and Hospital. Police said the woman and the child were critical.

 Saturday, September 06, 2003 				 Ragging rap on freshers welcome
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The health department on Friday issued a directive to all state medical colleges which, the authorities felt, would curb ragging on campus.																								According to the convention followed till this year, hostels of all medical colleges across the state organised individual freshers welcome programmes. But this, officials said, made the supervisory role of the authorities less effective.																								Freshers welcome, the authorities felt, is often an euphemism for ragging. We have, therefore, asked the principals of the states seven undergraduate medical colleges to ensure that each institution is allowed to organise only one freshers welcome programme, director of medical education Chittaranjan Maity said on Friday. 																								Of the seven medical colleges, Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, Medical College and Hospital, NRS Medical College and Hospital and RG Kar Medical College and Hospital are located in the city.																								Maity, however, said he was happy that the ragging charges, levelled by the Students Federation of India (SFI) against some seniors of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday, were later found to be baseless. All the second-year girls, who had allegedly been ragged in their hostel, withdrew their complaint on Thursday and told the authorities that they had been forced by SFI members to level the charges.

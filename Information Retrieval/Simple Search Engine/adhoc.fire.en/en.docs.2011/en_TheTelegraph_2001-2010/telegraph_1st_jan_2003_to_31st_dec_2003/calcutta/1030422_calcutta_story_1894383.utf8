	 Lines of peace				 				 																															We want peace, not pieces				 				 																															Were high in spirit				 				 																															Not on spirits.				 				 																															Lets rock, not be a rock				 				 																															No drugs, no drinks				 				 																															Lets just jive and sing				 				 																															That was the message from Ravi Shankar to all youth at the Fusion Concert for Peace organised by Art of Living on April 19 at The Legacy (at the HSBC building on Shakespeare Sarani) and at the Dublin, ITC Sonar Bangla, the following day. This fun attempt to introduce spirituality to the youth was part of a cross-country series of concerts organised in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Cochin, Bhopal and Pune. Similar sessions were also held at universities abroad like Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard.				 				 																															For the Calcutta leg, young teachers from the Art of Living Foundation, Mumbai, Saket Kakker and Sahil Jagtiani, were the lead singers for the Art of Living Satsang band. Bhajans set to western styles, not dance music, was what got the crowd going for a change.				 				 																															Through shows like this, we want the youth to realise that partying and having fun need not be restricted to nights out with friends at discos and pubs. Every moment in life is a celebration, said international youth co-ordinator Sharmila Murarka.				 				 																															Actress June Maliah was the youth guest of honour, singing with the band. A 10-minute meditation session conducted by the band concluded the rejuvenating evening.

	 On a fun pitch				 				 																															I had the opportunity to live my dream last Friday at the mini world cup. On April 18 at a Summer Fun Camp organised for children, the 10 teams of eight players each could almost believe they were padding up at Joburg instead of at The Space Circle. We arrived bright and early at 7.30 in the morning, when we were given an idli-samosa breakfast to pep us up. Then, all the action was on the indoor cricket pitches.				 				 																															The teams were from different coaching centres and buildings. I, as captain, had dubbed our team Super 8. Others chose names like Lagaan, Josh and Manchester United.				 				 																															The rules were many and mind-boggling. Two runs for wides and no balls. If a batsman hit a boundary he could add to his score by running while the ball was being retrieved. A dismissal meant three runs knocked off. I was thrilled when I didnt get out once in the three matches we played. The tournament, organised by Bhavna Himani and Jolly Shah, had fair, alert umpires. The most memorable moment for me was when I hit a six, because it was the only one of the nine-match tourney.				 				 																															A team from Milan Samity coaching centre won the Cup while a Bhowanipore school was runner-up. The Super 8 made it to the semi-finals of the knockout tournament, after which our luck ran dry. Though we may not have won the tournament (we came third), my friends and I had a ball. We made new friends and learnt a lot about teamwork and coordination. It was a lovely day of cricket and a wonderful experience.

The annual event commemorates festivals of all communities  Id-uz-Zoha, Poila Vaishakh, the Parsi New Year  all packed into one day. In its fourth year, the theme was Peace and Unity.				 				 																															The evening commenced with a Unison Prayer for all religions led by Bishop Raju and other religious heads. In his address the Bishop stressed the need to celebrate India in its vastness and complexity.				 				 																															Apart from performances from Shrutinatak and pop singer Shayne Hyrapiet, the teachers and even a few students of St Johns Diocesan provided most of the entertainment. The audience of students and parents also included politician Ajit Panja, actors Arjun Chakraborty and Abhishek Chatterjee, artist Wasim Kapoor and chairman of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission Justice Mukul Gopal Mukherjee.				 				 																
	 Question time				 				 																															The Sreeleathers Bestfriends Battle of Brains Quiz Contest was held on Monday at the Science City auditorium. The winner among the 207 teams was St Xaviers Collegiate School, which walked away with Rs 25,000. Bidhannagar Municipal School was second and South Point followed in third place. - Coming up: A Shakespeare quiz  to commemorate the Bards birth anniversary will be organised  by the Shakespeare Society of Eastern India on April 23  at Deshbandhu Girls College, 5 pm.

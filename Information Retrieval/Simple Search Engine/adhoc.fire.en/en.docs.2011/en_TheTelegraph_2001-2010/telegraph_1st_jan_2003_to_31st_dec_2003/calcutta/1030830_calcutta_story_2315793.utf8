																																																		Hours of drama were staged at Sealdah station on Friday afternoon surrounding the arrest of a Bangladeshi national. Hasimuddin Sheikh was picked up from the parcel van of Lalgola Fast Passenger. According to police, the Border Security Force provided a specific tip-off at Lalgola, in Murshidabad, that a Bangladeshi smuggler was hiding in the luggage van. Tension spread among the railway employees as well as the Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel when they found the door of the parcel van locked from inside. We wanted to search the coach at Lalgola station, but the guard of the train did not allow us without the divisional railway managers permission, said a GRP official.

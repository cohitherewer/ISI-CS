 Monday, December 22, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Ralph Fiennes, actor. You  do not crack even under tremendous pressure. The ability  to take quick decisions makes you an efficient leader. You  open up only to some close friends. Your generous and caring  nature is widely admired. People are also charmed by your  sense of humour.  Kusum Bhandari

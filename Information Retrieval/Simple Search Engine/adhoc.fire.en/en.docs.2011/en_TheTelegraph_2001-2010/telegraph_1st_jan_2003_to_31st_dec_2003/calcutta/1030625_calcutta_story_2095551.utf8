Spandan Art Gallery, in association with The Oberoi Grand, hosts an exhibition of paintings by eminent artists, highlighting the essence of women in expressive moods, colours and styles. Showcasing works by Suhas Roy, Subroto Gangopadhyay, Sanatan Dinda, Partho Bhattacharjee, Avijit Dutta, Rohita Bhaskaran, Subro Chakravorty, Rabin Kumar Mondal and Devasish Das, the paintings capture the true essence of women. Beautiful, mysterious, haunting and wonderfully alive, these women form part of a very distinctly strong narrative. The artists have attempted to evoke the eternal magic and mysticism that surround women. The paintings depict various shades of alternating emotions  sorrow and joy, agony and peace, hope and despair  and, most importantly, a womans engaging search for an identity as envisaged by the creators in their canvases. 																								When: Today at 7.30 pm																								Where: The Oberoi Grand Tea Lounge

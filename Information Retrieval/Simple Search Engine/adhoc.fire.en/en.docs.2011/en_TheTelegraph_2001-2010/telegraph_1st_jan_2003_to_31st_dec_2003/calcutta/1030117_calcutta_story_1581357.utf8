				 																																										lAfter introducing a code of conduct for teachers of state-aided colleges, the state government for the first time has promulgated an order, making it mandatory for teachers of colleges controlled directly by the government to sign attendance registers on a regular basis. In the proposed registers, teachers will not just be required to note down the time of their arrival and departure, but will also have to mention the number of classes taken by them.

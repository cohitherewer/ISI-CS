The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, May 23, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	I was in a private bus on route 215A when it started pouring.  All the passengers got drenched, as few windows had shutters.  Moreover, the roof of the vehicle was partly damaged and  water trickled in through the leaks. When some passengers  protested, the conductor promptly retorted that nothing  could be done with the meagre earnings from bus fares. While  hiking bus fares, the government should keep in mind that  we are deprived of even the basic amenities.

	Last week, I found several open manholes missing in the  Calcutta Medical College and Hospital compound. The lids  are missing but no one has bothered to report this to the  authorities. If the holes are not covered immediately, a  mishap is not far away. Moreover, food stalls clog the main  entrance to emergency gate no. 2.

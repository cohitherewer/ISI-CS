Gupta, deputy commissioner of police, port, said residents of the area spotted the body lying under Majherhat bridge and informed the local police. The murder seems to be a professional job. There were three deep gashes on her head and body and strangulation marks on the neck, he added.Preliminary investigation revealed that the assailants had dumped the body under the bridge after killing her somewhere else. Around 7 am, passersby noticed the body lying on the bank with the face dug deep into the mud. Apparently, the body was thrown from atop the bridge, said an official of Taratala police station. The woman was married and seemed to have hailed from a middle class family. There is a high chance that the killers had first raped and then murdered her, he added.Investigators said the bruises on the victims hands indicate that she had tried to resist the killers. We are trying to trace whether any missing complaint has been lodged in police stations in and around the city, an official added.- Scholarship test: The Anandabazar Patrika-GNIIT Scholarship examination for 2003 will be held on Sunday at St Xaviers College in Calcutta and NIIT centres  Copyright

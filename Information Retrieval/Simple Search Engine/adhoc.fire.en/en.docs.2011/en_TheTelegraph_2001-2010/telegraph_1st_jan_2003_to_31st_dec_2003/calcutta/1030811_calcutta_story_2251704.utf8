 Monday, August 11, 2003 				 Mishap sets off rampage
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Violence rocked the Mominpur crossing, in the Ekbalpore police station area, on Sunday morning when angry residents pelted stones at four private buses and put up a roadblock. 																								The cause: a young man being knocked down by a private bus. The youth died in the evening at SSKM Hospital.																								The mob went on the rampage after spotting the youth lying on the road. They damaged four buses parked along the roadside, though the offending vehicle had managed to flee. 																								Finally, they put up a roadblock at the intersection for over an hour and a half, demanding immediate posting of an officer from the traffic department at the accident site.																								Trouble started around 11 am when a private bus, on route 12C, knocked down the youth, identified as Sanjoy Roy. The young man was crossing the intersection of Diamond Harbour Road and Ekbalpore Road. 																								The driver slammed the brakes but the vehicle hit Roy, who was seriously injured. Some bystanders rushed him to SSKM Hospital. The driver of the bus managed to flee with his vehicle.																								As news of the accident spread, hundreds of local people rushed to the spot. Some of them turned violent and started ransacking four parked vehicles. Their windscreens were smashed in the stone-throwing.																								The passengers of other buses panicked and started fleeing. Initially, there was no one around to resist the mob. The passengers took refuge in shops in the neighbourhood. 																								Some local people then decided to set the buses on fire. They tried to break open the fuel tanks. But soon, policemen from Ekbalpore thana arrived and dispersed the mob.																								The demonstrators lifted their roadblock at around 12.45 pm, when senior police officers assured them of taking necessary measures against the recurrence of accidents. However, no one has been arrested so far for causing disturbance in the area. 																								A police picket has been posted. Police claimed they had identified some locals involved in damaging the vehicles. 																								In another accident in the Kidderpore area, an unidentified man received serious injuries when a lorry knocked him down near Gate No. 4, in the dock. The driver of the lorry lost control of his vehicle and hit a wall. The injured man, who was walking along the road, was trapped between the vehicle and the wall. 																								He was admitted to SSKM Hospital, where he has been kept under observation. Police arrested the driver and impounded the vehicle.

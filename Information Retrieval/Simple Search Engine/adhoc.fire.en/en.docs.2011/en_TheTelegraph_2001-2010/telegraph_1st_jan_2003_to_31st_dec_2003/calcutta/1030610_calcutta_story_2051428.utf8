 Tuesday, June 10, 2003 				 Collective blame cry in SSKM corridors 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Political parties and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday launched an attack on the government for not taking any action against post-graduate trainees of SSKM Hospital on the basis of the first inquiry report into the death of budding cricketer Rajnis Patel.																								After a series of protests by family members and relatives in the past few days, it was the turn of political parties to throw their weight. On Monday, a huge mob  all Trinamul Congress supporters  demonstrated in front of the office of surgeon superintendent Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay. They demanded immediate cancellation of the registration of the doctors who had treated Rajnis at the orthopaedics ward of the hospital since February.																								The protesters, after shouting slogans at doctors in the hospital, finally met the surgeon superintendent, demanding to be told why the post-graduate trainees and other doctors were not taken to task for the death due to negligence. I told them I do not have the powers to cancel the registration of a doctor. It can only be done by the competent authorities, like the state medical council, Chattopadhyay said. After arguing for some time, the protesters left in a huff. 																								 The city branch of the IMA, at a meeting convened during the day, unanimously came out in support of Dilip Majumdar, the orthopaedic surgeon who was in charge of Rajnis and has been suspended on charges of dereliction of duties.																								It was extremely unfair on the part of the government to suspend Majumdar on the basis of a one-page report and to let the others go. Everybody is equally responsible and it (the government) should have waited for the final report before jumping to conclusions. What about the post-graduate trainees in the orthopaedic ward who did treat Rajnis, but have got away scot-free? asked joint secretary (headquarters) of the IMA and the city branch secretary R.D. Dubey.

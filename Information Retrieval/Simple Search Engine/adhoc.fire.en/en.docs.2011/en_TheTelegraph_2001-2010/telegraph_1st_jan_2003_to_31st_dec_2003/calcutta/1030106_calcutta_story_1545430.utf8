				 																																									Strand Road, a vital route connecting the city with Howrah, is always under repair. Its a matter of concern that tar is being used even on the concrete road, which is in good shape. One fails to understand why the civic body is so careless about maintenance of roads. 				 																																									Sumant Poddar,				 																																									Kyd Street.				 																																									The rate structure for phone calls made from PCOs is not uniform. In some areas, the booths charge Rs 1.25 or Rs 1.50, while quite a few of them also demand Rs 2. The BSNL is coming up with a fresh mobile network soon, then why cant the authorities rectify the anomalies in the PCO system? 				 																																									T.R. Anand,				 																																									Budge Budge.

	It is very difficult for common people to gain entry to  Raj Bhavan to visit the premises. The colossal white building  with its arched portals and invaluable collection of art  fascinates people who are curious to know more about this  historical place. A walk around the manicured green lawns  and the water bodies is something many will cherish. The  government should consider the feasibility of allowing visitors  on the premises at least once a week for a fee.

	Pipes of varying diameters made of cast iron, galvanised  tin and cement, are used for supplying water across the  city. More than 60 per cent of these are corroded from inside  and unfit for supplying drinking water. For instance, a  pipe off BT Road is more than 50 years old and needs to  be replaced. For the sake of public health, the civic authorities  must immediately replace broken, rusty and worn out pipes. 
	Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum.

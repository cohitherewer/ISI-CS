 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Leaders lay siege, burns victim dies
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								A few politicians denied Gauranga Pal  charred beyond recognition at the Ashoknagar State General Hospital  the chance of being treated at a bigger hospital, as they advised doctors on what to do next with the burns victim. And then, when it was all over for Pal, they got busy probing the cause of his death by burns, in the hospital.																								From Trinamul Congress activists entering the campus and then refusing to let Pal  who had suffered 40 per cent burns and later died  leave for another hospital to a CPM legislator descending there to counter the Opposition protests, the Habra hospital saw it all in less than a days work, said superintendent Pushpendu Sengupta.																								It was, ironically, another patient who led the politicians to the hospital. Raktim Ghosh, a Trinamul activist admitted with breathing trouble, called up his band of followers from a cellphone, who promptly showed up to demand that Pal be treated there itself, as he was not in a position to be shifted.																								These men entered the hospital around 3 am and did not leave till daybreak, by when they had ensured that Gauranga would stay  and die  at Ashoknagar. When he did succumb to his burns, around 7.30 am, they were not around, but as news of the death spread, they were back to lay siege on the hospital.																								Trinamul MP from Barasat Ranjit Panja and party MLA from Habra Tapati Datta later led a demonstration in front of the hospital. Their main demand  the resignation of health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra.																								It was then that CPM legislator from Ashoknagar Sharmistha Datta decided to step in, to see what the Trinamul people were up to. The slogans and counter-slogans reached a crescendo around 9.30 am, when hospital superintendent Sengupta came out and took Panja  himself a doctor  inside.																								Panja left soon after, the Habra MLA in tow. But Trinamul supporters then entered the hospital to probe what could have led to the killer blaze. We saw some loose wires near Pals bed and that could have caused a short-circuit, observed youth leader Sanjay Rauth.																								The Trinamul crowd followed Pals family to Barasat, where the body was taken for post-mortem in the afternoon. Another round of demonstrations ended with the decision to hold a 12-hour bandh in the Ashoknagar-Habra belt on Wednesday.

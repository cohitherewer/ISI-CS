 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Wall cave-in claims labourer
 																											- Two trapped under debris of old house being demolished OUR CORRESPONDENT																								A labourer was killed and another man was seriously injured when the wall of a building, more than 70 years old, collapsed early on Tuesday at 52, Madhusudan Biswas Lane, in central Howrah. The injured labourer was admitted to Howrah General Hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical. 																								The men were digging the plinth of the building for a new construction when the groundfloor wall collapsed on them, said Amiya Das, who was passing by after his morning walk.																								On hearing groans, I inspected the heap of bricks and noticed a body under the pile of debris, he said. Subsequently, some others returning from their constitutionals discovered the two bodies after removing the debris. They informed the owner of the house, Gitarani Das, and Howrah police station.																								Das, who lives in the rear section of her old house, said she could not afford to maintain her house and had signed an agreement with a promoter, Satyendra Singh of Salkia, for the construction of a highrise there. 																								Police said Singh had reportedly started the building project in the middle of this year. But he seemed to be in a hurry to complete it, without bothering to take adequate precautions.																								Local people said the demolition had started two months ago but the contractor tried to finish it in a slap-dash fashion. 																								A police officer said: An old building requires a certain timespan to be demolished and it is not safe to tackle the old and worn-out concrete parts very hurriedly. They should have taken more time to do it. 																								The dead man was identified as Pancham Paswan, 30. The injured is Jaladhar Paswan, 35. Both were rushed to Howrah General Hospital, where Jaladhar was pronounced dead.																								The police have started investigating the case and they stress that the labourers should have taken adequate precautionary measures before digging out the base of the 10-ft wall below basement level. 																								This might have caused the 10-ft high and five-inch broad wall to collapse and cause the death, said a police officer. No one has been arrested.

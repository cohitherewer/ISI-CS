 																											- Qualifications of new peons, clerks daunt CU officers  A STAFF REPORTER																								Meet these peons and clerks working for Calcutta University (CU), qualified enough to teach college and more. 																								Nabyendu Basak, 28, is a masters degree-holder in commerce from CU and was a part-time college teacher. Present occupation? Peon in CUs Central Library. His colleagues, most of whom have studied only up to Class VIII, feel he is grossly over-qualified for his job.																								Sonali Chakraborty, who passed out of Visva-Bharati Patha Bhavan, proceeded to do her B.Ed and majored in economics from Santiniketan a few years ago. Present occupation? Lower-division clerk in CUs establishment section, a job for which the requisite qualification is a Higher Secondary pass certificate.																								Sumit Basu is 26, a graduate in pure science. Present occupation? Peon in the office of CUs registrar. Officials say Sumits knowledge of computers often comes in handy while working on departmental machines.																								The trio represents nearly 300 high-performing and academically-sound peons, apart from Class IV employees and lower-division clerks, that CU recruited nearly three months ago. There are lower-division clerks who are diploma engineers. 																								According to registrar Ujjal Basu, also head of CUs recruitment department, more than 80 per cent of the 56 Group-D staff and the 134 lower-division clerks are graduates and post-graduates. Some of these newly-appointed peons carry cellphones and speak fluent English.																								Officers in different departments of the university find it difficult to order around these new recruits, for many of them are more qualified than they are.																								It is extremely embarrassing to ask such highly-qualified peons to carry a file from one department to another, or to go and fetch tea from the canteen. For example, Nabyendu. If we are to respect our own education system, we cannot order qualified people like him to bring a glass of water or to re-arrange books on a shelf, said Dilip Dutta, an officer in the Central Library.																								To avoid ordering these new recruits, many officers are themselves doing the jobs that these peons get paid to do.																								This will soon cease to be a problem. The officers will slowly adjust to the situation, said registrar Basu. 																								Nabyendu, Sonali and many other new recruits like them have reason enough to decide to work in posts meant for less-qualified candidates. One of the reasons is the crisis of good and secure jobs in the market. They have all joined permanent posts. The other reason is that they are left with little option but to join the posts.																								Parthasarathi Choudhury, a senior officer and leader of the universitys CPM-controlled employees union, says on an average, those recruited as peons are paid approximately Rs 3,500 per month and those in the clerks posts Rs 6,000. But chances of an exodus cannot be ruled out. Some of these highly-qualified employees have already left and joined big companies outside Bengal, he said.

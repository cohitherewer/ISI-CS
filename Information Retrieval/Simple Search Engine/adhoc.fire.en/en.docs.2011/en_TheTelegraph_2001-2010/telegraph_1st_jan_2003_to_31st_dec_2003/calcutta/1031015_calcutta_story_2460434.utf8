The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, October 15, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	Metro Railways did a commendable job during the Pujas,  ferrying thousands of pandal-hoppers at unearthly hours.  But the leaflets distributed to commuters from the ticket  counters contained wrong information on the routes. For  instance, it was mentioned that one had to get off at Netaji  Bhavan station to visit the Maddox Square and Mukta Dal  pujas. This was slightly misleading, as Jatin Das Park is  the station nearest to both pandals and more convenient.  The mistakes are in fact a repetition of last years. Commuters  will benefit if the guide is revised for the next festive  season.

	A moderate shower is enough to inundate Thanthania, a low-lying  area in north Calcutta. Last week, the civic authorities,  for some unknown reason, made an unusual delay in opening  the manholes of the area when heavy rains lashed the city.  This resulted in a sharp rise in the water-level and residents  were forced to stay indoors.

 A poster of the latest screen adaptation  of Shakespeares tragic romance, starring Leonardo di  Caprio and Claire Danes Young Metro readers argue for  the timeless appeal of the Bard in the Time to Talk debate  over Is reading Shakespeare pass for school students or  is he still a must-read? But there is also a call for more  lights, camera and action.				 				 																															Art is an imitation of reality.  Nobody portrayed this better than Shakespeare. Humanity  at large still identifies with his writings. He has given  us the entire range of human feelings. Universal truths  of life need early understanding and reading of Shakespeare  does that for us. Maybe for students of today, Shakespeare  is only a part of the English syllabus, but he uncovers  life with its faults and makes us aware of all its sound  and fury. We have to think twice before doing away with  somebody as great as William Shakespeare. Pravati Maulik Gupta,
 IIIrd year, English,
 Shri Shikshayatan College. Reading Shakespeare can never  become pass. He is undoubtedly the greatest creative mind  in the realm of literature. His greatness lies in his ability  to take old stories and retell them in his own inimitable  manner. No other writer has been able to map human emotions  as accurately as Shakespeare did, and the fact that each  generation rediscovers new vistas in his works proves the  immortality of his legacy. Through his works, we get rare  insights into how people are shaped by fundamental emotions.  Today, we live in a world torn apart by strife and turmoil  and yet, we are given the promise of a perfect tomorrow.  There is a void in us that Shakespeare seeks to fill with  compassion, by stating that we are all part of a human drama.  He explored ordinary impulses and described human nature  as it was, as it is and as it always will be. In doing so,  he has put himself far beyond the reach of time.				 				 																															Priyanka Aich Shakespeare has been canonised  in the middle and senior school English syllabi. Students  have been compelled to read the time-honoured works of the  Bard, willy-nilly. The deterrents to a simply textual appreciation  are many: the language is Elizabethan English, with words  having different meanings, and the sentences being convoluted.  A unique product of a special age in history, the plays  are largely incomprehensible, and thus unexciting, in the  modern perspective, unless the students are guided by the  audio-visual medium. Frequent staging of the plays would  help in generating interest. It is more appealing to the  average school student to witness the histrionics of Laurence  Olivier as Othello than to merely go through printed pages.				 				 																															Trinanjan Dutt Is it time to ban the Bard? It  is pointless to deny that in todays tech world, Leonardo  di Caprio is easier to identify with than Shakespeares  Romeo. But the abolition of Shakespeare would leave a gaping  hole films cannot fill. It is unfair to pressurise students  by forcing large volumes of Shakespeare on them. But if  future authors work to make their grounding strong, will  it be too much to keep Macbeth and the rest side  by side with Jhumpa Lahiri? The Bard, it seems, must go.  English literature, like Nietszches God, the dodo, Queen  Anne and mutton, is dead. This is a brave new worldand  a Shakespearean quotation is as meaningless as ancient Greek  to pupils of the future. Let us not go to extremes of pass  or must-read. What about something in between?

Horlicks Activity 2003, the seventh edition of Indias most prestigious inter-school festival, showcased the talents of students from Classes I to XII.				 				 																															Held in Calcutta for the first time, DBPC was buzzing with students from about 30 schools as the fest, comprising about 40 events on and offstage, was formally kicked off. The first day witnessed rounds on debate and quiz, where Mahadevi Birla Girls High School and St Augustines School came out on top. They will represent Calcutta at the national finals in Bangalore. Short play, fusion dance, Indian film hits, calligraphy and cartooning were also held.				 				 																															On Day Two, the competition intensified, as students fought it out in categories like fashion show, elocution, poetry-writing and cooking. But the major events of the day were Mr and Mrs Horlicks and antakshari. In the latter, Frank Anthony Public School was the champion which will represent Calcutta at the national finals.				 				 																															For the Mr and Mrs Horlicks crowns, 10 boys and 10 girls were selected from 70 students through written prelims and group discussions. Five boys and five girls went on to the finals.

	 Verbal volley				 				 																															The best college-student debaters of leading city institutions will square off at the end of September, to thrash out the pros and cons of Legalisation of prostitution. The debate is being organised by the Youth Volunteer Action Division of CRY (Child Relief and You). 				 				 																															The concept of the debate was mooted during a consultation among the volunteers and CRY personnel. 				 				 																															The aim of this inter-college event is to reach out to the students and sensitise them about the issue. It is also a platform for socially aware youth to voice their opinions.				 				 																															Jadavpur University, Presidency College and St Xaviers College have confirmed their participation, while many others are in contention to fill the final slot. The last leg of the preparation is on, as the volunteers put up posters at various institutions, and the CRY team decides on a venue and date. A panel of judges has also been finalised.				 				 																															The debaters are busy honing their pugnacious word skills and researching the issue. For them, its more than a competition. It is a chance to address a serious social issue. Samya Seth, representing JU, explains: While there are more basic issues of import in todays world, sex is a driving force for humanity. In this regard, prostitution is a problem affecting society at large. The topic has made me think, and I am glad that I now have a platform to air my views on the subject.				 				 																															So, one hopes that the audience will be equally enlightened through this brainstorming debate on the burning topic. Aritro Ganguly,
 Jadavpur University

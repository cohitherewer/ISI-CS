Picture by Pabitra Das																								Two concepts, one new and the other bigger and better, promise to make this a Durga puja with a difference																								ITs mahasashthi, and Durga puja 2003 is upon us. This year, a new concept has been introduced, keeping in mind all things that are supposed to count in a celebration of this magnitude. The CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja, supported by People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC), has seen 79 puja committees enrol for this unique assessment, which prioritises safety, not big budgets, sensitivity, not sensation.																								The honour roll will be announced on Ashtami evening. This will include a True Spirit Model Puja, followed by five, four, three and two-star pujas. The chosen committees are to present their plans for a social project, against which they will receive grants between Rs 2,500 and Rs 25,000 for the execution of the project. The True Spirit Model Puja is eligible for up to Rs 50,000.																								The judges, including representatives from The Telegraph, CESC, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and PUBLIC, will choose the most commendable efforts by examining a number of criteria, mainly in relation to safety, security, public facilities and restoration plans.

All these pujas will be visited by an assessment panel before the final announcement. Being the first year, many of the criteria have been relaxed. But some things, including adherence to electricity norms, first-aid and fire-fighting preparedness are some of the essential yardsticks.																								Watch this space for updates All for one																								Remember what it used be like at the para pujas? No elaborate pandals or themes, just simple devotion to the Devi through prayer and plain good fun with family and friends. That is what The Telegraph ING Vyasa Hand-in-Hand community puja programme, in association with Sony Entertainment Television, is all about  promoting the Pujas in housing complexes through community camaraderie.																								The list of community pujas geographically encompasses Calcutta, from north to south, east to west. In the south, theres Golf Green Phase I and Golf Green Phase III, IV, VII, along with Golf Garden Natun Pally on Prince Ghulam Md Shah Road. Theres Regent Estate, ODRC Rental in Behala, Swaranika at Shakuntala Park, Sikhar Bindu in Brahmapur, Green View on Southern Avenue and Bank Garden in Bansdroni.																								In the north of the city, theres Prasad Nagar on BT Road, Peerless Nagar in Panihati and Vinayak on KC Ghosh Road, Malancha in Baranagar, Motijhil Housing in Dum Dum, Anandam on Mall Road and CIT Singhibagan in Madan Chatterjee Lane.																								In Salt Lake, theres Karunamoyee G Block and Anushakti Abasan in Bidhannagar, as well as Karunamoyee A, B, C and D, Purbachal Sarbojanin and Labony.																								Anupama and Gitanjali, as well as Minakshi and Dakshinayan, are on VIP Road. In Patuli, theres Happy Nook and Abhudaya, along with Purbayan on Purbachal Main Road, Udayan in Survey Park and BP Township in Baishnabghata.																								Up to 30 from last years 15, the residential complexes are all in a mood of celebration through some friendly competition. There are six contests that the complexes will hold over six days, with some beginning on Panchami and others continuing till Dashami. Sit-and-draw is just for the kids, and will be held primarily during the day. Sera Uttor, on the other hand, is only for the ladies. This event involves some tricky questions that dont have any right answers, just good answers.																								However, conch-blowing and diya-lighting, traditionally both female bastions, is open to anyone who can blow the longest and light the maximum number of diyas in the minimum amount of time. The spot quiz is open to all who would like to test their knowledge of the city and the Pujas, and Antakshari is for those who know songs at their fingertips. Not being able to hold a tune is no bar, although it is a perfect opportunity to show off singing skills.																								Although the fun is in taking part and not winning, those who do manage to make a mark on the judges, themselves residents of the respective complexes, will be given prizes by Nestle for their efforts. For those families who have been at the forefront with wholehearted and enthusiastic participation in the programmes, there will be a Family of the Puja award. And for that one special person who knows it all and is omnipresent, theres the Personality of the Puja to say thank you.

	Zebra crossings have got erased from some vital stretches  like Old Court House Street, Council House Street, Govt.  Place East and the Bowbazar-CR Avenue intersection. At some  places, the pavements leading to the zebra crossings have  been fenced. So, pedestrians are almost forced to walk on  the busy carriageway, along with speeding vehicles. The  authorities must apply a fresh coat of paint at the crossings  and amend the other faults before slapping a fine on jaywalkers. 
	 Debaprasad Mukherjee, Nayapatty Road.  
	I often find private buses and minibuses blowing horns  in front of hospitals. Though it is a punishable offence,  no action is ever taken against the culprits. 
	 Prasenjit Guha Thakurta, Rashbehari Avenue.  
	Most bus stand sheds across the city have been encroached  upon by beggars. The structure at the Raj Bhavan stop requires  immediate repairs. 
	 Chandan Ray, Sarsuna.

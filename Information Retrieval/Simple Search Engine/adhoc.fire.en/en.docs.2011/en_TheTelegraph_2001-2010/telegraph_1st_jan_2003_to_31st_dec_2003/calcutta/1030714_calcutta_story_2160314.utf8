The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
 Maternity home dons warehouse apron
 The maternity hospital that never opened at Narkeldanga. Pictures by Kishor Roy Chowdhury Mohd Amiruzzaman: A highrise was constructed on Canal East Road by the CMC to house a maternity hospital. Twenty years have passed but the hospital did not materialise. The building is used by vendors as a godown for vegetables and livestock.The CMC should have taken care of that long ago. Thank you for bringing this to my notice. I shall talk to the mayoral council member in charge of health. I assure you the hospital will start functioning as early as possible.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The Complete Works of Shakespeare
  Theatre lovers, comedy fans and all those looking for a hilariously intelligent evening are in for a rare treat. Hutch, in association with The Telegraph, hosts a rollicking roller-coaster of a comedy through The Complete Works of Shakespeare (Abridged). Originally written and performed by the Reduced Shakespeare Company, the action-packed play features all of the Bards 37 plays (plus 14 sonnets) in 97 minutes. Performed by a troupe of brilliant actors including Ezra Bix, Berynn Schwerdt and Tim Schwerdt, the play begins with these madcap men in tights combining Shakespearean prowess and brilliant comic improvisations as they weave their wicked way through all of the Bards comedies, histories and tragedies. Hamlet is performed forwards, backwards and sideways. Titus Andronicus offers tasty treats and Othello does the rap. This incomparable assault on the ramparts of Stratford-on-Avon leaves the audience in splits. As a primer for Shakespearean dunces or a refresher course for those whove read them all, this comedy is a must-see for all.When: February 19 - 23; 7.30 pm (an additional show at 3 pm on February 23) Where:  Copyright

	Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) workers had dredged  some underground sewers in a busy lane connecting NSC Bose  Road and Raja SC Mullick Road in Garia. The refuse was dumped  near a gully pit and even after four months, the heap of  trash is yet to be removed. The garbage is blocking vehicle  and pedestrian movement.  
	N. Dhar, NSC Bose Road.  
	Mother Dairy booths usually provide fresh packets of milk  to consumers if the ones issued initially are found curdled.  But recently, I found that the booth-owner in the AE-Market  area takes back the spoilt packs but refuses to issue fresh  ones.  
	Subhamoy Ghosh, Salt Lake.

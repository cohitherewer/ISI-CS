				 																																									A few years ago, a second underpass was built at the Ultadanga station, hoping that it would ease traffic problems at the crossing. But it has only worsened the situation. Auto-rickshaws take a U-turn in front of the underpass and private buses to Salt Lake slow down to pick up passengers of local trains. So, vehicles take a long time to cross this zone. Traffic police are mute spectators.

It has been in a shambles since the past six months.				 																																									B.L. Chandak,				 																																									Salkia.

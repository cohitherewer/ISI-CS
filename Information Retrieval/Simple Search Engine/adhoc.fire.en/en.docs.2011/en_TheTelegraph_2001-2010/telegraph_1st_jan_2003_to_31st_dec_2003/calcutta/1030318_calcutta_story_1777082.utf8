The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 Arms dealer in sleuth custody
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Detectives of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday arrested Manirul Islam, leader of a gang selling arms and ammunition to city criminals. The CID claimed Islams gang was one of the biggest, with a wide network in the citys underworld. He had been conducting business here for a long time, but was never arrested earlier.																								Special superintendent of police (CID) Manoj Malaviya said Islam had fled the city after his sleuths cracked down on illegal arms sales in February. A major haul of firearms and ammunition had been recovered from various pockets in the city. Islam is the man who supervises the shipment of arms and ammunition from Bihar and also from across the border to Calcutta, said special superintendent Malaviya.																								A CID team, led by deputy superintendent Tanmay Roy Choudhury, followed Islam to his hideout in Suti, in Murshidabad, and rounded him up on Monday morning. He is being brought to Calcutta for interrogation, Malaviya said. Investigations revealed that Islam and his associates had sold arms to gangsters like Gabbar, Naushad, Sona and Gudda. All four are now in jail.																								During the course of investigations, Islam told the cops he bought the arms in Bihar and also Bangladesh. Sources in the CID said Islam had divulged details of his Bangladeshi contacts and how he would smuggle the arms with the help of local villagers.																								Detectives will interrogate Islam this week for more details of his city contacts. The CID will coordinate investigations with the city police to net the rest of the gang, said additional director-general (CID) S.I.S. Ahmed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, February 24, 2003 				 One and all for alma mater
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Father Andre Bruylants receives the Alsoc Award for 2003 at a function on the St Xaviers Collegiate School grounds on Saturday. A Telegraph picture																								It was an ode on the hallowed ground of hallowed memory. After 25 years of service, the old boys of St Xaviers Collegiate School  or the Alumnorum Societas (Alsoc)  were back to formally announce their future plans for their alma mater.																								At Saturdays annual dinner, named Silver this year to commemorate Alsocs 25th year, the alumni also recognised over 50 years of service of Father Andre Bruylants, who came to India in 1949. I am deeply honoured and deeply grateful, said Father Bruylants, receiving the Alsoc Award for 2003, on the senior school grounds.																								Things have altered and do go on changing. I wish you all the best for another 25 years, smiled the veteran educator, who was also the force behind one of Alsocs main social projects Titli, a school for around 150 under-privileged boys of the area.																								A book on Father Camille Bouche, the legendary teacher who died last year, was also released by Father Boris DSantos.																								The reunion  led by ex-student and professor of Xaviers N. Vishwanathan, and Noomi Mehta, honorary general secretary of Alsoc  visited the schools past as well as the future. A film on the school and alumni associations history was screened, tracing the growth of service projects like Titli and a weekly free clinic, financed and run by Xaverians. It also recorded the passing of history, much of which has been lost through time. For instance, Rabindranath Tagore, an ex-student of the Park Street school, initiating a short-lived alumni association is a little-known fact.																								An interactive CD titled Taal (The Alsoc Alumni Library), unveiled the future plans of Alsoc for the school, including a centre for sporting excellence, a revamp of the libraries, labs, bathrooms and staff rooms. It is our duty to continue to improve our alma mater, said ex-student, now benefactor, B.M. Khaitan, chief guest for the night. Noomi Mehta urged Xaverians to join the army of Alsoc to better serve the school and community.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, April 07, 2003 				 Lessons off the liquor shop
				 	 BASUDEB BAG, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, met residents of the district at Doltala police headquarters last week to answer their queries. Participants included Raju Das, Basudeb Chowdhury, Kallol Dasgupta, Tanmoy Mondal, Angshuman Maity, Arabinda Das, Subhasis Chakraborty, Madhavi Ghosh, Benoy Mukherjee, Sudipta Bhattacharjee, Sabita Biswas, Srijit Biswas and Diptimoy Ghosh				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Arabinda Das: I am the local councillor of Madhyamgram. In my area, a liquor shop has been opened close to some schools. Isnt that illegal?																																																			This has been brought to my notice. Actually, the excise department issues a licence for a liquor shop after visiting the spot where it is to be located. There are two to three schools close to the shop. Residents demonstrated when the shop was opened. I have informed the district magistrate of the incident. He will soon convene a meeting to sort out the problem.																																																									

Raju Das: The sale of drugs has increased. How can cases be reported without the disclosure of ones name?																																																			A report can be filed with the local police on a sheet of paper without disclosing the name. Even if the name is written, it is kept secret.																																																									

Sabita Biswas: Though Lake Town police station has drug rehabilitation centres, there are often drug-related law-and-order problems and some suspicious people lurk in the area.																																																			Repeated raids were conducted at Dakshindari and adjacent spots to check this menace. However, more vigilance is necessary and we are trying to increase our force in Lake Town.																																																									

Angshuman Maity: I am a resident of Barrackpore. Here, the drugs menace is rampant, especially near Baroda bridge. 																																																			Sale and use of drugs needs to be checked. We will take action with a firm hand. I shall ask the local police station to put an end to this menace at any cost.																																																									

Raju Das: A person known to me runs a video parlour in Habra. Excise officials drop by often to collect money. How can he stop this menace?																																																			Your friend can lodge a complaint with the excise commissioner or superintendent of police. Also, he can move the vigilance department against the officers coercing him.																																																									

Raju Das: Those building new houses in Salt Lake are facing a peculiar problem. Some youths force them to buy building materials from them, which is obviously of inferior quality. 																																																			If anyone faces any trouble with the so-called suppliers, he should report the matter at once to the local police station or, if necessary, the additional superintendent of police.																																																									

Subhasis Chakraborty: I live in Salt Lake. Here, several new apartment blocks are coming up, and the labourers stay till late at night, creating a menace for other residents.																																																			We often launch a drive to clear up this mess. But then, these people pretend they are durwans of the building or the contractors men. If we get specific complaints, it becomes easier for us to take action.																																																									

Benoy Mukherjee: Recenly, I was in a spot of trouble while driving along Kestopur. I tried to lodge a complaint with the local police station, but officials there advised me to contact the traffic guard. I tried, but without success. In such a situation, what does one do?																																																			Complaints over traffic should be made to the traffic police, as they are authorised to deal with it. The higher authorities, too, can be moved.																																																									

Sudipta Bhattacharjee: Traffic lights installed along BT Road are mostly inoperative, and so, snarls are common.																																																			Several new traffic signals in modern format have been installed to control traffic at different spots. Some of them may be out of order. We will see to it that they are repaired at the earliest. We take special care of the route to the airport, which is used by dignitaries both national and international. 																																																									

Srijit Biswas: Auto-rickshaws near Dum Dum station create too many problems. A crackdown tames them for only a couple of days, after which they return to original form. Is there any permanent solution to this?																																																			We had received complaints and taken steps earlier. I shall request everybody to report to the local police station or, if necessary, the higher authorities, so that this auto menace can be checked firmly.

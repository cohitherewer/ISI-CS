The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, May 19, 2003 					 					 It's Your Birthday So... You are sharp, definite and  enterprising, with a firm sense of identity. You will fight  to the end to uphold your beliefs. Your fiery temper may  cost you some battles. People may look up to you for leadership.  In spite of your strong will, you seek approval, particularly  from peers. Not a good time to splurge.  Kusum Bhandari

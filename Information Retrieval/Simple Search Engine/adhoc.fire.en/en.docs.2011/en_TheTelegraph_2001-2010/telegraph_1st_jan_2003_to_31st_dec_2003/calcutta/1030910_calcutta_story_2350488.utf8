																																																		Eight shops were completely destroyed when a fire broke out in the early hours of Tuesday on Belgachhia Road in the Cossipore police station area. It took more than two hours and four fire tenders to douse the flames. Kuldiep Singh, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, said the fire started from a short-circuit in one of the shops at around 4.30 am and then spread to the neighbouring shops. No casualties were reported but it could have been dangerous if the fire spread to the adjacent slum that houses thousands, Singh said. The loss could be well over Rs 3 lakh according to preliminary investigation, said Bibhash Guha, divisional officer of the fire department. According to shop-owners, the loss will amount to more than Rs 4 lakh as they had stored a huge amount of merchandise before the Pujas.

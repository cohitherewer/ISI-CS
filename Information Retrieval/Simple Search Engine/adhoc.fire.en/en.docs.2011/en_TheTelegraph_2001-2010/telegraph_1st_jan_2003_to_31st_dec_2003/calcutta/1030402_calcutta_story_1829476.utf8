				 																																									A  number of minibuses plying from various points in Howrah to  Esplanade take a roundabout route in the afternoons when the  buses are not filled to capacity. Most of them enter Esplanade  through Old Court House Street via the road beside KC Das  sweet shop and Rani Rashmoni Road and then, instead of proceeding  towards BBD Bag, the buses take a right turn towards the KC  Das shop again. I had boarded a Satyabala-Dharamtala minibus  one evening and was forced to travel along this route. I have  lodged a complaint with a sergeant.
 K. Asokan,
 Salkia. 				 																																									A  few days ago I had gone to a dog point run by Compassionate  Crusaders Trust near Science City and was very surprised to  find the place so clean and tidy. All the dogs had individual  cages with case files attached. Injections and other medicines  were kept on top of the cages, while caretakers were always  around to attend to them with food and water. The upkeep of  the animals is exemplary. 
 Helen Rodgers,
 Park Street.

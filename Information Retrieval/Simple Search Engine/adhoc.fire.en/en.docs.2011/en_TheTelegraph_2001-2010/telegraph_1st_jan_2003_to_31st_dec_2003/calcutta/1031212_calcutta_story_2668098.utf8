																								Art is a universal language of communication and can be used deftly and effectively to state ones convictions and beliefs. Mausumi Mutsuddi is a self-taught artist whose current series of paintings expresses her vision of earth. By a restrained illumination of the colours in a decorative way, she depicts the outward vibrancy and the inward stoicism of the vast barren and arid earth where the simplicity or naivety still dwells. In this series of work, I intended to search a pictorial imagery which would emit the essence of earth. It should radiate the simplicity, thrive with colour, but would roll up in introspection. I displayed the work without figure and picked up mainly the dots and lines as motifs which are universal for avoiding the apparent homology with folk or traditional arts. I chose the yellow and blue as the symbols of vitality and restraint, respectively, says Mutsuddi. She acknowledges her indebtedness to folk art and says, I was overwhelmed by the strength of folk art. Its line, usage of pure colour, unpredictable arrangement... the mystique of the composition.... The three inherent qualities of folk art  its symbolism, distortion and the potential of abstraction  can be traced in Mustsuddis works as well. 																								When: Till December 14: 11 am - 7 pm																								Where: Genesis Art Gallery 8B, Middleton Street (Geetanjali Apartments)

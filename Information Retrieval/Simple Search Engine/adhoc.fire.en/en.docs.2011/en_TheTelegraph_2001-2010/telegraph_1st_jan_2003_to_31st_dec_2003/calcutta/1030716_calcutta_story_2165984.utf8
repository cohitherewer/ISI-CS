The human experience is all about connecting and communicating. But there are times when even language fails to express those core feelings of ecstasy and agony, and then mans quest for newer expressions and newer language begins. This is the realm of the creative mind  the territory of an artist. An artist not only communicates through his works but also bridges a gap between his works and his viewers. Prachi-Protichee (East-West) 2003 is an exhibition of paintings hosted by International Young Artists Organisation, India. The organisation has been arranging fine arts-related cultural exchange programmes (exhibitions, art camps, workshops, seminars, etc.) with other countries to build up a strong artistic bond between our country and the outside world. The present exhibition showcases the works of five talented artists from Bangladesh and nine from India. The show provides an interesting window to the works of artists working in the cultural and geographical proximity shared by India and Bangladesh. The exhibition begins today.																								When: Till July 31; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery

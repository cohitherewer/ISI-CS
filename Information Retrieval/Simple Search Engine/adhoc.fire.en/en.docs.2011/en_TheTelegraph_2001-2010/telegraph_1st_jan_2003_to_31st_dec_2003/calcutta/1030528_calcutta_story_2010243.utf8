 Wednesday, May 28, 2003 				 Suicide by lover of jobless youth
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Lakshmi: Fatal silence. Picture by Amit Datta																								Lakshmi Singh, 22, died after consuming poison at her Girish Park (North) residence early on Tuesday, allegedly because she was being married off against her will. The news of her death took her neighbours by surprise. 																								Lakshmi, who had lost her parents, lived in a rented flat with her elder brother and grandmother. Her sister had married earlier. Lakshmi had been in love with a young man of the locality since her childhood. But her family was against the match, as her boyfriend was jobless.																								The boy, who lives with his parents, could not be traced after the incident. Aunt Meena Shah said Lakshmi was an introvert and it was very difficult to realise what was going on in her mind. 																								When we arranged her marriage with another boy, she had not opposed the match, aunt Meena said. The parents of the would-be-groom came to their house on Sunday and the marriage was settled. After dinner that evening, Lakshmi was sitting in the courtyard, as it was too hot. 																								Suddenly, she complained of feeling uneasy. A local doctor was called and he gave her an antacid. Lakshmi began to vomit, but as her condition deteriorated, she was taken to hospital, where she died early on Tuesday. 																								Local people said Lakshmi seemed to have been suffering from depression for some time and of late, she did not even meet her lover. 																								Earlier, they would go out quite frequently. She must have been very upset after her marriage was settled elsewhere, but she did not express it, they said. 																								Officer-in-charge of Girish Park police station D. Datta Barman said his men would interrogate the boy and his family members. We will talk to the boy to ascertain the facts. So far, we have come to know that the boy was unemployed. But he used to love her deeply and their affair had been going on for a long time, Datta Barman said. 																								Police will find out how Lakshmi got hold of the poison. They will also try to ascertain if her boyfriend had any role in instigating her to commit suicide.

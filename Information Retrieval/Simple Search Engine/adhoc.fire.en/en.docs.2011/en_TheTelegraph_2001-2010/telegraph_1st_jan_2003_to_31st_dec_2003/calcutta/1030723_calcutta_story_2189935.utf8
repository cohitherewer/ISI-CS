The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, July 23, 2003 				 Bangla band of robbers held
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Barely a week after the arrest on July 15 of Habibur Rehman, a Bangladeshi behind a rob-and-run gang operating in Calcutta, the city police busted another gang of Bangladeshi robbers, whose modus operandi was similar to that of Rehmans boys.																								The dacoity wing of the detective department arrested six Bangladeshis in various spots of central Calcutta a few days ago, when they were on their way to attempt another robbery. The kingpin, Abu Taher, 32, a resident of Gopalganj, in Bangladesh, was the first one to be picked up by the sleths, followed by Daud Mirdhah, 24, Kabir Hussein, 28, Zakir Hussein, 27, Nata Zakir Hussein, 25, and Badshah Mollah, 29. 																								Apart from Mollah, who held a ration card and had himself enlisted in the voters list of Howrah, the rest were from the Dulalpukur police station area of Khulna, in Bangladesh.																								In the last three or four months, a chain of robberies had taken place in Burrabazar, Posta and the surrounding areas. We were closely following the modus operandi of the gang and made a sudden breakthrough a few days ago. The arrests followed, said deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Soumen Mitra. 																								Badshah Mollah, besides actively taking part in the operations, was the link-man between his Bangladesh-based accomplices and the informers here. 																								Mollah would buy information from a few local goons, who had prior knowledge of the movement of merchandise and cash transactions in the Burrabazar area. He used to convey the message to his friends in Bangladesh over mobile phones and then decide on a time and venue for a meeting, either in Howrah or elsewhere in the city.																								The gang was very professional and used to plan its action well in advance. It also had very good networking with local criminals. After a robbery, its members would take different routes to Sealdah, where they would hand over the booty to an accomplice and then move on to Howrah. There, they would get back their loot. Then they crossed the border from the Benapole-Petrapole area, Mitra added.																								The detective department sleuths had arrested Bangladeshi Raju, a former member of the gang, in the North Port police station area a couple of months ago. Raju was involved in a number of dacoities and is facing trial in five cases. His elder brother, Sheikh Basu, is serving a life term in Presidency jail as a convict in a murder case in 1989, he said. The criminals have been remanded in police custody.

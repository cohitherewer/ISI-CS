																																																		A fresh controversy broke out at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital after college authorities directed the three interns, earlier suspended, to appear before an inquiry committee on Saturday morning in the micro-biology department. The three interns, Shubhajit Roy, Shubhankar Chatterjee and Biplab Chandra, on Friday decided not to appear before the committee, alleging that the college authorities had not yet informed them about the nature of the charges, a pre-requisite set by the high court, while hearing out their case, earlier this week. The interns, all members of the SUCI-controlled Democratic Socialist Organisation were suspended by the college authorities for allegedly assaulting relatives of patients and reporters on November 1. Protesting the decision, the three interns went to court and proved their point, after the government decided to revoke the suspension order slapped on them. Justice Indira Banerjee had said that the government was free to conduct an inquiry, but clarified that the college authorities would have to inform the interns about the charges in advance.																																																		A 32-year-old woman was, on Friday, sentenced to life imprisonment by a sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Barasat, on the northern fringes of the city, after she was found guilty of killing her husband by poisoning him in February 1999.

Hussein had even shown her photographs catching her in a compromising position with the youth. The same night, she laced her husbands food with poison. After a month, Husseins brother complained to the police, suspecting Manjus hand in her husbands death. Acting on the complaint, police arrested Manju for murdering her husband.

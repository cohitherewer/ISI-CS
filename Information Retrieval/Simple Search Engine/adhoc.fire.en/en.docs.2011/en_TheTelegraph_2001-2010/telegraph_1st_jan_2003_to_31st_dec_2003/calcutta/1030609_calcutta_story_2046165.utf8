																								Dance is a primitive form of expression. Since time immemorial, man has explored the entire gamut of emotions through dance. Chhau dance is part of our rich cultural heritage we have inherited from the sons of the soil, the Adivasis (the original inhabitants of the land). This vigorous yet intensely beautiful dance form was gradually dying due to apathy and lack of promotion. Restricted to the interiors of Bengal-Bihar-Orissa border areas, Chhau was once a popular dance form that was encouraged by the local rulers. But post-Independence, the picture changed. Of late, the government has taken initiative to revive this art form. We are also lucky to have teachers like Guru Shyama Charan Pati, the renowned choreographer whose area of specialisation is the Seraikela Chhau. Over the years, he has held numerous lecture-demonstrations to popularise Chhau and has tutored many aspiring dancers. Currently he is in town conducting a workshop. He will be performing along with his students on the June 12 after the workshop.																								When: Till June 11; 10 am - 5 pm																								Where: Aikatan, EZCC complex,																								 Salt Lake

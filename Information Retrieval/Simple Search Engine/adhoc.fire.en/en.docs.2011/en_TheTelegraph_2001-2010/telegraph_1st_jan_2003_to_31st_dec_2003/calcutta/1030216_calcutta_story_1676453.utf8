 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 Burglary at Lake Gardens
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Burglars raided a businessmans ground-floor flat in Lake Gardens early on Saturday and decamped with jewellery worth Rs 8 lakh. They also picked up a VCD player and Rs 15,000. Both the local police station and the detective departments burglary wing have initiated a probe.																								Pradip Sanyal, deputy commissioner (II), detective department, said the burglars first broke open the window of the Bhalotia house and cut the iron bars using a gas-cutter. They, then, entered the room and broke open three almirahs where the ornaments were locked, he added.																								Lalita Bhalotia said the thieves almost cleaned out her sons room. My son Suresh and his wife went to Haldia last night. We returned home around 9.30 from a marriage party and went to sleep around 1 am. The family woke up on Saturday and found Sureshs room locked from inside.																								According to Sanyal, the culprits had a specific tip-off that Suresh and his wife were not home. We think someone who knows the family played a key role, he added.

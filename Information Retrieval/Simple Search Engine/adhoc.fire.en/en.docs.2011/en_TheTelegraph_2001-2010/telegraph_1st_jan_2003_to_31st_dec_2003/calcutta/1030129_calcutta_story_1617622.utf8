				 																																										lPWD minister Amar Chowdhury on Tuesday said a traffic signal had been illegally set up on VIP Road by the North 24-Parganas police. He said traffic signals on VIP Road can only be installed with prior permission from the PWD. Chowdhury also accused the district police of illegally giving permission to companies to set up hoardings on the road. It is illegal to give such permission on VIP Road without the PWDs consent as the arterial road is under our jurisdiction, he said. The minister said he had summoned the district magistrate and the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas on February 5 for an explanation.				 																																										Justice Barin Ghosh of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday ordered the state government to pay all retirement benefits to Kanan Gopal Bannerjee, assistant teacher of a Bankura school.

The order is of significance as thousands of teachers in the state have yet to receive retirement benefits.

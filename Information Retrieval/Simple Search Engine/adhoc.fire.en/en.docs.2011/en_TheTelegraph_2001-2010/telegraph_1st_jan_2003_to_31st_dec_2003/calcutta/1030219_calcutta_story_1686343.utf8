				 																																										In a desperate bid to prevent power theft, CESC has decided to introduce paper seals on cutouts containing the fuse that control supply to the premises of individual consumers. The decision to introduce modernised proprietary paper seals over the existing lead seals has been taken to make the system foolproof, a spokesperson for the power utility said. We were concerned over the use of spurious lead seals by miscreants. We have now decided to put holographic paper seals on the supply points over and above the existing seals, the spokesperson added. The CESC officer claimed that the adhesive used in the holographic seals will make it difficult for anyone to tamper with them. He also warned consumers that any attempt to disturb or interfere with the paper seals will be construed as a bid to obtain unauthorised access to power supply. The spokesperson said the initial affixing of CESC paper seals on the cut-outs will be done in a phased manner. Information about the affixation on the premises of individual consumers will be intimated through the monthly electricity bills, he added.

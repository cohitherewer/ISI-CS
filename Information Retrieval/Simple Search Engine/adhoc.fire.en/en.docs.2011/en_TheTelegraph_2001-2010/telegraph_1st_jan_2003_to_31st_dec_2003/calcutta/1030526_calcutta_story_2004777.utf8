 																											- Candidate, wagon workshop staff held, police hunt for kingpin A STAFF REPORTER																								Howrah police busted a racket in leaking the question papers of the railway selection examinations, with the arrest of two men in Belur on Sunday. 																								A senior employee of Eastern Railway was arrested along with a candidate, but the police are looking for the brains.																								The incident came to light shortly after several hundred candidates went to Belur Girls High School to take the examination, organised by the Railway Recruitment Board for fresh ticket collectors.																								The examination started around 10.30 am. Around 11.05 am, a candidate, later identified as Debasish Das, sought the invigilators permission to visit the toilet. He returned soon.																								While candidates were answering the objective-type questions, invigilator Kalidas Saha noticed that somebody was trying to smuggle in an answer script through a window.																								Saha immediately raised an alarm and asked the armed guards waiting outside a hospital to catch the man running away from the centre. 																								The police arrested the man, who identified himself as Rana Chakraborty, a senior officer of the railways, posted at the carriage and wagon workshop in Liluah.																								On being grilled Rana, a resident of Stritchy Road, in Liluah, admitted he was working under instructions from somebody who had asked him to pass on the answer-scripts in the examination hall. Rana also confessed that the answer-scripts were for Debasish Das, who had not left the examination hall. 																								Das gave himself up to the police without any resistance. He told his interrogators that he was a resident of Burtola, in Calcutta. He confessed to having given Chakraborty a large sum of money to get somebody to write the exam.																								Till now, we havent been able to find the person who wrote the answers for Das. He is the kingpin, said additional superintendent of police (Howrah) Rahul Srivastava. Police mounted a search in Belur.

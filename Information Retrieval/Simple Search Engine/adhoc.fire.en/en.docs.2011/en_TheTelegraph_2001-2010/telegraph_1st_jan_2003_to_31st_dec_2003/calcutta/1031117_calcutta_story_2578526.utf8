The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, November 17, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									Every time I think of taking a train from Howrah station, the nightmarish scene outside puts me off. The narrow entry to the main station is clogged by hawkers. Though the number of taxis far outstrips the demand, you will always find it difficult to get one. Buses block the approach road to the bridge and garbage vats are overflowing. If anybody wants to have a glimpse of hell, the station is probably the best bet.				 																																									Sekhar Basu Mallik,				 																																									B.B. Chatterji Road.				 																																									The Dum Dum Park-Haridevpur minibus route was suspended some time ago, affecting commuters. The route should be reintroduced.				 																																									Bhupen Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.

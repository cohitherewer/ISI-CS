The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, January 06, 2003 				 Back to Nature to cope with stress
 															- Multi-dimensional naturopathy centre opens in April to heal messed-up lifestyles SUBHRO SAHA																								Ride a horse, take a boat cruise, hit the trim trails, try your hand at archery or tennis, fly a kite, go for a swim, till the soil, weave the charkha, or balance mind and body with Tai Chi. Live by Natures laws and reap the rewards of health, happiness and vitality. In other words, get well. 																								Wellness is at the heart of the super-speciality naturopathy centre inside the 75-acre Vedic Village in Rajarhat, which will throw open its doors this April. The centre of excellence promises to be a significant value-addition to the healthcare delivery system in the city, educating the stressed-out urban soul to adapt to modern excesses, reverse the degeneration process and offer a second chance.																								Wellness does not mean eating raw carrots and continually depriving yourself. Its about educating yourself on how to pull back on track a messed-up lifestyle through organic food, pure water and air and a regimen of sustainable, enjoyable exercises, says Jeff Butterworth, director of medicine of the Vedic Village wellness centre. The 30-year-old Australian naturopathic consultant has been brought down by the Sanjeevani Group, developers of the back-to-nature project, to pilot the unique treatment facility.																								The Vedic Village wellness membership is an entirely new concept, according to M.J. Robertson, CEO, lifestyle division of the group. Ananda in Hrishikesh has some of the facilities and the north Kerala resorts offer mostly ayurveda. But the core strength of Vedic is holistic naturopathy, for which there is a huge demand. Our preliminary findings in Calcutta reveal that at least one member of every family surveyed needs help to cope with stress, adds Robertson.																								Rejuvenation of the nervous, digestive and endocrine systems, detoxification, weight-loss and anti-ageing programmes, corporate team-building and wellness solutions for better productivity are among the therapies the centre will host under one roof. Our Wellness Plan is not just a detoxification programme, but is designed to rejuvenate unhealthy and tired body tissues, explains Butterworth.																								The wellness centre medical team will use a variety of techniques to evaluate the level of well-being of an individual. A report will outline the stage of health progression and the most suitable dietary and lifestyle recommendations. An eight-week programme is recommended to initiate the progression towards wellness, while further programmes may be taken for deeper levels of healing.																								Cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar feels such a centre is most welcome in todays socio-economic context. There is enough medical evidence to show that stress goes hand-in-hand with a lot of present-day lifestyle ailments. If a holistic facility can deal with the stress factor and offer avenues for exercise, it gives the blue-collar professionals a tool to cope, he says. The slabs of wellness week memberships at Vedic start at Rs 1.05 lakh and go up to Rs 4 lakh to spend one week in a year, over 30 years.

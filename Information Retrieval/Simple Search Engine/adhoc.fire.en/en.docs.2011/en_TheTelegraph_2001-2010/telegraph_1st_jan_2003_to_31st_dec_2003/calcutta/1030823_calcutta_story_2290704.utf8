 Saturday, August 23, 2003 				 Madhyamik pre-test delay
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state governments plan to push back the dates for holding selection tests in secondary schools for Madhyamik 2004 candidates is likely to be formalised on Saturday.																								West Bengal Board of Secondary Education officials will meet representatives of various teachers organisations to discuss if it is possible to reschedule selection test dates in over 6,500 Madhyamik schools.																								State school education minister Kanti Biswas had recently met the teachers and asked them to consider if final selection tests for Madhyamik examinees could be held in late December every year. The tests are now held in early December.																								The government is keen to defer the tests to increase the number of teaching and learning days in the schools. The move is part of a drive to improve overall academic standards in state-aided schools.																								West Bengal Board of Madarsa Education president Abdus Sattar said, on the basis of a similar directive from the education department, the board has already decided to postpone selection tests to end-December from this year itself.																								All madarsa examinations of 2004, including High Madarsa, Alim, Fazil and Kamil, will begin on March 8.

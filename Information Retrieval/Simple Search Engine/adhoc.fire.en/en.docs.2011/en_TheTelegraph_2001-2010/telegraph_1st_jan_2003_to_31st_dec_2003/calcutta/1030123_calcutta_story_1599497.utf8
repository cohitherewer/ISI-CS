 Thursday, January 23, 2003 				 One window for mutation of property
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a major development, the system of mutation of landed property in Calcutta was simplified on Wednesday.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said a legal heir can now take advantage of the new system of single-window mutation of landed property, on production of the legal heir certificate or the registered deed of transfer, along with a current tax-clearance receipt. 																								Till now, an applicant seeking to carry out mutation in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had to produce clearance certificates from three different departments  assessment, revenue and collection. 																								In the municipal areas, however, correction of the record of rights used to be done on production of a current tax-clearance receipt, along with the relevant documents.																								This practice of getting clearance from various departments has been the root cause of harassment of tax-payers and corruption among civic employees, said Mukherjee. 																								Since the validity of a clearance certificate was for three months only, in most cases, clearance from one department would lapse while an applicant was waiting for clearance from other departments. Hence, he had to re-apply for a fresh clearance. And this exercise could continue for years, unless he greased enough palms.																								Both the CPM and the Congress leaderships in the CMC welcomed the decision. We congratulate the mayor for this citizen-friendly decision, said Amar Mitra, president, All Calcutta House-owners Association.																								More than 20,000 applications for mutation are handled by the CMC in a year. And barring a few special cases, it takes not less than a year to get a property mutated by correcting the civic assessment records.

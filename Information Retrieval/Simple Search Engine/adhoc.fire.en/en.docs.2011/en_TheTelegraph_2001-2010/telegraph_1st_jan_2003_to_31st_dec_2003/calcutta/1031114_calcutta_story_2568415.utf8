The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, November 14, 2003 				 Stay suit against sack orders
 							 - Snub to CPM cause of govt ire, claim junior doctors  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Three of the six junior doctors of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital,who were summarily punished by the government for their alleged role in the campus violence of November 1, moved court on Thursday.																								Two of the six were house-staff and asked to stop coming to work. Four were interns and the government recommended their suspension, throwing a question mark on their medical career. No charge was spelt out clearly, but health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, saying the charges against them had appeared in the media, hinted that they were being punished for medical negligence and beating up patients relatives and journalists.																								But the three who moved Calcutta High Court on Thursday  as well as the others  said they were being punished for their refusal to join any CPM front. None of them had been on duty in the medicine ward (where the patient whose death sparked off the November 1 trouble had been admitted), hospital records revealed. And none of the six was influential enough to engineer the scale of violence witnessed that night, hospital officials admitted.																								The writ petition filed on Thursday seeks a stay on the government order. The court, likely to hear the case on Monday, has been asked to decide whether the government action is permissible, as the punished junior doctors did not get a hearing .																								Calling the order illegal and arbitrary, the petition has made the government and senior officials of Calcutta University and RG Kar Medical College and Hospital parties to the case.																								In another move, a team of medical-college teachers has got an appointment with governor Viren J. Shah on Saturday. Shah, who has voiced his displeasure about the state of the health sector, will be urged to intervene on behalf of the junior doctors.

 Saturday, June 07, 2003 				 18-year-old mother of girl set ablaze
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The night before Jamai Sashthi, 18-year-old Rinku Mondals husband allegedly tried to set her ablaze at their home in Ghola, North 24-Parganas. She is now fighting for life at Panihati State General Hospital. Her fault  she had given birth to a girl child. Her husband is trying to hush up the case as a suicide bid. 																								Rinku was married to Badal, a small trader, two and a half years ago. They have a daughter, 18 months old. Neighbours said trouble started after the daughters birth. Badal would torture her regularly, and Rinku would suffer in silence. They were forever quarrelling, too, said some of them. On Friday, the neighbours saw smoke billowing out of the room and heard the girl crying. They ran into the house and found Rinku in flames. They banked the flames and rushed her to hospital. 																								Officer-in-charge of Ghola police station Asoke Roy said the nature of burns suggested that Rinku had been set ablaze. We will interrogate Badal and also Rinku, when she comes around. 																								Rinkus elder brother said his family will lodge a criminal case against Badal. My sister kept complaining about the torture inflicted on her, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Safety steps, mental blocks
				 	 HUMAYUN KABIR, deputy superintendent of police (town), South 24-Parganas, met readers of The Telegraph in his office at Jadavpur thana to reply to their queries. Participants included Saileswar Chakraborty, Supriyo Mukherjee, Deepankar Pal, T.K. Datta, Debasish Biswas and Abhijit Das				 																																																																																																																																																																		

T.K.Datta: There are two subways  one at the Jadavpur crossing on Raja SC Mullick Road and the other in front of the Tollygunge Metro Railway station  that are rarely used.																																																			Actually, it is nothing but a mental block. These two subways were built for the benefit of the people. If they do not use them, it is their lack of awareness about the safety of their own lives. In Delhi, I have seen people use subways. They have turned it into a habit that we need to develop.																																																									

Supriyo Mukherjee: The government had once ordered that every landlord inform the local police station about his tenants and also furnish their photographs. Is this order followed?																																																			It is not obligatory. No such law has been passed. Of course, this should be done to avoid any future trouble. Suppose, a tenant kidnaps the child of his landlord or steals some stuff and flees. In that case, if we have the particulars, it becomes easier to collar the culprit.																																																									

Supriyo Mukherjee: The word police would draw either a shudder or a sneer. Has the image improved? 																																																			 Yes, the attitude has changed. Now, we regularly organise blood donation camps and other programmes where common people play a vital role. Even when a resistance group is formed in any area, we talk to every section of residents so that they can be involved fully.																																																									

T.K.Datta: A section of police officers is honest, but the other section taints the entire force.																																																			Frankly, it depends on ones upbringing and social environment. If a person is raised in a congenial atmosphere, it is not possible for him to be dishonest. Of course, some times, the question of honesty or dishonesty does cloud the efficiency and working capacity of a person. 																																																									

Saileswar Chakraborty: I have observed that each time a multinational company lodges a complaint, there is a scurry to set things right. This immediacy is lacking when the complainant is an ordinary individual. Why this discrimination?																																																			When a company lodges a complaint, rapid action is taken as it involves the fate of a number of people. That, of course, does not mean that proper attention is not paid to a complaint lodged by an individual. 																																																											Actually, the authorities of a company engage experts who know how to lodge a complaint, which an individual does not, and that is why his case is delayed. Everybody should know where and how a complaint should be made.																																																									

Saileswar Chakraborty: Some times, police avoid taking action or claim their hands are tied as a particular case is sub judice.																																																			Thats not true. Every policeman tries to understand a case, to see whether it is civil or criminal in nature, and then acts according to procedure.																																																									

Debasish Biswas: The traffic jam at the Bagha Jatin crossing is a daily ordeal. 																																																			I am aware of the problem. There, the road space is inadequate. The situation worsens because of the autos and other slow-moving vehicles. Moreover, the nearby market adds to the problem. We have already started controlling the autos. More action needs to be taken.																																																									

Abhijit Das: I am a resident of Bank Plot, in Dhakuria. We have formed a local resistance group in our area. A Calcutta Police mobile van patrols the area regularly as it is under their jurisdiction. Cant the district police also help?																																																			Your expectation is justified but our infrastructure is not strong. However, every night, our van does visit the area.

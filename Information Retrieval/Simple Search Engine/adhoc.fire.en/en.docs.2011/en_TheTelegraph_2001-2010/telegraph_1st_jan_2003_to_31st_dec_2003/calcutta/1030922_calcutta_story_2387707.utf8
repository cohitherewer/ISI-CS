	The state health department should check on the sudden  growth of agencies supplying nurses, ayahs and ambulances.  Nurses without proper qualification or training, ambulances  without the basic equipment and nursing homes without proper  staff and infrastructure are doing great business. For instance,  the driver of a doctor, who has a nursing home in Southern  Avenue, operates X-ray machines, works as an OT assistant  and also does odd jobs. 
	 Secretary, Centre of Development and Social Sciences.  
	CTC buses introduced temporarily between Belur/Bally and  Howrah have been a great help. Can this be a regular feature? 
	 B.L. Chandak, Salkia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, September 16, 2003 				 Festive fun minus potholes, crackers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								No hitting the potholes during pandal-hopping. This is a Puja promise that the government held out after Mondays joint meeting and inspection by the Calcutta Police, Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), CESC and Calcutta Tramways Corporation (CTC). 																								The CESC formed part of the team as inspection of overhead wiring conditions was also on the agenda.																								Road repairs was not the only happy news that Monday brought. The Lalbazar top brass also held a meeting with its district counterparts and manufacturers of fireworks to stop the sale of banned crackers and ensure a noise-free Kali puja. 																								The joint inspection team prepared a list of junctions and electricity wirings that need immediate repairs. The team started off from central Calcutta and reached the five-point crossing of Shyambazar. From there, they moved down south, via Sealdah, covering all the major puja sites. 																								Deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, Kuldiep Singh, said most roads were in good condition. However, certain points, especially the roads with tram tracks, need repairs. The roads are uneven in these stretches. So we have asked the CTC and CMC authorities to work on the damaged portions, Singh said.																								Crowd-control measures were also discussed. Singh said this year barricades will be put up in more areas, like the stretch from Jadavpur police station to the Lords Bakery junction on Prince Anwar Shah Road.

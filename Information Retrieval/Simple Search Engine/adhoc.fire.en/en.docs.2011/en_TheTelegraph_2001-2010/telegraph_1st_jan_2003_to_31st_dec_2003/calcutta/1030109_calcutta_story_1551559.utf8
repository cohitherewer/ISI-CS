 Normally used to projects going  haywire, thanks to cost overruns, the government has sprung  a pleasant first. The state coffers are left with a surplus  of over Rs 35 crore from the ongoing flyover projects, which  will be used to upgrade six important city roads. The proposal, according to transport  department officials, has been sent to the Japanese agency  for its formal approval, as it has funded the flyovers. We have managed to save Rs 35  crore by closely monitoring construction work and curtailing  avoidable expenditure. Since all the projects are expected  to be completed within the stipulated timeframe, there is  no question of any price escalation. The surplus amount  will be spent for development of city roads, said Prashant,  joint-secretary in the transport department and nodal officer  monitoring the flyover projects. The development plan, named the  Additional wide area traffic management project, includes  improvement of A.P.C. Road, New Park Street, S.P. Mukherjee  Road, Deshapran Sashmal Road and relocation of the tram  tracks on Maniktala Main Road, A.P.C. Road and Rashbehari  Avenue. We had proposed construction  of another flyover at Ballygunge Phari with the initial  investment of the surplus amount. But they didnt agree,  as the financial agreement with them runs out in 2003 and  the flyover cant be built by then. So, the road upgradation  plan was drawn up instead. We will start work soon, after  we get the formal approval, Prashant said. Spelling out the belt-tightening  measures, transport department officials said the cost of  preliminary work for construction was minimised. Besides,  the underground water pipeline and sewerage system at Gariahat  and A.J.C Bose Road were completed without disturbing the  existing system. Money was also saved as the development  projects at Shyambazar and Maniktala were shelved. We kept  a close watch and were careful not to misuse a single rupee,  even though the funds were provided by the Japanese bank.  Apart from our engineers and officers, the contractors were  also committed to meet the deadline, since they knew they  wouldnt get any price escalation if work was delayed,  officials said. When work started, most people  said the flyovers would take at least 10 years to complete  and the expenditure would double. Now, it has been proved  that both time and money can be saved through proper supervision  and right planning, said transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.

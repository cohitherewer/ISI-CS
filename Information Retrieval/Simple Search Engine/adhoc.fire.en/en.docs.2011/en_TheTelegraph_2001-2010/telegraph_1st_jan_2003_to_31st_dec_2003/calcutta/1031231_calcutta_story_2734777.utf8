The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Tread not on reader rights
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should an independent censor board be set up to vet novels before they go to print? More letters will be published next week				 OVER THE SHOULDER:  Film-maker Deepa Mehta with her cast for Water, which  was shelved in the face of violent protests  Mahuya Samadder,
																		Canning. Definitely not. Needless to say,  as a citizen of a democratic country, one has the right  to speak. If the censor board blocks novels before they  go to print, readers lose the right to express their views.  Its entirely unethical. Judging the quality of a literary  work is best left to the discretion of the readers.									

Seraj Alam, 
																		Bansberia.																																																														Yes, there should be a censor board to check novels before sending them to press. The right move at the right time will help prevent controversies. Authors who hurt feelings of others should be asked not to do so.									

Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
																		Rakhal Ghosh Lane.																																																														Freedom of expression is a fundamental right granted by the Constitution. So, there is no need to set up an independent censor board to vet novels. The government of West Bengal is wrong to ban Taslima Nasreens Dwikhandita. Does the chief minister think that a book is enough to spark communal violence in a progressive state like ours?									

Sneha Rai Chowdhury,
																		College Street. 																																																														I do not think novels need a censor board, as in the case of movies. If an author is made to function within a framework, the output will be affected. Readers are intelligent and responsible enough to appreciate quality and censure works which do not deserve accolades.									

Debashish Chakraborty, 
																		Nilmoni Mitra Row.																																																														Novels should be vetted before they are published, to find out whether the contents may cause communal disturbance. Risque remarks should be deleted. If this practice is not started, untoward incidents, as happened to Taslima Nasreen recently, will recur. 									

Bhupen Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														Certainly not. Since independence, not one Bengali book has caused problems, except Buddhadeb Basus Raat Bhor Bristi, which was obscene in parts. Only recently did Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreens book Dwikhandita create a stir for revealing her sexual involvement with a poet and her comments on Islam. One or two controversial books in 50 years do not require an independent censor board.									

Indraneel Mukherjee, 
																		Kidderpore. 																																																														The recent storm over the ban on Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreens book has brought the issue into focus. For the first time, the state government has ordered such a ban. Is the book so violent as to disrupt communal harmony in a state where the government had invited Deepa Mehta to shoot her controversial film Water after she faced fundamentalist attacks in Varanasi? But, the government is also responsible for law and order. So, an independent board, comprising personalities like retired senior bureaucrats, former judges of the apex court and distinguished academics, may be set up. Only when this independent agency gives its nod should publishers distribute copies of the book in the market, much as in the case of films. This will ensure the freedom of authors, while safeguarding public sentiments.									

Goutam Narayan Deb, 
																		Jessore Road. 																																																														Though it is not right in a democratic society to ban books, some sort of policing is necessary to stop misuse of freedom of expression. A censor board, comprising persons from different walks of life, should check anything objectionable in literary works. And if need be, certain portions can be deleted instead of banning the entire book. A board members term of office should be short, so that a writer can approach a new board for review. This way, misuse of power by the board can also be checked.									

Tapanayan Roychowdhury, 
																		Shyamnagar.																																																														We live in an enlightened, civil society. Liberal education, free from fundamentalism, dogmatism and fanaticism, can stop such madness. A democracy of fools can never do justice to writers. Should readers reign supreme, no censoring authority can ban books. 									

Santosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park.																																																														Never. Pre-publication blue-pencilling is a repulsive and undemocratic idea. In fact, no one has any authority to edit the manuscript of an author. That apart, what is the purpose? To expurgate the objectionable portions? What eligibility and credibility will the board have? Rather, it is prudent to rely on the good sense of the writer and the wisdom of the publisher. That is enough. 									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury, 
																		Barrackpore.																																																														If every novel is subjected to censorship, readers might lose interest. Moreover, what is wrong if novelists, through their writings, make people aware of the dark face of society? Besides, why should educated and cultured readers be deprived of their right to assess novels and decide for themselves? Keeping in mind the democratic fabric of the country and its liberal culture, this is unthinkable. 									

Smita Mukherjee, 
																		Barrackpore.																																																														No way. Novels carry a statement in every line. Thats why we love reading them. A censor board can end up taking away from the attraction of a novel.									

Debyani Basu, 
																		Birati. 																																																														Yes, I think formation of an independent censor board has become essential to vet novels before publication. There was chaos recently, over Taslima Nasreens latest novel. What she has written in the name of an autobiography is trash. This novel can be compared to third-grade adult films. Will parents be able to encourage their children read this novel? Some remarks hurt Muslim sentiments. Has she any right to do so? If such actions are not checked, others will follow. There should be a censor board and writers should be bound to send their manuscripts for approval before printing. This will help literature flourish.

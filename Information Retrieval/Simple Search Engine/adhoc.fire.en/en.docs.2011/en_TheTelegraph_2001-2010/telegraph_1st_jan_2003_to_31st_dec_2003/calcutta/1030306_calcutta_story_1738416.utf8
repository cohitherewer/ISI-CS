 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government on Wednesday set up a committee to monitor construction of all flyovers and other public utility projects in the city. The decision was taken in the wake of the recent chaos, after several breaches developed in water mains during piling work of an upcoming flyover. 																								Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said it will be made compulsory for all agencies to get a clearance from the committee before work begins on public utility projects in the city. The decision was taken at a meeting held between the minister and mayor Subrata Mukherjee at Writers Buildings.																								Bhattacharya said the new committee will comprise officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners and the state transport department.

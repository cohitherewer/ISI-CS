The Telegraph - Calcutta

				 																																									The long queues in front of ticket counters at Metro Rail stations are a tedious experience for most commuters. This is because only a few ticket counters are in operation. At Central station, two or three counters operate, instead of nine. Sometimes, technical snags develop in the ticket-issuing machines. The employee manning the counter has to bear the brunt without any fault of his. 				 																																									Gunjeet Singh Wadhwa,				 																																									Behala.				 																																									For the past few months, CESC has been delaying in despatching electricity bills. As a result, customers are finding it to difficult to pay the bills on time. The power utility can inform us of the delay through newspapers or TV, as is done by Calcutta Telephones. Is it a ploy by the CESC to avoid giving rebates to consumers, or force more and more consumers to accept the CRES offer? The government should intervene and settle the matter. There should be a gap of 10 days between despatching the bills and the due date of payment.				 																																									Kalyan Ghosh,				 																																									Park Street.

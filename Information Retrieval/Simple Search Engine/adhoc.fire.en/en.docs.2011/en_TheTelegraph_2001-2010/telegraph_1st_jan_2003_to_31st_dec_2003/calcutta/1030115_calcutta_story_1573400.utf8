				 																																									Over the past few days I have noticed that trees are being indiscriminately felled in Salt Lake. In some places, all the branches on the trees have been chopped off. Some people then gather all the branches, pile these on trucks and drive away. Certain parts of the township are looking extremely bare and ugly as a result. Its surprising that the Bidhannagar Municipality scarcely takes note of such illegal activities. 				 																																									Debayan Podder,				 																																									Salt Lake.				 																																									A couple of days ago, I had gone to the Behala post office to send a money order. I stood in the queue for nearly an hour and when my turn came, the man at the counter refused to do the job on the pretext that their MO receipt stock had been exhausted. The authorities should have put up a notice and saved our time.				 																																									Ratan Guptu,				 																																									Behala.				 																																									One can often spot motorcyclists driving on the pavements to bypass traffic jams. Such practices may drag pedestrians into mishaps. 				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Nayapatty Road.

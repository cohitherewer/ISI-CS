 Monday, November 24, 2003 				 Eagle tattoo clue to murder victim name
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Till Saturday night, the dead youth was put down as Flying Eagle in the record book of Entally police station. On Sunday morning, he was identified as Sameer Pradhan, resident of Tangra Road and known as a local rowdy.																								The identification was made of the semi-decomposed body by officials of Entally police station in a dramatic style. The investigators, initially, had no idea who the victim was. The only lead they had to the body, retrieved from the Beleghata canal banks, was three tattoos.																								We recovered the half-buried body, with the throat slit and a bullet wound on the right temple, from the canal banks near Chaulpatti, said A.B. Majumdar, officer-in-charge of Entally police station.																								There was a hawk tattooed on the victims back and two letters, J and K, on his left arm. The word ma in Hindi was inscribed on his right hand. We started our investigation with these leads, said Majumdar. Initially, we thought the two letters could be the initials of his name.																								From the start, police knew the victim had to be from a nearby locality. He was five feet and 10 inches tall. Carrying in the body of a such a tall youth from outside the city would have been tough. So, we activated our sources, added Majumdar.																								Police initially started a campaign in the eastern part of the city, saying they were looking for a youth with a hawk tattooed on his back. The first lead came fast. One of our sources in Tangra said he knew a youth, in his early 20s, who sported such a tattoo. Accordingly, we went to Tangra Road and met Sameers mother. She told us her son had been missing for the past three days. She thought he had been picked up by police, which is why she did not lodge any complaint with the local police station, stated Majumdar. 																								By then, investigators were sure about the identity of the victim, and his mother provided them with a description of his clothes. We called in Sameers brother, who later identified the body, said an official of Entally police station.																								Majumdar, however, confirmed that Sameers murder was a sequel to a long-standing rivalry between the two local gangs. 																								Sameer was arrested several times in the recent past. We have started a murder case. Officials are working on it and trying to find the victims rivals, added Majumdar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, November 01, 2003 				 Safe, natural amp; holistic hub
 															- Customised wellness regimens to rejuvenate body, woo tourists SUBHRO SAHA																								Find out the rate of fat uptake by your liver, or take stock of your stress and toxicity levels. Assess the damage caused by free radicals and check out how your immune system is functioning  all these through the analysis of just one drop of blood. Experience total detoxification through shodhana-based panchakarma, or take a grip on those sudden, choking asthma attacks with the help of vamanakarma  avenues of classical ayurveda.																								Sanjeeva Spa, the first holistic medical spa in this part of the country, promises to address the growing need to rejuvenate and keep the body free of toxins through self-healing and natural therapy, a concept thats a global rage now.																								Located in the 100-acre, back-to-nature Vedic Village off Rajarhat, a 30-minute drive from the airport, Sanjeeva Spa promises to put Calcutta on the world health tourism map, with its customised wellness regimens. We expect a steady traffic of foreign tourists and NRIs once we open the resort facilities in mid-January, says Raj Modi, director, Vedic Village, who conceived the property.																								 A unique blend of preventive and curative medicines, the spa provides not just a fun-filled experience, but an extensive range of treatments and facilities for the chronically ill. The medical spa combines the best of time-tested ayurveda from South India with naturopathic therapies that originated in this country and have been refined through extensive research in the West and in Australia. The synergy makes Sanjeeva Spa a unique property in the whole of Asia and the three key words here are safe, natural and holistic, says Jeff Butterworth, the specialist naturopathic consultant from the Gold Coast heading the naturopathy wing of the wellness centre.																								Live-blood analysis has been introduced here for the first time in India. Unlike in conventional blood tests done on dead blood, the components in the blood sample are viewed when they are still alive and moving, explains homoeopath Tania Bardhan. We use a combination of treatment techniques, from homoeopathy to western herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine to reiki to aromatherapy, she adds.																								At the ayurveda wing, the stress is on locating the causative factor of the disease and then prescribing evidence-based therapy for conditions like Parkinsons disease, osteo-arthritis and osteoporosis, Alzheimers disease, asthma, diabetes, hypertension and even certain forms of paralysis, stresses ayurvedacharya C.M. Pradyumna.

 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Cold-blooded murder by maid
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After being grilled all of Saturday, Rina Bar, the domestic help who had murdered her employer Gayatri Singhal and stolen cash and jewellery worth Rs 15 lakh thereafter on Thursday, revealed that earlier, she and her sister Tina had planned the entire operation.																								Though Rina committed the crime alone, Tina was well aware of what her sister was up to. They waited for the day when her employer would be alone.																								Rina was rounded up from her home at Harinbari village in the Sunderbans and brought to Calcutta early on Saturday. Both sisters were produced before the sub-divisional magistrates court at Alipore and have been remanded in police custody. Tina, too, is being questioned.																								Residents of Neelachal apartment in the New Alipore area had found Gayatris body on Thursday morning. Her throat had been slit and there was a wound in the back of her head. He husband and son, who run a chartered accountancy firm, were both out of town.																								Rina murdered the woman like a professional killer. It was cold-blooded murder, said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, South 24-Parganas.																								According to Rinas statement, she had murdered the woman early on Thursday. She slept keeping the door of her bedroom open. So, I did not face any problem entering the room, Rina told detective department sleuths. The knife that Rina had used to slit the womans throat was taken out of the kitchen. Police found it from under the bed on which the womans body was found.																								She was sleeping when I noiselessly entered the room with a bonti (a sharp kitchen instrument) and the knife. I first hit her head with the bonti, and then tried to strangle her. But she woke up and started struggling with me. I was left with no option but to slit her throat with the knife, Rina said.																								Subsequently, Rina opened the almirah. She knew where the keys were kept. She even knew where the jewellery and Rs 3 lakh in cash were kept, police said. The maid was smart. We did not find any bloodstain except inside the room where Gayatris body was found. She washed her hands and then changed. The basin and toilet were both clean, police said. 																								After the act, Rina had waited for nearly an hour. After daybreak, I left the apartment with the booty and my clothes and asked the driver to give me a lift to block D where my sister worked as a maid. We left the city around 6 am on Thursday, Rina said.

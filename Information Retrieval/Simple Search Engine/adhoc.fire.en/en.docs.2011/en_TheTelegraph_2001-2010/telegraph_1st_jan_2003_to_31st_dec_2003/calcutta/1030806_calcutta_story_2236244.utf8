The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, August 06, 2003 				 Mobiles blank for two hours
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Hutch cellphone service users in the city were hit on Tuesday when the network in the central business district (CBD) went blank for over two hours from three in the afternoon.																								The CBD comprises Minto Park, Park Street, BBD Bag and Esplanade. Company officials said cell sites in this area had tripped, causing a disruption of services. 																								The cause of the tripping is not yet clear. We are looking into the matter, said Sunil Sood, chief operating officer, Hutchison Telecom East Limited.																								Industry sources said the tripping could have been caused by capacity overload, software malfunction or upgradation work.																								Even as its network went on the blink, Hutch announced new tariff plans for pre-paid and post-paid subscribers. The post-paid plan does not require payment of monthly rental and offers outgoing calls at Rs 2.40 per minute to both mobile and fixed phones. The user, however, needs to use a minimum of Rs 499 of airtime a month. SMS will be charged at 60 paise per message.																								For pre-paid users, Hutch has introduced Party Time from 10 pm to 8 am for a monthly charge of Rs 25. Outgoing calls will be charged at Rs 1.20 to cellphones and Rs 1.40 to fixed lines during this period.

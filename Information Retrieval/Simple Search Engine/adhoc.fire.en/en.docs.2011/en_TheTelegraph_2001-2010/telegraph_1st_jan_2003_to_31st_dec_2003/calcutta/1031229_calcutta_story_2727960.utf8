The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Swift traffic, narrow transit
				 	 Ratan Dey, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward no. 93 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), met readers of The Telegraph at Jodhpur Parks Taltala Maidan to answer their queries. Participants included Dilip Banerjee, Pinak Mitra, Dilip Chakraborty, Goutam Bhattacharjee, Rabi Ghosh, Rajib Das and Hrishikesh Saha				 																																																																																																																																																																		

Goutam Bhattacharjee: There are many schools on the main road. The area is accident-prone. 																																																			Strictly speaking, this is not a civic problem and I have hardly any role to play. But as councillor of the area, I have already taken up the matter with the deputy commissioner of traffic. Moreover, the footpath is too narrow in stretches and people are forced to walk on the carriageway. An alternative traffic plan, specially during school hours, and widening the footpaths will solve the menace.																																																									

Pinak Mitra: There are many private bus terminals on the road in the area. So, the effective transit space decreases considerably. Can these bus terminals be shifted elsewhere?																																																			It has come to our notice that private buses on some routes remain parked in pockets of the area and they have made a permanent terminus for themselves on the roads. We had discussed this problem with the traffic police and a few of these terminals will be shifted soon to some other areas, like Golf Green and Mathpukur. Once this is done, the road space will increase, and rush-hour traffic snarls will ease.																																																									

Dilip Banerjee: In Lake Gardens, there are many open drains that are a public hazard.																																																			The root of the problem is the unauthorised colonies that have come up in the area and are choking the drainage system. We have started covering the drains. Only about 22 per cent of the work remains.																																																									

Dilip Chakraborty: There is a urinal at the Prince Anwar Shah Road crossing with Deshapran Sashmal Road that is actually a public nuisance.																																																			I am aware of this. Not only at that spot, there are several such urinals in Jodhpur Park and Lake Gardens. The Calcutta Improvement Trust is in charge of maintaining the area and its roadside structures. It is not paying adequate attention to its duty. We had taken this into consideration and special attention has been given to it in the Prince Anwar Shah Road beautification programme, that is to start soon. A budget of Rs 70 lakh has also been sanctioned by the CMC for the project. 																																																									

Dilip Chakraborty: Crossing the Dhaka Kalibari stretch is becoming increasingly difficult.																																																			We have already talked to the officer-in-charge of Jadavpur police station about it. The problem is that the area lies on the border of Calcutta Police and Bengal Police jurisdiction. Once it is brought under Calcutta Polices jurisdiction, the problem will be solved. The traffic department is also installing a semi-automatic signal at the crossing to help pedestrians.																																																									

Rabi Ghosh: There is no piped water supply in the Gobindapur area. We depend on deep tubewells for drinking water.																																																			This is a long-standing demand. There is a single pump operating in the area, which cannot generate enough pressure to distribute water. Another pump has been installed, but we are waiting for an electrical connection to the pumphouse. It is expected within a month.																																																									

Goutam Bhattacharjee: Does the CMC plan to restore the Bikramgarh jheel, now a breeding ground for mosquitoes?																																																			We have started a dialogue with a private company to renovate the lake, on the lines of the Jodhpur Park lake. We have a detailed plan to restore the lake.																																																									

Goutam Bhattacharjee: Some open drains in Poddarnagar are not cleaned regularly. 																																																			This is a colony and has open drains. Many houses have come up lately and the area has become over-populated. The garbage generated is often thrown directly into the open drains, instead of the vats. Mass awareness needs to be increased to stop the practice. I have already sanctioned Rs 10 lakh to cover the drains. Work will start in February 2004.

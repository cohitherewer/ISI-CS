 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Another police horse runs rebel race
 PRONAB MONDAL																								Whoever named it wasnt much of a seer. For when the 11-year-old Mounted Police steed flung off its rider and galloped away on the Maidan greens on Saturday, it was flying in the face of not just years of regimentation but also its name  Obedient. 																								This is the second case of mutiny in the equine ranks within a span of a week and a half. Twelve-year-old Its My Style had done the same on a wintry Wednesday morning before running the two-km stretch of Kidderpore Road from the Maidan.																								If Its My Style had hoofed off from the south gate of Victoria Memorial to the Park Circus seven-point crossing, Obedient started its race of defiance in front of the Calcutta University tent  the spot on the Maidan where the horse and its rider Anurodh Singh do their daily rounds  till it was intercepted by another Mounted Police rider near the Vidyasagar Setu police outpost. 																								Later, it was taken to the stable at the Mounted Police headquarters on SN Banerjee Road.																								The day had begun like any other for the former racehorse. It woke up around 5 am and joined its rider for the routine rounds on the Maidan.																								It went at a canter till the CU tent. But on reaching the area it suddenly reared up and threw an unprepared Singh off the saddle. Singh landed about 15 feet away and lost consciousness.																								As soon as its rider fell, Obedient took off for a free lap. It started running up Kidderpore Road towards Vidyasagar Setu, throwing up visions of another unbridled race like the one Its My Style had run across the citys newest and longest flyover on Lower Circular Road.																								Fortunately, another rider of the Mounted Police noticed the chest nut-coloured horse tearing past the morning traffic. Immediately he started chasing the free horse. In the meantime, on seeing the horse coming from the opposite direction, the motorists driving down the road jammed the brakes. Traffic came to a standstill, though at six oclock it was not heavy.																								By then, Obedient had spent its burst of rebellious energy and made its way under the Vidyasagar Setu in front of the police outpost. The rider on the chase, too, was closing in on it. So it gave up the race and allowed itself to be intercepted. Soon, it was back in the stable.																								But what exactly led Obedient to disobey its rider is yet to be ascertained. 																								Its My Style had behaved abnormally because of its saddle wounds. There was a raw point on its belly and the friction with the saddle made it uncomfortable. The steed has been kept under observation. But there is no such apparent logic in Obedients case, said an official of the Mounted Police.																								Singh was rescued immediately after the accident by policemen patrolling the area. He was taken to SSKM Hospital from where he was shifted to Calcutta Police Hospital. Singhs condition is stable, the official said.

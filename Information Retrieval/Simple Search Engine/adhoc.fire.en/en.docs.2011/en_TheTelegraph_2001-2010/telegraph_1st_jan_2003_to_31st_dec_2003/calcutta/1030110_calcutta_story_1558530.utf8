				 																																									There is a custom in several localities to organise soirees featuring reputed artistes in the winter evenings. Para clubs organise these jalsas with great enthusiasm and residents usually lap them up. Music is played at full volume and the programmes often drag on even after 10 in the night. The organisers tend to forget that there are senior citizens living nearby as well, who cant put up with the ear-splitting sound. Such noise can cause cardiac arrests and sleeplessness. The local administration should check such disturbances.				 																																									B.N. Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.				 																																									Traffic jams at the Salkia-Chowrasta intersection are causing immense chaos, with pedestrians, bicycles, rickshaws, autos and four-wheelers, all tumbling on each other. Three or four policemen, who are usually posted at the spot, look helpless. Sergeants must take disciplinary action immediately. Anyone found flouting traffic rules should be fined. 				 																																									B.L. Chandak,				 																																									Salkia.

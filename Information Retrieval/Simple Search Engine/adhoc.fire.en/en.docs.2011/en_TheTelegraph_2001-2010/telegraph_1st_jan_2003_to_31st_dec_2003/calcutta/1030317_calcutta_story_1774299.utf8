 																											- CM convenes Writers meet with top cops to sort out traffic mess A STAFF REPORTER																								A month after transport minister Subhas Chakraborty blamed the city police for the car chaos, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appears to have come around to the same idea.																								Unhappy with the management of traffic, Bhattacharjee has taken it upon himself to stem the rot.

Deputy commissioner Singh confirmed that several of the ideas would be discussed at the Monday meeting. 																								Earlier, the transport minister had squarely blamed the police for the traffic mess. They are responsible for the chaos on the road. Shirking work and corruption are the bane of our force, Chakraborty had said.																								Initially, the chief minister had not reacted to his ministers criticism.

He was addressing the silver jubilee conference of the Income Tax Employees Federation (ITEF) and the golden jubilee celebration of its foundation at Yuba Bharati Krinangan in Salt Lake from February 10 to 15. There is a parallel economy in black money, Basu said in his inaugural address, while urging income tax employees to curb the menace.

In our country, the origin of dance, like the other art forms, is intrinsically associated with the Hindu pantheon of gods and goddesses. Lord Shiva or Nataraj is the adi (original) guru and dance as a form of expression originates from him. In fact, in the realm of traditional music and dance, the position of the Guru is held in the highest esteem. He/ she is the one who not only introduces the pupil to a unique form of expression but also moulds and teaches him/her to master the art form. Rani Karnaa is a veteran Kathak dancer who has been imparting lessons to enthusiastic youths under the aegis of Sanskrtiki Shreyaskar. This evening two of her talented disciples, Debashree Bhattacharya and Vikram Iyengar (picture on the right) will present Prathama, This presentation features a series of duets choreographed in the Kathak style, set to both traditional and contemporary music. Bhattacharya will present the 14-beat Taal Dhamar while Iyengar will focus on the 15-beat Pancham Sawari. They will also present select compositions from the vast repertoire of Natwari Nrittya, that is, the dance of Krishna, exploring both shringar and Veer rasa (aspects) of the dance form. Also, vocal recital by Sudakshina Chatterjee and tabla recital by Siddhartha Bhattacharya, both first class post-graduates in their respective fields from Rabindra Bharati University.

  They start, city stops: Team India  at Eden Gardens Apropos the report Wetlands in Ramsar delist shade (Nov. 17), it is interesting to note that although the Ramsar agreement was signed long ago in 1971, due to some inexplicable reason, the government is reluctant to publish a map of the wetlands on the eastern fringes of the city. As the wetlands are necessary for maintenance of ecological balance, reduction of the wetlands will seriously affect the environment. However, in view of the promoters filling up waterbodies, the matter has assumed increased significance. It is also a matter of concern that law-enforcing authorities are mute spectators to this undesirable state of affairs. This inaction from all quarters only points to the possibility of a tacit understanding between a section of promoters and the local administration. Are we then to conclude that the promoters lobby is creating hurdles in the way of the publication of the map of the wetlands to safeguard its land-grabbing interests?  Rabindranath Kar, 
 Sankar Ghosh Lane.  Apropos the report Big boys missing in action (Nov. 19) it is shameful how an undeclared holiday is forced upon the public on the day of an important cricket match, like the India-Australia tie at Eden Gardens. As the people at the helm of affairs are thus encouraging others to take an active interest in the game, they may consider declaring a holiday on such days.  Debaprasad Mukherjee, 
 Nayapatty Road.  The decision of Calcutta University to introduce a course exclusively to improve communication skills in English for engineering graduates is most welcome (Its fine, but its not English, Nov 18). Engineering graduates from West Bengal fail to get suitable jobs in other states for their poor performance in interviews, though they are otherwise qualified. The faulty education policy at the primary level has made our boys and girls weak in English and that is their main drawback in getting proper placements.  Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
 Behala.  The report HS review modifies marks of 5270 (Nov. 18) highlights how Higher Secondary examinees had been wrongly assessed by irresponsible examiners who, by and large, undertake evaluation of scripts as a perfunctory job. Can the past mistakes of the council heaped on students be compensated?  Govinda Bakshi, 
 Budge Budge.  Attacking errant doctors or demolishing nursing homes cannot solve the problem of medical negligence (Clinic clique for mob cover, Nov. 14). Similarly, neither is an association by nursing home-owners going to stop the irate mob from launching such attacks when a patient is killed due to medical malpractice. The root of the problem has to be tackled first.  Dr Kunal Saha,
 President, People for Better Treatment (PBT), Ohio.  Employees Provident Fund Organisation is shocked to go through the report entitled Assault alleged for refusing PF bribe (Dec. 6). B.R. Sharma was brought to the office in execution of the warrant of arrest issued against the directors of the defaulting establishment M/s Dum Dum Mettaloy Industries Pvt. Ltd, which has defaulted in payment of Rs 19.82 lakh towards outstanding PF and allied dues. A cheque for Rs 2 lakh tendered by the establishment towards arrears of the dues has also been dishonoured by their bankers against which a showcause notice dated November 21 has also been issued by this office.  During the proceedings, Sharma submitted that the establishment had in the meantime remitted an amount of Rs 9.25 lakh and proposed to pay off 50 per cent of the remaining outstanding dues on the spot and committed to remit the rest of the dues by the end of this month.  Accordingly, Sharma requested to be released on a personal bond/surety so that he could arrange for the payment. In course of this, he tried to escape through the main gate but slipped and fell. Some of our staff members tried to help him but he made a dash for his car and left without paying the promised dues.  Rajni Kant, 
 Asstt. P. F. Commissioner, WB, 
 DK Block, Sector-II. 
 Salt Lake.

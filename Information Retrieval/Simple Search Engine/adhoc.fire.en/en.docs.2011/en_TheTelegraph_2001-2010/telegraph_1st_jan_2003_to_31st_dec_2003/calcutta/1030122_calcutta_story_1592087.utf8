																								Creativity is in itself a process of learning. It enables an observer to peer into the innermost essence of things and ponder on the universe in constant upheaval. This inward life of the cosmos itself is brought before us by the master printmaker Krishna Reddy. The exploration of nature which, in his case, began as a journey to satiate curiosity gradually gained momentum as it became a quest to look beyond the limitations of the visible world. Gradually, it developed into a spiritual curiosity about the cosmos. That led to developing ways to overcome technical difficulties in creating icons of distilled beauty in printmaking which reduced the appearance of objects to their pure and essential forms. Reddy revolutionised printmaking by discovering the method of printing numerous colours from a single metal plate. His work, along with the spirituality of his art, makes Reddy a legend in his lifetime. Krishnas Cosmos  The Creativity of a Painter, Sculptor amp; Teacher is a study in the creativity of a master. Written by Ratnottama Sengupta and published by Mapin Publishing, the book will be formally released today by Governor Viren J. Shah at 6.30 pm. An exhibition of Reddys prints will be on view. 																								When: Till January 31; 11 am - 7 pm																								Where: Gallerie 88

 Monday, August 25, 2003 				 Wife-killer dies in hospital
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The man who shot dead his estranged wife on Saturday, and then tried to kill himself with the same revolver, died in hospital on Sunday.																								Twenty-six-year-old Tuhin Chakraborty and his 22-year-old wife Soumi were married two years ago. 																								Though their divorce suit was in court, they would meet often at Tuhins grandfathers place, in Haripada Datta Lane, near Lake Gardens, police said.																								Saturdays meeting ended in an argument that sparked the shootout and the twin deaths. 																								Soumi was killed with a single shot to her head, following which Tuhin put the revolver to his own head and pulled the trigger. 																								A mob gathered on the spot and set Tuhins car ablaze.																								Jadavpur police later arrested Tuhins father, Tapan Chakraborty, on charges of torturing his daughter-in-law. 																								Police recovered three firearms, including the revolver used in Saturdays incident, from the Haripada Datta Lane house.																								Police said Tuhin and Soumi, then a student of Class XI, had tied the knot without the consent of their families. Soumis relatives were opposed to the idea as Tuhin had a criminal record  a case of lynching  and Tuhins family, too, did not accept Soumi. 																								The marriage soured soon and police said they had picked up allegations that Tuhins family made life difficult for Soumi. She filed for a divorce last year.																								Soumi then returned to her parents home, near Gariahat, and rejoined school. But she would keep in touch with Tuhin and meet him occasionally. Saturday turned out to be her final rendezvous.

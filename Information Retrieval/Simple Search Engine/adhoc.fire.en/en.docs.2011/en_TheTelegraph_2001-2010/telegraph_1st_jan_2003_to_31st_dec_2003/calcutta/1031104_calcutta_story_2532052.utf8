 Tuesday, November 04, 2003 				 Court rap on road upkeep
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The public works department (PWD) on Monday assured Calcutta High Court that the stretch of Grand Trunk Road, between Howrah and Serampore, would be repaired by November 30. 																								Justice K.J. Sengupta of the high court, even after the PWD assurance, passed an order asking three advocates  Subroto Mukherjee, Saptangshu Bose and D.P. Mukherjee  to visit GT Road and its approach roads from Howrah and Hooghly after November 30 and file a report stating whether they were fit for plying vehicles or not.																								The directive came on the basis of a petition filed by Jaswant Rakshit, a resident of Howrah, alleging that GT Road, particularly between Howrah and Serampore, was in a bad shape and a major mishap was just waiting to happen. The petition also alleged that the PWD was not maintaining the road properly.																								Rakshits petition also alleged that the approach roads of the highway from Howrah, Bally and Uttarpara, in Hooghly, were not being maintained by the respective municipal bodies. He alleged the civic bodies were extracting taxes from the people but ignoring their needs. 																								On the basis of the petition, the judge asked the commissioner of Howrah Municipal Corporation and officers of Bally, Uttarpara and Konnagar municipalities to file reports on the condition of the approach roads and to state what steps the civic bodies had taken with regard to the development of the roads.

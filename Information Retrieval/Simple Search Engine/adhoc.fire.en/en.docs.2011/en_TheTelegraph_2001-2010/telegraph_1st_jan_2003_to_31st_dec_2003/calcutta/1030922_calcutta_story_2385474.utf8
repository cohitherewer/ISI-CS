 															- Camp throws up stress-related fitness faults in sedentary force A STAFF REPORTER			How fit are our police officers? The answer, to put it politely, is staring us in the face. Long hours in office and precious little exercise have left the police brass far from fit and quite stressed out.																								The Indian Police Service Officers Association, on a drive to check the fitness levels of its members, has diagnosed a majority of senior officers with at least a bad back caused mainly due to unscientific exercise regimens followed by them for the past few decades.																								We have prescribed the correct method of exercise to several officers who attended a camp this weekend. Their problems are not acute, but they are suffering from various stress-related problems, said neurosurgeon Indrajit Roy.																								The camp, organised by the Park Neurosciences Centre (PNC), saw more than 40 IPS officers evaluating their fitness levels within neurological and endrocrinological parameters. Roy and neurosurgeon Sandip Chatterjee were there with endocrinologist Sudip Chatterjee, along with a host of physicians, to put the officers through the paces.																								Since their work is pretty sedentary now, compared to what they used to do when they were younger, the results are showing in the form of back and other allied problems, said Chatterjee.																								Several IPS officers, including special additional commissioner of police (administration) Jogesh Chattopadhyay, special additional commissioner of police (traffic) Sandhi Mukherjee, deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Sanjoy Mukherjee, IG (prisons) Joydeb Chakraborty and the IPS association president Tapan Chattopadhyay, were present at the camp.

Since all off us lead a hectic life, with exercise not figuring on our priority list, a series of health camps could prove vital, said Tapan Chattopadhyay, announcing the next meet for younger officers. Deb Kumar Mukherjee of PNC said  the officers were very keen to know about their fitness  levels. Some, he added, were surprised by the findings and  were all ears for some simple suggestions

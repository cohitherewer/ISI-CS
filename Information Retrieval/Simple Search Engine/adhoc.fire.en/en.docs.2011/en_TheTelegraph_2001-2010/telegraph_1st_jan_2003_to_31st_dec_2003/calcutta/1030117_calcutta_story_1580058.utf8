	 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  Prime  consultant CMDA Partner  A  host of private players  The buzz had been there in business  circles for some time now  the projects, the pitches and  theparks were leading up to something big. And on Thursday,  chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee set speculation to  rest by unveiling a vital chapter of his great Bengal dream   Digital Destination, eastern Indias first information  technology (IT) township, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.																								Modelled on the lines of Hyderabads much-hyped hi-tech city for all things IT, Digital Destination is billed to be a Rs 116-crore affair. The township will be spread over nearly 70 acres at Nonadanga. CMDA is the primary consultant to the mega project for which several private players will be roped in for funds and execution.																								The chief minister met urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and CMDA officials at Writers Buildings, on Thursday, and gave them the go-ahead after being highly impressed by a video presentation of the concept plan by CMDA officials. Bhattacharjee directed his digital dream team to do whatever was required to turn this into a model IT project.																								Announcing the principal features of the township, minister Asok Bhattacharya said, following the meeting, that it would house everything related to IT. 																								Bhattacharya went on to explain: As IT is emerging as the major industrial sector in West Bengal and more and more entrepreneurs are asking for land in and around the city to set up IT-based industries, we have decided to develop a vast area to meet these demands. The concept of the project is to accommodate all IT-related matters within the boundaries of an integrated complex.																								The state government, however, has shelved its earlier plans to construct a habitat centre following its decision to develop a full-fledged IT township. The proposed centre, which too was a brainchild of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, was to have come up on EM Bypass over 10 acres.																								At Digital Destination, the manufacturing unit will come up on a 10-acre plot and accommodate a large number of entrepreneurs. The area will be exclusively earmarked for the development of software units, export-processing concerns, information centres, exhibition-cum-promotion centres, sales counters and packaging units.																								To make it a one-stop point for the IT industry, there will also be a residential complex to account for the housing requirements of entrepreneurs and their employees, an auditorium and diverse utility services like banks, post offices, cyber cafs, milk booths, telephone offices and even a fire station.																								In Hyderabad and Bangalore, there are integrated complexes exclusively for IT-related activities. We have already constructed several buildings in and around Salt Lake to provide space to IT entrepreneurs. But this will be an integrated complex, said Bhattacharya.																								The CMDA will provide the land and private players will take care of the investment. Many private parties have shown interest to be partners of the project. We shall select them after verifying their track records, said Bhattacharya.

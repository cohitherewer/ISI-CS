 The aftermath: Posters and wood being  set on fire after a meeting at the Brigade Parade Grounds				 																																																																				 The report Auto pilots turbulent times for traffic (Metro, March 6) shows how much the ruling Left Front is being pressurised by the Citu to allow more auto-rickshaws to ply. While the government had decided to restrict the number at 10,000, autos have already touched the 15,000 mark and the number is likely to go up to 20,000. The State Transport Authority and the transport minister, in their concern for unemployed youths, are forgetting the condition of the citys traffic system, which is only getting worse.				 																																													On the flip side, deputy commissioner of traffic M.K. Singh needs to give a second thought before slamming auto-rickshaws for traffic mismanagement. The chaos is also due to inept traffic police. 				 																																													Gunjeet Wadhwa,				 																																													Behala.				 																																																																				There are various causes for the degradation of the Brigade Parade Grounds, some of which have been cited by the NGO quoted in After the assault, a breather for Brigade (Metro, March 7). It is true that both the Army, responsible for its upkeep, and the police, keepers of law and order, become powerless once political bigwigs start calling the shots. If trees on the Maidan are being chopped, it cannot be the work of just the men wielding the axe. They must be carrying out orders. Can we afford to keep scores of policemen on guard to check such nuisance or Armymen, who are already tired with fighting insurgency? Under such circumstances, a way out is imposing an entry fee. But who will pay the gatekeeper? May be the Ground should be shut altogether to common people.				 																																													M.G. Kaimal,				 																																													Palakkad, Kerala.				 																																													lRallies, political and otherwise, have ruined the green Maidan. NGOs and private companies must step in to restore and conserve whatever is left.				 																																													Naren Sen,				 																																													Santragachhi.				 																																																																				The report Court rap for Board delay (Metro, March 1) is a glaring example of criminal neglect by a section of corrupt employees of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. This is not just callousness, but an irritating childish play with the career of 34 students. The errant staff must be given exemplary punishment. 				 																																													Mohan Lal Sarkar,				 																																													Budge Budge.				 																																																																				 The report Hospital home for homeless (Metro, March 8) was a reminder that the social structure of our country is disintegrating. Children are expected to look after their parents in old age. Its sad if they leave them in hospitals instead. Its also impossible for any government to control this trend and look after the rising number of destitute people.				 																																													A. Purushothaman, 				 																																													BBD Bag.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Level tram tracks to curb car chaos (Metro, March 10), it is surprising that the transport department has decided to level the tram tracks with the road. Tram tracks are at a higher level to safeguard alighting passengers. This step will only increase accidents. 				 																																													Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																													Nayapatty Road.				 																																																																				Apropos the report Cigarette scorch for tease protest (Metro, March 5), women are not safe on the streets due to the alarming rise of eve-teasing. Most cases are not registered in fear of the consequences. 				 																																													Sunil Banerjee,				 																																													VIP Road.				 																																																																				It is good to learn that a Calcutta-Mumbai hotline has been established to develop a standardised treatment for cancer in the city (Cancer cure by handbook, Metro, March 6).				 																																													Prahlad Agarwala,				 																																													Nadia.				 																																																																				The report Young amp; hectic, risk heart  (Metro, March 7), should serve as an eye-opener for those who lead a fast and unregulated life. 				 																																													S. Ram,				 																																													Purba Putiary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 From the fairways, hungry fangs and fatal forays
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Rampant undergrowth at the RCGC after the five-month closure. The foliage is being blamed for harbouring jackals																								The day of the jackal spells terror for the residential belt bordering our oldest fairways. A section of residents from the Tollygunge neighbourhood descended on Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) on Sunday, alleging that two persons had died of jackal bite and at least 10 had suffered injuries in the past few weeks. The jackals, they alleged, had enjoyed a free run of the unkempt greens when the club was closed for five months due to union versus management trouble.																								Going hungry behind closed gates, the animals had started stealing into the residential zone, through various gaps in the club wall, and had bitten several unsuspecting victims. South 24-Parganas deputy superintendent of police (town) Humayun Kabir confirmed that such a complaint had been received. The matter is being investigated, he added.																								 Sundays demonstrators, led by Trinamul Congress councillor Shyamali Bhadra and Tollygunge Nagarik Parishad general secretary Subrata Chaudhuri, demanded compensation for those killed by the jackal bites and the cost of vaccination for the injured.																								The protesters left after meeting RCGC chief executive officer M.M. Singh, who later admitted that one of the deaths had been caused by a jackal. I met the family of the lone victim, said Singh, adding that a decision on the unfortunate incident would be taken after discussions with other club officials.																								Singh blamed the recent five-month cessation of work, sparked by union trouble, as the undergrowth could not be cleared for the period. But things are improving now, he added, with the operation to clear the undergrowth being taken up on a war-footing.																								With the club shut, the starved jackals would slip out of the club grounds in search of food. Residents of the adjoining area, often mistaking them for dogs, would try and shoo them away, and pay the price. Even after the club has reopened, the animals have continued to stalk the locality.																								As Paltu Som found out, tragically. A resident of neighbouring Arabindanagar, Som was brushing his teeth early on November 6 just outside his home when he was allegedly bitten by a jackal. The father of two  14-year-old Gaguli and 10-year-old Popo  was first taken to MR Bangur Hospital. But as the neighbourhood hospital did not have the wherewithal to deal with the case, he was shifted to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital the same day. Here, too, he could not be treated properly and Som was shifted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beleghata. By then, it was too late. Not responding to treatment, he died on November 13, cried his wife, Alo.																								Kasem Ali, of Madartala, was the first victim, alleged the protestors. He, too, had been taken from Bangur to Sambhunath Pandit to ID Hospital, where he died on November 30. Club CEO Singh, however, said he had been told by local residents that Kasem had died of tetanus after suffering a cut from a rusted piece of iron.																								Tollygunge Nagarik Parishad members went on to allege that 10 other residents of the area had been bitten by jackals this month.

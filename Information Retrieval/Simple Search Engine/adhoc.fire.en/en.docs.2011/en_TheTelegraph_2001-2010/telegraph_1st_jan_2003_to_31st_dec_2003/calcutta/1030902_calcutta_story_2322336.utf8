 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 31-year-old woman was knocked down by a Matador at the Bangur Avenue-VIP Road crossing on Monday morning. She was admitted to RG Kar Medical College for treatment. The driver could not be arrested. This is the eighth accident of its kind to occur within a span of six months on a kilometre-and-a-half stretch between Golaghata and Bangur Avenue. The earlier mishaps were all fatal. 																								According to police, the accident occurred at around 7.45 am when Debi Chakrabarty was returning home after dropping her daughter at a local school. As she was about to cross VIP Road, the vehicle hit her. 																								Office-goers and local people first took the woman to a nursing home from where she was shifted to RG Kar Medical College. Soon afterwards, people blocked VIP Road demanding that traffic police be posted in the area. The road was blocked from 8.15 am to 9.30 am. It was withdrawn after police intervened. Office-goers and passengers headed for Dum Dum airport had a tough time. 																								People said though the area is accident-prone, no traffic policeman is in sight even during peak hours. The traffic signal installed by local people was pulled down by the Public Works Department. 																								Two traffic guards used to operate the signal. The signals at the Lake Town-VIP Road crossing, too, are not functional, they complained. 																								In consonance with locals, Ajay Nand, additional superintendent of police, said the area badly needed a traffic signal. Local councillors blamed South Dum Dum municipal authorities for the fiasco. Councillor Mriganka Bhattacharjee said he had funded the traffic signal. It was removed for political reasons.

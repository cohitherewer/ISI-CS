 Saturday, December 27, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Salman Khan You are generous by nature. Your best moments are those spent with thinkers. You are very receptive to ideas and a quick learner. Your common sense can throw up solutions to every problem, if you are not too lazy to use it. Your sense of humour never fails you. The year ahead signifies cooperation, though some people may not want to compromise.  Kusum Bhandari

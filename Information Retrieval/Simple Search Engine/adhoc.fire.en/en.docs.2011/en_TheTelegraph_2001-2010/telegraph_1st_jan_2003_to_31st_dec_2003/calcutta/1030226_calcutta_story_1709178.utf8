The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, February 26, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The deplorable condition of Taratala and Hyde Road  in the citys industrial belt  reflects the apathy of the government towards developing this important zone. Several reputed companies are located in this belt and the PWD should take up repairs. Vehicles often break down while negotiating these bumpy stretches. Investors will not be too keen on pumping money into the state if the condition of thoroughfares does not improve.				 																																									T.R. Anand,				 																																									Budge Budge.				 																																									Chicken being slaughtered in the open is a gory sight. I have often seen children cringing while passing through blood-splattered pavements with the entrails of the birds lying around. The stench pervading the surroundings is unbearable. Such shops were removed from the Manicktala crossing area some months ago. But they are back in business and will probably continue for a long time. The problem can be solved only if people boycott these shops.				 																																									Lalita Agarwal,				 																																									Bagmari Lane.

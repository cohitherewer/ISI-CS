The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, January 06, 2003 				 Trio netted with drugs, Pak notes
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Three youths, aged between 20 and 24, were rounded up on Sunday morning for carrying drugs and unaccounted-for foreign currency. Deputy commissioner of police, central, Zulfiquar Hasan said his men on morning patrol noticed the trio moving suspiciously near the Sealdah flyover and stopped them. 																								We found drugs on them. During interrogation, they admitted being part of a gang that robs and snatches valuables from people across the country, Hasan added.																								According to the police, the arrested youths were wanted in connection with robberies in Jaipur, Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi and a few thousand Pakistani currency notes were recovered from them. The three could not explain why they were carrying the notes or what they would use them for.																								Keeping their identities under wraps, Hasan said the three were residents of Thane, in Maharashtra. Calcutta Police is getting in touch with its counterparts in Delhi, Mumbai and Jaipur. An officer of the special branch said the Mumbai police had tipped them off about these youths on the run.																								For the police in Muchipara, however, Sunday proved less productive, with three criminals managing to give them the slip. A Muchipara police team, acting on a tip-off that five dacoits had gathered on B.B. Ganguly Street, raided the hideout in the afternoon, but drew a blank. Instead, the cops picked up Sajamal Fakir, 25, and Bishu Koley, 29, and recovered some arms and ammunition from them. Fakir is from Barasat, while Bishu lives on Canal West Road. We are on the look-out and will get the criminals who fled, Hasan said.

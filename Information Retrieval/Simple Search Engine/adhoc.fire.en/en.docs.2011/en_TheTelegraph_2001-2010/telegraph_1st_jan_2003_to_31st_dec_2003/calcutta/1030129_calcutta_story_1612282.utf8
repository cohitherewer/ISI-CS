 Wednesday, January 29, 2003 				 Hannah and Hanna
																								The play has two central characters: Hannah is a teenage girl living in Margate. Hanna is an asylum-seeker who has been living there for over a year. Their acquaintance begins in conflict and mutual insult. A friendship develops cautiously through the (unsought) discovery that they are both singers  and both good singers. A political coup in Hannas country ensures her free return as she doesnt need asylum any more. In the summer Hannah and Hanna go there together. The country is in ruins. For different reasons, both girls are devastated by what they see. They return to Margate, the closest of friends. Hannah speaks passionately about both the country and the pity of asylum-seekers and refugees everywhere  and in Margate, in particular. The play movingly captures the kind of tensions and rivalry between incoming refugees and host communities now apparent almost all over the world. Hannahs peers find her attitude difficult to stomach , and reject her new identity by casting her out of their circle. Hanna is now free to return to her country but her summer visit has convinced her that she could never live there. She like England and she like Hannah. Written and directed by John Retallack for Company of Angels, UK, this play has been brought to the city by British Council and The Oberoi Grand, Calcutta. 																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

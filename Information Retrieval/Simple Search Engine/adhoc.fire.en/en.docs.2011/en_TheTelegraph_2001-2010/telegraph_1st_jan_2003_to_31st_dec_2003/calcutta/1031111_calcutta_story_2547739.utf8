				 	YASH KISHOR HEMANI Yash Kishor Hemani																									May have pushed a pause button to Yashs singing career, but theres no stopping this 18-year-old for whom lifes either a studio or a stage. Having started singing on stage from age nine, the boy born on the 12th day of the 12th month has won distinctions by the dozens and participated in shows by the hundreds.																									May not be what youd catch this DBPC singing sensation humming (though hes called just that by family and friends) or playing on the keyboard or the piano (which he has learnt for the past six years from the Royal School of Music), but our boy sure can belt out Bollywood with the best. Be it Mumbai, Ahmedabad or Cuttack, Yash has shared the spotlight with the likes of Babul Supriyo, Sunidhi Chauhan, Anuradha Paudwal and Usha Uthup.																									Reads long and lustrous. Best soloist in semi-classical and the most promising talent in Bosco Raag 2000; best singer in the Tetra Pak Talent Hunt involving 32 schools; the most outstanding performance out of 2,600 students in Bata Quest 2000; the Jain Sangeet Spardha crown for three consecutive years; the certificate of honour for outstanding talent as a singer in The Telegraph School Awards 2002; a place in Close-Up Antakshari on Zee TV and Aao Jhoomein Gayen on SABe TV																									Has been our Yash, lending his voice  and face  to a Gul Bahar Singh documentary dubbed Sixer, with Amrish Puri. Sung four songs in a cassette released by the Swaminarayan sect called Bal Sargam, released by a certain Mamta Banerjee. Sung and recorded for Kalyanji-Anandji...																									Are what he juggles, thanks to the support of his parents and his teachers. Having scored 88.8 per cent in his ICSE, he is now slogging it out for his ISC, with plans to pursue biotechnology and Bollywood. One for security, the other for his soul, one as livelihood, the other as life.																									Is how he wants to do it, with a motto reading destiny lies in my own hands. If destiny does do his bidding, Yash would be booking a berth in the Bollywood playback pantheon, and be a biotech boss to boot.

 Friday, May 16, 2003 				 Poison shots to wife push doctor in net
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A city-based doctor, who was allegedly slow-poisoning his wife by regularly injecting her with low-grade poison, has been finally arrested after the woman fell critically ill at her parents home at Nandan Park, in Thakurpukur. Sarmistha, wife of doctor Sudip Biswas, is battling for life in a private hospital in south Calcutta, where she was admitted by her parents and neighbours. 																								Sudip has been arrested on charges of trying to kill his wife by administering poisonous injections at his in-laws house. Thakurpukur police station officials said Sarmistha was married to Sudip, a resident of Bangur Avenue, two years ago. He was working for a nursing home before the marriage. 																								We will interrogate Sarmistha as soon as her condition stabilises, said Shyamal Ghosh, inspector in charge of Thakurpukur police station, on Thursday. Police sources said they had received reports that on earlier occasions, whenever Sarmistha fell ill, Sudip would inject her with low-grade poison. We are probing the veracity of the reports, an official said.																								Sudip was arrested on a complaint lodged by Manisha Dalui, Sarmisthas mother. Manisha said in her complaint that her daughter came to her Thakurpukur house on Saturday. The son-in-law followed at night. When Sarmistha complained of uneasiness, Sudip administered an injection but her condition deteriorated, Manisha said.																								Soon, Sarmistha started throwing up blood. She was rushed to a local nursing home, where she is still being treated.																								Officials investigating the case said a strain had developed between the couple six months ago. We have learnt that the couple was undergoing a financial crisis, which was affecting their relations, an official said.																								Police said the injection and needle used by Sudip were found in a bush behind the house. They were sent for forensic tests.																								Manisha alleged that Sudip often instigated his wife to kill herself because of their financial crisis. He would himself threaten to commit suicide, creating mental pressure on Sarmistha, Manisha said in her complaint. Sudip and Sarmistha would quarrel often over trivial matters.																								The night Sarmistha fell serious ill, Sudip was surprisingly polite and affectionate towards her. He pretended to administer the injection quickly to ease her pain, police said. Sudip was produced at Alipore court and remanded in custody for further investigations.

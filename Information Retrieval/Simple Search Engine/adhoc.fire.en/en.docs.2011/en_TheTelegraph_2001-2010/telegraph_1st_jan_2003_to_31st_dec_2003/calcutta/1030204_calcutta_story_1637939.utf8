 Banking on the blue blasters
 Sachin and Sehwag: The champ and the challenger Banking on the blue blastersSachin and Sehwag: The champ and the challengerAmaan and Ayaan Ali Bangash at Presidency College. Picture by Aranya SenAs D-Day approaches for Sourav and his Men in Blue, Indias cricket fans are keeping their fingers and toes crossed. But who are Young Metro readers pinning their hopes on? And which international giants do they see ruling the pitch? The player to watch out for this World Cup is what Time to Talk asked. The nominees are in, but the winner is awaitedlThe player to watch out for during the Cup in South Africa is Virendra Sehwag, the dashing new opener of the Indian team. His outstanding performance in New Zealand is proof enough that he will score well in the coming weeks. His contribution as a bowler adds to the excitement, ensuring that Indian fans will keep their eyes firmly on him.Sananda Sen,IIIrd year, Asutosh CollegelThe player to watch this World Cup is the Rawalpindi Express, otherwise known as Shoaib Akhtar. He is the only one in the Pakistan squad who is in full bloom despite the teams deteriorating form. After Wasim Akram, he is the only one who can drive the audience to the edge of its seat which each delivery.Saadia Sitwat,IIIrd year, B.Sc.lLike Pele and Maradona could win the World Cup for their country single-handedly, this is the time for our very own Little Master. He may be going through a lean phase now but like all the best players who always prove themselves on a big stage against the best opponents, this is the time for Sachin Tendulkar to prove once again that he is the best.Mayookh Sengupta,Jadavpur UniversitylThe player to watch out for this World Cup is definitely the Big Wall himself, Rahul Dravid. With his sound technique and cool head, Jammie will be playing a pivotal role. Coming in at number three, he will have to hold the innings together against the fastest of bowlers. Adding to his importance is the responsibility he has as wicket-keeper. But fans cant resist the charms of apna Sachin and Sehwag either.Aakash Kamal Misra,RCC, CalcuttalThe player to watch this World Cup is Mathew Hayden. This Australian, who fights for his team like a tiger protecting its den, is sure to blow every bowler away.Vivek Mukherjee,Class XI, St Thomas Boys lIts not Sachin and definitely not Sourav! The player to watch out for this World Cup is Rahul Dravid, our highest scorer in the last World Cup, on whose broad shoulders rest the aspirations of Indian cricket. He is the most consistent run-getter in the team and has pulled India out of trouble on numerous occasions. Although this time, he is entrusted with the additional responsibility of wearing the big gloves, we hope Dravid will help India realise its Ek Cup Aur goal.Piyal Mukherjee,1st Year, Institute of Engineering and ManagementlVirendra Sehwag is the man to watch. Viru can be a real danger for the opposing bowling line-up, beside turning his arm over as well. Dravid, who played so well in the last World Cup, cant be ignored and the South African skipper Shaun Pollock is another danger man.Vineeta Nair,Class XII, Modern High lFrom an Indian perspective, the player to watch out for this World Cup is Sachin Tendulkar. Batting at number four, he has a very important position. The maestro, who is an excellent runner between the wickets, can score a quickfire 30 or 40 runs with a few overs in hand, or can also play a sedate innings if he comes in early. The comforting effect he lends to the team enables dashing players like Sehwag to play their natural game.Pratyay Banerjee,Class XI, Patha Bhavan

	 Room with cine viewThe room assigned to the Jadavpur University Film Society has for long worn a deserted look. However, the spartan settings have recently been spruced up by a television set, a VCD player and a speaker. The Society has been revived by the efforts of three students  Kaushik Ananda Kirtaniya, Soumya Subhra Das and Sudipto Shankar Roy. It has already started screening two films every Saturday afternoon. The February line-up includes The Thin Red Line, Kolkata 71, Mahanagar and Komal Gandhar.While the funds have come from the varsity coffers, getting hold of classics remains a problem. The Film Studies department has, however, promised to provide the films and documentaries of our choice. Professors of the department will also pitch in with interactive sessions.And this is just the start. There are plans to instal a projector and launch a film magazine. Efforts are also on to link up with the Eisenstein Film Club in Gorky Sadan, Max Mueller Bhavan and the NFDC.  Aritro Ganguly,Jadavpur University

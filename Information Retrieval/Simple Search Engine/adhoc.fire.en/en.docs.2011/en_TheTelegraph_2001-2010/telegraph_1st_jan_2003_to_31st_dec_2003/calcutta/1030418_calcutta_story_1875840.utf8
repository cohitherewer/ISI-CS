 																											- 20-point strategy ahead to check fires, collapse of old buildings  SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The state government has started formulating a strategy and a new set of rules for the old buildings in congested areas like Burrabazar, Shyambazar and Gariahat, to prevent any major fire and house collapse.																								The decision follows a 20-point recommendation submitted by a six-member expert committee, formed to probe the devastating fire at the hosiery market in Burrabazars MG Road in December last year. The committee has also forwarded seven suggestions to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). 																								The committee, chaired by S.N. Sarkar, additional commissioner of police, submitted its report to the government last week. The recommendations include provision of a law which will make it mandatory for owners or occupiers in the congested areas to get the structural condition of the buildings checked by a qualified structural engineer after certain intervals. The CMC will also conduct a regular check on the structural condition of the buildings and their electrical installations.																								Some of the other recommendations are : - Owners and occupiers of old  and dilapidated buildings, especially in Burrabazar, must  get their structures rebuilt, leaving the mandatory open  space and abiding by fire services norms - Teams, comprising representatives  of the state government and CMC, must be formed to inspect  the old and dilapidated buildings at regular intervals.  It will be mandatory for the owners to implement the suggestions  given by the teams and defaulters should be penalised - There should be proper in-house  security arrangements to prevent intentional damage - Fire-safety measures, like an  alarm system, ventilation, escape routes and sources of  water should be incorporated in the building plans and be  reviewed at the time of renewal of trade licences. Electrical  installations in markets must be checked regularly by a  competent authority - Additions and alterations by  occupiers of old buildings must be discouraged by the CMC  and action taken against those flouting the ban. All unauthorised  construction must be torn down - Market complexes in Burrabazar  must have an underground or overhead water reservoir of  at least one lakh-litre capacity - The CMC must repair all the  fire hydrants in Burrabazar - Storage of inflammable goods  and setting up a canteen or tea-stall using a gas stove  should be strictly banned																								Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said his department, along with the municipal affairs department, will finalise the new rules for congested areas within a month.

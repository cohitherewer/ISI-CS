		 Megha  Sharda  Megha Sharda																									Is what Megha sometimes dreams of becoming, as she loves fixing all things mechanical. But she has far too much going her way to allow that particular dream to come true. Her other dream  of getting through IIT, completing a Ph.D and becoming a research scientist has a far greater chance of becoming reality.																									And the answer is simple. This consistent class  and school  topper has brains by the bucketful and commitment by the crate-full. The student of Class XII topped Ashok Hall with the 92.8 per cent she secured in the CBSE Class X exams. Her ability to juggle responsibilities earned her the head girl badge as well as a certificate of honour in the best all-round student category at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence held earlier this month.																									Went into her achievements in a number of public examinations like the Regional Math Olympiad, the KVPY Scholarship exam, All India Science Talent Search, All India Reynolds Scholarship exam and the ETC exams conducted by the University of New South Wales, winning distinctions in English and math. It was at the National Science Olympiad that this perfectionist stood first in the state, qualifying for the nationals in May 2002. She represented the school in Mathworx, a math workshop organised by IIT-Kharagpur every year.																									In school, is where this workaholic, as her friends call her, is happiest. Intra and inter-school events are the head girls responsibility. She was behind the school fest Zeitgeist 2003, as head of the Students Council. She is on the school quiz team, attending quizzes and fests regularly. Photography and computer contests also tempt the 17-year-old to sign up. 																									And a scientific bent of mind go hand in hand as far as this Piscean is concerned. The gal used to learn Bharatanatyam and Hindustani classical music till age 13. Megha, who helped start up the school nature and informal quiz club, was involved in Virasat, Spicmacays annual festival, part of which was held in her school. This former member of the Girl Guides signed up for the Alzheimers awareness programme, too.

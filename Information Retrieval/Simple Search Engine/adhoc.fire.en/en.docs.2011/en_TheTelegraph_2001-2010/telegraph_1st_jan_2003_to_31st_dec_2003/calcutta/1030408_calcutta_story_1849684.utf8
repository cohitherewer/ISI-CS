The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, April 08, 2003 				 Char Duar
 Four women from the general strata of society: a mother and her three daughters, and some others surrounding them. Their happiness and sorrows, their yearnings, their desires and their frustrations are all very familiar to us. But there are momentary flashes that tend to disturb the apparent calmness, the equilibrium of our known world. Once confronted by antagonistic and insurmountable odds, a protagonist is forced to take up cudgels. And then each ones battle becomes part of that universal strife to establish ones identity and each one is a hero. Based on a Marathi play by Prashant Dalvi, this Gandhar production is directed by Meghnad Bhattacharya. The cast include Bijoylakshmi Barman, Manasi Sinha, Meghna Lahiri and Mandira Bandopadhyay.																								When: Tomorrow at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

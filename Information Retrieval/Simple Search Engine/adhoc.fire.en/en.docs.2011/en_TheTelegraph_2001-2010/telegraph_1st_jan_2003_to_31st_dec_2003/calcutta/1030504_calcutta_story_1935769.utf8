The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, May 04, 2003 				 IT firms plot to combat disaster 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Be it after a terror strike or a fire, managing the IT-set up in an organisation is one of the crucial tasks facing corporate India in todays uncertain world. So investing in IT alone is not enough. The companies must have a well-laid down business continuity plan to minimise the impact of disaster.																								Representatives from government, industry and academia got together on Saturday to discuss the importance of disaster management. Organised jointly by city-based IT infrastructure company Indicon Management and Computer Associates, the seminar also focused on various technical issues involved in data storage and management. 																								The West woke up to disaster management following 9/11, but there is little awareness on this subject in our country. Though Calcutta is the hub of IT in eastern India, the city lags way behind Delhi and Mumbai in terms of awareness and preparedness on disaster management, said Kaustav Majumdar, chief executive officer, Indicon Management. 																								The four-year-old IT company, which has recently made a foray into disaster management, organised the seminar to bridge the information gap. A.R. Thakur, pro vice-chancellor, Jadavpur University, Subir Roy of National Informatics Centre and Anjan Bose, company knowledge manager, Haldia Petrochemicals, spoke at the seminar. 																								Besides helping some city-based corporate houses, the fledgling IT firm has also worked for the state commercial tax directorate to put in place a disaster management application. Shortly we will start offering services in network and security management, added Majumdar.																								Road mishap 																								Two persons were killed and three injured when a private bus lost control and hit pedestrians on Jessore Road on Saturday morning. Satyan Ghosh, 50, and Prabhakar Dutta, 44, died on the spot, Ajay Nand, additional superintendent of police, said. The accident occurred when the bus on route 46 tried to take a sharp turn at the crossing of Jessore Road and VIP Road near gate number one of the airport.

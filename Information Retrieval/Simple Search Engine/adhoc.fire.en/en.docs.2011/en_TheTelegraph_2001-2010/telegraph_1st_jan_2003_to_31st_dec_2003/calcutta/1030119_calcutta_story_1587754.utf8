 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 Rights panel seeks death report
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								The National Human Rights Commission has sought a detailed report from director-general of police Dinesh Vajpai on the death of Soumitra Biswas, a fourth year student of RG Kar Medical College. 																								Soumitra was found dead in his hostel room on August 25, 2001. The Prime Ministers Office (PMO) instructed the assistant secretary (judicial) to submit the details of the death after Soumitras mother, Sabita, wrote to the central home ministry, demanding a CBI probe into the matter. In the letter (467/25/2002-2003 OC), the rights commission made it clear that if the report was not submitted within four weeks, it might take up the case on a suo-motu basis. 																								When contacted on Saturday, principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, Indrajit Roy, said: The incident did not occur during my tenure. But I shall look into the matter. Chairman of the state rights commission Mukulgopal Mukherjee said they were still investigating the case.																								The death had created ripples as some RG Kar students launched an agitation alleging that a simple case of suicide was being unnecessarily blown out of proportion.

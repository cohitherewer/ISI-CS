 Dui gharanar mohana
  Spandan, in association with Kanakangi, hosts a novel dance programme, Dui Gharanar Mohana (a blend of two dance styles)  Bharata Natyam and Goudiya Nritya. The entire programme has been divided into two parts: the first part features three items in Bharata Natyam style and the second half features three items in Goudiya Nritya form. The items will be presented by Ambali Praharaj, who has also choreographed the Bharata Natyam pieces: Padam, Javeli and an item based on Rabindranath Tagores Mamo chitte niti nrittye. Padam is based on abhinaya (acting) and Javeli is set on Sringar rasa that explores the myriad moods of Krishna as he teases the Gopis and steals their hearts while polishing off their butter. The first part of the programme concludes with Tillana, a pure dance item. In the second half, Praharaj, along with her troupe members Mou Barik, Chaiti Ghosh, Tanushree Saha, Madhuparna Chakraborty, Ritwika Ghosh and Sanchari Adhikary  will present Goudiya nritya comprising Ganesh Vandana (offering prayers to Lord Ganesh), to be followed by Alapchari and finally Hey Parthasarathi, an item based on Nazrulgeeti. The Goudiya nritya items have been choreographed by Dr Mohua Mukherjee. When: Today at 6.30 pmWhere:  Copyright

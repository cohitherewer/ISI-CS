 																											- Widow missing, sons become bus cleaners; court raps PF office for loss of papers OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Their father died 25 years ago after a cardiac arrest. Sixteen years ago, their mother, who had become mentally unsound by then, just disappeared from home one morning.																								Poverty forced them to drop out of school and take up cleaners jobs at the Garia bus depot. They would never have come to such a pass had the provident fund (PF) authorities not lost their fathers papers and failed to pay them their dues. 																								When they finally went to court to claim their dues, courtesy a neighbourhood lawyer, their case was buried under the system for three long years. At long last, luck seems to have smiled on Swapan (now 33) and Tapan (30) Biswas. The case came up for hearing  for the first time  on Wednesday, and Calcutta High Court asked the PF commissioners office to speed up things. It directed the PF commissioner to explain the 25-year delay in clearing the dues.																								But, for the two brothers, all this may have come just a bit too late in the day. Given their limited education, it will be difficult for them to land better jobs.																								Swapan and Tapans father, Shakhanath Biswas, was an accountant with a small private firm in Lalbazar. He died in 1978 at 45, when his sons were eight and five, respectively. His widow was a little mentally unbalanced. But she still tried to make both ends meet. However, with their meagre savings drying up, education became a luxury. First Swapan and then Tapan were forced to take up cleaning jobs at Garia bus stand. 																								The widow went to her husbands former office to plead for a job. She was denied that but was told about her husbands PF money  Rs 53,000. She was given the relevant documents.																								According to the affidavit filed before the court, the widow visited the PF office several times. Time and again, she was told to come back another day and, ultimately, the PF office allegedly told her that she stood little chance of getting her dues as the relevant papers were missing.																								This, perhaps, was too much for the woman to bear. She disappeared one day in 1986.																								In 1989, advocate Subrata Mukhopadhyay bought a house near Swapan and Tapans home. But it was not till the 1990s that they met the advocate in a bus.																								Mukhopadhyay filed a petition but it took three years for the case to be heard on Wednesday. Justice Girish Gupta directed the PF office to explain why the duo  and, earlier, the mother  had not been paid their dues. He told the office to file the relevant documents by March 21.

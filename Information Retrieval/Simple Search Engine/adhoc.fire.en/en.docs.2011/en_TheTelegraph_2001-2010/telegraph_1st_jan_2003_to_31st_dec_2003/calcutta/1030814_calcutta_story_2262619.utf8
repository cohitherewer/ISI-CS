 Thursday, August 14, 2003 				 Students block road for lights
 A STAFF REPORTER																								More than 100 students and a dozen teachers of Patwaribagan Girls School hit the road on Wednesday morning, demanding immediate restoration of water supply and electricity, which they had been deprived of for three days. School officials blamed a snag in the local transformer. A CESC official, however, said the power line may have been cut over non-payment of bills. 																								The blockade, at the crossing of APC Road and Swarnamoyee Road, crippled traffic for two hours. Senior officers of the local police station had to convince the agitators to call off the blockade.

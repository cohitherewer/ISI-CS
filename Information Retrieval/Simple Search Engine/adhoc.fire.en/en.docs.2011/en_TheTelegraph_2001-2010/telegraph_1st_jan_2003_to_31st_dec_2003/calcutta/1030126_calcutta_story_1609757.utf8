 A STAFF REPORTER																								An inmate of the government-run Liluah Home for Destitute Women, who was allegedly raped two years ago, died in a hospital on Saturday morning. 																								Sources said the 25-year-old woman had been suffering from abdomen-related problems and was under treatment since January 9 at Howrah General Hospital. She was admitted after the doctor of the Home diagnosed her with acute low blood pressure, the home authorities said. 																								A resident of Jadavpur, the woman was rescued by local police from a brothel. A rape case was started on the basis of her statement. She had been living in the Liluah home for the past two years. We got in touch with her family but no one wanted to take her back, home authorities said.																								nBorder traffic: Vehicular movement at the Petrapole border became normal on Saturday following a meeting among truck-workers, the North 24-Parganas district administration and the Border Security Force during the day. The strike was called after a truck-driver, allegedly beaten up by some BSF personnel, died on Wednesday.

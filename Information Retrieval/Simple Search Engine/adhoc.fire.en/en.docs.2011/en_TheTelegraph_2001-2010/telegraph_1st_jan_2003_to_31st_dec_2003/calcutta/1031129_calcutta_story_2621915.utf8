The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, November 29, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Anna Nicole Smith, model.  You are connected with your inner self and, hence, at peace.  Your warmth and brightness draw people. You have perfected  the art of weighing options before taking action. You sense  of judgment is impeccable. Natural beauty appeals to you;  its also your key to relaxation.  Kusum Bhandari

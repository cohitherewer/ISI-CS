				 																																									Taxi drivers face a serious problem with parking their vehicles. Lack of space often forces them to garage the cars temporarily near busy road intersections, blocking traffic movement. The transport department should consider demarcating parking zones for taxis. This will also reduce chances of mishaps.

A few sports-loving youths in Salt Lake have converted a public road into a badminton court, though there is no dearth of playgrounds or parks in the area. They start their games at about 10 pm and continue till late in the night. This has been going on for quite some time and the youths are least concerned about the inconvenience caused to the residents, who are spending sleepless nights due to the noise and bright lights. The local civic authorities should put a stop to such things. Residents must also unite and protest.				 																																									P.K. Mukhopadhyay,				 																																									Salt Lake.

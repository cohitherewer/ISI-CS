 Sunday, July 20, 2003 				 CU cracks admission norm whip
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Students and guardians gather at Presidency College to collect admission forms on Saturday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								A day after the announcement of Higher Secondary (HS) results, Calcutta University cautioned its affiliated colleges on Saturday that it would take stern action if they are found admitting students to under-graduate courses disregarding the new admission guidelines of the university.																								The university has thoroughly revised the procedure for admission to the BA, B.Sc and B.Com (honours and general) courses and increased the cut-off percentages for students seeking admission to such courses.																								The syndicate of Calcutta University (CU), the highest policy-making body, took a number of decisions in June to improve academic standards in its 200 affiliated colleges.																								We have already informed the colleges about the changes in the admission procedure. Now that the HS results are declared, we will start sending the circular to all the institutions, said Shyamal Kumar Sarkar, secretary, CU under-graduate council.																								According to the new guidelines, students seeking admission to honours courses will have to score a minimum of 45 per cent marks in aggregate and 50 per cent in the subject in which he/she wishes to major. Till 2002, students were required to obtain either 45 per cent in aggregate or 50 per cent in the subject.																								CU has also asked colleges not to admit a single student beyond their permissible capacity.																								Many colleges were found to have admitted students beyond their capacities. We also found them taking in students with scores much below the cut-off percentage in the honours courses. We will no longer allow such irregularities, said Sarkar.																								A day after the HS results were declared, students thronged city colleges to collect admission forms. Serpentine queues had formed in front of Presidency and Loreto colleges where admission forms were distributed on Saturday.																								Bethune, Maulana Azad, Brabourne, Asutosh and Rani Birla colleges, which will distribute forms from next week, were also flooded with queries about the admission criteria fixed by the institutions.																								Unlike the previous years, many colleges in Calcutta have decided to expedite the admission process and started distributing forms from Saturday. 																								The move follows a CU directive asking colleges to complete the admission process within two months from the date of publication of the results. All colleges will have to close admission by September 18. We will not grant the registration of a single student if we find he or she has taken admission after the deadline, Sarkar added.

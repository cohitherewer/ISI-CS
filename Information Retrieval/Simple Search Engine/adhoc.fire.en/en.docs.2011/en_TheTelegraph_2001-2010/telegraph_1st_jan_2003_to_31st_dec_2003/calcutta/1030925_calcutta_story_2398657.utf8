 Thursday, September 25, 2003 				 Door defect hits Metro schedule
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The pledge of a smooth ride for Puja revellers received a jolt on Wednesday, with a technical snag in a rake disrupting Metro Railway services at peak hour. 																								Trains were late and several pairs had to be rescheduled after a rake had to be withdrawn. Its door-opening system had developed a fault. Metro officials said the trouble was detected at 4.40 pm on the Up line at Sovabazar station. A Metro spokesperson said the train was taken to Dum Dum and since the Down line doors were functioning properly, it was returned to Tollygunge.																								Fearing problems, the Metro employees sent the rake to the carshed. However, as there was no arrangement for alternative rakes, several trains had to be rescheduled. As a result, timings went haywire, much to the harassment of commuters. The situation did not improve till late in the evening.

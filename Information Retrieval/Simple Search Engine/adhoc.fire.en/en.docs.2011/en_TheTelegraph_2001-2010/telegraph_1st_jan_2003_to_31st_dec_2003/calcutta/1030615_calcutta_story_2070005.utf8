 Sunday, June 15, 2003 				 Mamata salvo at rebel councillors
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee held a meeting on Saturday night with all 10 mayor-in-council members of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and expressed her displeasure over the way some of them were disobeying mayor Subrata Mukherjee after their reinstatement in the new council on Wednesday.																								Mamata has reportedly pointed fingers in this regard at Pradip Ghosh, Mala Roy and Javed Ahmed Khan, who were also responsible for the assault on municipal commissioner Debasish Som early this week. 																								The Trinamul leader is said to have asked all council members not to criticise the mayor as it might harm the partys prospects in the election to the 14 municipalities on June 22.  Flyover mishap: Rashid  Khan, 30, suffered head injuries when a concrete slab fell  off the flyover under construction at AJC Bose Road on Friday  night. The incident occurred at Beckbagan when Khan was  on his way home. He was admitted to a local nursing home,  police said.

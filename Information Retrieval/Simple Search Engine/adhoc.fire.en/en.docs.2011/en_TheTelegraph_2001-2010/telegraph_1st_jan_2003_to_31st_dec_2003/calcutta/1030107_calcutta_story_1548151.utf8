The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, January 07, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 					 Nicolas Cage. First eight months of 2003 will be rewarding in terms of relationships. An opportunity may come after September. At work, you will be efficient. You have a tendency to take a gloomy view of life. You are dependable.  Kusum Bhandari

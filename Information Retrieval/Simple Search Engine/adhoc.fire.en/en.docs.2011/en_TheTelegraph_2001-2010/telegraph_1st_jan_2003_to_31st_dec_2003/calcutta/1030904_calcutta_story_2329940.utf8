The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, September 04, 2003 				 Model answers mar results
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Around 15,000 students, who appeared for Calcutta Universitys (CU) B.Com examination this year, were victims of wrong evaluation, a senior examiner alleged on Wednesday. Benoy Bhushan Chakraborty of Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration said he had brought the matter to the notice of the authorities, but no action was taken.																								According to Chakraborty, this years management paper had three questions, adding up to 38 marks of the total of 100 for the entire paper, for which the model answers CU provided to examiners were wrong and misleading.																								This means that examiners who based their evaluation on the model answers provided by the university (as they were bound to do) gave marks for the wrong answers, he said. Conversely, those who answered correctly were given fewer marks, he added.																								Chakraborty said he had brought the matter to the authorities notice when he was examining the papers. CU officials admitted that this was the case. But, after inquiry, we could not agree with Chakrabortys views, a senior CU official involved in the evaluation procedure said. We, therefore, asked him to return his share of the answer-scripts, which he did, the official added.																								Many of Chakrabortys colleagues, however, supported his stance. The inquiry was conducted by university officials and included those who have no connection with the subject or the paper, one of them said. He added that this example of victimisation of students was going to be one of the major issues in the forthcoming polls to the CU senate.																								Democratic Teachers for Autonomy and Academic Freedom, an organisation independent of the majority of teachers loyal to the Left Front, has used this incident to show how the voice of reason is being muffled.																								Every aspect of administration in the university has been politicised and we intend to change things, said Pradip Datta, general secretary of the All-Bengal State Government College Teachers Association.																								Leaders of the Left-backed lobby admitted that all was not well within the organisation. Several new candidates had been put up this year, they said, due to an internal feud between two teacher leaders, one of them a former CPM Lok Sabha candidate.

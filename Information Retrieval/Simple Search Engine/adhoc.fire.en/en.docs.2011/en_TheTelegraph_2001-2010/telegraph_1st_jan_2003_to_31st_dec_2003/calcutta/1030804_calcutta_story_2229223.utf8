 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) has tied up with the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) to celebrate the 62nd death anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, that falls on August 8. Three tramcars carrying teachers and students of the universitys fine arts department will ply along various routes across the city, as part of the daylong programme.																								Students will hold street plays and recite and sing Tagores works in front of Esplanade, Kalighat, Gariahat and Nonapukur tram depots, said RBU vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee on Sunday. This is our way of paying tribute to the poet, she added. The vehicles, decked up with pictures of Tagore and quotations from his writings, will start from the RBUs Jorasanko campus, the vice-chancellor added.																								Before embarking on the journey, fine arts students will hold a brief cultural function on the Jorasanko campus, to be attended by the vice-chancellor and senior officials of the university.																								The CTC authorities will provide the tramcars free. CTC general manager S.N. Pal said on Sunday that the move would boost the century-old transport system. We will provide the best cars, so that the students can enjoy a hassle-free ride, he said, adding that the traffic wing has already been asked to choose the trams and prepare them for the programme.

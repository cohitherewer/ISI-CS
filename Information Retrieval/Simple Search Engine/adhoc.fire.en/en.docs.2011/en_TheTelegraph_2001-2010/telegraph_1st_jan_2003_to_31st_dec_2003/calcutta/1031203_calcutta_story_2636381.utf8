 Wednesday, December 03, 2003 				 Medical teachers minus interview
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 																								Twelve days after asking all medical teachers working on an ad hoc basis in teaching hospitals to appear before an interview panel between December 4 and 9, the state government, in a dramatic switch of plan, decided to select as many as 260 of them without any interview at all.																								On November 13, the government circulated a notice, directing all medical teachers of the West Bengal Medical Education Service holding the rank of assistant professors (ad hoc) and associate professors (ad hoc) to personally appear before the duly-constituted selection committee for interview on December 4-9 at NRS Medical College and Hospital. On November 25, barely nine days before the interview, the government released a list of over 260 medical teachers, confirming their appointment as regular assistant and associate professors.																								Explaining the decision, director of medical education C.R. Maiti said the candidates considered for the selection before the interview fitted the eligibility criteria and were, therefore, exempted from an interview. But the interviews for more vacant seats will take place as scheduled, he added.																								However, with 260 positions filled up, health department officials fear only a handful (about 50 more) is likely to be selected post-December 4. About 116 medical teachers up to the associate professor rank and 150-odd in the assistant professor category got the nod in the list and each one of them was informed overnight about the decision and directed to take immediate charge.

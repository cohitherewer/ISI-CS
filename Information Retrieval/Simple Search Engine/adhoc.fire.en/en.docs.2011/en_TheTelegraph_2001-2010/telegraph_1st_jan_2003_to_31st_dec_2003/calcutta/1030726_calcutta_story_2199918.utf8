 Saturday, July 26, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Sandra Bullock Your  glamour and style catch the eye. You are an emotional and  warm person. You have a well-developed intellect and associate  with peers on a mental level. You are strong and independent  and can skilfully take control of a large group. Others  see you as charming and witty. Powerful and loud music relaxes  you. You are organised, capable and conscientious.  Kusum Bhandari

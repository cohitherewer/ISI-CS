The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, May 09, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	For some 50 years, I have been a witness to the way Gol  Park, a spot of beauty in south Calcutta, has changed for  the worse. The need to increase the road-width near the  roundabout is understandable. But the haste with which the  park was sculpted in the past few years is really surprising.  Trees lining the garden were chopped and the plants uprooted.  But attempts to revive the greenery have been really sluggish.  The small patch now sports overgrown shrubs and weeds. The  shed that housed the gardener was pulled down. Now, he stays  in a makeshift tent, which is an eyesore. The elevated divider,  erected to divert traffic heading for Southern Avenue, has  become a shelter for street-dwellers.

	Tram journey is no longer safe and smooth because of the  ill-maintained tracks. The stretch between Bagbazar and  Kumartuli is risky and needs repairs. Several times, trams  have jumped the tracks and rammed into vehicles and nearby  houses.

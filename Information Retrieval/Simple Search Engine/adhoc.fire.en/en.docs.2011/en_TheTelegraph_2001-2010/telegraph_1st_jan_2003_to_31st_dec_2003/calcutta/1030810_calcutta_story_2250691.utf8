 Sunday, August 10, 2003 				 Crack derails Metro
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Metro Railway services were disrupted on Saturday afternoon after a crack was detected on the Up line between Netaji Bhavan and Rabindra Sadan stations. Services were suspended between 1.30 pm and 2.25 pm.																								Metro Railway officials said the motorman of an Up train felt a jerk while passing through the line and reported the matter to the control room at 12.30 pm. Repairs started around 1.30 pm and continued till 2.25 pm. Four Up and two Down trains were cancelled, and two pairs of trains were rescheduled as a result. 																								There is a need for intensive checking of the rails on a daily basis to avoid mishaps. Supervision has now become irregular, alleged Dilip Mukherjee, general secretary of Metro Railwaymens Union. Refuting the charges, Metro Railway chief engineer Ashok Gupta said: Such cracks occur only once in a while. In earlier cases, tests revealed meteorological defects. A thorough meteorological test would be conducted at the site of the crack soon, he added.

 Surjo Sinha																									Is Surjos weapon of choice. The 21-year-old has a passion for music and has won many a trophy with his violin-wielding ways. Though he has been a violinist since age eight with the Atelier de Musique orchestra, he is known for his singing talents. But if you havent heard him so far, you may have to wait a while, for this dude is off to IIM Ahmedabad on Tuesday.																									With things to do. Music, debating, football, cricket, quizzing and writing Melody may be our mans main squeeze  as former member of the La Martiniere for Boys school band and choir, winner of over 12 school fests, regular at Someplace Else singing with Sound Check, performing on All India Radio and Doordarshan  but it takes much more to make him tick.																									Our ex-student of economics at Presidency attacked the LMB newsletter, The Chronicle, as editor. He has competitions and school prizes for writing under his belt, too. An avid quizzer, Poppy was chosen to represent his school at the Bournvita Quiz Contest and bagged 11 wins of 15 rounds he participated in, while in Class XII. Has travelled from Lucknow to Doon School and Delhi, debating and quizzing. In college, too, he was a quizzing star, and represented his institution at the ETV Bangla Checkmate Quiz. Debating, although not his forte, was part-time occupation through school and college.																									Was Surjos thing, through school. The founder of the LMB Music Club and member of computer, quiz, nature and Interact clubs, was committee chairman of the annual school fest, besides being a fest regular. He believed in taking the initiative, reviving the Quiz Club through a face-off between La Martiniere Boys and Girls. He organised a computer fest and was a western music teacher for the Friday Club, teaching his juniors.																									Is what the one-time school prefect loved to get on the football field, top scorer for two years straight, on the winning team twice in inter-house championships. Cricket was a ball, and athletics often saw him breaking records. Relaxation means chess, though the school champ couldnt afford to sit back too much.

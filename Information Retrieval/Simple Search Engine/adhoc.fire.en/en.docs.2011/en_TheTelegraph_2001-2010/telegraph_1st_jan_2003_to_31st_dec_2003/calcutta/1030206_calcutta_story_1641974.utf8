 A STAFF REPORTER																								Trouble broke out at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday, after the death of a junior doctor, who reportedly committed suicide late on Tuesday. House-staff and other employees have submitted a memorandum to the principal, protesting alleged irregularities in the hostel and hospital. Police said there was no report of disruption of services in the hospital because of the agitation. 																								Arijit Dutta, 24-year-old house-staff, killed himself by jumping off the third-floor roof-top of his hostel on Tuesday night. He was reportedly suffering from depression. According to K.L. Tamta, deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, Dutta was an introvert. We have questioned his room-mates and friends, but they cannot shed any light on his death, he added. There was blood on the rooftop from where Dutta jumped off. He had slashed his left wrist and the vein with a blade. He also stabbed it with scissors, Tamta added.																								The exact cause of Duttas death is still unknown. We are interrogating his room-mates and friends, but we found nothing wrong. So no one has been detained so far, Tamta added.																								Tension started building up in the hospital as news of Duttas death spread. The house-staff and employees held a snap demonstration late on Tuesday night. The agitated staff returned on Wednesday morning and staged demonstrations all day. They demanded a high-level inquiry into Duttas death.																								The demonstrators claimed the hospital compound had become a haven for criminals. Complaints had been made to the hospital authorities, but no action was taken. Some hospital staff are in cahoots with the goons who are occupying rooms in the hostel, they added.

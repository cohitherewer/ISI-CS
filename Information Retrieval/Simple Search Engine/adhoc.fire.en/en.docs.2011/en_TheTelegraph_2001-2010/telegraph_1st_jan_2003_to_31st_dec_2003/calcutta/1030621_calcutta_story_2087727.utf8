This is the first time since 1976, when the government had introduced the Higher Secondary (HS) course, that such a revamp has been undertaken.																								Council president Jyotirmoy Mukherjee said the new curriculum would be implemented from the 2004-05 session in all HS schools in Calcutta and the districts. The objective of the overhaul was to upgrade the HS syllabi and introduce a modern approach. We have done this so that our students do not have a problem in coping with the standards of the corresponding undergraduate courses taught in any other university in the country, Mukherjee added.																								The works of a host of contemporary authors have been included in the syllabi of various languages, including English, Bengali and Nepali. Sharing space with excerpts from Jhumpa Lahiris Interpreter of Maladies will be pieces from R.K. Narayan.																								In the wake of students demands of a revamp, Mukherjee said the syllabi change would: establish  parity between the contents of the Madhyamik and HS syllabi establish  parity between the HS syllabi followed by the Council and  those followed by its counterparts in other states, especially  the ones followed by the Delhi-based Council for Indian  School Certificate Examinations and the Central Board of  Secondary Education incorporate  elements of higher education make  it easier for students in the science stream to compete  in the joint entrance examination																								Mukherjee also said it would be mandatory for HS students from next year to participate in extra-curricular activities, like work education, physical education, NCC and social and community services. Students will be assessed for the above activities on the basis of grades granted by the respective schools.																								The Council has also decided to scrap the system of teaching zoology, botany and physiology separately as elective subjects. From now on, only a single subject  biological sciences  will be taught. Public administration, too, will cease to be a separate elective subject.

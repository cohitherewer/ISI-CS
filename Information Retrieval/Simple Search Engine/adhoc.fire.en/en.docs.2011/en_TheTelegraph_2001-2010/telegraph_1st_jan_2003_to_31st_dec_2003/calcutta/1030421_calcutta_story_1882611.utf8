 Monday, April 21, 2003 				 RBU builds hostel for listed classes
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A hostel for students of the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), constructed by Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) at Bonhooghly, is slated to open on April 23. The hostel, the first of its kind in the city, will be named after B.R. Ambedkar.																								Higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty and PWD minister Amar Chowdhury will attend the inauguration ceremony, while former Kalyani University vice-chancellor and chairman of Tripura Education Commission Basudeb Burman will open the hostel. 																								RBU vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee said on Sunday that the SC/ST cell of the state government had sanctioned money for the construction of the hostel on a six-cottah plot. The four-storey building, completed within a year, will accommodate about 100 students and house a reading room, a library, a huge dining room and a hall for indoor games. We have now approached the government for money to buy furniture, Mukherjee said.																								Though the hostel is exclusively for the SC/ST students, we may take in general students if there arent enough candidates from the backward classes, Mukherjee said, adding that outstation students would be preferred. Sources said the governments SC/ST cell had also shown interest in constructing another hostel for students of Other Backward Classes (OBC). We are considering the proposal, but we might not get the requisite number of OBC students to run the proposed hostel, said a senior RBU official.

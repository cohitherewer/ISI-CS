 							 - Students match Southern score in ICSE, ISC A STAFF REPORTER																								The East vs South rivalry has spilled over from the corridors of power to the classrooms of learning. If Writers Buildings is struggling to keep pace with the technological strides being taken by the southern states, ICSE and ISC students here are matching their southern peers mark for mark. Well, almost.																								According to this years ICSE and ISC examination results, declared on Monday, nearly 200 schools based in Calcutta, Howrah and elsewhere in Bengal have grabbed glory by showing a marked improvement over last year. The schools in Calcutta have done well, but the general performance of the institutions in the southern states is also impressive, Francis Fanthome, secretary and chief executive, Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), told Metro from Delhi.																								A day after the posting of the ICSE and ISC results on the Net, students who had taken the exams in Calcutta and elsewhere in Bengal thronged their institutions on Tuesday to collect their mark-sheets. Wednesdays industrial strike added to the mad scramble.																								Confirming the Councils observation, heads of various schools in the city said they were happy to track an upward trend in students performances in both the ICSE and ISC this year. The performance of our students in the ICSE and ISC exams has been consistently good. But this years results in both the exams are remarkably better, said S. Francis, vice-principal, La Martiniere for Boys.																								The school, according to Francis, had sent up 174 students for ICSE. Thirty-seven of them have scored above 90 per cent marks. In ISC, 119 students took the exam and 24 of them bagged 90 per cent aggregate marks.																								Like La Martiniere for Boys, the authorities of other top-ranking English-medium institutions, too, pencilled a definite improvement. The results of my school are excellent this year. All the students have done extremely well, beamed Sonia Pradhan, principal, Pratt Memorial School for Girls.																								Gillian DCosta Hart, principal, Welland Gouldsmith School and MLA representing the Anglo-Indian community, said 302 students of her institution had appeared for the ICSE and ISC exams this year. All of them have passed, scoring fairly high marks, she added.																								According to Hart, the high standard of teaching and other facilities provided by most ICSE and ISC schools could have helped the performance of the students.																								Sources in the Council stressed how the performance of many lesser-known institutions has come up over the past few years. Some of them have also done extremely well, add officials, welcoming the trend of more schools doing better.																								My school is just 15 years old. But all my students have scored a first division, said Kajari Mukherjee, principal, Rajasthan Vidya Mandir, a girls school in north Calcutta.																								Vivekananda Mission School, another new school in the Behala area, has also recorded 100 per cent success of its students, said principal Keya Singh.

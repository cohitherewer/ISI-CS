The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, August 27, 2003 				 Chokher Bali
																								Based on Rabindranath Tagores novel of the same name which was first published in a serialised form in 1901, this contemporary dramatic production (scripted by Partha Chatterjee) centres around Binodini, a young widow who finds refuge from neglect and poverty in a rich household in Calcutta. She then becomes entangled in complex relationships with two men, Mahendra and Bihari, and the two other claimants of Mahendras affections  his mother, Rajlakshmi, and wife Ashalata. It is not the conventional story of exploitation of women by a traditional society, but rather of their attempt to articulate and individuality  of a traditional kind as represented by Rajlakshmi and, most adventurously, of a very modern kind by Binodini. A century later, Chokher Bali is being reassessed in the light of the many changes which have swept urban India with special emphasis on the character of Binodini, who represents the complexities of the new womans identity in the evolving modern Indian society. It is a strikingly contemporary story of modern Indian woman. Directed by Runu Choudhuri, this Kushilav production celebrates its 25th show today.

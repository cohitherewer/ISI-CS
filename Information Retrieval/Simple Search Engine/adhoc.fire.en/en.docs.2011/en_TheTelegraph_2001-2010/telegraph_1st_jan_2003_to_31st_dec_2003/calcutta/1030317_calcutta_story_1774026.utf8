	It is surprising that several post offices in the city  often run out of revenue stamps. Why cant the GPO provide  a steady supply of revenue stamps? Unlike the other branches,  the Park Street post office seldom keeps gum for customers.  Despite several complaints, the authorities concerned have  never bothered to show interest. Its high time our postal  services became a little more customer-friendly. T.R. Anand,  Budge Budge.

	Some civic workers have felled several trees, including  a 70-year-old banyan tree, along Judges Court Road. I request  the authorities to take immediate action. Atul Kejriwal,  Judges Court Road.

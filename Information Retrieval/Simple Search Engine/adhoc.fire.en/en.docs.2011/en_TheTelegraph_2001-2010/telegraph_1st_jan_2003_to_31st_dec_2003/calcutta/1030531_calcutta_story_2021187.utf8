 A STAFF REPORTER																								In an early morning swoop on Friday, the police picked up eight criminals from the Jadavpur and Golf Garden areas and recovered a huge cache of arms from them. Some of the arrested men were wanted in a number of dacoity and murder cases.																								Acting on a tip-off, a police team, led by inspector in charge of Jadavpur police station Swapan Bagchi, raided a hideout at Patuli, on the EM Bypass. Bablu Jamadar and three associates  Kader Mir, Saif Panna and Arshad Ali, alias Pagla  were arrested. Bagchi said that Jamadar had been arrested before for dacoity and murder. During the chase, the goons fired at the cops.																								After interrogating them, the police came to know of another gang in Golf Garden. Ataur Rahman, Sheikh Akbar, alias Tinku, and Pappu Das were arrested in the Golf Garden raid. Police said they were armed. Investigation revealed that they belonged to the same gang. After assembling near the Bypass, they divided themselves into groups to commit dacoities. Arms recovered from them include 12 revolvers, cartridges, bombs and bomb-making materials.																								Jamadar is from Canning. He chose his group from Jadavpur, Kasba and nearby areas, Bagchi said. The police are now looking for the arms supplier. We have clues about him, and will pick him up soon, he added.

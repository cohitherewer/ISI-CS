																								Dance, dance, dance little lady/ Leave tomorrow behind  the lithe and petit structure of the dancer sways and moves rhythmically to the lilting music and tinkering ankle bells (ghungroo). Gradually, the external elements  the dancer, the music and everything else  seem to merge into one another, weaving a unique tapestry and mesmerising the audience. This is the magic of dance. For the past 10 years, West Bengal Dance Group Federation has been engaged in a number of projects, including organising festivals, seminars and workshops to help local dancers widen their sphere, providing an opportunity to interact with others and thereby enrich their own arts. In addition, the Federation has been holding an annual festival of Indian classical dance, Stars of Tomorrow, for the past five years. This fest is held to encourage upcoming artistes by providing them a platform to showcase their talent. This years fest begins today and the line-up is: February 18: Jayati Dutta Gupta (Odissi), Sutapa Awon (Bharata Natyam), Debi Banerjee (Kathak); February 19: Lopamudra Hazra (Odissi), Rajib Mondal (Bharata Natyam) and Jalsa Chandra (Kathak); February 20: Chumki Maity (Kathak), Ranita Majumdar (Odissi) and Sohini Chatterjee (Kathak); February 21: Sheli Karmakar (Kathak), Sudeshna Bhadra and Arpita Sen (Bharata Natyam duet) and Sudeshna Maulik (Kathak).

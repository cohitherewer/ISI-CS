	A lot of inconve-nience in local and short-distance trains  can be avoided if some passengers mend their ways. For several  people, playing cards has become a habit. They just wait  to get on the train and occupy seats, often unlawfully.  If someone protests, they even go to the extent of assaulting  him or her. Besides, some commuters have the tendency of  blocking the passage between seats by placing their bags  there. Vendors, too, obstruct movement in front of the compartment  doors with their huge baskets. All these malpractices go  unchecked. The onus lies on the railway authorities to ensure  that office-goers are spared this trouble.

	The Gariahat branch of Syndicate Bank is the only bank  in the locality authorised by the BSNL to receive phone  bills. But the bank does not accept cash payments over Rs  1,000. The BSNL authorities must tie up with other banks  for the benefit of customers.  
	Chandidas Roy, Baishnabghata.

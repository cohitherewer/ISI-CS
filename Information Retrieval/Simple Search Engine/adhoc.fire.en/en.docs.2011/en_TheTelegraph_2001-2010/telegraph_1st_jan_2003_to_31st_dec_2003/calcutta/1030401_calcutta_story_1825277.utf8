				 	ATREYI MAJUMDAR																	Of bathroom singing, but thats not why she is rounding up the scalps. This 20-year-old has one true passion, one real calling -- Indian classical dance. Toddling into kathak class at age two, she was hooked by her first public performance at age four. The third-year B.Com student of Jadavpur University is now pursuing Odissi. Not to forget her interest in glass painting, with two of her works having pride of place on the walls at home.																									Is what she made, showing up at the Puri Beach Festival the day after her ISC exam ended. But she hopes to make waves in the business world, too, with an MBA next in line to dancing on her list of priorities. Her mom makes sure nothing gets in the way of her studies, and the ex-student of St Teresas and St Thomas feels she hasnt done such a bad job so far.																									From Allahabad to Delhi and Bhubaneshwar, the gal they call Mou has taken part in the Konark Dance Festival, Vishwa Hindu Sammelan, Jhankar Musica Circle, Heritage Festival, Uday Shankar Festival and Padatik shows amongst others. Her favourite experience was being applauded by a whole host of famous names in the world of Odissi, at the Kala Vikas Kendra, Cuttack, where she was the youngest perfomer.																									Is a solo show abroad on her own merit. A brother in Boston has been inspiration so far, and its his advice shes taken to heart, working hard to achieve her goals, with a lil help from guruji Aloka Kanungo. Winning a gold medal from Prayag Samity Sammelan and a scholarship from the ministry of tourism and culture, being honoured by West Bengal Tourism Department and coming out on top at the Rajya Sangeet Academy and the Stars of Tomorrow contest of the West Bengal Transport Corporation she takes it all in her stride.																									For at least three hours is a must, but she finds time for Rashid Khan and jazz classics, too. When it isnt her study books, Atreyi likes curling up with a thriller or a mystery novel, or letting her hair down at lunch-and-movie outings.

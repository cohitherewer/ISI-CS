The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, October 11, 2003 				 Sunny side up after four days
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Sunshine bathed the city again on Friday, after four days of overcast sky and lashing rain. The weatherman said the depression, that hovered over Malda, in north Bengal, on Thursday evening, had crossed over to Assam on Friday. The regional meteorological centre at Alipore recorded only one mm of rain till 5.30 pm.																								However, we have forecast a shower or two on Saturday, as the monsoon current is prevailing. We think the rains will bow out in another few days, said a Met office spokesperson. The depression over the Bay of Bengal swept into Jagdalpur, in Orissa, last Tuesday, travelled north-west to Chhattisgarh and then veered towards Orissa, Jharkhand and Bengal, leading to incessant rains in Calcutta and the rest of Bengal.

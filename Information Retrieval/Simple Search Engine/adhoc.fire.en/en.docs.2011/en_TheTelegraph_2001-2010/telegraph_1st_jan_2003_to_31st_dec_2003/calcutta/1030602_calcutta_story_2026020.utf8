 HS awaits muscle to rein in teachers 
 A STAFF REPORTER  Wanted: punitive powers to teach teachers a lesson in ethics and work ethics.A flurry of complaints of corruption against a section of teachers will force the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary (HS) Education to make a fresh appeal to the government, seeking a bigger role in punishing examiners found guilty of negligence and corruption.Two examiners, both teachers of a Hindi-medium school in North 24-Parganas, were recently arrested on charges of increasing marks of some students, for a fee. We are most concerned with the incident and will take all possible steps to ensure that such a thing is never repeated, said Council secretary Dibyendu Chakraborty. A report will soon be submitted to the government in this regard, he added. Officials blame the delay on the part of the government in amending the Act to allow the Council to have a larger say in punishing errant and corrupt examiners for the rise in reports of malpractice, corruption and negligence of examination duties against teachers.The Council has convened a meeting on Monday to discuss ways to expedite the process of amending the Act. Going by the existing rules, the HS Council can only blacklist errant examiners  that is, bar them from participating in exam duty.We have submitted a proposal to the government seeking an amendment to the Council Act, so that we can take punitive actions against the errant teachers if they are found committing an offence involving the examination process. An approval of the government is pending, even though we have submitted our proposal several months ago, said a Council official.An official of the state education department, however, said the government has already given the green signal to the Councils proposal. According to him, the final approval to this effect is pending because of some technical problems.Disco raid: A man was arrested and several bottles of foreign liquor were seized from the basement of a building on Middleton Row, where an unauthorised discotheque was being run.

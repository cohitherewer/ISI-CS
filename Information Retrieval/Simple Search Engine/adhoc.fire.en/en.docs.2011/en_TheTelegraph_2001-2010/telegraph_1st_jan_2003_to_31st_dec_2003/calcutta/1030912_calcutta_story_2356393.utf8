	The Kyd Street- Chowringhee intersection is turning worse  by the day. With the flyover progressing at a snails pace,  the traffic signals have gone for a toss. Accidents in this  zone have become a routine affair. The situation will not  improve unless traffic management is restored.  
	Sumant Poddar, Kyd Street.  
	I was recently called for an interview for the post of  a teacher at a tutorial home on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road.  The interviewers said I needed to sign a bond and took all  my certificates for verification. They then handed me a  photocopy of the bond for perusal. As I did not agree with  the clauses, I asked for the certificates to be returned.  They refused as I had wasted their precious time. I was  also told that I would have to work for two years to get  them back. Later, they agreed to hand me the papers in exchange  for Rs 500 as compensation. The whole process took about  10 hours and the harassment was enough for me to seek psychiatric  treatment.  
	V. Choudhuri, Nager Bazaar.

				 																																									The South Dum Dum municipality has not dredged the Bagjola canal and, like every year, residents are facing the consequences. The channel needs to be thoroughly desilted to prevent water from spilling over on to the low-lying pockets. The monsoon rains, coupled with a high tide in the Hooghly, have recently inundated several parts of Bangur Avenue, Lake Town and Dum Dum Park.				 																																									Jyoti Bakshi,				 																																									Heysham Row.				 																																									The footbridge connecting Lake Town and Salt Lake is used by a large number of people, as it is quite an uphill task for them to cross VIP Road braving the thick vehicular flow. But of late, some fruit vendors and beggars have occupied this narrow stretch, inconveniencing pedestrians. Several motorcyclists, too, drag their vehicles along the bridge. Such gross flouting of traffic norms can spark a mishap any time.				 																																									Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																									Lake Town.

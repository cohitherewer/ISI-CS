 Thursday, April 10, 2003 				 Creativity in her genes
		 Suchismita Ghatak SUCHISMITA GHATAK Teacher, painter, dancer, writer  For Bulbuli Ghatak, life is full of activity. Having lost  her film-maker father while she was still in school, the  44-year-old says she has inherited the spirit of creative  originality from Ritwik Ghatak, and it is this that spurs  her on to invent, innovate and experiment.																								Painting is the first passion for this graduate in graphics from Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan. After numerous exhibitions and workshops in Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Kerala and even New Jersey, USA, she is still trying to find new inspirations. I do things in series, Ghatak explains. This is because a collection of pictures makes more sense than a standalone image. I try to tell a story. Like my Mother Earth series, which portrayed her as the creator and destroyer. My latest work is called Merge, and depicts relationships.																								But helping children explore their imagination and talents through art is what she likes best. As a teacher in Vidya Bharati School, in Mominpur, she helps the primary kids deal with stress and other issues by helping them portray their problems and emotions through colours. Its wonderful to watch expressions brighten after a session, Ghatak smiles.																								The challenged children of Behala Bikashan have a special place in her heart. Some are autistic, some are schizophrenic, some have Downs Syndrome. Each one has to be dealt with in a different way. But progress, however small, is always intensely satisfying, she explains.																								Through an organisation called Interlink, Ghatak has previously worked with streetchildren and rag pickers, too. Its always a revelation when you watch a disadvantaged child drawing something he cant or doesnt have. But it helps them express their frustrations, she adds.																								This amateur dancer has learnt kathak from Bandana Sen, and used to perform regularly at Santiniketan. Although she now does so only for Birla Academys annual birthday celebrations, she uses her knowledge, once again for the little ones. At Vidya Bharati, she organises the annual show, through a unique combination of dance, music, story-telling, acting and this time, puppetry. That is something I learnt from my father  to keep changing and reinventing to create something new, Ghatak says.																								Although not much of an actor herself by her own admission, despite giving the stage a try for a while after her graduation in 1981, she loves to write about it and her father, particularly in little magazines.																								Shes happy being who she is, and certainly does not feel lost in her fathers shadow. As long as I am able to do what I like best  painting and working with children  I am satisfied, she signs off.

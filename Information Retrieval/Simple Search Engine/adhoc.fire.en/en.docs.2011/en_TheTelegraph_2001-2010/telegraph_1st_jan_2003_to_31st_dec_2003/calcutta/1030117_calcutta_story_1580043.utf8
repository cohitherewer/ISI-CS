 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 Court nod to cop identity parade
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) S.N. Mishra, on Thursday, gave the go-ahead to investigating authorities to hold a Test-Identification (TI) parade of the five policemen arrested in connection with the murder of sergeant Bapi Sen.																								The CMM at Bankshal Court also rejected the bail pleas of the accused constables and remanded them in jail custody till January 30. The date for the TI parade would be fixed later, said Mishra. Public prosecutor A. Bakshi clarified that the parade would be held in a separate court.																								Sleuths of the detective department of Calcutta Police, meanwhile, claimed in court that they had got several definite clues in connection with the Bapi Sen murder case. Opposing the bail prayers of the accused constables, the public prosecutor said the probe team had identified some other witnesses to the assault on Bapi, on New Years eve. He added that investigations would receive a major boost if the accused could be identified by these witnesses.																								The constables, who had attacked Bapi when the sergeant had tried to stop them from harassing a woman on the night of December 31, were brought to Bankshal Court from Lalbazar around noon, on Thursday, amid heightened security to keep a crowd of onlookers at bay.																								Advocates representing the accused claimed that the police had no definite allegations against their clients and drew attention to the fact that they had already spent 14 days in police custody. All of them are government employees and they will not leave the city if granted bail, they argued. But to no avail.

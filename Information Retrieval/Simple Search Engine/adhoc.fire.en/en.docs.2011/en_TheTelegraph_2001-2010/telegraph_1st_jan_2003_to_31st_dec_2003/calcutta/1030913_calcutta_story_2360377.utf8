 Saturday, September 13, 2003 				 Cousin caught for couple murder
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A relative of the elderly couple found murdered in its Ganganagar home near the airport on Thursday was arrested for his alleged involvement in the killing on Friday morning. 																								Palash Sarkar, the 41-year-old cousin of Jharna Sarkar, was tracked down to his Belghoria residence. Jharna and her husband Sanjiv were found dead in their bedroom with their throats slit.																								Sanjiv was a retired employee of the surface transport department, while Jharna worked as a teacher in a primary school in Belghoria. 																								On Thursday morning, one of the Sarkars nieces who lived with them noticed a trail of blood outside the couples bedroom. 																								As she raised the alarm, other family members rushed in and found Sanjiv lying on the floor, close to the door, with his throat slit. Jharna lay near the bed with a similar fatal wound.																								Suspecting that the property owned by the childless couple might have been a motive behind the murder, a team led by additional superintendent of police (Salt Lake) Ajay Nand raided various places and interrogated several relations of the Sarkars. 																								During preliminary interrogations, police came to know that Palash, who would often visit the couple, was unemployed despite being a mechanical engineer. 																								He had asked his sister for some money to start a business on his own, but Jharna turned down his proposal.																								Palash had been under a lot of strain as his career was yet to take off. Moreover, he strongly resented Jharnas decision to divide the money the couple had received from their gratuity and provident fund between him and his sisters, said Basudeb Bag, district superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.																								According to Nand, police zeroed in on the couples relatives as circumstantial evidence pointed to the fact that the killer was known to the family and the murder had been pre-planned.

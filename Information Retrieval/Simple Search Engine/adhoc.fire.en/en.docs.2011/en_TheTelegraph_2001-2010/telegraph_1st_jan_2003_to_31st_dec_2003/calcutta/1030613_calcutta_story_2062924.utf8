 Friday, June 13, 2003 				 Sleuths at SSKM for cricketer case file
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The detective department of the city police began on Thursday its probe into the death of budding cricketer Rajnis Patel at SSKM Hospital earlier this month. Rajnis died on June 2 after five failed surgeries on his left shin bone, which he broke while at the nets at Vivekananda Park, in south Calcutta, on February 6.																								For now, we will examine the relevant documents and papers and then decide on the kind of expert opinion we should be seeking, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Soumen Mitra. We have asked the hospital authorities for the papers necessary to carry out an independent probe. They include the admission ticket and the case reports, Mitra added.																								A team from the homicide department, too, visited the hospital on Thursday.																								Director of medical education C.R. Maity on Thursday convened a meeting at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, at which all hospital superintendents and administrators were warned of serious consequences if they failed to maintain proper records of patients and supply information about critically-ill patients every day. 																								It was basically a refresher course and everybody was informed about the governments plans for transparency and better treatment in the state-run hospitals, Maity said. 																								After his death, Rajnis parents had complained that negligence by the hospitals doctors had led to the tragedy. They blamed orthopaedic surgeon Dilip Majumdar, under whose care Rajnis had been admitted. 																								Sleuths who will probe the case will also check the condition of the SSKM wards and the operating theatre and whether patients can contract infection there. It could well be the place where Rajnis had developed an infection in his leg, deputy commissioner Mitra said. Doctors, nurses and other staff of the hospital will also be interrogated. 																								Rajnis parents are in Bihar for his last rites. They will be back on June 15.

 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Annya Aami
																								Chitrangada, who emerges from the pages of Mahabharta, is immortalised by Rabindranath Tagore in his verse-drama. A brave and glorious princess, she is the epitome of womanhood. A force to reckon with, Chitrangada believes she alone holds the key to her own destiny. She has the courage to carve out from within herself her alter-ego  a woman not fettered by chains, but a fiercely independent and spirited soul. She is a woman beyond all relationships, beyond the boundaries of identities given to her  of a daughter, wife and mother. Till the very end, this Chitrangada never concedes defeat. She gains confidence and strength from her sorrow and pain. Madhuboni Chatterjees Annya Aami  The Other Me is a choreographic tribute to the eternal woman epitomised by Chitrangada. Produced by Jahnavi Centre for Performing Arts, Annya Aami is conceptualised, choreographed and performed by Chatterjee. The ballet is based on two dance forms, Bharata Natyam and Kalaripayattu. The performance is accompanied by narration, both in Bengali and English.																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: Madhusudan Mancha

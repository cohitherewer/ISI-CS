The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Boom to bust, assets to ashes
 															- A year after blaze, woollen garments hub in darkness, desolation DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Har ghar kuch kehta hai (Every house has a tale to tell). And the blackened and crumbling three-storeyed building at 171A, Mahatma Gandhi Road has a tragic tale to tell today. Ludhiana Building, in the heart of Burrabazar, is a cruel testimony to a time spanning boom and bust.																								Till December 20, 2002, this was the biggest and busiest centre of trade in woollen garments in the region, consistently clocking up no less than Rs 40 to 50 crore between October and January every year. The rear of the building, Jenana Bari, was the permanent address of 30 happy homes.																								December 2003 is dismally different. One year after that winter night when a mystery fire blazed through the building, barely 12 shops with makeshift arrangements  down from 50-odd flourishing establishments  are open. The traders arent talking about business volume, as counting losses is more important these days.																								Devoid of electricity, water supply, and other basic facilities, Jenana Bari wears the look and feel of a haunted house. Yeh bhoot bari ho gaya hai, says Pawan Khandelwal, carefully measuring his steps through the dingy and dark staircase leading to his one-room flat on the third floor. Once the generators that light up the ground-floor shops stop growling, darkness descends on the building.																								So, kids wrap up their days lessons by 8 and dinner is served by 8.30 pm. After dinner, there is nothing that we can do. We sit together and wait for the crack of dawn. We go to sleep at around 4.30 am, after seeing the days light, adds Shyamsundar Ganeriwal, another tenant.																								For the 40-odd residents, down from around 150 before the blaze, who squeeze into small 10-by-10 rooms, reconstruction of the building is priority number one. A memorandum of understanding to reconstruct the building by sharing the cost was signed in April 2003 between landlord Deeptimal Agarwal and the tenants association, which has also filed an application in Calcutta High Court.																								We were 25 in the family and had four rooms. Now, eight of us are sharing a single room. We can bear a part of the reconstruction cost but the landlord hasnt taken any steps, complains Khandelwal. Agarwal doesnt agree: I had 17 shops and my business has suffered the most. I want reconstruction, but the tenants are not cooperating.

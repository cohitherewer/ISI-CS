The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 26, 2003 				 																				subhas chakraborty								Minister-in-charge, department of transport and sports, Government of West Bengal																																							Sealdah station is equipped to cope with 348 trains. But that is only theoretically. So, it is best to build new terminals at Chitpore and Base Bridge. Another terminal should come up to take some load off Howrah as well. I had sent such a proposal to the Railway Board about 10 years ago. It is good that RITES is acting on it. The local trains can definitely be spread across the new terminals. South Calcutta-bound passengers from the Ranaghat line will find it easier to get off at Budge Budge while those from Diamond Harbour wanting to go to north Calcutta will prefer Chitpore as a terminal.

Now, its time for the Big One, the last night of 2003. And heres The Telegraph guide to where the revellers young and old will be headed, this 31st Nite: Tollygunge Club Skinny Alley, Hip Pocket and Geno  Banks will keep people rocking through the night. Although  a formal affair, what better backdrop than the lit-up clubhouse  and the fairways? And dont forget the shamiana full of  festive food fare. Presented in association with BE: Calcutta Swimming Club This ones a formal affair, too,  but the atmosphere on centre stage  in the outside pool   is that of a colourful Paris nightclub, with show dancing,  a mix of the modern and the exotic, by an Australian group.

Dont miss the food stalls. Dalhousie Institute Non-stop live music is the USP  at this club, starting off with the band Blue Mist, followed  by father-daughter duo Don and Sonia Saigal, and rounded  off by the evergreen Pam Craine.

If thats not your style, get  serenaded by musicians over a candle-lit dinner at the Poolside  Barbecue. Or try the midnight Indian and continental buffet  at By The Way.		 Ronnie: Twinkle toes				 																																									 Tap dance, Latin jazz, funk jazz, folk dance, gyrotonics Ronnie Shambik Ghosh sure has a passion for dance and music. Now back in the city, he is busy passing on stuff he has learnt during his sojourns abroad. 				 																																																											Swan Lake and Michael Jackson, pop and hip-hop, the martial arts fanatics interests range far and wide. So, after graduating from Bhawanipur Education Society, the boy from Park Circus decided it was time for more fruitful pursuits and enrolled in Calcutta School of Music for a degree in the theory of dance.				 																																																											There followed a series of courses, from a year-long stint at Chandigarh University to learn how to play Rabindrasangeet and Nazrulgeeti on the Hawaiian guitar, to another year in the UK, picking up tips on all forms of dance  the 29-year-olds first love in life.				 																																																											Finally, Ronnie admitted himself to a three-year course in musical theatre dance at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, where he learnt a bit of everything, from Chinese folk dance to classical ballet, and toured with dance companies to London, Paris, Singapore and New York. Back at home base, hes determined to impart some of that knowledge.				 																																																											The only qualified tap dancer in Calcutta is busy giving lessons at Padatik, in Latin, lyrical and funk jazz, and pilates and gyrotonics. At the AJC Bose Road centre, he teaches serious students of dance. And at the newly-opened Salt Lake school, he has about 50 followers, and a long waiting list.				 																																																											I dont use any Hindi music, nor do I teach any Bollywood-style dancing, the ex-South Point student asserts. But obviously people here appreciate that, because they like it. Eventually, I want to open a technique-based dance school here, because this city needs one.				 																																																											The winner of the best student award 2002-2003 at the Hong Kong academy was also selected by Hong Kong Central Radio TV and Broadcasting centre for the International Arts Festival, and was felicitated by the city for his performance. In January, he has been invited by Kathak Kendra in Delhi for a body-conditioning workshop. And in June, he is off to France for a month, on a scholarship.				 																																									 At first they crawl, later they fly. In the beginning theyre ugly, and then they evolve into one of natures most beautiful creatures. The lifecycle of butterflies is one that has always fascinated and excited, from the egg, to caterpillar, pupa and butterfly. At the countrys only captive butterfly breeding programme, they have been captivating visitors for the past six years. 				 																																																											Begun outdoors in 1997 at Science City, the project had to be shifted indoors, to protect the species against its natural enemies. Now, there are two separate breeding rooms  one for the caterpillars and the other for the butterflies  both attracting large numbers of students and adults alike.				 																																																											Plants are the essential ingredient, explains an official involved with the breeding programme. That, of course, depends on the season. Some, like the lemon plant, are available all year round. Others are conducive only in certain months. So, the species of butterflies on show, too, are different at various times of the year.				 																																																											Rows and rows of potted plants have to be changed every day for the caterpillars on a leaf diet. The 3,000 to 4,000 crawling creatures at any given moment consume kilos of leaves daily. The sunroof of the garden shed provides plenty of warmth for the eggs to hatch within a week.				 																																																											Once the outer shell has hardened, the cocoons are shifted to the glass room in the main viewing gallery, where they become butterflies. About 500 of the winged beauties of around four species can be seen flying around.				 																																																											Butterfly breeding is an expensive exercise. We have the capability to breed 10 to 15 species, but not enough space, observes the Science City official. They are very important to maintain an ecological balance, be it as polluting agents or food. But with their habitats becoming sparse in urban areas, they are at risk, he adds.

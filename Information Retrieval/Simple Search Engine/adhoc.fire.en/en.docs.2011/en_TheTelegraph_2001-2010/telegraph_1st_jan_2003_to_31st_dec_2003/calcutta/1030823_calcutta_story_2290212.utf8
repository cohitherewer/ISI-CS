The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, August 23, 2003 				 Million-rupee berths delayed
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The state government on Friday announced a delay in the publication of names of those selected for the million-rupee medical course. Though director of medical education Chittaranjan Maity spoke of a delay in vetting answer-scripts of the examination, held last Sunday, his departmental colleagues said on condition of anonymity that the government was waiting for the outcome of its plea to the Medical Council of India for more berths.																								The results of the exam are expected on August 28 or 29, officials said (the original date for publication of the results was August 24), adding that a second round of counselling for the merit-only students would come off in a few days.																								The assurance followed an agitation by the newly-formed JEE (Medical) Guardians Forum, demanding that all candidates who secured a rank in JEE 2003 be immediately granted admission to medical colleges. Around 70 such candidates are still without seats and some of them have already moved court.

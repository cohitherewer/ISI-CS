The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, June 09, 2003 				 Vice flourishes in waterfront park
		 The river runs by it:  Millennium Park, along the Hooghly, is a favourite pot  for family outings. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryRam Avatar Mundhra: Millennium Park is the citys pride. Its a great draw for families. But of late, it has turned into a den of sex workers, especially after dark. Will you please do something to restore its ambience? 																																																													You are right. And not only Millenium Park, but most of the citys parks have been taken over by them. I shall talk to the North Port police station about some checks on this menace. Such a thing cannot be allowed in a family outing spot. You will be horrified to know that just a few days ago, some people were caught selling country liquor and drugs behind Writers Buildings. It took some effort to weed them out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, January 10, 2003  Years grace gift for student
 Court orders  school, Council to allow ailing girl to sit for HS 2003 OUR LEGAL REPORTER Justice A.K. Mitra of Calcutta  High Court on Thursday directed the headmaster of Boral  Girls High School to take all necessary steps to ensure  that Promita Kundu fills up her application form for Higher  Secondary (HS) 2003. The judge also directed the headmaster  to send the form to the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary  Education within seven days. The Council has also been directed  to allow the student to sit for her HS examination as a  regular candidate of Boral Girls High School. Promitas  lawyer Supradip Roy conveyed the order of the court to the  school authorities, as well as to the Council office, on  Thursday. Metro had reported on January  4 (Testing times for ailing student) how Promita  was being denied permission to sit for HS 2003 as a regular  candidate. She had earlier cleared the selection test and  been issued the admit card for HS 2002, but could not sit  for the examinations after being told by city specialists  that she was suffering from cancer. At the Christian Medical College  and Hospital, in Vellore, where Promita was taken, doctors  set aside the earlier diagnosis and concluded that an abdominal  malfunction was what she was suffering from. She should  be all right after surgery and post-operative medication,  they told the relieved family of the girl.  After the surgery in April last  year, she went through an extensive treatment procedure. After a few months of rest, Promita  was back at her books, preparing for HS 2003. She even returned  to Boral High School, a government-aided institution in  Garia, where teachers were happy to welcome her back. But her dream to appear for the  finals appeared to crumble after the HS Council announced  that Promita would have to clear the selection tests again.  But I cleared the exams in 2002  and my results are there for everyone to see. Why should  I lose another year now? pleaded Promita. With the HS Council refusing to  yield, Promitas father, Pradip Kundu, filed a case before  Calcutta High Court, alleging that the Council was not allowing  her to sit for this years HS examination as a regular candidate,  even though she had cleared the qualifiers in 2002. The Kundus further alleged that  the school authorities had initially assured Promita that  she would be allowed to appear for HS 2003, without having  to clear the selection tests again.  But when it was time to fill up  the application form, the Council refused Promita permission,  leaving her with the prospect of having to drop another  year.  Thursdays developments in the  high court have given Promita the hope to pursue higher  studies without yet another setback.

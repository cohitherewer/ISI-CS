The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, June 20, 2003  Tuning in to a new town
 Lee-Alison Sibley on a day  this April in the life of the US consul generals wife The author on song with husband George Sibley by her  side  6.50 am. The doorbell downstairs  rings and I wake up suddenly. It must be Paul, one of our  two junior officers at the consulate, coming to meet my  husband, George Sibley, the US consul general in Calcutta,  to go play squash at the Calcutta Racquet Club. George leaves and I decide to  go to my desk on our verandah to check e-mails on my computer.  This will take all the time George is out playing as I receive  an average of 15 e-mails a day and try to answer them all  so I dont fall behind in my correspondence. Some news from  my Calcutta Hash Group. Im the Hash Mistress, in charge  of sending out weekly information on our Sunday runs, keeping  track of the bank account, disbursing funds, handling Hash  correspondence, and barking out instructions each week before  the 40-member group sets out on its course. More news from  my friends in Jordan and their thoughts on the war in Iraq,  and some messages from the Internet forwarded by family  in the US. By the time I finish, George is back. 8 am. We have breakfast.  Our head bearer, Lal, serves it to us on a silver tray upstairs  on the verandah. As Im enjoying the fruit and yoghurt,  fresh coffee and bread, I keep the tape running in my head  enjoy it, but dont get used to it  Georges words of  wisdom. After breakfast, we move to the sofa for a bit of  CNN and to read five English daily newspapers. 10 am. Before I leave for  my first appointment, I go over the plans for the evening  and for the coming weekend with Georges assistant, Amada.  I say a quick goodbye to my mom and go downstairs to check  in with the house staff about todays meals and telephone  messages. Outside, I greet my driver, Abdul, and my personal  security officer on assignment from the police department.  Each day, since the war in Iraq began, a different policeman  has accompanied me whenever I leave the house. There have  been daily marches protesting the war, with as many as 150,000  people walking and holding up anti-US placards. Windows  were broken at the American Center, a few blocks from the  US Consulate, and rotten eggs were thrown as well. The windows  of the Nike shop around the corner from us were vandalised  by a group of young men because it was a so-called American  business. Forget that the employees and the owner of the  shop are Indian, that the shoes are manufactured in Asia.  Who will give them jobs if their business has to shut down?  The protesters? Because of recent events, and the fact that  my first appointment is fairly far away in Barisha, there  is a police escort jeep waiting for me and we will follow  it to the Rehabilitation Centres for Children. I ask Abdul  to tell the police vehicle not to go too fast  Calcutta  traffic is frightening enough without trying to keep up  with a car whose siren is blasting as it speeds past buses,  bicycles, taxis, rickshaws and pedestrians . and cows! As we ride through the city, I  am filled with conflicting emotions. I love Calcutta, love  India. Im so glad were here. But its strange to have  to be escorted by the police, strange to think anyone would  want to hurt me just because Im an American. And I dont  want to hide in my house either. What to do? Be sensible,  keep working, stay low, be careful what I say and to whom  I say it, live. 10.40 am Because of the  police escort we arrive early for my visit, but the reception  is ready  some women and a young girl holding a lighted  oil lamp to offer me the traditional welcome. I am used  to this. The lamp is moved in a circle in front of me, its  smoke leaving an arc in the air. Then someone hands me some  fragrant lotus flowers and as I bow my head, a dot of sandalwood  paste is put on my forehead. Thus I am blessed. The tour begins. The centre was  started by a British lady, Jane Webb, who saw a need for  the physically handicapped children of the area, raised  funds and opened a diagnostic, medical and surgical centre.  Ms Webb died a few years ago, but her work continued and  the centre expanded. It now includes a school for the children  who are there for surgery and rehabilitation. The Bengali television news people  show up; I sing We Shall Overcome with the kids.  Admiring their artwork, I marvel at a teenager without arms  who is painting in watercolours with his mouth. On to the  prosthetics lab. Slowly and carefully I repeat what Ive  said so often before  that I love Calcutta and am delighted  to be in such a great city. And how do I feel about the  children here at the centre? Well, I think the work being  done is wonderful and important and the children seem very  happy. But  here it comes I say right to the camera:  Im frustrated and angry that children are still needlessly  contracting polio and that it is the human duty of people  in influential positions to encourage vaccinations, not  to prevent them. And then I say that Im grateful to the  people of Calcutta for bringing me into their hearts and  I smile. Always end an interview smiling. It looks better. 1:15 pm. Hooray! Im not  the last to arrive at the Conclave, the club/restaurant  where Ill meet some old and new friends, Indian ladies  trying to make a difference in the world. We are meeting  to enjoy a meal and visit with Ruchira Gupta, executive  director of Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an NGO that among  other things rescues women and young girls sold into prostitution  by their families. Back home, Im given two phone  messages. One phone call is from a girlfriend (shell call  later) and one is from a designer clothing store, asking  me to stop by tomorrow afternoon to view the new collection.  The last time I was at that shop a photographer took my  picture all over the store. The next day I appeared in the  newspapers with the caption Lee Alison Sibley shops here.  Good publicity for them since Im on the A List in Calcutta  and people really pay attention to what I wear and how I  look. How very strange for me. I, Lee-Alison Sibley, have  spent most of my life in jeans and work shirts, and now  Im a fashion statement. 6.15 pm: George is waiting  for me in his official armoured vehicle with his driver  and personal security officer. Were off to Raj Bhavan,  the Governors mansion, to attend the final of four lectures/demonstrations  on Indian classical music. I have gone from knowing nothing  to knowing something. Indian classical music is so different  from Western classical music that even I, a musician, have  trouble following the points made by the lecturer at times.  During the first lecture, I demonstrated the vocal technique  used in Western classical music and people were greatly  enthused and anxious to hear me in concert. It gave me a  chance to advertise my upcoming performance of Rabindranath  Tagore songs. 8.15 pm: Back in the car  and late for a dinner in our honour. I think for a moment,  weigh my options and decide to abandon George. Ive had  enough. 9 pm: Im on the sofa,  eating a bowl of soup, and watching a bad movie. It feels  wonderful. 11:30 pm: Off to bed, to  rest and face tomorrow, because tomorrow is another day  in the life of the consul generals wife.

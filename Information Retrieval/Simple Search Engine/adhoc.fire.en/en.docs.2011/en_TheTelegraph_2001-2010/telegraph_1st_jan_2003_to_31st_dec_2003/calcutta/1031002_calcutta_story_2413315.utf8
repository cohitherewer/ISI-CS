 Thursday, October 02, 2003 				 Oil major to fuel bus terminus project
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Identify a partner, present the business potential, and strike a deal to finance projects. 																								The cash-strapped Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) has done just that by roping in public sector oil major Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). 																								CSTC and IOC have agreed to jointly develop a full-fledged bus terminus in Kudghat.																								We were in talks with IOC for some time to work out the involvement of the parties in the project. After a few rounds of meetings, it has been decided that IOC will develop the land and in return, they will be allowed to set up an outlet at the terminus, said Sukumar Bhattacharjee, general manager, CSTC.																								Given the present state of the terminus, its development into a better facility was long overdue, he added. Both government and private buses on the Howrah, Salt Lake and BBD Bag routes use this terminus, which lacks basic facilities and gets inundated during the monsoon. 																								CSTC has 11 depots in the city and its suburbs where its buses refuel. With the increase in the number of buses  of both CSTC and private operators  terminating at the Kudghat centre, opening a fuel station there made good business sense, felt IOC officials. 																								P.K. Bose, general manager, West Bengal office, IOC, said: Such tie-ups are important for both growth in business and better relationship with the agencies. 																								But setting up a state-of-the-art terminus and a fuel station would be easier said than done, felt the main promoters. From cleaning up the area to relocating the rickshaws and autorickshaws from the terminus, the administration has a tough job ahead. 																								The clean-up drive will start after the Pujas. We have already discussed the project with both the agencies and have worked out ways to complete it as soon as possible. This will minimise trouble for commuters and local residents, said Shakil Ahmed, deputy superintendent of police, traffic, South 24-Parganas.

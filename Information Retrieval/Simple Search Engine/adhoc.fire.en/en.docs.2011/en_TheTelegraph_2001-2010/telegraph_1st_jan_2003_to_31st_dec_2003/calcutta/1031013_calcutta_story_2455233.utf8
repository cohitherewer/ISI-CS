																																																		Kali puja organisers were briefed on rules and regulations by senior police officers at Lalbazar on Sunday. It was decided that police would keep a strict vigil across the city to prevent the use of banned crackers. The height of the idol, after being mounted on a lorry, should not exceed 17 feet, police told the organisers. The deadline for immersion is October 27. Other problems, such as noise pollution and forcible collection of subscriptions, were also discussed in the meeting. In the run-up to the puja, police are carrying out raids and preventive arrests in various troublespots.																																																		Sayeed, a 25-year-old taxi driver, was found murdered on Saturday night on the approach road to the Rajarhat New Township. The taxi could not be traced.

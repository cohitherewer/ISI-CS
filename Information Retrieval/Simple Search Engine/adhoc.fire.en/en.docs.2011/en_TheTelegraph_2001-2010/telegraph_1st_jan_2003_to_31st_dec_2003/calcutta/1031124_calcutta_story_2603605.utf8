The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, November 24, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	Elaborate transport arrangements were made for spectators  returning home after the India-Australia cricket final at  Eden Gardens on November 18. Additional trains of Circular  Rail and Metro Railway were run late into the night, but  nothing was done for those returning to Howrah. After 10.30  pm, there was neither any ferry service, nor any buses.  Almost all of us had to take a long walk down to Howrah. 
	 B.L. Chandak, Salkia.  
	Streetlights at the Chowringhee-Kyd Street crossing are  once again out of order. The stretch is used by fire personnel  and policemen, yet it goes unnoticed.  
	Sumant Poddar, Kyd Street.

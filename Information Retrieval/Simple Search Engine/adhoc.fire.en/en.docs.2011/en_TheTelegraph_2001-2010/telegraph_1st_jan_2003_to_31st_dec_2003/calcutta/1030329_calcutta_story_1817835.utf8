 Saturday, March 29, 2003 				 Consumer panel slaps fine in Saha death case
 R.VENKATARAMAN IN NEW DELHI																								About 12 directors of the Advanced Medicare Research Institute (AMRI) facing a Rs 77-crore medical negligence compensation case were on Friday slapped with an interim fine of Rs 25,000 by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in New Delhi.																								The interim fine was imposed, pending the final decision on the total claim, as the doctors had not filed affidavits, senior counsel for petitioner M.N. Krishnamani said. The Commission had earlier declined the AMRI directors prayer that since they were not involved in treating Dr Anuradha Saha, who had died allegedly due to medical negligence at AMRI five years ago, they could not be made a party in the case and no compensation should be demanded from them.																								The Commission dismissed a petition by the members of the AMRI board of directors, praying that they not be taken to task for the alleged negligence. Only the doctors who had treated Anuradha should be made parties to the case. The directors, who are to pay the fine and face trial, include L.R.K. Prasad, Ashim Barman, G.D. Gautam, S.K. Chaturvedi, S.C. Chaturvedi, Rabin Deb, Moni Chettri, S. Bose, Sital Ghosh, S.K. Todi, S. Bose and R.S. Agarwal. Anuradhas husband, Kunal Saha, a US-based doctor, said the money will be deposited with the Legal Aid Committee.

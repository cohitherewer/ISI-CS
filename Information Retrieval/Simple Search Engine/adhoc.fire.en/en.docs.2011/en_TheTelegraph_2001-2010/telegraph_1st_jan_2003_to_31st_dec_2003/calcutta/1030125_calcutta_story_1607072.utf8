				 																																										Calcutta High Court on Friday passed an order empowering the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) to collect drinking water samples from any public place of the town for routine tests. Earlier, the court had passed a similar order for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. The green bench of the court also directed the HMC to collect the samples from at least 130 sources and get them analysed by reputed test centres. The court also directed the civic authorities to announce the results of the tests for the benefit of the residents. The bench, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice J. Biswas, also said in their order that if the civic authorities found that the water supplied by any of the institutions was not fit for consumption, the head of the institution should immediately be asked to take proper steps to purify the water. The court passed the order on the basis of a petition filed by the Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samity, seeking a court directive for the supply of pure drinking water in the area. The organisation had submitted reports of the test centres, observing that the water supplied by several institutions was not fit for consumption.				 																																										Jewellery and cash worth more than Rs 25,000 was stolen from a Kali temple in EC Block of Salt Lake on Thursday night. Bidhannagar North police station sources said the thieves broke open the lock of the temple gate, on the premises of a residential complex. Local Trinamul Congress councillor Ashesh Mukherjee alleged that in September 2002, a similar burglary had taken place in the same temple. Despite repeated requests, the police have not beefed up night patrol in the area, Mukherjee alleged.				 																																										Residents of Thakurpukur put up a roadblock in the area on Friday to protest the death of a physically challenged telephone booth owner in an accident on Thursday. As a result, traffic movement in the area was suspended for more than two hours in the evening. They demanded a traffic guard and road humps in the area. They also demanded the arrest of the driver of the killer bus. The blockade was lifted after police officers intervened. Shops remained closed on Friday in tribute.				 																																										Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has decided to complete the construction of the Jodhpur Park market which has been lying unfinished for about five years. It will be constructed on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. The Jodhpur Park Land and Housing Mortgage Society, founded in 1945, had promised to develop the market in 10 years before transferring it to the CMC. But as the Society could not complete the construction, the former CPM board took control of it in 1997. But little has changed since, prompting the latest move by the mayor.				 																																										A motorcycle rally taken out by cable operators, mostly from south Calcutta, was stopped by the police near Maniktala on Friday, since the two-wheeler-borne cablemen did not have the requisite permission, sources said. Calling themselves the Cable Operators Sangram Committee, they were protesting the confusing business policy of broadcasters and multi-system operators and demanding a uniform basic service charge across India in the post-conditional access system scenario, among other issues. Later, the group submitted a deputation to the offices of the Governor and the chief minister.				 																																										Two persons were arrested from Chandni Chowk on Friday on charges of selling pirated video and audio CDs. The investigators also recovered a number of pirated discs worth Rs 3.78 lakh from a shop. Those arrested were identified as Md Akbar and Jamal Rabbani. 				 																																										Calcutta Boys School will celebrate its 125th anniversary from January 26 to 31, on its premises.				 																																										Tanishq has launched a scheme whereby 22 karat gold jewellery will be available for Rs 65 to Rs 99 per gram making charge. The scheme, Gold Mine for 99, is valid till February 5.				 																																										O jay shree shyam seva sangh for distributing blankets among pavement-dwellers

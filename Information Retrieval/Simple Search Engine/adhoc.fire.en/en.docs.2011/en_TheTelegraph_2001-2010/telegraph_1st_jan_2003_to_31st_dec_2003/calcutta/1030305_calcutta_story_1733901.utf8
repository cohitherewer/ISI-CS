 Wednesday, March 05, 2003 				 Piped water for eastern pocket after 15 years
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The missing link, measuring 350 metres, in the civic water supply pipeline, which has denied around 50,000 residents in the Tiljala, Topsia and Kushtia areas filtered water for well over a decade, should be connected by the end of March. The laying of pipelines in Trinamul Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjees constituency began on Tuesday. The project cost is pegged at Rs 12 lakh.																								Chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury said: The people of Tiljala, Topsia, Shibtala, Roycharan Ghosh Lane, Kushtia Road and Picnic Garden Road will start receiving filtered surface water around the third week of March.																								Initially, filtered water will be supplied from the Park Circus booster station in the morning. The afternoon feed will start after the third 20-million gallon treatment plant is commissioned at Palta, added Roychaudhury.																								Water supply chief Sovan Chatterjee said earlier civic boards had never taken the initiative to bring this area under the Tallah-Palta network as this has been a traditional anti-Left pocket. While those living on the western side of Topsia Road had no water problems, houses on the eastern flank were deprived of this basic service for over 15 years.

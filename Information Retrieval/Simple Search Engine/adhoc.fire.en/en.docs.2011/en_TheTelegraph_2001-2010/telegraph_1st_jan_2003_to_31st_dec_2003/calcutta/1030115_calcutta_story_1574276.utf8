 Wednesday, January 15, 2003 				 Japan funds for uplift
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said on Tuesday that an estimated Rs 20 crore would be made available from Japans Fund for Poverty Reduction through the Asian Development Bank (ADB).																								The foreign funds will be utilised to improve quality of life of a large number of sex workers, sexually-abused women and destitute children in and around the city. The ADB has offered to dove-tail the Japanese-funded welfare project into the Rs 1,245-crore environment improvement project the civic authorities have already undertaken. 																								It is for the first time that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will undertake special development schemes for the red-light areas of the city, said the mayor.

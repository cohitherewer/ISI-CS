		 Monday, March 31, 2003 				 Traffic terror on three wheels
 MINI MENACE: A bus stop on BT Road,  near Dunlop Bridge, blocked to passengers by illegally-parked  auto-rickshaws. Pictures by Kishor Roy Chowdhur				 	 Madhavi Ghosh: In Salt Lake  and some other parts of the district, auto-rickshaw operators  have crossed the limit of tolerance. They create traffic  snarls and ask for fares as per their whims. They often  carry five to six persons per trip, without bothering about  traffic laws. 																																																													You will be glad to know that recently, some auto operators were booked for violating laws. Soon, the police and civic authorities will start further action. We will check with the motor vehicles department to ascertain how many auto-rickshaw owners have genuine licences.

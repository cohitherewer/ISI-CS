 Wednesday, July 02, 2003 				 Blockade to protest raid 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Women and children blocked the busy VIP Road for an hour on Tuesday morning to protest the growing lawlessness in the Shastribagan area of Baguiati. 																								Housewives raised slogans, demanding the arrest of the criminals who had raided the houses of a few businessmen and hurled bombs after they declined to buy protection. They were also protesting the intentional inaction of local police, who failed to arrest the criminals roaming freely in the area. 																								As tension mounted, police were deployed. Hardly half an hour after the attack, a teen gang raided a house. They fired three rounds after night guards chased them away.

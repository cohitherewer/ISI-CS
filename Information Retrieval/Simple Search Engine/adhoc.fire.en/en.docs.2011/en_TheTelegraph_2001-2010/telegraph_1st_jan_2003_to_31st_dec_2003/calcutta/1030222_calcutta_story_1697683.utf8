				 																																										One person was killed and 11 others, including a woman, were seriously injured when a chartered bus hit a taxi near VIP Nagar Bazar, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, on Friday evening. The victim was identified as Dhiren Burman, 35, a member of the Ananda Marga Pracharak Sangha. The injured have been admitted to the nearby Ruby General Hospital. The accident took place at around 7 pm, Tiljala police station sources said. The bus was coming at a high speed and hit a taxi, which was parked on the roadside. The bus then ran over several pedestrians. It was going from Ultadanga to Behala, additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Damayanti Sen said. Local people damaged the bus and assaulted the driver, Debotosh Sengupta, and then took him to a local club and kept him there. Sengupta claimed that he lost control of the bus. Police have impounded the bus. Traffic movement was disrupted for over three hours after the accident. Even as the police were struggling to bring things under control, a Tata Sumo hit a motorcycle near the spot of the accident. The motorcyclist, who is yet to be identified, was injured, police sources said. Meanwhile, MP and Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee and CPM leader and Sunderban affairs minister Kanti Ganguly rushed to the spot. The traffic signals in the area do not work and there are no traffic police personnel at the junctions, Banerjee alleged. Ganguly announced that the state government and district authorities would take the responsibility of the treatment of the injured, since they all come from poor families.

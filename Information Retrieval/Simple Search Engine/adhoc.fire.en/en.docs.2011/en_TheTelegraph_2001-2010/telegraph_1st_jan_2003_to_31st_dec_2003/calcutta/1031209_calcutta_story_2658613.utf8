 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government continues to play its CAS card close to its chest, failing to announce the date for even the first meeting of the implementation committee. 																								Nevertheless, service providers and cable operators have kicked off an initiative to try and speak in one voice at the deliberations of the rollout panel to clear the decks for the system.																								A closed-door meeting on Monday, attended by representatives of multi-system operators RPG Netcom, SitiCable and Manthan and various operator organisations  all members of the CAS implementation panel  sought to iron out differences and present a unified platform in favour of the technology. 																								Its in the interest of all the stakeholders that CAS is implemented at the earliest, said a committee member who attended the prelude parley.																								A large section of operators is even contemplating a signature campaign for CAS. We want to show that at least 80 per cent of the operators are in favour of the system. With all pay channels lining up substantial rate hikes, we will be forced to pass on the burden to the viewer if CAS is not rolled out by January 1, said a cable operator.

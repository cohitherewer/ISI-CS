 Tuesday, September 02, 2003 				 Judge prod to reopen HS review chapter
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Justice Pratap Roy of Calcutta High Court on Monday expressed a desire to revise his last weeks ruling that the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education was not bound to show the answer-script to aggrieved candidates.																								The judge asked counsel Supradip Roy to file a fresh petition for the revision of the earlier order. Justice Roy also asked the lawyer to submit the order of a division bench urging the HS council to bring more transparency in the process of publication of results to redress candidates not satisfied with evaluation of their answer-scripts.																								A division bench presided over by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur in 2000 had passed this directive while disposing of a case filed by Priyanka Sarkhel and 300 other students, demanding that the council issue photocopies of the answer-scripts with marksheets.																								Justice Roy also asked the lawyer to produce the Ranju Gopal Mukherjee Committees report before the court, if possible, during the hearing of the case fixed on Tuesday.																								Last week, the judge had dismissed the petition of Paramita Roy Chowdhury, a student of Dum Dum Airport Girls High School, who had failed the exams, scoring identical marks in physics, chemistry and mathematics. Paramitas answer-scripts were brought to the court and the judge found no irregularities.																								Paramitas counsel demanded that the court hand over the answer-scripts so that her teachers could assess them, but Justice Roy refused. On Monday, when the lawyer approached the court for a separate case, the judge asked him to submit a fresh plea to reopen the case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 16, 2003 				 Coffee, just the way Calcutta gulps it
 															- Brew masters spill the beans: there arent enough connoisseurs in the city NISHA LAHIRI																								Calcutta is gulping down coffee by the gallons, but dont dare ask it to distinguish between instant and brewed. The message from the Calcutta coffee drinker in one of the many newly-opened cafs in town is clear  understanding the beverage has very little to do with consuming it.																								Proof of the cuppa  cappuccino, the safe option, is the highest-selling brew in most cafs, and although blends and flavours are gaining fair ground, discernment is a distant dream.																								The right beans and blends make the coffee, and espresso is often the preferred choice of real coffee-lovers. Roasted or ground, Arabic or Brazilian, the choices are aplenty for the Calcutta coffee drinker. But few can fathom the brewed beverage.																								Cappuccino is the favourite at Aqua Java outlets, points out Saket Agarwal, and despite blended flavours being hits, he believes Calcuttans dont really understand the subtle nuances of the beverage. Calcuttans like coffee I dont believe that espresso is the benchmark of connoisseurs, although here they have a lot to learn, he adds. At Barista, D. Banerjee explains that people would rather go for the cappuccino than the mocha.																								But that hasnt stopped the caf concept from catching on (though Banerjee points out that the city has had a coffee-house culture for a long time). Barista has six outlets in the city and is planning another, while Caf Coffee Day has five, with three more on the way. Blends of the beverage are popular and the footfall is high.																								Culturally, coffee is not a traditional drink, feels Arnab Pandey, regional head of Caf Coffee Day. I think it will take at least another five years to get people to really understand coffee.																								And for that, educating consumers are the budding brew masters. On Friday, the new Caf Coffee Day outlet on Park Street was the stage for the chains first east India regional brew masters championship. 																								Twenty young participants from the cafs Calcutta, Bhubaneswar and Jamshedpur outlets had gathered to take a crack at the nationals, organised by the Speciality Coffee Association of India and Coffee Board of India, and then the international barista (coffeemaker) contest next year.																								Regularly trained, from the growing to the brewing stage, they are the new-age coffee connoisseurs, mixing and matching to not just make the perfect cup of cappuccino, but create new flavours to please the palate.																								Coffee might still be far behind tea, but judging by the number of cafs coming up at every corner, its not a just phase, but a lifestyle shift, observes M. Venkatesh, head of India operations, Caf Coffee Day. 																								Not to mention the fact that the most popular outlets are at Woodburn Park and New Alipore, perhaps because of easy availability of parking space and distance from the city-centre chaos, allowing for an unhurried and leisurely cup.

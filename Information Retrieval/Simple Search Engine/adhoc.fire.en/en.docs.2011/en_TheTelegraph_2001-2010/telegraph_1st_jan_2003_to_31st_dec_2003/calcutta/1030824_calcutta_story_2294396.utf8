The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, August 24, 2003 				 Pre-Puja date for Part I results
 A STAFF REPORTER																								There is good news for examinees awaiting the results of BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I (honours and general) examinations of Calcutta University.																								The university authorities are expecting to announce the results of the three exams within the targeted time  before the Pujas  even though the exams had to be rescheduled twice in 2003 due to the panchayat elections and a Citu-sponsored bandh. The exams were held in June and July.																								The universitys confidence stems from the overwhelming response from examiners this year to go through answer- scripts. Officials say, for the first time in many decades, this year nearly every teacher approached by the authorities agreed to examine answer-scripts.																								We are happy with the response. The remarkable improvement in the attitude of the teachers will help us avoid the delay due to the repeated postponing of the exam dates this year, said Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor, academic. We will be in a position to announce the exact dates in the second week of next month, he added.																								According to Das, the increasing response among the examiners is the result of a drive taken by the university to motivate teachers for more involvement in examination-related duties.																								Nearly 8,000 teachers have been engaged this year to check the answer-scripts of the universitys major undergraduate exams. More than one lakh students appeared in the exams and over 12 lakh answer-scripts have to be examined. 																								In the past, refusal of teachers to examine answer-scripts was one of the most serious problems faced by CU, delaying the publication of results. A large number of teachers would cite health problems, sources in the universitys examination department said. 																								Expecting a similar response this time, university authorities had announced in June that the results would be declared after the Pujas, though the university had introduced a system of announcing the results before the Puja vacation in 2002. 																								Talking about the special drive, Das said apart from motivating teachers through discussions, the university this year introduced certain changes in the process of appointment of examiners. For example, he said, this year college principals were asked to issue the appointment letters to the examiners. Earlier, the appointment letters were issued directly by the university which made it difficult for the authorities to trace the unwilling teachers.																								In the new system, the heads of colleges could verify the excuses cited by the unwilling teachers and this brought down the number of refusals.

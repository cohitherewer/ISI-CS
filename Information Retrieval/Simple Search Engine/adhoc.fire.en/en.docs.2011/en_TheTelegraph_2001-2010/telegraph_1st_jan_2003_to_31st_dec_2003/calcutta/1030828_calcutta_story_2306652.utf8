  The road ahead: A crater on a city  street  It is ironic that only after the blood sugar of fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee was detected at different levels in different diagnostic laboratories in the city that the health department seems to have got the wake-up call to respond to this messy aspect of healthcare in West Bengal (Blood test mess miffs minister, Metro, July 23).  However, the minister may not be aware that many factors like a different meal and exercise regimen may also influence the blood glucose level. Even stress may cause fluctuation. It is possible that both results were correct.  On the other hand, bogus test results are a regular feature here as there is hardly any control over the mushrooming laboratories by either the government or the Medical Council. It is indeed amusing that a minister of the ruling government had to test his own blood to realise the bitter truth.  Ive seen a copy of a completely blank blood report card from a popular laboratory in Burdwan that nevertheless contained the signature of a pathologist on an otherwise empty page. Obviously, the busy registered pathologist routinely signs these blank reports en masse at his convenience to enable the poorly trained and often unlicensed laboratory workers to do the actual examination and fill up the blank report.  The minister did not suffer but other individuals may not be as lucky. Ive received complaints of medical negligence where a fabricated blood report was produced by a health centre when the patient was actually suffering from malignant malaria and eventually died from it. A proper blood examination could have saved his life.  For ordinary patients, it is almost impossible to establish whether these licenced laboratories have been producing erroneous reports. Unfortunately, the state government is a mere spectator to the state of affairs.  Kunal Saha,
 President, People for Better Treatment,Columbus, Ohio.  Apropos the report Peril pothole kills cop (Metro, July 26), it was painful to read about the tragic death of the sub-inspector of Calcutta Police. How long will the authorities fool citizens with tall promises every time a mishap occurs due to bad roads?  Sunil Banerjee, 
 VIP Road.  It is sad to read so often about  precious life lost due to negligence of either the Corporation  or some telecom company or doctors. Death traps are set  all over Calcutta in one form or another. The CMC has become  very prompt in sending tax bills but has overlooked its  duty of rendering services. Purnima Vasudeva,
 Rowland Road.  Arup Chatterjee, mayoral council  member in charge of roads, had the audacity to blame the  victim for his own death and compared CMC roads with those  in Mumbai. He should have talked of the roads of Patna,  Kanpur or Burdwan, which do not exist. When will this habit  of passing the buck by our politicians stop? Renu Sashmal, 
 Mudiali.  When a major thoroughfare like  CIT Road is in such a state, one shudders to think about  the condition of the smaller roads.  Chandan Ray,
 Address not given.  It is collective negligence (coupled  with total incompetence) of the road repair contractors  and the civic officials which is responsible for the death  of SI Arun Mazumdar (Cops hit hard in neglect hunt, Metro,  July 28). The only way to save the city is to dismiss them  and lock them up for manslaughter! A. Chakravorty,
 Jodhpur Park.  The report Assault over refusal to talk assault (Metro, July 24) provided us a slice of the present political scenario. It was really sad to know of CMC chairman Anil Mukherjees plight, who at his advanced age, has been a victim of Left Front councillors ire. It is a shame to even talk of these politicians.  Kunal Ray,
 Howrah.  Apropos Twin lessons in Queens language (Metro, July 24) both measures to improve communication skills in English will definitely help undergraduate students. But, the measures should be introduced from Class IX in secondary schools.  Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
 Behala.  In response to the letter No faith in our care in this column on July 21, I am sending the feedback given by Vivek Oberoi on his treatment in our hospital.  Thank you for taking such good care of me and making me feel at home. You have treated me like I was your own family. Thank you for genuinely caring for me and comforting me through my pain. You have an excellent team. God bless you all. Lots of love and best wishes. Vivek Oberoi  Cdr. S.C. Iyer,
 CEO, The Calcutta Medical Research Institute.

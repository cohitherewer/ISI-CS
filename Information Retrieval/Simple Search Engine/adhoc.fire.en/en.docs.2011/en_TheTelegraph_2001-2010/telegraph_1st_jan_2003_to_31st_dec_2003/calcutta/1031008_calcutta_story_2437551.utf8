The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, October 08, 2003  Indrani Halder								Actress																																							The actual pujo takes place on the ghot. This is where the Devi comes to life. The idols are there for the convenience of conceptualising the goddess. The themes actually add to the attraction of the Pujas and draw attention to social issues. I mostly do my pandal-hopping on television, apart from the pujas I go to inaugurate. In one puja, Osama bin Laden was portrayed as Mahisasura. This is a reflection of our times. The Pujas have also emerged as a platform for creativity, be it through the conventional bamboo or cane or the innovative chilli or tin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, May 30, 2003 				 Pilgrims progress
Everyone knows Sunil Das, the enfant terrible of contemporary Indian art who refuses to be dominated by convention and tradition. A pioneer of sorts, Das entry into the world of art was meteoric  he came, he saw and he conquered. Das tryst with destiny began when he was still in art college and his work was selected for the coveted National Award instituted by Lalit Kala Akademi. That was way back in 1959 and the work that was submitted by Das was the study of a horse he had made in the police stables. His style was unmistakable  the fluid bold strokes captured not only the equine grace but, more importantly, portrayed the subjects very essence. With the award, he charged into the national scene as an artist who had already established a distinctive style. Over the years, Das has experimented with forms, mediums and images. A non-conformist, Das has nonchalantly shaken off the inheritance factor, once claiming that his painterly idiom was his own and that he did not owe anything to anyone. A mellowed man now though the fire burns within, and if the embers are stoked, out comes the rebel. The first phase of a retrospective of his works gives a ring-side view of the artist and his creations.																								When: Till June 15; 11 am - 7 pm																								Where: ITC Sonar Bangla Art Gallery

 Tuesday, December 16, 2003 				 Nandikars 20th National Theatre Fest
																								Come winter and the city gears up for some cultural activities that act like fresh oxygen and rejuvinates it. Individual artistes and groups await eagerly for this time of the year to showcase their talents. Nandikar has been striving to convert more and more people into theatre buffs, tutoring the audience to appreciate good theatre. With this aim, the group has been holding regular workshops, seminars, lectures as well as theatre festivals. This year the festival steps into its 20th year and the 11-day affair begins this evening at 6 with a Hindi play, Janemann, by the National School of Drama (NSD) Repertory Company, Delhi. Written by Machhindra More and directed by Waman Kendre, the play is about the third sex who have little acceptance in our society. They are an enigmatic presence, who stick out like a sore thumb, often ridiculed and chased away by society. The play attempts to observe them from close quarters, delve into their lives and explore the many layers of their conscience and existence. 																								When: Till December 26																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

The decision was taken after the Railway Protection Forces intelligence wing informed the Railway Board about the possibility of sabotage on the tracks. The new timings will be enforced from July 1, said Subhas Ranjan Thakur, chief operations manager, Eastern Railway. Thakur said the speed of Rajdhani was reduced from 110 kph to 75 kph on the section between Koderma and Dehri-on-Sone of East Central Railway. As per the new timings, 2301 Up Howrah-Rajdhani Express via Gaya, which runs six days a week, will leave Howrah at 4.15 pm instead of 5 pm.

State fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee on Thursday reiterated that it would be mandatory for puja organisers to submit layout plans of their pandals while seeking permission from the government. The organisers will also have to ensure that they submit their illumination plans. The illumination plan has to be approved by a licensed electrician. The minister, however, promised that the organisers will not be asked to disclose the theme on which they were planning their pandals. Several organisers had recently met the minister and expressed their unwillingness to submit the pandal plan. They feared this would disclose their themes to their rivals.																																																								he government has prepared a list of inflammable materials which will not be permitted to be used for decorating a pandal. Such materials include dry grass, hogla reeds, golpata, bamboo strips, untreated tarpaulin, polythene and canvases. The minister said the government released an order last week announcing the inclusion of the new restrictions imposed on erection of pandals under the rules of the West Bengal Fire Services Act, 1956. He said violation will attract six years imprisonment or a fine of Rs 50,000.

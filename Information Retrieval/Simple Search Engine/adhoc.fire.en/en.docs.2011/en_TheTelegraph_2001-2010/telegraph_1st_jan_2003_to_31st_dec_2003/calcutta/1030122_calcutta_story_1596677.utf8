The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 22, 2003 				 																				Rajesh Kumar Singh								Additional superintendant of police, industrial, South 24-Parganas				 				 						The Constitution allows any citizen to make an arrest for the sake of law and order. Only, he has to hand the miscreant over to the police. The state retains the right to prosecute. So citizens groups can always help the force out, but all powers of the police cannot be given to the common people. The police are accountable to the government and are trained for the job professionally. There are lots of technicalities involved in implementation of the law, which novices are not expected to follow.

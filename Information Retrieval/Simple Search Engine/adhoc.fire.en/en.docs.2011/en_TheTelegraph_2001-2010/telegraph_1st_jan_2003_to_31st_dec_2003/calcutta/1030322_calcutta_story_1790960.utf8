 Saturday, March 22, 2003 				 Sacked man stabs employer in shop 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								He was sacked three days ago. On Friday, he returned to teach his employer a lesson. In a daring daylight attack, 23-year-old Suresh Sharma stabbed Hanuman Prasad Mollu, a garment dealer, on Madan Mohan Burman Street, in the Jorasanko police station area. 																								As the youth sped away, the businessman was rushed to Marwari Relief Society Hospital with multiple stab wounds in his abdomen.																								It was the second consecutive incident of a worker exacting revenge. On Thursday, employer Ashoke Dutta was beaten up by one of his former employees in Chitpur. 																								Dutta, proprietor of an advertising agency, was severely thrashed by Sanjay Bera and two of his associates. Bera had been sacked by Dutta. 																								Timir Bhattacharya, officer-in-charge of Jorasanko thana, said Mollu had sacked Suresh for his irregularities. He started suspecting Suresh of squandering his business funds, Bhattacharya added.																								According to the police, Suresh was caught redhanded several times. The owner had warned him thrice, before sacking him on Tuesday, said a Jorasanko police station official.																								To plot his revenge, Suresh kept tabs on Mollu from the day he was sacked. The trader would open his office-cum-shop around 9.30 am, said Bhattacharya, adding: On Friday, as soon as he entered the shop, Suresh stabbed him from behind. While Mollu fell, he was slashed in the abdomen repeatedly.																								Hearing Mollus scream, other shop-owners rushed to the spot. But Suresh managed to escape before they could grab him. Mollu was shifted to hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical. Police said they were conducting raids to track down Suresh.

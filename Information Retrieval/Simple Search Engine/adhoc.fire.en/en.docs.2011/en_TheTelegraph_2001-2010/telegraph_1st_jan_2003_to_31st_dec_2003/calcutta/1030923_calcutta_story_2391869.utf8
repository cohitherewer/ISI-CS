The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, September 23, 2003 				 Medical seat plea okayed
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After two attempts this year to get a Medical Council of India (MCI) nod for another 200 under-graduate medical seats, the state government had something to cheer about on Monday: news trickled in from Delhi that the MCI had, in principle, agreed to issue a letter of intent to the Union health ministry for its consideration of the matter.																								Health secretary Asim Barman is off to the capital on Tuesday for the meeting with health ministry officials so that the crucial letter is issued within September 30, the last date for admission to MBBS 2003. 																								It was learnt that the MCI nod covers 100 seats at SSKM Hospital only. The state government had also sought permission for under-graduate classes at the newly-formed Midnapur Medical College and Hospital.

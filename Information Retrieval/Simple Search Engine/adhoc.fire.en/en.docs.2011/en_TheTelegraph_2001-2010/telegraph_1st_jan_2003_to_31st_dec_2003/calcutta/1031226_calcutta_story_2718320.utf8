	Its coolie raj at Howrah station. As soon as a long-distance  train pulls in, the coolies pounce into the compartments  and snatch the belongings of the passengers, without even  bothering to take their permission. Then they charge exorbitant  rates, even for carrying lightweight luggage. I have often  seen them misbehaving with women passengers. The authorities  must spare us this harassment.  
	B.N. Bose, Dum Dum.  
	Office-goers have a hard time walking in the areas adjoining  India Exchange Place, Netaji Subhas Road, Brabourne Road  and Fairlie Place. Eateries, tea stalls and fruit-sellers  have encroached on the footpaths. The shabby look does not  suit the business hub of a metropolis.  
	Chandan Ray, Sarsuna.  
	The condition of toilets at Park Circus rail station needs  to be improved. The stench is unbearable.  
	Mohal Lal Sarkar, Budge Budge.

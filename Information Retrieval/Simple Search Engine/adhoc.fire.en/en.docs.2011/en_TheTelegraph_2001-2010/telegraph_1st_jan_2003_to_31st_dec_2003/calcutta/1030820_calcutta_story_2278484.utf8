	Smoking and chewing tobacco among high school and college  students have increased in recent times. One is bound to  find packets of paan masala strewn on the floor in  classrooms and the walls stained with tobacco spit. The  authorities must make their students aware of the ill effects  of tobacco consumption. 
	 Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane.  
	I am a regular commuter of S-4 and have to reach my Salt  Lake office by 9.30 am. So, I need to catch a bus from Parnasree  that starts between 8.15 and 8.25 am. There are about 25  to 30 office-goers who also take this trip daily. We will  benefit if the CSTC introduces more vehicles on this route.  
	Keshab K. Chowdhury, Behala.  
	The Pujas are round the corner and the roads need repairs.  The civic authorities must ensure that the potholes are  at least covered with stone chips, if not coated with tar.  
	Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum.

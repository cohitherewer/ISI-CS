 Thursday, July 31, 2003 				 Fine slap on power utility
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Wednesday directed power utility CESC to pay a fine of Rs 3,400 to Jogeswar Rout, a small-time shopkeeper on Bakulbagan Road, in Bhowanipore, for harassment caused to him by an officer demanding a bribe of Rs 5,000.																								Jogeswar said in his petition that his nephew, Arjun, owner of a shop on Beltala Road, had his electricity line disconnected for non-payment of a Rs-14,000 bill. Arjun then plied his trade from Jogeswars shop. A CESC officer turned up at Jogeswars shop and threatened to snap his power line over the illegal business being conducted from there by Arjun. He demanded hush money of Rs 5000, Jogeswar said.																								On his refusal to pay, Jogeswars line was snapped. He went to court and won a restoration order. On Wednesday, his counsel sought damages, and won it.

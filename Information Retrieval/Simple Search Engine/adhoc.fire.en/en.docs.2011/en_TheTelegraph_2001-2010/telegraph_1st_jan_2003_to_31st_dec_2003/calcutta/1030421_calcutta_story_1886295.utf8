 Monday, April 21, 2003 				 Teachers draw higher scales
 																											- CU has 110 professors more than governments sanctioned posts A STAFF REPORTER																								Nearly 80 teachers of Calcutta University (CU), mostly of the rank of professors  the seniormost rank any university teacher can hold  are drawing excess salaries from the government.																								The governments audit department has recently written to CU, seeking explanations for paying excess salaries to at least 80 teachers whose pay-scales have been fixed at much higher rates than what they deserve.																								 University sources said the government audit department has expressed serious concern over the manner in which the university had promoted nearly 110 readers to the rank of professor during the past five years. The promotions had been made without government sanction. The university has 260 professors. But the government has a maximum of 150 sanctioned professor posts for CU.																								We were surprised to detect that the salaries of nearly 80 professors working in various departments of Calcutta University are fixed at much higher scales than what they deserve. We have given a number of reminders to the university and wanted to know the rationale for paying them such higher scales. Unfortunately, the authorities have still not replied, said an officer of the audit department, preferring anonymity.																								The university has two systems for recruiting professors. By the age-old procedure, advertisements inviting applications from candidates from across the country are published in newspapers. The universitys selection committees are in charge of screening and final recruitment. 																								The second is a comparatively new method, introduced by the university in 1986 and 1997, under the governments career advancement and merit promotion schemes.																								All the 110 teachers who are now holding the post exceeding the 150 limit set by the government were promoted under the governments career advancement and merit promotion schemes.																								On the basis of a directive of the University Grants Commission, the government had introduced the career advancement and merit promotion schemes for university teachers in 1986 and 1997, respectively.																								University teachers, after teaching for a certain period, are required to submit self-assessment reports to the university. Officers in the audit department said, the self-assessment reports of a bulk of the teachers who have been promoted to the post of professor were unsatisfactory. CU registrar Ujjal Basu denied comment.

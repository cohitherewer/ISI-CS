 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Ammunition haul nets three more 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Meghalaya police have rounded up three persons, including the owner of the truck found abandoned in a city parking lot with more than 25,000 rounds of live AK-47 ammunition. The arrest of this trio takes to six the number of persons rounded up so far.																								We have received news that Meghalaya police have netted three men. The truck-owner and his associates are being sent over and we expect them to reach here tomorrow, said Damayanti Sen, deputy commissioner of police (special), detective department, on Friday. 																								The truck, which had the ammunition hidden behind a false ceiling in the drivers cabin, had arrived from Assam on August 6. And on September 3, police recovered it from the Dhobitala parking lot, in the port area. 																								The owner of the truck was identified as Keoarstone Momin, elder brother of Sirush Momin, the man who had sent the consignment from Assam to Calcutta. Momin was arrested by Meghalaya police in Tura, in the Garo Hills. Sirush purchased the truck in the name of his brother. He is a militant of the Meghalaya-based Achik National Volunteer Council, a terrorist outfit, said a Meghalaya police officer.																								We alerted our Meghalaya counterparts immediately after the ammunition haul and handed over a list of suspects, in which the names of Sirush and Keoarstone were mentioned, said a detective department official.																								Earlier, the sleuths rounded up Syed Abid Imam, an employee of the Food Corporation of India, and a former footballer of East Bengal, from Malda. Imam is the kingpin of a racket that supplies arms and ammunition to militant outfits in Kashmir. He was the receiver of the ammunition in Calcutta, said an official investigating the case.

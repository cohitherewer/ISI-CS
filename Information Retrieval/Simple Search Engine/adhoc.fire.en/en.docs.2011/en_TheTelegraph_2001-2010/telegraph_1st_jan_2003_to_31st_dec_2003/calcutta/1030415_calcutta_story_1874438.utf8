				 																																										The  22-year-old man admitted at the Infectious Diseases Hospital  in Beleghata on Wednesday with suspected symptoms of the deadly  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was released from  the hospital on Monday evening after reports confirmed the  Gorakhpur-based businessman was suffering from other respiratory  infections, not SARS. At around 5.30 pm, the businessman,  who had arrived from Bangkok with respiratory distress and  fever, was told he was free to go home, after nearly five  days in isolation. Another patient, Subir Maity of Ghatal,  who had rushed to the same hospital from Kalighat two days  ago with symptoms common to SARS, was transferred to the general  ward on Monday afternoon after doctors concluded he was not  carrying the deadly virus that has left many dead in Southeast  Asia. 				 																																										Presidency jail authorities shifted Ketan Parekh, alleged mastermind of a multi-crore share scam, to Presidency jail from SSKM Hospital on Monday. Parekh was admitted to the hospital on March 7 after he complained of chest pain. Though his release order had been issued five days ago, he was not allowed to shift as the jail authorities had failed to clear the dues. He was discharged after the SSKM authorities were given an assurance of payment. 				 																																										Banik Roy, 27, was killed in an accident on Alipore Road on Monday.

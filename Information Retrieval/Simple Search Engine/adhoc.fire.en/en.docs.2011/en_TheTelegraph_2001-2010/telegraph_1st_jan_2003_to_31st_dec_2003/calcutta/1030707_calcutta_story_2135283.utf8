  Seagull Empire and Sanskriti Sagar jointly host a very special programme, Five Monologues and a Rock Band, featuring a suite of five monologues by award-winning playwright Manjula Padmanabhan in the form of an ensemble theatre production, comprising a series of short pieces interspersed with live music performed by the rock band, Insomnia. The theatre performance is the outcome of a 10-day Actors workshop, conducted by well-known theatre and television personality Jayant Kripalani at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre with a group of talented, young people. This is the first time these pieces will be performed. Produced by The Red Curtain, this theatre production is directed by Kripalani and the central theme is anti-violence and pro-peace. The event also includes the release of Padmanabhans book, Hidden Fires, a collection of five monologues, published by Seagull Books. The proceeds from the performance will go towards the Peace Works project, an initiative of The Seagull Foundation for the Arts with young people, aimed at promoting peaceful coexistence.When: Today at 7 pmWhere:  Copyright

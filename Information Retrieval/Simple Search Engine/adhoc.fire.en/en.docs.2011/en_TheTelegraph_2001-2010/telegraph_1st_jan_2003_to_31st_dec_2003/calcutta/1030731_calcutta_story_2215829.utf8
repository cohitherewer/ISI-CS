The Telegraph - Calcutta

	The Metro Rail authorities are very lackadaisical about  maintaining the entry-exit machines at the stations. I have  recently lost a multi-ride ticket to faulty punching machines  for the third time in a short while. I commute regularly  between Shyambazar and Kalighat, and cannot face this harassment  any more. A large sum is allocated for maintenance, then  why should the Metro men get away with such callousness?  Asim Paul, PNC Lane. 				 																																									Residents  of Mahendra Nath Roy Road, in Howrah, are inconvenienced by  noise pollution, but there seems to be no redress in sight.  During any festival or function in the locality, the organisers  set up a sound system. Music is played from 6 in the morning  to 11 in the night, with the sound well above the 65-decibel  mark. I have complained to the police, but they dont respond.  My grandfather has a heart problem, while my siblings are  all students.

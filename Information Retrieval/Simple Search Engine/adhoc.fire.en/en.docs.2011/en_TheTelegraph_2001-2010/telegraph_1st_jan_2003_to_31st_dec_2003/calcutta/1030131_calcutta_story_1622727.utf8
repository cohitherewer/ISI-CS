				 																																									The recent changes in fare and the period of validity of metro tickets unfortunately overlook the problems of one-way commuters. It is not possible to exhaust 40 rides in 30 days, nor 80 rides in 90 days given that there are the weekly holidays during that period. Faced with this problem, though buying daily tickets is cumbersome, most office-goers are opting out of season tickets. I request you to retain the earlier option of 12 rides with a reasonable validity period and increase the period of validity of the new season tickets.

Several unauthorised car-servicing garages have mushroomed on the stretch between Rowland Road and Chakraberia Road. Cars parked on either side of this narrow lane leave little space for commuting. Alongside the car-repair shops, many makeshift eateries and illegal dwellings have also cropped up in this residential area. Its unfortunate that the local police dont bother to check such illegal activities.				 																																									Name and address withheld.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 																				Colonel (retd) Saumitra Ray								Former CEO, Salt Lake stadium																																							Most short-term damage to the stadium is caused by spectators. They, for example, break chairs and ransack toilets, electrical fittings, fencing, gates and water taps. Even VIP and VVIP block spectators break chairs, throw peanut shells and cigarette butts and spit on the walls. Few spectators bother to get up from their seats to throw food waste in litter bins. Not only should a maintenance fee be added to the tickets, spot fines should also be imposed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, April 26, 2003 				 Wada Chirebandi
				 																																																																				The play, written in 1983 (originally in Marathi by Mahesh Elkunchwar) captures vividly the gradual decline of the Wada culture in Maharashtra, unable to stand the test of time and the social changes in the world beyond. Wada, which means an ancient ancestral country house, is the focal point of this play. The play reveals the skeletons of a culture , stuck in time. The Wada insularity is a product of the large joint-family with its hierarchic patriarchy that holds the tensions in check under a facile pretence of authority. The crises brought forth in this intense play are more than mere family crises  they are crises of a more serious nature. The crisis at the centre of the play is one of traditional culture against commercial or consumer culture. As playwright Elkunchwar says,  Wada is not a simple family drama, it is more than that, a document of social and political changes. Translated in Hindi by Vasant Dev, this Padatik presentation is designed and directed by Kunal Padhi.																								When: April 27 at 10 am																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

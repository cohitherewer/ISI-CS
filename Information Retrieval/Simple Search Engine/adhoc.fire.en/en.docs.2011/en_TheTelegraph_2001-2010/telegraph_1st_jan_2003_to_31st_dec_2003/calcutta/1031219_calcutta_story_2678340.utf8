 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								Car-owners aplenty want to sell their vehicles, even at throwaway prices. These are cars with engines that do not match the Bharat Stage II standards. The sell-off cause: spiralling taxes. 																								While some have decided to sell off their cars, others have surrendered their blue books to the public vehicles department (PVD), since no tax is charged if this is done. At least a thousand owners have surrendered their blue books. Many more have applied, a PVD official admitted. He said there is road tax due from about a lakh car-owners.																								Transport lobbies are up in arms against the government move to compel car-owners to make a one-time payment of five years tax. The Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI) is to move court against the order.																								 According to the system, introduced in October, owners of cars up to 10 years old have to pay road tax for five years in one go. For cars that are over 10 years old, the tax can be paid annually. A bill on the tax has been passed in the Assembly budget session.																								According to the existing tax structure, the owner of a vehicle up to 10 years old must pay Rs 2,000 as registration fee, Rs 10,000 as road tax (one-time for five years), Rs 50 for a pollution under control (PUC) certificate, Rs 1,000 for a certificate of fitness (CF), and if the proposed flyover tax is imposed, another Rs 500. Then, there is a cess on petrol and diesel at Re 1 per litre.																								So, an owner of a 10-year-old car will have to pay a tax of Rs 13,500. The amount is Rs 15,000 for a commercial vehicle. Cars that are over 10 years old will be taxed a minimum of Rs 3,050 annually. According to transport department officials, of the nine lakh vehicles in the city, at least 80 per cent are 10 years old and 50 per cent 15 to 20 years old.																								The confusion over Bharat II has sent old car prices crashing. There are no takers for cars over 10 years old. The cost of a 10-year-old Ambassador or Fiat has come down to Rs 10,000. A 15-year-old Maruti will fetch between Rs 30,000 and Rs 40,000, said P.K. Agarwal, a trader of old cars in south Calcutta. He pointed out that an owner of a 10-year-old car will have to pay a tax of Rs 13,500 for a vehicle whose resale value is a maximum of Rs 10,000.																								Samar Mitra, who deals in vehicle scrap on Ritchie Road, said his garage was choc-a-bloc with old cars. I have a waiting list of 200 owners wanting to sell their vehicles at Rs 5,000, he said.																								H. Mohan, PVD director, admitted to a trend in selling old cars after the court order on Bharat II. I cannot say whether the trend is due to the tax load. Owners can avail of the discount we offer if they pay the one-time, five-year tax, he said.

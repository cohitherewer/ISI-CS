 Friday, June 27, 2003  Maltese Cross in city heart
 Jim Pearson, now a Londoner,  recounts the days of the Bengal United Service Club on Chowringhee,  which later sold out to the Geological Survey of India The Geological Survey of India building: High on history.  Picture by Pabitra Das  The Bengal United Service Club  was founded in 1845 as The Bengal Military Club. Membership  was restricted to Commissioned Officers, Military and Naval  Chaplains, members of the ICS and Barrister Judges of the  High Court as may have received permanent appointments from  the Home Government. I am not aware when the name was  changed to the Bengal United Service Club, but it may have  been 1855, because I remember a centenary dinner in, I think,  1955, at which the Clutterbucks, who were on a visit from  Delhi, were guests of honour. It cannot have been the centenary  of the founding of the club or of the building, and thus  I feel confident that it was the centenary of the club under  its present name. I do not know the original location  of the club, but an early address was 30 and 31, Chowringhee,  which, since the Bengal Club was at 33 and 34, Chowringhee,  must also have been south of Park Street. The club must  have prospered in its early days for it to have been able  to afford to erect a purpose-built clubhouse instead of  enlarging a former Nabobs house. The design for the building  was innovative in that it sought to catch any breeze that  there might be and distribute this throughout the building.  The design was in the shape of a Maltese Cross. On the ground  floor, the four arms of the Cross housed the billiards room,  the administrative offices, the library, and chambers for  the accommodation of temporary visitors. The octagonal space,  from which the arms of the Cross radiated, was used as the  members bar. On the first floor, the arms of the Cross  were occupied by the dining room, the kitchen, the card-room  and the reading room. The space above the octagonal bar  was open to the roof and provided an entrance lobby at the  top of the main staircase to the public rooms.  Although originally founded for  ICS men and military officers, it later became necessary  to include other services such as the Indian Police, the  Forest Service, the Bengal Pilot Service and others. I do  not know quite how far this went  possibly it included  anybody who could not be described as a box-wallah! During World War II, temporary  membership of clubs all over India was offered to commissioned  officers. For example, during my five years in the Indian  army, I was able to make use of the Bangalore United Services  Club, the Royal Bombay Yacht Club, the Sirhind Club Ambala,  the Jhansi Club, the Saugor Club, the Abbotobad Club, the  Murree Club, the Srinagar Club, the Shillong Club, the Madras  Club and the Narbadda Club Jabalpore. However, any such  facility must have been a closely-guarded secret known only  to those stationed in Calcutta and Barrackpore. Anyway, I did not learn of the  existence of the US Club, as it was commonly known, until  1949 when, after a year spent up-country, I was due to return  to Calcutta and needed somewhere to live. Someone suggested  that, as an ex-officer, I would be eligible to join the  US Club. At that time, the membership was  still mainly made up of members of the ICS and other services.  However, the majority of these had retired to the UK since  Independence. They had nevertheless retained their membership  on the off chance that they might return to Calcutta, or,  more likely, in the hope that the club would have to be  wound up and they would receive a pay-out. There were, however,  still a few of the old members living in the club  a high  court judge, the head of the Geological Survey of India  (GSI), the wartime tea controller, four senior Hooghly pilots,  and so on. Among the non-resident members were former members  of the ICS who had stayed on under short-term contracts  in the Pakistan Administrative Service in East Bengal and  used the club when in Calcutta. Thus the service qualification  remained intact and, whilst it was not originally intended  that this should include ex-officers, it was convenient  to overlook this and the greater part of the resident members  were now people like myself  mercantile assistants who  had been wartime officers. Many of us had been in the Indian  army, and living in the club was very like living in an  Indian army mess. With this influx of new members, the club  was full to bursting point, and for my first two months  I had to live in one of a row of hutches on the roof built  during the war. Before very long, however, the  supply of new mercantile assistants who were ex-officers  began to dry up. It, therefore, became necessary to look  elsewhere for new members. The first thought was to offer  membership to officers in the Merchant Navy. This did not  go down well with the Hooghly Pilots, and a compromise was  made whereby ship captains were offered temporary membership  whilst their ships were in port. Temporary membership was  also offered to officers in the British Gurkhas stationed  in Barrackpore or up-country. None of this increased the  numbers sufficiently, and the service qualification ceased  to be insisted on. Hitherto, there had been no Indian  members, although, unlike some clubs, there was no bar to  Indian guests of members being entertained. In fact there  was one Indian resident in the person of a lady from a very  distinguished Bengali family, who was the wife of a former  ICS man. I doubt if ladies were admitted  to the club building in the earlier years and the only concession  to them was a single-storey building in the club compound  known as the Lawn House, which was used for dinners or dances  at which ladies could be present. There were, however, no  lady members in their own right at any time during the history  of the club. Wives lived in the club or otherwise made use  of it in their husbands names and, in order to make things  more comfortable for them, an effort was made to improve  the public rooms and the quarters. The larger card-room  was re-decorated in what was considered a more feminine  style. This was not an unqualified success, as was shown  when someone said to Sir Percival Griffiths, What do you  think of it, PJ? to which the great man replied, Bloody  awful. It is like a brothel without the bandobast. It was all to little avail, and  negotiations with the new club were entered into. The plan  was that the new club should sell its building and bring  its money and its members to the US Club. Both committees  were in favour, as were the members of the US Club. Not  surprisingly, the members of the new club were not in favour.  They preferred to sell their building, take their share  of the money and then consider joining the US Club. This was the last chance of saving  the club and, when it failed, the only thing to do was to  go into liquidation. The committee made enquiries concerning  the possibility of selling the building, but the advice  was that, although the site on Chowringhee was a valuable  one, it was an encumbered site and anyone buying it would  first have to knock down the building before they could  develop it. By a stroke of fortune, the next-door  GSI had been urging the government to requisition the building.  Whilst the club still had some hope of carrying on, this  proposal was stoutly resisted. However, the writing was  on the wall and, as the price the government was prepared  to pay was very fair, resistance to the requisition was  withdrawn. In the end the sale had to be rushed through  before the end of the year, otherwise the purchase money  would have ceased to be available. It was sad to see the end of so  old an institution. On the other hand, the building was  preserved and could be used for a purpose for which it was  extremely suitable, both from the standpoint of location  and design  members got a reasonable share of the proceeds,  and the only real sufferers were those who had to find somewhere  else to live.

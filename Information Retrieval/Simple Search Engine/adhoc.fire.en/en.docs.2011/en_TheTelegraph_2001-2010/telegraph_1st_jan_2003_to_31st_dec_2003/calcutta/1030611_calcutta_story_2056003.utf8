The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
You Answer  We Ask You Answer  Tell cops all about tenants
  Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should house-owners be penalised if they fail to inform the police about tenants?  Home truths: Keeping watch on strangers downstairs
 

Sandipan Dutta,
 Sukantapally. Penalising a house-owner who fails to inform the police about his tenants cannot be justified until intimation to the police about tenants is made compulsory. Hence, at present, house-owners should not be penalised if they fail to inform the police about their tenants.

Pritam Chakrabarty,
 Serampore. House-owners provide a safe haven for those involved in illegal or immoral activities. So, the house-owners are indirectly responsible for these malpractices. Therefore, the local police must be informed about tenants. If not, house-owners must be penalised.

Sudipa Dutta Chowdhury,
 Dum Dum Park. House-owners should, in their own interest, find out the details about their tenants before renting their houses. Persons who are new to the city should be dealt with cautiously. We all have a duty towards society. If a penalty is imposed upon house-owners, nothing much will change. Besides, it is not practical to find out the details about every person renting a house. It will only lead to harassment of innocent individuals.

Moumita Das,
 Address not given. Definitely. It is the duty of the house-owner to inform the local police about his/her tenant to be on the safe-side and avoid clandestine activities taking place in the house. This should help the police keep a tab on people residing in a locality.

Bhanu Dwarkani,
 Rabindra Nagar. Though house-owners should keep an eye on the activities of tenants, they cannot be penalised if they fail to do so. House-owners cannot spend all their time keeping a vigil on their tenants. They have their own work to do.

Satyen Biswas,
 Behala. A landlord should ask the tenant to furnish his/her particulars, including recent photographs, and he should personally go to the nearest police station and submit the information. 

Sounak Chakraborty,
 Barui Para Lane. Every house-owner should inform the police before letting out the premises. But most house-owners have no knowledge about the rules of tenancy. An awareness campaign is called for.

Michelle Mendes,
 Marquis Lane. With the spurt in criminal activities, this is a welcome move. This should be more strictly adhered to in case of people who come from outside. If house-owners inform the police, they would not be held entirely responsible even if an incident of crime occurs on his premises. 

SANANDA SEN,
 New Alipore. Definitely. It is the duty of every house-owner to inform the police about his\ her tenants. But often they do not feel the need to inform the police. But if any dispute occurs they run to the police for assistance.

Biswajit ganguly,
 Dakshindari Road. House-owners should cooperate with the cops for catching criminals. But they are scared to go to police stations due to fear of harassment.

Hara Lal Chakraborty,
 Arabinda Nagar. When a person stays under anothers roof, he has to behave responsibly. In our scriptures it is stated Ajnata kulashileshu basam na deyam, i.e. a person whose whereabouts are not known should not be given shelter. In todays world, due to high mobility of people, one cannot escape dealing with strangers while letting out a house. The minimum that a citizen can do is inform the police about the details declared by the tenant along with his photograph. Failure to do this should attract a heavy penalty.

Tapan Pal,
 Batanagar. Definitely. Rather than lethargy or indifference, it is the lure of easy money that prevents house-owners from reporting tenants to the police. After all, drug-runners and terrorists pay a higher rent than average tenants. Celebrities not only rent their houses but also their names. Illegal activities can be carried on peacefully and the police do not dare touch them. Failure to inform the police about tenants within a reasonable time should be made a criminal offence. It will go a long way in controlling organised crime.

Kazi Quamruddin Ahmed,
 Collin Lane. No. It is not possible for house-owners to inform the police about their tenants unless tenants are compelled to inform the police about the details of their sub-tenants as well. We own a building on Collin Lane. Our two tenants have sublet four rooms. These sub-tenants change every three to six months. When we ask the sub-tenants for information, they refuse to comply. Our own tenant is not bothered. If we file an ejectment suit, it will take more than a decade to conclude. Now, if any of our tenants or sub-tenants is found to be involved in anti-social activities, should we be hauled up? 

Dilip k. Ganguly,
 Salt Lake. I am against forcing house-owners to supply information about tenants. It violates ones right to privacy. I do not see why the police should be involved in this.

Pooja Bajaj,
 Salt Lake. House-owners always warn their tenants if they create any problem. They seek help from the police when matters go out of hand. They should not be penalised.

Madhusree Gupta,
 Anil Roy Road. The rising crime graph makes this necessary. Fear of punishment will make house-owners take this seriously.  Copyright

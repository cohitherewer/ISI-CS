The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Designs on Paro amp; Binodini
 															- Ash adornments travel far and wide, set jewellery trends MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA				 	 Aishwarya in Chokher Bali																								Aishwarya Rai isnt one of the most sought after models for nothing. Everything she touches seems to turn to gold. First, Paros precious adornments ruled the most-wanted list. Now, the gold-plated copper ornaments Binodini borrows and bedecks herself in one memorable sequence, is set to stun and sell this Puja, from Shyambazar to San Francisco.																								Anjali Jewellers, which designed the jewellery worn by Binodini (Aishwarya) and Ashalata (Raima Sen) in Rituparno Ghoshs Chokher Bali, is taking the collection to the Bay Areas biggest puja, hosted by Prabasi, a Bengali association in the US.																								There is a lot of hype surrounding the film, and the association is also screening it on Dashami, explains Anannya Chowdhury, director, Anjali Jewellers. To cash in on the hype, the ornaments will all be on show. While Chowdhury hopes for orders, the exposure is enough to merit the brand-building exercise.																								The Devdas spotlight on traditional styles has significantly affected sales. We have a separate display of Devdas-inspired jewellery, says Chowdhury, who is also designing Raveena Tandons collection in Saharas Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam. But if last years ad campaigns had focussed on Devdas, this year, it will be Chokher Bali. Everyday, people take movie stars as their style icons. The investment is definitely worth it, insists Chowdhury.																								The B.C. Sen experience backs this up. Devdas may still be the fad of the moment, but the most memorable request was inspired by Hollywood. We had a lot of clients looking for a copy of the blue sapphire (Heart of the Ocean) Kate Winslet wore in Titanic, recounts a B.C. Sen spokesperson.																								The trend can be traced back to Madhuri Dixits jewels in Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, and to television as well, where the soaps make the loudest fashion statements. People take the style and improvise on them to match their wardrobe and their budget, the spokesperson adds. But the reactive craze only occurs when the public eye becomes fixated on a particular star.																								The maang-tika (tikli) and bangles, the opor haath and chokers from Devdas have been all the rage at A. Sirkar. We have had the most orders for the maang-tika, which a lot of girls are wearing, not only with saris, but also as the only accompanying jewellery with salwar-kameezes, explains designer Brinda Ganguly Sirkar. It was Kajol, feels Sirkar, who was a style symbol for many Bengali girls, starting from Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

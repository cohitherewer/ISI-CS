 Tuesday, July 22, 2003 				 DYFI forces family to ink blank sheet
 A STAFF REPORTER																								For the Mandals of Rabindranagar, near Metiabruz, the nightmare is not over yet. Members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) knocked on their door again on Monday morning and escorted mother Nirmala and daughter Mamata to the local police station, where they were forced to sign on a blank sheet of paper. 																								On Saturday night, activists of the CPMs youth wing had ousted the family from one and a half rooms of their three-room home of 24 years because they wanted to house the party office on the premises. Protests led to furniture being tossed out and manhandling of Mamata. Father Madhab has a heart condition.																								Both my mother and I were taken by force to the police station. There, in the presence of the police, we were forced to sign on a blank sheet of paper. When we resisted, they forced my mother to put her thumb impression on the sheet and then threatened me to sign or face the consequences, complained Mamata.																								As far as I know, both mother and daughter have given their consent for the party office. Some people are trying to politicise the incident, claimed local thana officer-in-charge Utpal Saha. 																								CPM partner RSP has stood by the family in distress. It has called for a local bandh on July 23 to protest the DYFI action.

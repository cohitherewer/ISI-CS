The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, July 24, 2003 				 Top cop rap for probe disclosure
 OUR BUREAU																								Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb on Wednesday pulled up North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Basudeb Bag for going public with vital information on the Gunjan Tanwani murder case and hampering the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) probe. Gunjan was murdered on July 8 in a Baguiati highrise.																								Though the CID took on the case two days after the murder, Bag took it upon himself to call the media to his Doltala office on Sunday to claim that the case had been all but solved with the arrest of alleged mastermind Bhagaban Das.																								Bag had also announced how the police had identified the village in Bihar to which another accused, Bhola Das, had fled.																								Bag should not have gone public, since the case is with the CID. The disclosure of the arrest of the accused does hamper investigation, Deb admitted late on Wednesday, adding that he had received a complaint on this score from CID additional director-general of police R.K. Mohanty. Such action is unbecoming of a senior district police officer, Deb observed.																								The Assembly earlier saw two Congress MLAs, Asit Mitra and Gopal Mahato, demanding Bags scalp. When contacted in his office, Bag refused comment, saying he did not want to be drawn into any controversy.

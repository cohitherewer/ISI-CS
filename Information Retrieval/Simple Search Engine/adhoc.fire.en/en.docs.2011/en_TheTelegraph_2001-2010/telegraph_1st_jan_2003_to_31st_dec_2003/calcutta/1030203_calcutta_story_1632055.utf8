The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, February 03, 2003 				 Consumer court shift finalised
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state consumer affairs department has finally issued the necessary circular to split Calcuttas consumer courts in two, by shifting one out of Bhabani Bhavan.																								According to the circular, the second unit of the Calcutta District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum will now be housed in a building on Lindsay Street. The first unit, however, will stay put at Bhabani Bhavan, as will the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.																								Consumer organisations, which had initially blocked the move, have once again voiced their protest. The move to split the courts is going to make consumers run from pillar to post, they have complained. Some have also voiced apprehension that the move to distance one court from another will prove counter-productive to consumers and help big traders and businessmen.																								A section of officials has labelled the shift, without consulting the State Consumer Protection Council, as illegal.																								Various consumers organisations are now mulling a legal move to stall the governments plans to shift a consumer court.

																																																		Around 12,000 residents of several areas of Rajarhat, marooned for the past three days of continuous rain, staged a protest on Thursday at Jatragachi over not receiving relief material from the government. Local MLA Tanmoy Mondal alleged that the district administration had been too slow in distributing food material among the rain-affected. The demonstration turned violent as residents complained that they had gone without food for two days. Police said the relief department had been alerted and the protest was called off after the victims received an assurance about getting food materials and tarpaulins.																																																		Banned firecrackers, worth Rs 6 lakh, were seized by police from various parts of the city. The crackers were on their way to different markets around the city. Police said about 340 kg of raw material to make the fireworks was also recovered. A senior police officer said the citys adjoining areas had been alerted about possible consignments of banned crackers from Nungi and Budge Budge, on the southern fringes of the city. 																																																		Train services in Eastern Railways Sealdah-Barasat and Sealdah-Hasnabad sections were hit on Thursday as trees fell on overhead wires. An ER spokesperson said the overhead wire was damaged between Birati and Madhyamgram stations and train services were suspended from 10.05 am to 11.25 am. Two Barasat locals were cancelled and one EMU was terminated at Birati, officials said. The overhead wire was also damaged between Haroa and Champapukur stations at 11 am. A local train, which had already entered Haroa station, was pulled away with the help of a diesel engine. The wire was repaired and services were resumed at 4.10 pm. One train was short terminated at Sandalia while two pairs were cancelled, officials said.																																																		Rainwater seeped from the roof of the international terminal building at the NSC Bose International Airport and flooded some portions. According to airport officials, rainwater also seeped in behind the escalator, the Calcutta Police passport office and conveyor belts. An Airport Authority of India official, however, denied that parts of the building were flooded by rainwater. But he admitted that water seeped in behind the escalator and added that special measures were being taken to tackle the problem.																																																		The body of a 30-year-old unidentified youth was recovered on Thursday afternoon from the railway tracks between Madhyamgram and Hridaypur stations. Police said they found the body with the head severed from the trunk, wrapped in a plastic bag, which was recovered from a cane basket. Police suspect that the youth was murdered elsewhere and the miscreants dumped the body later on the railway tracks.																																																		The civic conservancy department is planning to make it mandatory for garbage handlers to use gloves, gumboots and bright yellow helmets. According to member, mayor-in-council, conservancy, Rajib Deb, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will supply the gear to its own workers while private contractors will have to procure them for contract labourers. There are about 5,000 CMC labourers directly involved in handling garbage. 																																																		A fire broke out on Thursday morning in a multi-storeyed building on Mahatma Gandhi Road that houses several private offices. Police said the fire broke out from a short-circuit near the meter box and it took three fire tenders and nearly an hour to douse the flames. No one was injured.																																																		A three-year-old girl, Raheja Khatun, died after she fell down from a swing while playing at her residence in Canning on the northern fringes of the city. Police said the mishap occurred when the swing swayed violently in a gusty wind. Raheja, who was hurled off the swing, died in a local hospital.

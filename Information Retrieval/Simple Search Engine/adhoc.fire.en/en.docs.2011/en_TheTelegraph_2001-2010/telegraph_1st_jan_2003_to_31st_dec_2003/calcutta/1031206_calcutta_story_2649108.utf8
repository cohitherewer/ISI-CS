 Saturday, December 06, 2003 				 Staffer in admission fraud net
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The trail of fraud now leads to the classroom door. Three persons, including a receptionist of a college in the Park Street area, were arrested on Friday on charges of duping a candidate who had applied for admission to a first-year degree course. The trio has been remanded in police custody till December 18.																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said the arrests were carried out on the basis of a complaint lodged by the candidate from Kankurgachhi on December 1.																								The student (name withheld on request) had gone to the college for admission to a BA course last August. As his ISC marks fell short of the requisite figure, he was refused, said Mitra. On his way out of the campus, the candidate was approached by a man who identified himself as Raju Prasad and promised him admission.																								After a few hours, the candidate re-entered the college. Raju introduced him to receptionist Ignatius Das who also assured him a place in the BA course. The student was asked to hand over the originals of his marksheet and admit card, said Mitra.																								A few days later, the candidate received a regret letter from the college authorities. They had cross-checked the marks mentioned on his marksheet with that on the ISC website and realised that the figures had been fudged, said Mitra.																								For four months, the candidate tried in vain to retrieve his original marksheet and admit card, following which he lodged a complaint at Lalbazar.																								Sleuths first picked up Raju from Jagaddal, then arrested Ram Chandrika Rajbhor in Barrackpore, before rounding up receptionist Das from his Taltala Lane address.

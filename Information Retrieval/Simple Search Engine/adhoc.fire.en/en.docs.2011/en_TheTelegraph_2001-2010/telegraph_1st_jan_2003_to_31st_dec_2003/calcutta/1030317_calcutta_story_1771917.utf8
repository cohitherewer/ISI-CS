 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								The CMDA has undertaken a project to beautify a number of sewage treatment plants in the city and its adjoining areas and convert some of them into residential areas for slum-dwellers. After conversion, the flats will be handed over to slum-dwellers at subsidised rates. 																								The CMDA aims to construct 3,000 flats at its sewage treatment plant at Garden Reach and convert a small portion into an amusement park, which will later be used commercially to earn revenue. The plant is spread over 112 acres, of which only 40 acres are used for treating daily waste. The rest of the land can be converted into a housing project for slum-dwellers, pointed out Prov Das, CMDA chief executive officer (CEO). The CMDA has already cleaned up a major portion of the unused land at its Garden Reach plant for the purpose.																								About 47.5 million litres of waste are treated daily at the plant, before being discharged into the Hooghly. 																								The CMDA also plans to beautify and convert the unused land at several other treatment plants in the city into amusement centres and use them commercially to earn revenue. After Garden Reach, the CMDA will target its plants at Mathkal, in Baranagar, and Lake Town. 																								The agency has already converted part of its treatment plant at Chandernagore into an amusement park. Nearly a crore was spent for the park. The public response has been very good, said a CMDA official. He claimed that the success of the Chandernagore formula had spurred the CMDA into converting more plants into amusement parks.

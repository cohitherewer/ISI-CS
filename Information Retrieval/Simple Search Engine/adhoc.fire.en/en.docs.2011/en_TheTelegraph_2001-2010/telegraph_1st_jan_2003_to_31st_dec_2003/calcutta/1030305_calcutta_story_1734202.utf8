				 																																									Quite often one finds devotees from the suburbs visiting the city temples, piled into trucks with drums and conches. Many of them are perched precariously on the edges of the heavy vehicles running at great speed. A mishap can occur at any moment. The traffic police should check such reckless driving.

Private buses are reluctant to operate on all routes at such odd hours. But several people will benefit if the government brings back its morning fleet. 				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Nayapatty Road.				 																																									The drive against air pollution should be stepped up. Most vehicles emit black smoke, which causes irreparable damage if inhaled daily.

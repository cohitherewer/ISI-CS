 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Tale of a city
																								The pulse of a city is seldom felt by those who people it. But its brilliance is like that of a diamond, transmitting its inner radiance for all who would care to see it. It is the artist who, with his sensibilities, perceives this intricacy and recognises the life running through the fabric of the city. Sometimes he captures this brilliace on canvas, adding to it his own aesthetic touch, thereby creating an enduring image of that which goes largely unnoticed. Tale of a City is an exhibition with a range that covers abstract cityscapes to street level human drama  a plethora of subjects that brings into close proximity the city and its inhabitants; a palette that captures the mind, the heart and the soul of a city throbbing with life. When: Till January 22 (except Sundays) 12 noon - 7.30 pm																								Where: Gallery Caps, 16 Jatin Bagchi Road, Calcutta 700 029

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, February 22, 2003 				 Munni-O-Saat Chowkidaar
																								Dhritikanta Ghosal is an industrialist who owns a mosquito repellent factory. He was abducted twice before the elections and released only after paying a hefty ransom. The third election is just round the corner and Dhritikanta is apprehending another mishap. He is certain that his wife Sunanda is behind his abduction. Sunanda is a politician who files her nomination from several constituencies during every poll and ritualistically loses her security deposits. From where does Sunanda get all the money? Dhritikanta is certain she spends the ransom on her polls. Sourav is a senior executive in Dhritikantas company. He and his wife Munni have a perfect marital life. He has to go on an official tour for 20 days. Dhritikanta suddenly decides the safest place for him to take shelter before the elections would be Sourav-Munnis flat. He is confident that staying close to Munni would make him immune to any danger whatsoever. But Sourav is dumbfounded when Dhritikanta moots this proposal. He can neither say no as that would antagonise his boss, nor can he rest at peace to leave his wife with his boss during his absence. After much deliberation, he finally decides to recruit seven chowkidars (guards) for Munni who would ensure her safety during his absence. This is how the hilarious satire begins. This Sundaram production is written, directed and performed by Manoj Mitra.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Madhusudan Mancha

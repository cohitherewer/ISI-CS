The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, September 17, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	The road from Jinjria Bazaar to Budge Budge is unfit for  travel. Yet, residents of the area, office-goers and schoolchildren  have no option but to ride along this potholed stretch and  face the hardships. Vehicles breaking down while negotiating  the uneven surface is a common feature on this stretch.  This also decreases the longevity of our cars. With the  Pujas round the corner, shouldnt the public works department  pay some attention to this road? 
	 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.  
	The regional passport office has denied me a passport,  despite my being an Indian citizen and for no fault of mine.  I had applied for a passport to the Calcutta office in April  2001. In spite of sending several reminders and visiting  the officials a number of times, I have failed to get the  document. Neither have I been officially informed about  the reason behind such an abnormal delay. The way this department  functions is a blot on our public services. 
	 Maya Bose, Chandernagore.

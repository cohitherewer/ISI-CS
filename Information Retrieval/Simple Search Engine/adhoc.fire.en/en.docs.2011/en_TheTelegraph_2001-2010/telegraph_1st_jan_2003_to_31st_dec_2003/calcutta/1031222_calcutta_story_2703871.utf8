 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Remodel route for Howrah
 																											- Nod awaited for plans to receive more trains, ease platform pressure A STAFF REPORTER																								In the near future, reaching Howrah station by train may not be the harrowing experience it is today with the authorities drawing up a major remodelling plan.																								We have identified the problems and sent a remodelling proposal to solve them to the headquarters, Swapan Chowdhury, divisional railway manager (DRM), Howrah, said on Sunday. 																								The plans, some of which have been implemented, include extending a few platforms, improving crossover facilities and the engine shunting system. These would help us receive more trains, and passengers need not be stranded at signals for long, Chowdhury added.																								Officials said although the Eastern Railway (ER) section faces fewer problems, they continue to persist in the South Eastern Railway (SER) section. With Platform 11 closed down after yard remodelling, the major problem of accommodating rakes has cropped up, officials said. To overcome this, Platform 15 has been extended. Now, 10-coach rakes can be received at the platform. Earlier 15 trains could be received every day but now, we can accommodate 23. Our target is to receive at least 25 trains at the platform, Chowdhury said. 																								Thus, he says, the problem is solved to some extent. All the 10-coach rakes of SER earlier used to block other platforms. Now there will be less pressure on Platforms 11 to 13, where long-distance trains can be accommodated, the DRM said. Work on extending platforms 1 and 3 will start soon, he said, adding that these would be able to receive 12-coach rakes. 																								Remodelling proposals, including increasing crossover facilities, which would allow trains to depart and arrive at the station simultaneously, have been sent to the headquarters. Another important technical improvement proposed is the engine shunting facility. Now, mail and express trains have to wait for more than an hour at the platform for the engine to be detached at one end and another attached at the other end to drag it to the yard. There is a track where shunting is not allowed now. If a safety device is provided, it can be used for shunting, DRM Chowdhury said. 																								The proposals are awaiting the approval of the commissioner of railway safety. Once the nod comes, work will start immediately, he added. Three hundred forty-three local trains and 85 mails and express trains of ER arrive at the station daily.

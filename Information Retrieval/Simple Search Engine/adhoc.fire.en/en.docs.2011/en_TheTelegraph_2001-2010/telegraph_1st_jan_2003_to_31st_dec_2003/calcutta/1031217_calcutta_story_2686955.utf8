 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Funds pose no hurdle to riverfront revamp
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Funds for revamping the four warehouses along the Hooghly on Strand Road into multipurpose commercial hubs will not be a problem, feel officials of the London Rivers Association (LRA). The officials met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings on Tuesday to discuss a plan of action for the implementation of the Calcutta Waterfront Regeneration Project. 																								We will be in a position to elaborate on the viability of the project after getting a nod from the Union shipping ministry, Bhattacharjee said later.																								George Nicholson, LRA chairman, said about 12 million will be required for turning the warehouses into business hubs. Preliminary discussions have been held with city-based industrialists and private developers, who have shown keen interest in providing financial assistance. 																								We can start work only after the land on which the four warehouses stand is released for the project, said Eric Reynolds, managing director, Urban Space Management, one of the representatives of the team. We will share our experiences with the state government in developing the riverfront areas and providing the technology and expertise for the purpose, Reynolds added. 																								The Calcutta waterfront project includes development of the stretch between Fairlie Place and the first Howrah Bridge approach, preservation of the warehouses and declaration of the area off BBD Bag a heritage zone.																								Nirupam Sen, industries minister, who attended Tuesdays meeting, said the LRA team will submit a detailed project report next month. Shatrughan Sinha, Union shipping minister, will visit the city on December 30 and inspect the warehouses the next day. He has promised to take steps to ensure the handover of the warehouse land by the Calcutta Port Trust.

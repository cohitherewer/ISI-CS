  Twin arms of the law: Men in uniform  can either lend a helping hand (above) or extend a greasy  palm (below). It is really painful to note that while organising a rally protesting the judgement of Justice Lala, the participants of the youth wing of the ruling Reds can stoop to such a level as to describe the judge as a poisonous element and ask him to leave the state at the earliest (Poison protest stifles city, Metro, Oct 14). It is quite unprecedented in the history of the country. It is well-known that most political parties have dubious characters. Their attitudes, habits and philosophies vary according to the needs of the situation. The judiciary commands sufficient respect among the people and if any adverse comments are made against the judiciary, the basic objective of our democratic norms will be frustrated. It is all the more unexpected from the students wing of the party at the helm of affairs. If a personal attack is made against a sitting high court judge with the tacit support of the ruling party, it may spell doom for our democracy.  Rabindra Nath Kar,
 Sankar Ghosh Lane.  Our honourable chief minister has appealed to his police department to cooperate with common people (Seek cop help, end in lock-up, Metro, October 13). But his men are friendly only with criminals. I must condemn Sanjay Bhattacharya for seeking help from a cop since he does not fall into that category. He has no right to get back his wristwatch and Rs 1,300. I hope the policemen use the money to buy liquor and have a good time.  Debyani Basu,
 Birati.  It is really shocking how seeking  help from the police may drag a person to the lock-up. Men  in uniform have undergone a marked change in recent times.  The police are supposed to be the last resort of those in  distress. Where will we go for redressal of grievances? Piyal Mukherjee,
 Lake Town.  Bhattacharyas ordeal with the  police at Behala was painful reading. Such incidents discourage  people from approaching the police and force them to take  the law into their own hands. T.R. Anand,
 Budge Budge.  Many students with great expectations from different states go to Bangalore for higher education and fall prey to ragging (Hostel hafta kills youth, Metro, Oct 16, and Hafta victim was target of seniors, local toughs, Oct 17). My heartfelt tribute to Arijit Banerjee, who died protesting the tax imposed by seniors on outstation students. With more private higher education institutions coming up in West Bengal, hopefully students will have the choice to stay home.  Diptimoy Ghosh,
 Salt Lake.  The report filled my eyes with  tears. The death of Arijit Banerjee should not only be an  eye-opener for college authorities, but also the respective  governments. Kunal Ray,
 Howrah.  This is the black face of our  society.  Sachindra Nath Mitra,
 Beleghata. This is with reference to the Metro report Back home to builder horror (Sept 6). The report is one-sided and misleading. There are 150-plus flats in the Oxford View complex, out of which more than 100 are occupied. The complex was completed in 1993 but, as all the flats have not been registered, the flat-owners association  which was to take over management of the complex from the promoter, Nilanchal Estates,  could not be formed. So, an ad-hoc committee was formed in August 1997 to look after the management of the complex on behalf of Nilanchal Estates.  Santipada Banerjee has not been paying maintenance charges for the last six-seven years. He and other defaulters are, therefore, being deprived from services like generator-connection, garbage-collection, etc.  S.R. Ghosh and others.  Metro replies: Our entire report revolves  around promoter Arvind Meharias alleged attempts to get  Santipada Banerjee out of the two flats in Oxford View housing  complex. Nowhere in the story are residents either mentioned  or implicated. Neither have they been blamed for any of  his woes. Meharias views on the matter were sought before  the publication of the report and his comments published.  We are, therefore, unable to understand the undue interest  some residents is taking in setting the record straight.

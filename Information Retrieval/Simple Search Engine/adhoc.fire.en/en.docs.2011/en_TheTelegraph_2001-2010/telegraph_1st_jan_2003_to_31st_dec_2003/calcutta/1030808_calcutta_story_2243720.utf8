 Friday, August 08, 2003 				 Guardians join fee-hike protest
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Guardians, hitherto silent on the tuition fee hike for medical students, joined the fracas at Medical College and Hospital on Thursday, when forms were being sold to successful Joint Entrance Examination candidates.																								The action began with some medical students, spearheading the agitation, shouting slogans in front of the principals room. As they began to collect signatures  more than 300 guardians lodged their protest by lending their names to the agitation  some of the guardians expressed their willingness to do something more active.																								Principal Jayashree Mitra, assured them that she would take up the matter with the director of medical education. I listened to what they had to say but did not call in the police as things did not get out of hand, she said.

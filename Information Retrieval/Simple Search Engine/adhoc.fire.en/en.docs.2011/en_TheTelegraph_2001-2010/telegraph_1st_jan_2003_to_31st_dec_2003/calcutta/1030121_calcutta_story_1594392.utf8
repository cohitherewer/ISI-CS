But men and women are waking up to the fact that something must be done about the eve-teasing menace. With a few exceptions, who still feel women are to blame, Time to Talk readers were united in their protest, with many an idea to put an end to the menace:				 				 																															lWe can put an end to eve-teasing by steering clear of harassers. A girls behaviour should not encourage such people. Police should also be more active in catching the guilty. And as eve-teasers come from all walks of life, schools should take a vital role to stop this menace.				 				 																															Pallabi Majumdar,				 				 																															Baghbazar Multipurpose Girls School				 				 																															lEve-teasing is rising at an alarming rate in all public places. Parents should inculcate respect for the opposite sex in their boys. Ignorance will only aggravate the crime. NGOs working with women should take a lead as many women are not aware of their rights. The state should take measures to discourage such acts, but lawmakers and keepers themselves need to stop such acts first. Women and men should work in harmony to end this crime.				 				 																															Anna Rozario,				 				 																															J.D. Birla				 				 																															lSergeant Bapi Sen was a true son of the soil. How many people would have done what he did? The five men should be given exemplary punishment to discourage potential teasers. The police should keep tight vigil in places where such cases seem to crop up. Punishment should be swift.				 				 																															Adnan Hamid,				 				 																															IIIrd year, St Xaviers College				 				 																															lGirls must protest such harassment. The fear of embarrassment gives teasers an opportunity. The police force, particularly female officers, should be posted in plain clothes to trap culprits. In girls schools and colleges, the local thana should open a complaint cell, and the complainants identity should be kept confidential.				 				 																															Sayan Ghosh,				 				 																															Hindu School				 				 																															lStrengthening existing laws and punishing the guilty can help deal with this crime.				 				 																															Abhishek Arya,				 				 																															Class X, St Xaviers School				 				 																															lWe can put an end to eve-teasing by standing up and voicing our complaints. It is the inaction on the part of the victim that encourages eve-teasers to carry on.				 				 																															Aparajita Dasgupta,				 				 																															IIIrd year, Asutosh College				 				 																															lPlaces where teasing is on the rise should set up cells to keep a watch on culprits. Unless a few eve-teasers are punished, the rest will never learn a lesson.				 				 																															Suchi Arya,				 				 																															Class XII, Modern High School				 				 																															lWe cannot stop eve-teasing unless laws to prosecute perpetrators are enforced. The offenders must be taught a lesson so that no one dares harass women. But this can only be achieved if the law helps us out.				 				 																															Sananda Sen				 				 																															lIf one eve-teaser is fined and jailed for a month, it may stop would-be teasers. The punishment for offenders should just not leave them poorer but also expose them in society. Policewomen in plainclothes should patrol sensitive areas to catch the miscreants red-handed. Police cells should be set up everywhere so victims can easily lodge complaints. But unless the police are cooperative and quick to react, there would be no way to flush out this evil. College students, too, should take up cudgels against such social problems.				 				 																															Enakshi Biswas,				 				 																															IInd yr, Presidency College				 				 																															lAt times eves dress up provocatively, tempting adams to tease. But they should never go so far as to harm a girl in any way.

	 Festive affair				 				 																															Aamar kono dharma nai, shudhu shikor diye aakrey dhora chhara.				 				 																															Last week, the Jadavpur University campus was filled with colourful posters and dimly lit lanterns carrying these lines. This is the time of the year when college students all around the country get into the festive mood. At JU, too, it was time for Sanskriti 2003, the annual festival of the Arts faculty. Sanskriti was staged from January 13 to 16, with more than 35 colleges in the line-up.				 				 																															For four nights, music made all ready to rock. There was a Ronpaa Nritya, followed by a performance by V. Balsara. The following night featured elocution by Bratati Bandyopadhyay and songs by Raghav Chattopadhyay. On the third evening, a seminar was held on whether Bangla bands will be able to keep Bengali songs alive. The music stopped for Macbeth, presented by Theatre Workshop. The evening of January 16 was electrifying, with JUST, a band formed by JU students, belting out popular numbers. But it was Krosswindz, playing to the galleries of over 4,000, that was a smash hit with a two-and-a-half-hour gig.				 				 																															There was the regular spread of thinking events, too. The curtain went up with a Rabindrasangeet competition, where Ritajyoti Banerjee stood first. Pooja Das Sarkar snatched the first prize for western solo. Lokgeeti competition at the makeshift stage saw Sohini Sengupta clinching first prize. The hosts led the race from the start in the quiz and emerged the winners. Day II started with extempore and Hindi solo followed by group song where Gourav and gang from South City College shined through. Dhop nonstop (Arnab Bagchi, winner) and dumb charades were major hits, with students enacting some hilarious sequences. JU aced the antakshari.				 				 																															Day III started with a debate over whether Bengalis have their own culture in the 21st Century, where the hosts came first. This was followed by the eastern solo dance, where Trina N. Banerjee stood first and Debosmita Roy second. The recitation on the last day boasted names like Manabendra Banerjee, Subodh Sarkar, Jaidev Bose, Ballari Roy Chowdhury and many more, drawing quite a crowd.				 				 																															Folk fare was once again the focus of the fest. Stalls exhibiting the traditional crafts of the state, like dokra, were a major attraction. This is a message for communal harmony, against fundamentalism, said Poulomi Ghosal, a student.

	 Braille show				 				 																															The Blind Boys Academy held its annual exhibition at the Narendrapur centre on January 18 and 19. There were the usual projects by students on history, geography and science, but what was of special interest were sections that dealt with Braille.				 				 																															Rahuldev Roy enthusiastically demonstrated how, beginning with the six marble system, the students moved on to the peg board and finally to books written in Braille in Bengali. He read out portions from such texts, adding that once the students master Bengali Braille, they move on to English.				 				 																															There was an exhibit on how Braille can be written on the computer, with the aid of a special printer. Alternative ways of learning maths were also showcased. Pradip Mondal, a student of the school, regaled visitors with mathematical magic tricks.				 				 																															The exhibition was divided into two sections highlighting the activities of students in the general and vocational streams. We look forward to this event every year, as it gives us an opportunity to showcase whatever we have learnt, said Dipankar Sarkar, one of the participants.				 				 																															A prize distribution ceremony, recognising the students achievements in academic as well as extra-curricular fields, was also held. The two-day programme ended with the staging of a play, Padmar Jallad, by the students.				 				 																															 Sreejita Deb

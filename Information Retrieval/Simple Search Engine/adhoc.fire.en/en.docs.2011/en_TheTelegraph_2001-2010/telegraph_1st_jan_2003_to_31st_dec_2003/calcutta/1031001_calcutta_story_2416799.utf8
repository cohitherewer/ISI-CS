The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, October 01, 2003 				 Puja Parikrama
																								As the beat of drums ushers in the festive spirit, Calcuttans gear up to celebrate one of Bengals most cherished festivals  Durga Puja. But few of us feel for those who are not so lucky and do not get a chance to be a part of the occasion. However, Prayasam, an NGO working with the less fortunate children, along with Khadims unique Pujo Celebration, has come forward to bring a smile on the faces that otherwise remain subdued under the pangs of poverty, hunger and deprivation. The project also aims at inculcating a sense of togetherness by bringing in children from different social and economic backgrounds on the same platform. Two hundred children, mainly from Prayasams pilot project area Rishi Aurobindo Colony in Ultadanga, and children of rickshawpullers plying in the Salt Lake area along with students of some elite city schools will be taken round the city enjoying, celebrating and deciding the best Child-friendly Pujo according to parameters set by the children themselves.																								When: Today and Tomorrow; 8 am																								Where: AB / AC Park, Salt Lake City

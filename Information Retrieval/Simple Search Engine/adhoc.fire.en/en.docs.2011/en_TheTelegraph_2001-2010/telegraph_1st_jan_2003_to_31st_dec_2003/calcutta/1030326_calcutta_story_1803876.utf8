 Wednesday, March 26, 2003 				 Winter delight for all seasons
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Why wait till winter for nolen gurer sandesh? 																								The state government has asked the Central Food Technology Research Institute, Mysore, to develop a device for preserving dates, which is used for making jaggery, one of the main ingredients of the all-time favourite variety of sandesh. The device will enable mishti-makers to use the extract for making nolen gurer sandesh round the year.																								Once the extract is available in the market, a small quantity of it may be mixed with a portion of chhana (cottage cheese), which will impart flavour to the sandesh, Anisur Rahman, state animal husbandry and animal resources development minister, told the Assembly on Tuesday. He was replying to Tapan Hore of the RSP during Question Hour. 																								The nolen gurer sandesh will no longer be a seasonal delicacy. The Mysore institute has completed the preliminary research and handed over a sample of the concentrated form of the gur. It is now working on a method for large-scale production of the extract, explained Rahman.																								This apart, his ministry has taken up a string of measures to market Bengals rosogollas in other states, Rahman added.																								We are trying to develop a technology for producing high-quality chhana for the purpose. A new machine is being developed to produce chhana in large quantities in a short time, under hygienic conditions, he said. A Rs 10-crore project has been sponsored by the Centre for the purpose, the minister said. 																								Rahman, however, regretted that though his ministry had undertaken several dairy development schemes, a deficit of nearly 2.5 million metric tonnes of milk per day existed in West Bengal, against a daily requirement of six million metric tonnes.																								Asked if any multinational firm had sought to invest in Bengals dairy development, Rahman said only a single group had approached him so far.

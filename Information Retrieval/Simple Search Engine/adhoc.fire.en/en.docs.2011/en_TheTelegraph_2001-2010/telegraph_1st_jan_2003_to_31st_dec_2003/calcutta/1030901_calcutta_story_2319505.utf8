The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, September 01, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Gloria Estefan, singer  You put in a lot of thought in whatever you do. Friends  are inspired by your energy and vitality. The determination  and confidence to steer clear of all obstacles make you  unique. You do not take up projects unless you are mentally  prepared for them. People are drawn to your bold and wild  style.  Kusum Bhandari

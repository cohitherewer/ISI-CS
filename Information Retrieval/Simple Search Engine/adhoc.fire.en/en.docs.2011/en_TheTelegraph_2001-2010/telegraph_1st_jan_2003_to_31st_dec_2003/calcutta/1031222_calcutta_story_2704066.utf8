The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, December 22, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	Dum Dum is an important junction for Eastern Railway, but  the station has scanty civic amenities. The number of seats  on the platform is inadequate, as are the fans and lights.  The subways are dirty and stinky, and occupied by vagabonds  most of the time.  
	Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia.  
	Several motorcycle repair shops have sprung up around the  Vivekananda Road-Amherst Street crossing, creating problems  for pedestrians. Though the Vivekananda Road footpath is  quite wide, defective two-wheelers parked on it eat up most  of the space.  
	Rabindranath Kar, Nayapatty Road.

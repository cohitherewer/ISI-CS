				 																																									Vendors are often seen selling fresh flowers when cars are held up by the traffic signal at the Park Street crossing. It is said that hawkers pick up the flowers from the Park Circus burial ground soon after people leave the cemetery, having placed the bouquets on the graves. The cemetery guards, too, are hand in glove with the vendors. Such malpractice is unpardonable and should be checked without further delay.				 																																									T.R. Anand,				 																																									Budge Budge.				 																																									The massive traffic jam caused on Chitpore Yard, just below the Patipukur rail bridge, is a cause for concern as it may trigger an accident any moment. The Patipukur bridge is extremely low. Hence, trucks carrying goods often get stuck to the outer surface of the bridge and, as a result, the stretch gets clogged for a long time. This pushes the jam over to Belgachhia and Lake Town. These trucks should be barred from taking this route.				 																																									Biman Saha,				 																																									Lake Town.

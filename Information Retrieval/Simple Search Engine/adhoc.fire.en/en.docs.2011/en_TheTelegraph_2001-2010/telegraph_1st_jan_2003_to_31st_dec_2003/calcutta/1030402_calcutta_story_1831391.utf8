The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 02, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Shift cry for terminal cure
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should some existing trains starting from Howrah and Sealdah be shifted to the new rail terminals? Journey's end: a crowded Howrah station platform S.M. Nooman Alam,
																		Tiljala Road.																																																														Shifting existing trains to new terminals will create a problem for people living near Howrah and Sealdah. 									

Barsha Chabria,
																		Rabindranagar.																																																														The twin stations are too congested. It hampers the functioning and as well as the administration of the whole set-up. If some trains are shifted to a new terminal, such as Chitpore, or any other remote area, then it will breed hopes of better services and prevention of frequent snarls and snags. But the whole exercise should be done with proper advertisement so that commuters become aware of the changes in the existing schedules.									

Joydeep Chatterjee,
																		Shyambazar.																																																														I think this shift should work. It will reduce the crowd at the two stations, and hence keep the chaos in check. 									

Ashutosh Bhattacharjee,
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														No doubt. This will reduce the increasing pressure on the two terminals. But its very important to prepare the infrastructure at the new terminals so that communication with other parts of the city does not become a problem. There is no point in shifting both long distance and suburban trains to the new terminals as it will cause the same chaos there as well.									

T.R. Anand,
																		Address not given.																																																														Yes, some of the less important long distance trains, like Danapur Express and East Coast Express, need to be shifted to the new terminals to make Howrah and Sealdah clean and passenger-friendly. Howrah and Sealdah have become congested with too many trains departing and entering. Railway stations in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai and New Delhi should be emulated for betterment.									

Dhrubarup Chattopadhyay,
																		Teghoria.																																																														Yes, this will be a good move. With such a huge load of railway traffic at Howrah and Sealdah, trains always stand the chance of being delayed. With diversion of some existing trains to the new terminals, commuters will certainly benefit. The new rail terminals should have the proper infrastructure to handle the pressure.									

Anindita Choudhury,
																		Teghoria.																																																														It would be a welcome move because shifting some trains to the new terminals would decrease pressure from the already overcrowded Howrah and Sealdah terminals. Above all, the travellers, too, can expect better services from the railways. But again, another question arises, i.e. would the new rail terminals be as accessible to the normal public as Howrah or Sealdah?									

Jayanta Datta,
																		Chinsurah.																																																														Yes. Sealdah and Howrah had started operation in the mid-19th century. Despite the increase in population and traffic, we have totally ignored setting up new rail terminals. But before shifting the trains, the infrastructure must be improved. Otherwise, the total network will collapse.									

Bijoy Kumar Singh,
																		Howrah.																																																														The decision to select Chitpore as the third terminal is praiseworthy. There is a great need to ease the congestion at Howrah and Sealdah. This will be better for passengers. If there is a plan to set up a fourth terminal, then Majerhat will be more convenient for the people of south Calcutta and South 24-Parganas, especially since the railway owns a vacant plot in Majerhat. Shalimar will not be viable. It is already a busy goods yard.									

Sananda Sen,
																		New Alipore.																																																														There is no need to shift the existing trains starting from Howrah and Sealdah to the new rail terminals as this will lead to shortage of trains. So, the passengers will have to face a lot of problems. Instead of shifting a few trains to the new terminals, they should introduce new trains there. This will be a real help for passengers as they will not have to stand for long hours in line for tickets or remain on the waiting list. Hence, it will help the rail authorities tackle the heavy rush during the vacations.									

Pritam Chakrabarty,
																		Serampore.																																																														The trains must be shifted to other terminals from Howrah and Sealdah to avoid overcrowdedness. Nitish Kumar, our railway minister, has announced 50 more trains. These trains must start from other terminals.									

Atri Bose,
																		Address not given.																																																														Shifting of some existing trains from Sealdah and Howrah to the new rail terminals is welcome as it will help promote the new terminals and also ease the growing pressure on Howrah and Sealdah.									

Bhupen Bose,
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														Certainly. If the new rail terminal at Chitpore starts functioning quickly, it will be a great boon for people living in North 24-Parganas, Shyambazar, Belgachhia, Paikpara, Patipukur, Lake Town and Dum Dum. With constant traffic jams, it will be easier for passengers living in north Calcutta to avail of trains from Chitpore . 									

Govinda Bakshi,
																		Budge Budge.																																																														The new rail terminals will ease the pressure on Sealdah and Howrah. Passengers will easily reach the city availing of Circular Railways passing by the terminals. Moreover, the terminals should have facilities for reaching the bus and the taxi stands to be constructed on VIP road. This new project will not invite any major roadblock or eviction, as it will only utilise the Chitpore yard. A pragmatic gift to Calcuttans by the railway ministry.									

Mohan Lal Sarkar,
																		Budge Budge.																																																														The Chitpore railway yard is well-known as a haven for criminals. Railway commuters will feel insecure unless the state government takes some drastic measures to control the law and order situation in the area. As RG Kar Medical College and Hospital is situated a stones throw away from the yard, the new terminal will increase noise pollution for the ailing patients. It will be wise to improve facilities at Howrah and Sealdah instead.									

Angsuman Ghosh,
																		Dum Dum.																																																														Keeping in mind the chaos at Howrah and Sealdah, I think it would be a good idea to shift some local trains as well as some less important express trains to the proposed new terminal at Chitpore. A new terminal may also start at Shalimar.

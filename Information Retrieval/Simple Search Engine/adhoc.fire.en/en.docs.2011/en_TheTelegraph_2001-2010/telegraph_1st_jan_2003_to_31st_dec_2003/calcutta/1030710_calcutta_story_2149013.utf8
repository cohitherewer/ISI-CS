 SUDESHNA BANERJEE																								Bharat Stage-II (BS-II) may be driving the transport department up the grimy wall today, but a smoother ride may lie ahead, with the states first automobile degree course being launched this summer.																								The course, being offered by MCKV Institute of Engineering, in Howrah, is billed to produce experts capable of equipping vehicles with modern technology, help reduce fuel consumption and, perhaps most importantly in the context of the day, fight auto emission.																								The automobile industry is passing through a boom-time, but we do not have the trained manpower to support the demand. Once the technical expertise is available, related problems, like auto emission, will be easier to tackle, asserts S.S. Kejriwal, chairman of the institute and Heritage School trustee.																								And the government seems to spy a green light at the end of this tech tunnel. It will be useful (to tackle various automobile-related problems, including pollution) if experts are available at hand, environment minister Manab Mukherjee said on Wednesday. Specialisation will definitely be welcome.																								The four-year course will focus on areas like automobile systems and design, internal combustion engine, transport management, vehicle maintenance and garage practice. And students could have quite a role to play on the ground. Devices like catalytic converters, which added to the fuel line of an old vehicle absorb harmful gases, require improvement. Students can contribute in such areas, said Swarup Ghosh, part of the team drawing up the car course.																								Research should be the other big driver. Automobile engineering enables students to look out for wider areas that will help implementation of non-conventional fuel. While Delhi has started running on CNG, the last car show in the Capital showcased the electric battery-run Reva. Such eco-friendly energy options will come up once students start pursuing higher studies, feels Ghosh.

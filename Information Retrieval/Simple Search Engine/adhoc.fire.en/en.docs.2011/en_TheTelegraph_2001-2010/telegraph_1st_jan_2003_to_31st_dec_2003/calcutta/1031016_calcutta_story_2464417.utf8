The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, October 16, 2003 				 Small mishap for greater cause
 															- March-cum-meet of Left ladies sorry, but shrugs off responsibility  A STAFF REPORTER																								It was a show of strength in a citys collective hour of shame. The death of baby Shabana notwithstanding, it was business as usual for the Left Front womens wings on Wednesday. The woman brigade of the ruling force hit the streets in large numbers with a march-cum-meeting that disrupted traffic in the city centre and denied any moral responsibility of rallyists in the Monday tragedy.																								The death of six-month-old Shabana  due to the combination of a traffic standstill caused by a rally and a medical mess  was put down as a mishap on the path of protest to achieve larger socio-political goals by some leaders at Wednesdays convention at Rani Rashmoni Avenue.																								We feel sorry for the little one who died under such unfortunate circumstances. It was an unfortunate incident, but we are not to be blamed for that at all, claimed Rekha Goswami, secretary of the Paschimbanga Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti, womens wing of the CPM. 																								The rally, that forced police to impose several traffic restrictions at the city centre, was organised by four womens groups of the Left Front to protest the recent court directive restricting rallies and also the attacks on Palestine.																								Asked why they had organised the rally two days after the tragic death of little Shabana, Goswami didnt miss a beat: Rallies are being held since Independence Wednesdays meeting was pre-planned and there was nothing we could do to defer it... Also, our rallies are disciplined and our plans are conveyed to the people concerned in advance.																								There were some speakers who spared a few thoughts for Shabana, before focusing on the greater cause of criticising Justice Amitava Lalas landmark judgment restricting weekday rallies. We feel sorry for Shabanas parents. But for the larger cause of the people, we will have to hit the roads, said Shyamashree Das of Paschimbanga Mahila Samiti.																								Accusing newspapers of making a mountain out of a molehill, Das said during every rally, emergency services are hit, but those were small inconveniences for the greater causes being pursued. Other speakers conceded a citizens right to reach his destination on time but added, peoples movements are equally important.

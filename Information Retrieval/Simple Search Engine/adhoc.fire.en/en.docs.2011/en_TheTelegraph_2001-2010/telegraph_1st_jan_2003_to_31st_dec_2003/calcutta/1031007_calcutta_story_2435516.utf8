According to police, Ratan asked his wife to accompany him to some puja pandals, took her to a secluded spot and slit her throat with a sharp weapon. Ratans brother then informed Shilas parents that she had committed suicide. Preliminary investigation revealed that Ratan would torture Shila for dowry. On Sunday, Ratan had visited his in-laws and demanded money which he was refused. He had reportedly planned the murder after returning home. Ratan is absconding, said superintendent of police, Howrah, Zulfiquar Hasan.

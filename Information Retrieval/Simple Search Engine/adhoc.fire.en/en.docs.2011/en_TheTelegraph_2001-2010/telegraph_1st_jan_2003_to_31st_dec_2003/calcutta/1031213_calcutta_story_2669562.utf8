 Recently a gentleman got into trouble for writing a book based on facts! The book discusses the food habits of saints and hermits of ancient India and states their fondness for beef. In fact, the author goes to the extent of stating that beef was the staple food of most Indians. History is truth that refuses to bury itself amid ruins, and for many it is like a sore thumb that hurts constantly. There are people who want to sever all association with their past and forget their roots, but history is a tough task master. Time and again, power-brokers have tried to manipulate history and project it as something dead and gone. But history is a living entity that moves with time. It is a constant process of evolution and religion is only a facet of the socio-political evolution and has often been misused and misinterpreted as an impediment to development. That is precisely why we, in modern India, still think of propagating witch-craft as a scientific method and claim that scientist Meghnad Saha had immense faith in astrology  all these are efforts to garb class struggle under a new mask. Based on Utpal Dutts play, this Nattyaanan production is directed by Chandan Sen, who also appears in an important role.

 Saturday, August 02, 2003 				 Murder takes Assam trail
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Northeast link has become the focal point for investigators probing the murder of a housewife on Thursday afternoon at a highrise in Thakurpukur. Officers of the local police station have already left for Assam, from where the victims husband shifted here three days ago.																								Jayanta Banerjee, the victims husband, had worked in Dhubri as a branch manager of Canara Bank for the past three years. We thought of the Northeast link, as the murder took place only three days after Banerjee was transferred back to his hometown from a trouble-torn area like Assam, said an officer working on this case.																								Around 3.30 pm on Thursday, an unidentified man in his early 20s rang the calling bell of Jayantas third-floor flat and stabbed his wife Sarbari when she opened the door. As the woman collapsed, the assailant entered the flat and pounced on Jayanta, who had followed his wife to the door, and slashed him across the stomach. When Sarbari, in spite of her injury, picked up a shoe-rack and hit the youth, she was stabbed a second time. That later proved fatal. The couples only daughter Sohini, 17, was sleeping in her bedroom when the attack took place. The injured couple chased the killer but soon gave up and collapsed on the landing of the second floor.																								It is not unlikely that Banerjee had faced problems during his service tenure in Assam, said one of the officers investigating the case. We are trying to find out any details on this front to help us track down the killer.																								During the course of the investigation throughout Friday, police interrogated Sohini and her relatives. Sohini, a meritorious student who had scored more than 90 per cent in the CBSE examinations, for which she had recently appeared, could not provide the investigators with any leads.																								Jayanta was questioned at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) but he could not provide much information to the clueless investigators. Though, he is not in a position to answer all our queries, we shall question him again on Saturday, said Rajesh Kumar Singh, additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas. Jayanta told police that the assailant certainly did not have Mongoloid features. He was fair and tall, anywhere between five-and-a-half to six feet.

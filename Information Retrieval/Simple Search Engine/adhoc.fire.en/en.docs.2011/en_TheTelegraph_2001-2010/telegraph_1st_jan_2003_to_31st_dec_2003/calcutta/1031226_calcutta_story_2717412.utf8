 Friday, December 26, 2003  A mixed bag of melodrama
 Call it loud, call it crude, but you  cant turn a deaf ear to the enduring clamour for jatra  jamborees, says Reshmi Sengupta Indrani Halder as Bangladesher Baghini  at Mahajati Sadan on Day One of the jatra festival.  Picture by Amit Datta indrani halder will take a few  more minutes to come on stage. She is almost through with  her make-up, a voice booms over the microphone. So, we  request our respected guests on the dais to say a few words.  Lets welcome minister A deafening hoot from the packed  Mahajati Sadan auditorium drowns the ministers name. Shuru  korun, shuru korun, the audience screams. After two  truncated speeches amid more boos, the unwanted guests clear  out of the stage, the concert chimes and the curtains rise  on Trinayani Operas Bangladesher Baghini. The roar  can be heard from Central Avenue to the Sunderbans. The flavour of real jatra might  have been a trifle amiss on the proscenium, but audiences  at the inaugural show of Paschimbanga Jatra Utsav certainly  didnt seem to mind. Not as long as the pala had  a larger-than-life feel  with generous doses of melodrama,  high-pitched histrionics, tear-jerker dialogues, in-your-face  comic relief, some glitz and some glitter. One-hundred-and-twenty-years after  jatra in the form we know it today  well, maybe  not quite  took formal shape, this form of entertainment  is still making its presence felt  and most definitely  heard. So much has changed, and yet so much has remained  the same. The where The comfort of the closed Mahajati  Sadan in December 2003 is a far cry from the courtyard of  Madhusudan Sanyals Jorasanko address in a December night  of 1882. Having sold tickets for a pala for the first  time, Bagbazars National Theatre had staged Dinabandhu  Mitras Nildarpan, also paving the way for the establishment  of jatra troupes in Chitpur. Yet, suburbs have remained its  real bastion. The windy open fields are where viewers pour  in, even now, from far-flung areas and squat on the far-from  cushioned ground for hours. Standing on a bare wooden stage  open on all sides, the artistes would transport the audience  to a make-belief world  a palace, a hut or a battlefield   with sheer acting prowess and vocal power. No props, no  lights, no acoustics, recounts Surojit Banerjee, a scriptwriter.  Now, most troupes enlist some  technical support (hanging and lapel mikes, and a proper  backdrop at the least), and eye-popping stunts. Bottomline:  a bit of Bollywood and a lot of commercial theatre in the  garb of jatra. The what The standard of palas has  dropped drastically. A lot of vulgarity has crept into the  stories, costumes, dialogues and gestures. A gentleman recently  told me that he has stopped coming to jatras with  his family as some of the palas were very embarrassing  to watch together... One has to keep in mind that rural  Bengal is still very orthodox in such matters, laments  film actor-turned-jatra star Santu Mukherjee. The form may have undergone mere  cosmetic changes, but the content has invariably caught  the drift of the contemporary and held its audiences despite  the draw of the big and the small screens.  If mythologicals were the staple  fare in the early 19th Century (when it all began with Chaitanya  Mahaprabhus abhinay leela), the early 20th Century  saw it veering towards historical plays. Biographical palas  became the rage in the 1960s  with veteran Shantigopal  setting the trend  and continuing well into the 1980s.  With Utpal Dutt, the raw art form saw a definitive refinement  in treatment. A parallel wave of reformist palas  with a dominant Leftist ideology swept through the same  period. The 1970s heralded a never-seen-before  era of glamour and stardom unleashed by Swapan Kumar, with  whom stage adaptations of feature films entered the jatra  melting pot. While Uttam Kumar churned out one box-office  hit after another, Swapan Kumar picked up the cue and replicated  the success on stage. Saptapadi, Nishipadma,  Jibanmrityu, Sanyasi Raja, Amanush   some of the golden moments are still caught in frozen  frames at the 72-year-old thespians Gariahat residence.  This trend also foreboded the  decadence of the form, which became pronounced by the mid-Eighties  when film stars gained a foothold. The balance got tilted  when they started demanding and getting fat pay packets  just for that extra dash of glamour, says Banerjee. The who If film actors trot the line that  they brought big bucks and glamour into the palas,  jatra artistes never let go a chance to say its  quick cash that lured the Tollywood brigade to Chitpur.  And thats where all the action  is for 19 days now, as the Paschimbanga Jatra Utsav with  22 troupes rolls out an attractive line-up of Soumitra Chatterjee,  Shatabdi Roy, Indrani Halder, Dipankar Dey and several middle-ranking  actors. Beyond the festival and far removed  from Mahajati Sadan, the palas starring Chunky Pandey,  Shakti Kapoor and Asrani are among the big draws this season. Mumbai artistes dont work too  long at a stretch. For instance, out of 10 shows a month  with Chunky Pandey in the lead, he will act in five and  some other actor will replace him in the rest. Most palas  casting stars follow this module, says Santu Mukherjee.  Their dialogues, mostly a hotchpotch of Hindi with a smattering  of Bengali, are pre-recorded Quality, clearly, is the quickest  casualty. Cashing in on whatever is saleable is the sole  mantra  from the Kargil conflict to the capture of Saddam  Hussein. Fifteen days is all that it takes for Digbijoyi  Opera to stitch together the battle for Baghdad and hit  the Bankura fields with Dhora Porechhe Saddam. The how Its all about the money, honey,  but talk of sales figures and most jatra producers  act far more coy than their skimpily-clad money-spinning  women on stage. Modest returns is all that is  forthcoming. But given that most Tollywood stars do not  mind taking the dusty trail to the remote pockets of Bengal,  theres little doubt about where the bait lies.  A modestly successful pala  can pull around 8,000 people while a hit can push that up  to 25,000 to 30,000, says Samir Sen, secretary of the jatra  producers association. The booking rate for top draws climbs  up to Rs 50,000 a show. One particular pala featuring  a big Tollywood name has recorded Rs 70,000 a night.  On Tuesday evening, Day One of  the festival hosted by three jatra associations and  the information and cultural wing of the state government,  there was the odd gaffe. But the buzz in the audience was  indication enough that the organisers  battling a slump  in business with the rains playing spoilsport earlier this  season  would have the last guffaw by the time the jatra  jamboree would end.

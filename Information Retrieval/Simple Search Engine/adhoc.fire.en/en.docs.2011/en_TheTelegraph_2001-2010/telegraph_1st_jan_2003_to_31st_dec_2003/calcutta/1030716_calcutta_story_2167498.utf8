 Wednesday, July 16, 2003 				 Abandon partner, get sued for rape
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta High Court on Tuesday reiterated that a rape charge could be levelled against a man who refuses to marry his partner after a courtship involving a physical relationship.																								The court rejected the anticipatory bail prayer of a man who had allegedly ditched a woman after a two-and-a-half-year courtship.																								Last week, the court had taken a similar view on a youth abandoning his lover and marrying another girl.																								On June 26, a 20-year-old woman had lodged a complaint with Swarup Nagar police station, in North 24 Parganas, alleging that local youth Babul Sarkar had refused to marry her after an extended courtship. The inquiry revealed that the girl was six months pregnant. Police initiated a rape case against Sarkar, who filed an anticipatory bail prayer before the high court.																								Opposing the bail prayer, additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said the incident reflected a social problem and urged the court to take stern action. Producing a copy of The Telegraph (July 12), Goswami drew the attention of the court to the earlier case.																								The division bench of Justice G.C. De and Justice P.K. Biswas accepted Goswamis argument and rejected Sarkars prayer.

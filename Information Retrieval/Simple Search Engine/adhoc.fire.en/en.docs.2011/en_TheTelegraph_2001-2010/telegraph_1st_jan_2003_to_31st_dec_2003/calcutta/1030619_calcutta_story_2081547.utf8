The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, June 19, 2003 				 Blame game on streets of squalor
 
	What makes some Calcuttans compulsive litter-bugs? Metro  accompanies a civic official around town to catch them in  the act. Saibal Chakraborty, bank employee from Kankurgachhi,  was found by a civic official urinating on Chowringhee,  next to the Maidan Metro station. I admit I am wrong.  I am truly ashamed, he said. But as a diabetic, I  need to go to relieve myself often and there is little  that I can do when I am out on the streets. Where are  the public urinals? Pictures by Amit Datta  Name:  Dibyendu Chatterjee
 Occupation: Employee of a travel agency in south  Calcutta
 Offence: Spitting on the road in front of Metro  cinema
 His defence: This is really a terrible  habit, but all of Calcutta seems to be doing it. So,  I am really no exception. However, I normally do not  spit on the streets. I had no real intention of dirtying  the citys streets. I felt something in my mouth,  and I spat it out without thinking.
 When pointed out that he could have used his handkerchief,  he said: I just impulsively spat out something  that had come into my mouth. Name:  Hema Binani
 Occupation: Behala housewife
 Offence: Throwing a sal leaf on which she had  been eating puchka in front of Treasure Island 
 Her defence: Are there any civic amenities in  this city? I looked around for a bin to throw this plate  before chucking it on the road. Is it my fault that  there is no trash bin in sight? 
 When a trash bin was pointed out nearby, she said: That  is only a small tin and completely hidden from view.  If I had been told that this is where rubbish should  be dumped, I would certainly have done so. Name:  Sudhir Dey Sarkar
 Occupation: A hawker of sweets on Madan Street
 Offence: Dumping slips of paper, used for serving  sweets to customers
 His defence: Why should I bother about keeping  the streets clean? I pay the CMC employees a certain  amount every day to clear up the mess. If the streets  are still dirty, it is their fault. 
 When asked why he did not keep a container in which  people could throw the paper slips, he said: I  used to have a jhuri where people could throw the used  slips. But some time ago, someone stole it.  Name:  Javed Hossain
 Occupation: Employee of a multinational bank
 Offence: Littering Humayun Place, off New Empire,  with the wrapping of a kati roll
 His defence: I must confess that what I have  done is not correct and I am terribly sorry. But I was  in a hurry, so I just threw the wrapping on the road.
 When a Use Me trash bin was pointed out  behind him, he picked up the paper and dumped it in  the bin. He said: We do not derive any pleasure  from littering the streets, but I suppose we do make  these mistakes some times.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Fog factor plays havoc with timings
 OUR BUREAU																								As the north and parts of eastern India remained enveloped in dense fog on Wednesday, flight and train schedules to and from Calcutta went haywire again. Passengers were stranded for hours at the airport and major railway stations. The authorities fear the fog factor is likely to play havoc with the schedules even into the new year. 																								Two Jet Airways flights from Delhi to Calcutta were late by more than five hours. The flight to New Delhi (F 921) was delayed by an hour. It left at 9.45 am, instead of 8.45 am. The late arrival of flight 901 from Delhi pushed back the departure of the corresponding flight (902) to 2 pm.																								Indian Airlines officials said IC401 from Delhi, scheduled to arrive at 8.50 am, was late by four hours. The evening flight had to be cancelled.																								Twenty-five long-distance trains, including the New Delhi-Howrah and New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express arrived more than five hours behind schedule, on an average. One express train had to be cancelled from Sealdah because of heavy fog in the northern range, rail officials said.																								Down trains, like the Himgiri Express, Chambal Express, Poorva, Amritsar Mail and the Toofan Mail, all entered Howrah several hours late. Eastern Railway officials said the reason was the fog in the northern range. 																								The New Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani, scheduled to reach Howrah at 10.45 am, came in at 4.20 pm. 																								The Down Amritsar Express was running 11 hours behind schedule, while Himgiri was expected to reach Howrah nine hours late, officials said.

																																																																																		Three armed miscreants hijacked a taxi from Entally late on Thursday. According to police, Sukhdev Yadav, the taxi driver, lodged a complaint with Entally police station, that three youths dragged him out from the vehicle at gunpoint and sped away. During preliminary investigation, police came to know that Harpreet Singh had purchased the vehicle a month ago and employed Yadav to drive it. The police were not satisfied with Yadavs statements. He does not even know what the culprits look like, said an Entally police station official. Raids in Rajarhat have proved futile. Police said the gangsters might have fled to Bihar, from where Yadav came to the city last year. Yadav has been detained.																																																		The civic lighting department has decided to test a new range of streetlights. According to member, mayor-in- council, markets and lighting, Samsuzzaman Ansari, under this system, the lights will dim after midnight and consume less power.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, October 02, 2003  An ode to oddity this autumn 
 Towels and tops. Bombs and bonde.  Soap and spice. This Mahasaptami, Metro takes the trail  of innovative ideas and items going into the making of the  goddess and her abode 
	It doesnt get hotter than this. Bosepukur Parijat  Club has used over 100 kg of chillies  skin, seeds,  stalk, fried and grounded  to spice up its pandal.  The motifs are Rajasthani. The walls are panels with  intricate designs in red, yellow, grey and black   all natural colours of the potent vegetable. The Devis  weapons are also dotted with chillies. Even if the Pujas  are a muddy affair, the Kasba Kheyali Sangha structure  promises to come clean. After all, 7,000 kg of yellow  and red bars of soap has gone into the decor. The idol  is of clay, in matching dull yellow. At the other end  of town, Nimtala Kathgola, on Strand Road, has used  3,600 kg of soap for a south Indian temple model. The theme for this  cracker of a puja is the fizzle-out of the fireworks  industry. The decor of the Shahid Nagar Sarbojanin Durgotsab  pandal and pratima in Dhakuria has nearly 300,000  crackers minus the bang. Chocolate bombs are what Ganesh  and Kartiks garlands are made of, while chorkis  adorn the goddesses. The panels tell the story of a  labourer in the fireworks industry, with crackers.  Like a top, we continue  without a pause from the day we are born. That is the  idea behind the 25,000 wooden lattus  tiny to  over two feet wide  that adorn the small pandal of  Yuba Brinda, Ultadanga, and the lane leading up to it.  The over-the-top puja has been put together by artisans  who have lost business to plastic variants and more  exciting modern childrens games.  Bonde, but  without the luchi, has been served up at Aurobindo  Sporting Club Sarbojanin, off Bijon Setu. The sweet  beads, golden yellow and red, are all over the place,  but sadly for the flies, they are all dry. Bonde,  all 800 kg of it, has been pasted on the pandal surface.  The goddess is a matching yellow. If Bibi Russell has  taken the gamchha places, Juba Maitry has given  it pride of place near Kalighat. Gamchha is what  the goddess is clad in. The pandal and costumes, done  up mostly by club members, use Bengals favourite bath  towel in all colours, shapes and sizes. Pictures by  Pabitra Das, Amit Datta and Pradip Sanyal

				 																																									Earlier, Saraswati puja would be performed at educational institutions and a handful of local clubs. But now, theres a puja in every corner, with film songs blaring all day. The organisers also resort to forcible collection of subscriptions. Todays generation, it seems, associates the puja more with fun and merriment than with the pursuit of studies.				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Nayapatty Road.				 																																									I would like to thank the municipal corporation of Baidyabati, Hooghly, for repairing the fissures at the rail crossing. This will not only check mishaps, but also accelerate traffic movement.				 																																									Sumant Poddar,				 																																									Kyd Street.

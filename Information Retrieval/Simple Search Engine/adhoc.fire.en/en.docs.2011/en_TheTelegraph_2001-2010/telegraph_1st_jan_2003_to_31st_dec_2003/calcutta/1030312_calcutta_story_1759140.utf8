The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 12, 2003 				 																				Arijit Roy Chowdhury								Managing director, Gupta Press																																							The pressure on Howrah and Sealdah will be distributed if Chitpur comes up as a new hub. The new station will have as its hinterland an extensive area covering Poddar Court, Posta Bazar and Dalhousie, providing local people easier access. Calcuttas road network is small. So a new station must keep in mind infrastructural constraints. Chitpur is well-placed in that regard. Even then, only local trains should be diverted, not long distance ones, as the old stations will then be free to receive them. There is no need to spend money on improved infrastructure at the new stations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Conjuring an enchantment
 
 The man that hath not music in himself,/ Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds/ Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;/ The motions of his spirit are dull as night,/ And his affections dark as Erebus:/ Let no such man be trusted  William ShakespeareMusic and the other fine arts act like media helping the soul to transcend all physical barriers and be one with the Creator. The Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre hosts an evening of classical music and dance featuring three promising artistes from three parts of the country. Purabi Kakoty Sharma (picture above, right) is a talented violinist based in Guwahati. Meera Das (picture above) from Cuttack took to music and dance very early in life instinctively. Excelling in Bandha Nrutya in childhood, she took up Odissi and has proved her mettle in her chosen field. Lakshmi Ramaswamy is another young Bharata Natyam performer from Chennai who is the only dancer to have represented the country for the international Fullbright Scholarship in 1999-2000.When: Today at 6 pmWhere:  Copyright

 Sunday, July 27, 2003 				 Gunfire at construction site, one hurt
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 20-year-old labourer, Ganesh Sardar, received bullet injuries on Saturday morning when three miscreants opened fire at a construction site at Queens Park, in the Ballygunge police station area.																								It was around 10 am when residents were alerted by the sound of gunfire. A blood-soaked Sardar was seen writhing in pain. He was rushed to National Medical College and Hospital.																								Doctors attending to Sardar said his condition was stable and he would undergo an operation to remove a bullet from his leg.																								Sardar, a resident of South 24-Parganas, has been working as a daily wager at the construction site owned by Ajoy Madhukari, where a highrise is coming up after the demolition of an old building.																								Three goons arrived in a taxi, shot at random and sped away. The youth fell victim to a rivalry between two promoters, said the owner of a local shop.																								The Ballygunge police station, however, denied the involvement of promoters. Madhukari owns the land and is in charge of the project. No other promoter is involved. Rather, we suspect a rival of the man who is supplying building materials, an official said. The entire belt  Kasba, Karaya, Topsia and Tiljala  is being combed. 																								Residents demanded a police picket at the construction site. They alleged that clashes often erupted among rival gangs of building material suppliers.

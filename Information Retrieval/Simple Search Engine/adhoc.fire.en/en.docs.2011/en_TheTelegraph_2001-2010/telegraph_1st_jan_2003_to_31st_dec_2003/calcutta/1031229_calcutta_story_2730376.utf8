 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Flyovers miss date, SOS on funds flow
 SWATI SENGUPTA																								The lowdown on the high roads is that work on the flyover project will not meet its final deadline of May 29, 2004. Reason enough for the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) to push the panic button and write to the Japan Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) for an extension of the contract to cover the remaining work. 																								June 30, 2004, is the new deadline set for final closure of the project, covering the four flyovers at Park Street, Gariahat, AJC Bose Road, Cossipore and improvement of roads at Esplanade (see box).																								According to the job contract, JBIC will freeze its funds on May 29. If the bank does not agree to our appeal, the government has to pay for the leftover work from its budget, said Sadhan Banerjee, vice-chairman of HRBC, adding that the spillover work would cost about Rs 5 crore.																								If JBIC does not agree to extend the contract, then the government will have to foot the bill from its budget. Funds for the Rs 400-crore flyover project, that took off on November 1, 1999, is shared between JBIC and the state government on a 84:16 basis.																								Work on the two flyovers  Park Street and Cossipore  should have been completed by November 14, 2003. The new deadline for these is March 31, 2004, and work below the flyovers will take another three months from that date, said Banerjee.																								The HRBC official blamed the delay mainly on problems caused by underground utility services. Often, information available with us did not match what we found after digging, said Banerjee. In some cases, performance of the contractor concerned was not up to the mark. Delay in obtaining permission from the traffic police for work on certain stretches also slowed the project down, he claimed.

 Wednesday, August 27, 2003 				 Sleuths round up criminal duo
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two criminals owing allegiance to Sheikh Vinod, currently in jail, were arrested by sleuths of the detective department early on Tuesday. One of the officials, Jahar Das, suffered a bullet injury during the operation and had to be hospitalised. 																								Acting on a tip-off, the sleuths first picked up Akhtar Ali Mondal, alias Raju, from Baruipur, in South 24-Parganas. Raju, 26, was a close aide of Sheikh Vinod. He used to extort money from businessmen in the Tollygunge, Lake and Gariahat areas. 																								Sheikh Vinod was arrested in connection with three dozen cases of murder and extortion, mainly in the north and central hubs of the city. 																								Raju reportedly had with him a loaded, Chinese-made, 9-mm revolver, which belonged to Gabbar, another criminal now behind the bars, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Soumen Mitra.																								Rashid Alam, alias Gabbar, a most wanted criminal, was arrested in connection with the murder of Sanjiv Julka, alias Bunty, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. 																								He was also involved in a number of cases of murder and extortion and had allegedly attacked a police picket on Park Street by hurling bombs. 																								Raju led us to the house of Giasuddin Mollah, at Kamalgazi, in Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city, to whom he had handed over the revolver, Mitra added.																								On seeing the cops arrive, Mollah started to flee. The sleuths chased him. In the scuffle that followed his arrest, a bullet flew off Gabbars revolver, which Mollah was carrying, and ripped its way through the abdomen of detective department official Das. 																								He was rushed to a private hospital on the Bypass, where he was operated upon and is said to be in a stable condition.

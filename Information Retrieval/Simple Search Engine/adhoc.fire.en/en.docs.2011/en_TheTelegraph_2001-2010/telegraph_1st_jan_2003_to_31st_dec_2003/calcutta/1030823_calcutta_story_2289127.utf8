 A STAFF REPORTER																								Three youths were killed and two seriously injured when a lorry crashed into a Matador van at the crossing of Aurobindo Sarani and Raja Dinendra Street, in the Burtola police station area, early on Friday. 																								According to police, the mishap occurred around 4.45 am. The van was carrying poultry, with the lorry close behind, laden with goats. Both vehicles were speeding down the road. Suddenly, the Matador driver slammed the brakes. As a result, the lorry crashed into it. The impact sent the van skidding into a roadside pole, throwing off the five youths, police said.																								The van was on its way to New Market from Baduria. The lorry was bound for Narkeldanga. The drivers and helps of both vehicles fled after the accident. 																								Residents of the area heard the sound of the collision and rushed to the spot. They shifted the injured to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where three of them were pronounced dead. Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Kuldiep Singh identified the victims as Sanjoy Mondal, 25, Hamidul Goldar, 26, and Biswa Das, 22. All three were residents of Baduria, in the North 24-Parganas and own poultry farms there. The other two, Razak Ali, 22, and Raju Mondal, 18, are in a serious condition in hospital. Both suffered head injuries, Singh said.																								Both vehicles were impounded and we are on a hunt for the drivers and their helps. They cannot evade arrest, as we have their vehicles, Singh added.

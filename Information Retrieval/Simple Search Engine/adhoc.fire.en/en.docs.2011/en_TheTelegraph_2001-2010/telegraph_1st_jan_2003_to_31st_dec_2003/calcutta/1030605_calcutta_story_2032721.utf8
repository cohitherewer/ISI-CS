The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, June 05, 2003 				 Once in a blue moon
																								Blues, the mother of all jazz and rock, can groove, swing and rock listeners off their feet with rhythm n blues power. Seagull Empire hosts a special programme, titled Blue Moon, featuring some of the citys best-known musicians who have come together for a rare, once-in-a-blue-moon evening of blues and jazz. The evening is special because of the combination of musicians who have never performed together and also because most of them are returning to stage after many years, fuelled by the impulse to produce quality music. Pam Crain, the countrys leading jazz singer whose smoky voice, timing and delivery have matured with years of experience since the Sixties, will render a selection of her favourite jazz numbers including compositions by Chic Corea, Miles Davis, Cole Porter and a song by and for late Nina Simone. Anjum, whose power-packed rhythm n blues performances of the Eighties are still remembered for their versatility and energy, will explore the entire range in a selection of blues songs originally rendered by the likes of Carmen McCrea, Queen Sylvia Embry, DeeDee Bridgewater and Eva Cassidy. Others include veteran jazzman Anto Menezes, guitarist Amyt Dutta, pianist Debabrata Mitra, veteran bassist Willie Walters and drummer Nondon Bagchi.																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

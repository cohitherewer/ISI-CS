 Sunday, March 30, 2003 				 Man killed for illicit relationship
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 40-year-old worker of Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) was beaten to death by three of his colleagues late on Friday in Alipore over an illicit relationship with a woman. The victim, identified as Ramuji Rabidas, succumbed to his injuries while he was being rushed to SSKM Hospital by local residents.																								Preliminary investigations revealed that Ramuji, a father of two, recently fell in love with a widow, who also worked at the CMC and lived in the neighbourhood. Three men  Mithilesh, Dharmendra and Junky  came to know about the affair a few days ago and expressed their resentment.																								Initially, they asked Ramuji to put an end to the relationship. As he did not pay any heed, the trio decided to teach him a lesson, said an official of Alipore police station.																								On Friday, around 11 pm, the three took Ramuji to a deserted spot in Gokhana, near Judges Court Road, and started beating him up. 																								Later, local people noticed the man lying on the road and took him to hospital. The trio has been tracked down and the woman is being interrogated, said the official.

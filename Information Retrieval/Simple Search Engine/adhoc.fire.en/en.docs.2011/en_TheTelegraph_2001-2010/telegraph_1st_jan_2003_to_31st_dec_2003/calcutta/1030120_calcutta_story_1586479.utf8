																								Carmelia Mallebrein is a renowned Indologist who continues her research and every year, she spends about five months touring interior parts of India. The present exhibition of photographs is the result of numerous fieldwork trips to the country. The aim of this show is to focus on one prominent and unifying element in the diverse Indian religions, namely that of living gods on earth, who are still so vital in present-day India. Photography is an ideal medium to draw attention to the rich regional traditions of India and to look into the heart of belief. The exposition is divided into four sections offering access to a deeper understanding of indigenous rituals and cults which form a rich and indispensable part of its cultural heritage. The show is organised jointly by Indian Museum and Max Mueller Bhavan.

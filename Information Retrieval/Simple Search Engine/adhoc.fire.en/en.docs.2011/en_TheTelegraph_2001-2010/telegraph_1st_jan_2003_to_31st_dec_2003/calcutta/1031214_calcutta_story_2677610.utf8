 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Goons raid shoe shop for extortion money
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A gang went on the rampage at a shoe shop on Bentinck Street on Saturday afternoon, beating up the employees for not paying extortion money. On the way back, the gang tried to abduct one of the employees but sped away as local residents rushed in. 																								According to Hare Street police, the eight men, in their mid-twenties, went on the rampage in the shop on the stretch between the Dorina crossing and the Ganesh Chandra Avenue intersection around 4.30 pm. The goons hurled bombs and smashed the window panes of the shoe shop, owned by Sheikh Naushad. Three of them beat up the employees, said a police officer.																								While leaving the shop, the goons dragged out an employee. But the hue and cry alerted people in the neighbourhood. Sensing trouble, the miscreants fled. 																								Soon after, the gang arrived at the manufacturing unit of the shoe outlet in the nearby Gibson Lane. Here, too, they hurled bombs and smashed the windscreens of three parked vehicles.																								It was the work of local extortionists. They would often come to the shop and take away shoes for free, said an officer of Hare Street police station. Raids are being conducted, he added. Water supply disrupted:  Water supply in vast stretches of central and north Calcutta  was disrupted on Saturday due to a leak in the 30-inch diameter  pipeline at Tallah. Member, mayor-in-council (water supply)  Sovon Chatterjee said he hoped normal water supply would  resume from Sunday morning. Power cut: Power supply  to the northern fringes of the city will be hit for a few  hours on Monday due to maintenance work at the CESC distribution  centre at Kamarhati. Power supply in Ariadaha, Belghoria  Rathtala, Dakshineswar and Sarada Math will remain cut off  from 8 am to 10 am. Supply in Belghoria and Agarpara will  be off from 10.30 am to 12.30 pm.

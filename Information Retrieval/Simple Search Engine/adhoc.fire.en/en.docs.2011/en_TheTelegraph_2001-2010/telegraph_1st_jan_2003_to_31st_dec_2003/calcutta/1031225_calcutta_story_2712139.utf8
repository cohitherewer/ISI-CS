																								Life is strange. Surprises await us at every corner. The myth of contentment is shattered by tidal waves of unforeseen events. Sanjoy Ghosh was only five years old when he lost the use of both his hands and feet. Two years later, he recovered partially only to realise his right arm had become paralysed permanently. Undaunted by this calamity, Ghosh took to art naturally. By 12, he had found his calling: painting. At the age of 18, his first solo exhibition of paintings was held at the Academy of Fine Arts. Critics described his works as poignant with a sensitivity that reminded one of great masters like Ram Kinkar Baij and Gopal Ghosh. Four years later, with his second exhibition he consolidated his position as an artist. By then, he had got involved in a major project: forming a society for needy people. The years since 1996 have been trying for this talented artist. His wife passed away barely a month after they had a daughter, Chandrika. The artist had to play the dual roles of parenting the baby alone. The current exhibition is a testament of the artists need to express himself through art. Ghoshs paintings are haunted by space, both emotional and physical, by the need to fill blank spaces and margins, sometimes left blank intentionally. The theme of his works show the radiance of innocence and, at the same time, the crushing burden. Yet, above all this, if there is one theme that runs through his works like a leit motif, it is the vindication of the life force.

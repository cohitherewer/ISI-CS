 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Fog shift in BA winter schedule
 A STAFF REPORTER																								British Airways (BA) has changed its winter schedule for flights between Calcutta and London to minimise the effects of the anticipated fog in Calcutta. The new schedule is aimed at preventing delays in flights due to poor visibility at the normal scheduled arrival and departure times during this period.																								The new schedule will come into effect from December 19 until February 1, 2004, for flights on Friday and Sunday. The departure time for the recently-resumed third flight from Calcutta will remain unchanged.																								Under the new flight schedule, Flight BA 147 will leave London on Thursdays and Saturdays at 11.35 am (UK time) and arrive in Calcutta at 2.35 am (IST) the next day. On Tuesdays, the flight will leave London at 5.35 pm and arrive in Calcutta at 8.35 am the next day. Flight BA 146 will leave Calcutta on Fridays and Sundays at 4.25 am and arrive in London at 10.10 am. On Wednesdays, the flight will leave Calcutta at 10.35 am and arrive in London at 4.20 pm.

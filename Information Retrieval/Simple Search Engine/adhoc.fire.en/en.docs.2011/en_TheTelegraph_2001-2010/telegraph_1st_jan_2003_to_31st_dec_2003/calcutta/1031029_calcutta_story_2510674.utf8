 Wednesday, October 29, 2003 				 Cyclone threat weakens over Bay
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The deep depression that swirled over east-central Bay of Bengal on Monday weakened and crossed the coast of Andhra Pradesh, near Visakhapatnam, on Tuesday.																								Officials at the regional meteorological centre in Alipore said the system had weakened into a feeble low-pressure area and lay over Visakhapatnam. This means there will be no cyclonic storm or heavy rain from this system any more. But we can expect a partly cloudy sky and light showers, with the possibility of a thundershower, in some areas on Wednesday, an official said. 																								Weather bureau officials said the system moved about 700 km during Monday night and early Tuesday and was now located about 200 km southeast of Visakhapatnam. The system is showing signs of weakening and has toned down into a depression after it hit the coast on Tuesday afternoon. It weakened further into a feeble low-pressure zone. The weather is likely to be fairly clear on Wednesday, they said.																								 The weatherman had predicted heavy rain on Tuesday and Wednesday as the deep depression formed over east-central Bay of Bengal, with possibilities of it intensifying further and developing into a cyclone. The weather office had alerted the state government as well as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, and also warned fishermen against deep-sea fishing. The alert was withdrawn on Tuesday.																								Actually, we had detected the system as a depression over the north Andaman Sea and its adjoining areas on Sunday. It intensified into a deep depression and lay centred on Monday morning about 900 km southeast of Visakhapatnam, said an official. 																								However, if the low pressure, though feeble, moves over central India and towards Patna through Madhya Pradesh, there are chances of rains over Bihar and Jharkhand. We will experience some more depressions over the Bay of Bengal, as this is the cyclone season. The season will continue till December. This is the time cyclones and depressions develop in the Bay of Bengal, Andaman Sea and the Myanmar coast, said the official.																								Even though the weatherman warned of light rain with thundershowers in some places over the next 24 hours, the sky appeared to clear on Tuesday afternoon, with light white clouds across the city sky.

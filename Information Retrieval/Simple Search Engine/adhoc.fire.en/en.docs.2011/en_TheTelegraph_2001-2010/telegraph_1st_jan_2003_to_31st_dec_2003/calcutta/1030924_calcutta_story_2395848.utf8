 A STAFF REPORTER																								The 10-day-long impasse at Jadavpur University (JU) ended on Tuesday evening, with the agitating students deciding to call off their indefinite class boycott and relay hunger strike. 																								Students of the JUs engineering and technology faculty had launched a movement demanding an examination-related concession. The decision was taken in response to an appeal from the teachers. We have decided to attend classes from Wednesday morning, said Sudipto Sarkar, general secretary, faculty of engineering and technology students union. 																								The students union had to cancel the days convention with Jadavpur University Teachers Association (JUTA) after the members refused to attend it as the meeting had been announced without JUTAs approval.

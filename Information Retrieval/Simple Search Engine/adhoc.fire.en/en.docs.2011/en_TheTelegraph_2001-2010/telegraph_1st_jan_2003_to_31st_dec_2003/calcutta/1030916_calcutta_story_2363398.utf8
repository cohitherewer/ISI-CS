																								Bijoyesh Goswami is an eminent singer of devotional music (Kirtaniya). Steeped in tradition, this elderly singer belongs to the old school of music who prefers to stick to his gharana rigidly and hates any deviation or experimentation outside the existing tenets. His eldest son, Proloy, disagrees and defies his father. He renders his brand of fusion Kirtan, amalgamating elements of trendy, contemporary music with traditional Kirtan. Goswamis youngest son, Parimal, aspires to be a renowned footballer and his singular determination blinds him to the pressing necessities of his family. Goswamis daughter, Rakhi, however, is very serious about her studies. She intends to complete her education, take up a job and eradicate her familys poverty. Goswami is most hurt by his eldest sons defiance. Their titanic clash of belief forms the crux of this play, written and directed by Arijit Mukherjee. A Naba-Ajantik production.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

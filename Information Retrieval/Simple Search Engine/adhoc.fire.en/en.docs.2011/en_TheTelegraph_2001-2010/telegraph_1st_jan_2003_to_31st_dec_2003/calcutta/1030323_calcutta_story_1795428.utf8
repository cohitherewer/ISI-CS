 Sunday, March 23, 2003 				 Snag halts Metro
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Metro rail services were disrupted for nearly an hour on Saturday morning following a technical snag. Four Up trains and four Down trains were cancelled, while three more had to be rescheduled, Metro Railway officials said.																								A Tollygunge-bound train was stopped at Belgachhia station when smoke started coming out from near the tracks around 10:50 am. The passengers got off and power supply to the tracks was immediately disconnected. But there were no major damages, a Metro official said. 																								Our technical staff are probing the cause of the smoke. Although there was no problem on the tracks of the Up train, we decided to stop services as a preventive measure, he added. Services were resumed at 11.42 am.

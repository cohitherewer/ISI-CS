	Several petrol pumps across the city dump their waste on  the pavements and roadside. The sludge contains a lot of  harmful chemical substances. After a downpour, the refuse  gets washed away, which is even more harmful. Why isnt  the civic body doing anything in this matter?

	Passengers most often have to put up with the whims and  fancies of bus drivers. Last month, near Tollygunge Phari,  a bus on route IA screeched to a halt all of a sudden and  switched off the lights. When passengers demanded to know  the reason behind the act, the driver retorted that the  vehicle had developed a mechanical snag. Till then, the  bus had been running smoothly. The driver then asked us  to get off and push the vehicle. Some of the passengers  did as was told. After a lot of cajoling, the driver started  the engine and drove off very fast, to our astonishment.  The traffic police must check such harassment.  
	Prantik Sanyal, SP Mukherjee Road.

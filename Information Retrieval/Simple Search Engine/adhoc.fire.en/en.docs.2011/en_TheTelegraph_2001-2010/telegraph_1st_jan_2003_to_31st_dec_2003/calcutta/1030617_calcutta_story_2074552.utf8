 Tuesday, June 17, 2003 				 No-show rap logs out Board from Net result
 A STAFF REPORTER Students of Modern  High School for Girls exult over their Madhyamik results.  Picture by Pradip Sanyal  When you hit a hurdle, dont try  to cross it. Take a U-turn.																								Stung by the frustration among Madhyamik examinees denied a glimpse of their results on the Net till late on Sunday, and the resultant rap, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education did just that. By Monday evening, it had decided to roll back its experiments with technical truths in the dissemination of Madhyamik results.																								The result rap following the no-show on the Net came from all quarters, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on his first day in office after the Italy sojourn. The post-mortem was carried out with school education minister Kanti Biswas summoning the website-managers. The casualty, of course, was the idea to take a tech step forward by posting results on the Net.																								By the end of the day after, the posting of results on websites or beeping through SMS  as also the Sunday announcement of results  before the distribution of marksheets had all been deleted before one could click log out. And so it was goodbye, new ideas; welcome back, tried and tested formulae.																								We have learnt a lesson, Board president Dibyendu Bikash Hota admitted. Enough is enough and, henceforth, we will never depend on websites and the SMS only for announcing Madhyamik results. Apologising for Sundays student ordeal, Hota added: We are sorry for the inconvenience and will try to ensure that they do not face a similar situation in future.																								Even as apologies poured out of the Boards office on Park Street, at Writers Buildings, the chief minister appeared anything but amused at the result logjam on Sunday that tried the patience of over 5.75-lakh students. Bhattacharjee felt the results should not have been posted at an Internet peak time of 9 am on a Sunday.																								I have sought a report from the IT department, which runs the two websites, on what exactly happened, said Bhattacharjee, referring to the two websites  www.tathyabangla.org and www.wbgov.com  that students failed to log on to till late on Sunday. Till last year, the Board would post the Madhyamik results on websites only after it had ensured that all marksheets had reached the schools. The Net result  a virtual redundancy of marks on webpages.																								If the idea was to pre-empt the rush of students to schools, the results should have been posted at the correct time (midnight is when the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations and Central Board of Secondary Education do it), said a Board official. Also, distributing marksheets a day after announcing the results was of little help in easing the pressure. 																								It is better to let all students know their results at the same time, Hota said, admitting that pre-posting of results on the Net went against the spirit of equality.

 Vasundhara, when Nature beckons
  All nature is but art, unknown to thee,/ All chance, direction which thou canst not see;/ All discord, harmony not understood/ All partial evil, universal good/ And spite of pride, in erring reasons spite/ One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right  Alexander Pope Shyamasree Basu is a talented senior artist who has worked out a niche for herself as a nature-based abstract artist. Such a label, even if it encapsulates the main thematic and stylistic thrust of her paintings, does not capture the many sources and ideas that are embedded in her work. Over the years, it is the physical and natural environment  the land mass, the vegetation, the elemental forces of light, water, wind and heat  have remained the primary sources of her artistic vocabulary. The present solo exhibition, which showcases 26 of Basus canvases in oil, acrylic and mixed media, takes viewers to the artists intense and introspective world of nature-based abstractions, where the awe and wonder of primeval creations contend with the equally compelling spectres of doom and disaster.When: Till March 9; 3 pm - 8 pmWhere: Academy of Fine  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, May 24, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Bob DylanYou are absolutely  single-minded about succeeding in life. You have an insatiable  curiosity for human nature. You derive maximum satisfaction  from providing material benefits to your family. A good  time ahead to turn self-employed. Avoid shyness. You may  take on more responsibility than you can handle and wear  yourself out in the process.  Kusum Bhandari

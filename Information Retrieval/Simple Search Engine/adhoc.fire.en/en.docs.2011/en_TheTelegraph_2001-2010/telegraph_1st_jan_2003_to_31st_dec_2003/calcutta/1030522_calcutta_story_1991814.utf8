 Thursday, May 22, 2003 				 Teachers pilot plea for change in session
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A change in academic sessions in the state-aided secondary schools appears imminent, with various teachers lobbies pressuring the government to abolish the existing system of beginning the sessions from May every year.																								While some teachers say the state government should reintroduce the system of beginning academic sessions from January every year, another lobby feels July is the best time for starting new sessions in all Madhyamik schools.																								As of now, academic sessions begin in May and end in April the following year. This system was introduced by the state government in the early Eighties.																								The government is seriously considering a change in the present system of beginning academic sessions from May, as there is a strong demand from the teachers in this regard. We (the government) have received proposals from various groups of teachers. We are examining them and will finally accept the one we find is most suitable for students, said Kanti Biswas, school education minister. The government will soon hold a meeting to finalise the matter. 																								Sources in the state education department said teachers cited certain problems in the existing system of beginning sessions in May. The main reason cited is that such a system leads to the loss of many academic days, as the annual examinations of schools coincide with the two main school-leaving examinations  Madhyamik and Higher Secondary. 																								Ratan Laskar, general secretary, Secondary Teachers and Employees Association, said in the present system, the annual examinations in schools have to be held two months in advance, resulting in the loss of a number of classes.

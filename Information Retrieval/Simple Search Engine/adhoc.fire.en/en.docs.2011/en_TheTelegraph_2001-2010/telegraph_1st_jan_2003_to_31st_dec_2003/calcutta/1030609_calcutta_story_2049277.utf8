 Monday, June 09, 2003 				 Arrested for forging signature on certificates
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Ramji Rao, 23, was arrested on Saturday night from the Bally police station area, in Howrah, for alleged fraud. Rao had forged the signature of district magistrate Vivek Kumar and issued several certificates. 																								The Howrah police had been on his trail after a complaint was lodged by Lal Chand Agarwal, a local resident, last October.																								Agarwal said in his complaint that while on a visit to the district magistrates office last October for a certificate of domicile, he had been approached by Rao and offered help. 																								Rao told me he knew officials in the district magistrates office and would have a certificate issued to me in a couple of days for a fee of Rs 600, claimed Agarwal. 																								After two days, Agarwal received photocopies of the certificate and was told the original would follow in a few days. Then, Rao went incommunicado. Agarwal turned suspicious and lodged a complaint. 																								The police said: We had information that a racket involved in the forging of official documents was on, but before Agarwal, no one had come forward to lodge an official complaint. Since Agarwal brought the incident to light, we kept a close watch on the visitors in the district magistrates office. 																								Raos description was circulated in the police stations of the area, based on details provided by Lal Chand Agarwal. A tip-off led to his arrest by the Bally police. Rao is being grilled to name the others involved in the racket, police said.

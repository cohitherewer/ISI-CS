	The practice of washing roads every morning is good, but  Calcutta Municipal Corporation workers waste a lot of water  in the process. Puddles are formed in the cracks, resulting  in a traffic jam early in the morning. The water-spraying  machines should be fitted with improved valves or stoppers  to regulate the flow. Instead of cleaning dirt, the civic  staff most often end up producing a lot of mud and slush.

	Most buses of Calcutta State Transport Corporation do not  display the destination points, leave alone their routes.  This inconveniences non-regular commuters.

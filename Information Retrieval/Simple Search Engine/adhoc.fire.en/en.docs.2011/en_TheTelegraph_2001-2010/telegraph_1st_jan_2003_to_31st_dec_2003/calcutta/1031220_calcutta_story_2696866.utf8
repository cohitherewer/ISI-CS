 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Womanly Voices
																								Womanly Voices comprises three great stories that reveal the depth and scope of some of Indias finest women authors. Wajeda Tabassums sharply penetrative Utran explores the relationship between a young woman and her servant, who can only afford to wear utran  her mistress hand-me-downs  and simmers for a chance to get even with her mistress. Mahasweta Devis rivetting and savagely moving Shishu is a disturbing tale about government relief officers who visit a remote village in Ranchi and witness how poverty has degraded the tribals to such an extent that they are barely human any more. Gita Mehtas hauntingly poignant The Teachers Story unravels the doomed relationship between a music teacher and the gifted child he adopts. These are three powerful and distinct womanly voices that go far beyond hearth and home, and illuminate the world around them with humour, insight and rare compassion. A unique theatrical experience brought for city theatre buffs by Spandan in collaboration with Sanskriti Sagar. Directed by Lillete Dubey, the play features Joy Sengupta, Shernaz Patel, Neha Dubey, Suchitra Pillai, Zafar Karachiwala, Sephra Abraham and Ira Dubey.

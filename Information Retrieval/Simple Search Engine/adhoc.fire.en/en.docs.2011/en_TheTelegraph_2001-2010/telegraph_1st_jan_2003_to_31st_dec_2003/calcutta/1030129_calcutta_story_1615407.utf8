The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, January 29, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									I had a bitter experience with telephone operators at the Calcutta airport recently. I had called up to inquire about the arrival of a Bangladesh Biman flight from Dhaka. There was no attendant at the Biman counter when I called the first time. The next time the telephone operator said it wasnt her duty to give information about flight arrivals and slammed the phone down. I called up once again and this time the reply was more rude. I went to the airport unaware of the arrival time and waited for two hours for the flight. I request the airport authorities to instruct their staff to be polite to customers.

A friend had despatched a money order for Rs 1500 on December 23 from Trivandrum, in Kerala. The packet reached me in Calcutta after 24 days. The postal department has hiked the prices of every item but its efficiency has not improved. This is why most people prefer courier services than the post.				 																																									T.R. Anand,				 																																									Budge Budge.

 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Fair mode on Maidan
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Goaded by Calcutta High Court, a state government department said on Thursday it had undertaken several programmes for the cleaning and greening of the ground adjacent to the Victoria Memorial Hall.																								The public works department (PWD), in an affidavit filed on Thursday before a high court division bench, comprising Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice S.P. Talukdar, produced a long list of directives issued by Calcutta Police and measures already taken that, it hoped, would make the approach to Victoria Memorial less grimy and more green.																								The high court, responding to a public interest litigation filed by Subhas Dutta of Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samiti, earlier directed the state government to do away with fairs on the ground from April 15 next year. It also asked the government to spell out measures it would undertake to protect the Maidans environment before that date.																								Taking the cue, Calcutta Police issued a list of dos and donts that everyone setting up a stall on the ground will have to follow: The fair ground must be kept clean  and no garbage should be left behind after the party is  over No oven or any other kind of fire  can be used there No refuse/garbage should be burnt No garbage/refuse should be left  behind or be allowed to clog the Maidan sewer network Overall cleanliness of the fair-ground  and its adjacent areas must be maintained Temporary urinals/toilets erected  during the fair should be cleaned daily Each allottee should furnish an  undertaking sworn before a first-class magistrate to the  effect that he/she shall abide by the instructions Any violation of the order will  result in penalty and the organisers will be blacklisted.																								The PWD measures have also been listed: Organisers of fairs have been  asked to assign a particular spot for the waste that accumulates  and the PWD will carry the refuse to Dhapa The authorities will have to dismantle  all temporary structures within a stipulated period. The  PWD will clean up the debris and take it away to Dhapa All open drains will be cleaned  after the fair is over.																								Copies of both the police directives and the PWD list have already been circulated to all government departments.

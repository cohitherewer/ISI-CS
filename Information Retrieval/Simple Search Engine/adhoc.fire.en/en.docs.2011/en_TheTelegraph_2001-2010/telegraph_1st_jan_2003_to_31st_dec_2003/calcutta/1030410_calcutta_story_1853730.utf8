The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, April 10, 2003 				 Night call for state of the heart
 															- Round-the-clock emergency cardiac-care squad at Bypass hospital SUBHRO SAHA																								Sixty-three-year-old Tapash Roy suffered an acute myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, at two in the morning. The retired bankers family, in south Calcutta, rushed him to the nearest cardiac care centre, but doctors there couldnt give him the life-saving shot, since Roy had bleeding ulcers. By the time day dawned, Roys condition had deteriorated beyond salvage.																								Recent-entrant Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals has zeroed in on the treatment-time lag in fighting heart attacks at night in Calcutta. A group of doctors and support personnel at the EM Bypass hospital have formed an emergency core contingent to treat the midnight killer. Led by interventional cardiologists Sunil Lhila and Aftab Khan, the team is using primary angioplasty to open up the choked arteries, instead of the conventional treatment of administering life-saving medicine to dissolve the clot.																								In such an emergency, time management is the key, stresses the primary plasty core team at Apollo Gleneagles. We have achieved a door-to-balloon time (period from the moment the patient enters through the hospital door to the instant when the blocked artery is opened up by the balloon) of 30-40 minutes, giving ourselves the maximum chance to succeed, says Lhila.																								The moment a heart attack case is reported over the phone, the crisis crew  from the ambulance staff to cath lab technicians, anaesthetist to ward staff, besides the cardiologists themselves  swings into action. The only round-the-clock emergency squad in town offering the cath-lab procedure, has successfully opened up completely occluded arteries in 17 cases already. Most patients have resumed work on the fourth day after the attack.																								Besides keeping vigil by night, we are trying to raise awareness on the procedure by day, since education of doctors and the people is vital to save more lives. Early recognition of the condition is important for maximum benefit, feels Khan.																								The door-to-balloon rulebook drawn up by the team reads something like this: - Report to the hospital emergency  without wasting any time - Dont give the patient too much  sublingual nitrates, like Sorbitrate - Watch for perspiration, plus  upper-abdominal discomfort - A dedicated helpline for heart-attack  patients will be launched soon. Till then, the nightwatchmen  are Sunil Lhila: 98312 57841, Aftab Khan: 98312 57844, P.K.  Tiwary: 98312 57850.

 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Fast track courts after SC prod
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Thanks to the Supreme Court chiding the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government for its inordinate delay in setting up fast track courts (FTCs) in the state, the government has completed forming 65 such courts in less than two months. 																								Now, there is an FTC in every district in the state and in almost every sub-division. We hope to complete the remaining 33 FTCs by March 31, 2004, a senior official of Writers Buildings said on Saturday. 																								Only 54 FTCs had been formed when the apex court pulled up Bengal for its tardiness, and ruled that December 31 should be the deadline for all states. Failing this Central funds may have to be returned. 																								After setting up 65 FTCs in less than two months, the state government has now submitted an affidavit to the Supreme Court saying that the remaining 33 courts would be completed by March 31 next year  the financial year-end. We hope that the apex court will consider extending the deadline, the officer added. The 65 new FTCs were all formed by December 22, pushing up the total number of functioning FTCs in the state to 119. The state government is to complete establishing 152 FTCs as a target set before it by the Centre.

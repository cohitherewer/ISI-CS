The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, June 29, 2003 				 Gay walk for rights 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Supporters of the right to alternative sexuality have reason to cheer. A pride march will hit the streets on Sunday morning from Park Circus Maidan to Rabindra Sarobar. 																								Organised by Integration Society, an NGO specialising in human rights and sexual health communication, the silent walk will commemorate the Stonewall Riots, the landmark event of June 26, 1969, that changed the progress of the gay rights movement.																								The march is part of a month-long series of events called Walk on the rainbow, including the launch of a music video Jaoa Asha, a panel discussion and the release of a community newsletter. It will climax on July 24 at Gyan Manch with an audio play, Kinaaraa, about a same-sex relationship in the urban milieu. Sapphire Creations will present a ballet on the same theme.																								The situation may slowly be changing among a limited urban population, but in rural areas it remains unchanged, says Rafiquel Haque Dowjah of Integration Society.																								nRun over: An unidentified man, in his sixties, was run over by a bus on route 13 at the CR Avenue-Eden Hospital Road crossing on Saturday afternoon. He was taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared brought dead.

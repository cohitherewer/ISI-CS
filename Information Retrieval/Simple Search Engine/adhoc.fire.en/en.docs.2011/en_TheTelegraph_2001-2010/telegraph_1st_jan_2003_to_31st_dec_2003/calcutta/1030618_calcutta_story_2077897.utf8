 Wednesday, June 18, 2003 				 Girls 4-year wait for BA results review
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta University has robbed me of important years of my life. Its indifferent attitude towards my cause is responsible for my present mental agony. Why wont the institution be prosecuted for its unjust act? 																								Monali Chowdhury, a student of Gangadharpur Mahavidyamandir, in Howrah, on Tuesday filed a writ petition in Calcutta High Court raising this question. She has demanded exemplary penal action against university officials responsible for the setback to her academic career.																								Monalis counsel Smarajit Roy Chowdhury said the student had appeared for BA Part II with Bengali (honours) in 1999. When the results were published, Monali found she had passed the examination but missed the honours grade by 13 marks.																								She filed an application for a review of her Bengali answer-script in August 25, 1999. Four years have passed since then, but Monali is yet to receive a response from the university. Several reminders, sent by Monalis father to the universitys Bengali department, too, have failed to elicit a response.																								The petitioners father told the lawyer that his daughter had been suffering from depression and was slowly losing her mental balance. I asked her to file a case to console her and with the hope that she might get justice, the lawyer said.																								Despite the delay, Monali is still waiting for the review result. This has restrained her from pursuing higher education, said her counsel, who thought it fit to file a case claiming damages against Calcutta University. Roy Chowdhury said that Monalis case would be heard within a couple of days.																								The counsel for Calcutta University, when contacted, said he had not received any copy of the case. 																								Monalis case is one of the series of lawsuits filed by aggrieved examinees against Calcutta University, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education and the Council for Higher Secondary Education.																								Changes in the marks of some students after court intervention have prompted more and more dissatisfied candidates to move court and seek a scrutiny or review of their answer-scripts, said a spokesperson for the high court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Spend it all at the shopping mall
 															- Calcuttans no longer intimidated by the glitz, splurge on retail brands SUBHRO SAHA Selling space: 240 sq ft;  selling point: ethnic kurtas; monthly sales: Rs 8-9 lakh  Selling space: 242 sq ft;  selling point: top-of-the-line mobile phones; monthly sales:  Rs 6.5 lakh  Selling space: 650 sq ft;  selling point: designer undergarments; December target:  Rs 18 lakh																								And you thought Calcutta couldnt spend!																								Nearly 80,000 people walked into Forum in the last week of November, while 22 Camac Street consistently records footfalls upwards of 15,000 on weekends. And the footfall certainly doesnt comprise only moviegoers (INOX offers 31,000 seats a week) and hangers-on (the malls a great place to be seen).																								Shoppers Stop, the Forum anchor store, records a growth of 22 per cent every month and has started earning cash profits. Pantaloons, which anchors 22 Camac Street, clocked sales of Rs 3 crore in November, up 19 per cent from last year, and still their largest-selling store in the country.																								Mall magic has clearly cast a spell over Calcuttans, and retail brands  from apparel to cellphones, fusion food to designer crystals  are laughing their way to the bank. And this is not just during the Durga puja high tide. The biggest worry for a mall developer is when dropping in becomes just a fad. But brand loyalties are not built in a day and the walk-ins were bound to translate into conversion, says Rahul Saraf, the man behind the 200,000-sq-ft lifestyle mall on Elgin Road.																								R.S. Rekhi, head, operations (east), Pantaloon Retail (India) Ltd, feels the increased volume of mall traffic has a lot to do with the explosion of the myth that well-formatted air-conditioned mall shopping is only for the elite. Earlier, just the top-end crowd used to come to the malls. Now, even the next rung has started trooping in, he says. Saraf concurs, Calcuttans are no longer intimidated by the glitz.																								Ask Madhusudan Binani about it. Sales have skyrocketed after the Pujas, as people realised they dont have to pay more for the international ambience, says the man who runs five key retail outlets in Forum  Satya Paul, Adidas, Dockers, Levis and Benetton. Targeting a 22 per cent growth on a conservative estimate, he reports sales in excess of Rs 8.6 lakh from the Benetton store alone in November.																								Forum has given us a national launching pad and we could open a boutique in Delhis Hauz Khas Village, thanks to the success in Calcutta, says La Lingerie owner Dharam. With 300 new names added to our customer base in the last seven-eight months, we are now launching the Swarovsky collectors society, says Tarun Daga, director of the crystals outlet, said to be clocking sales of Rs 18-20 lakh every month.																								The mood is gung-ho in select spaces of 22 Camac Street, with an average weekday car circulation of 800-1,000. Grain of Salt, ModiCare and Bombay Shiv Sagar are doing consistently good business. In November, Grain of Salt, the fusion-food fine-dining outlet did more than 300 covers on an average every day. In December, we are already doing 15 per cent more business, declares director Nitin Kohli.

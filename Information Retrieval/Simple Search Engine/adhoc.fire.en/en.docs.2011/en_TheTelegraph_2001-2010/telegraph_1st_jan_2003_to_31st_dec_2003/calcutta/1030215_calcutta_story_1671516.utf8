The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A melodious journey
  The soft, melodious strains of santoor have a magical effect on frayed nerves. As the soothing music penetrates deep within, it boosts ones hidden sources of positive energy and the result is exhilarating. Santoor and Pandit Bhajan Sopori are synonymous. Born in a family of musicians of Sufiana Gharana of Kashmir, Pandit Sopori is hailed as the Saint of Santoor and the King of Strings for his enormous contribution to Indian music. This maestro has been a pioneer in bringing santoor on national and international platforms at par with sitar and sarod and giving it the honour of a concert instrument. Rendition of dhrupad ang on santoor with the accompaniment of pakhawaj, attaching tumba, introducing Meend and Glides, Gamak, balancing of Kalam (strikers) etc is also a part of his innovation. Pandit Soporis research on the use of santoor for sound therapy has been highly acclaimed by pharmaceutical companies. He has an illustrious band of pupils including his son, Abhay Rustom Sopori. This evening the father-son duo performs in the city for the first time under the aegis of Arohan Foundation, Centre for Performing Arts, Salt Lake. Their recital will be preceded by Kankana Banerjees Hindustani classical vocal music.When: Today at 6 pmWhere:  Copyright

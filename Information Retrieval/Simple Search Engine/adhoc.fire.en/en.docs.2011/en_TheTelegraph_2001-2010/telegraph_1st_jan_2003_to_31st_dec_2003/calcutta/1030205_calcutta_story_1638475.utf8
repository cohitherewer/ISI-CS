				 																																									I wonder what the pollution control board is doing about the distress the visitors at the Book Fair are being subjected to daily. The level of suspended particulate matter in the air is so high that one has to stuff a piece of cloth into ones nose to prevent choking. The organisers are spraying water on the fair ground disproportionately and in most of the stalls, browsing through books is becoming a hellish experience due to the stuffy atmosphere.				 																																									Manoranjan Dasgupta,				 																																									South Tangra Road.				 																																									On February 3, we received a phone call from a person claiming to be from the GPO, saying that there was a parcel from the Indian Medical Association, Delhi. He asked for confirmation of our residential address and within an hour, a man despatched a parcel and took Rs 375 from us. On opening the packet, we found a few old used magazines. We request the authorities concerned to look into the matter so that others dont fall prey to such dupes.				 																																									V. Lakshman,				 																																									Address not given.

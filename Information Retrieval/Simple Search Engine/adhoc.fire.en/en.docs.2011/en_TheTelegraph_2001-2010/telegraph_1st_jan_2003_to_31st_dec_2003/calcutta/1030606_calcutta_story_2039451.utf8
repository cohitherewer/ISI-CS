 Friday, June 06, 2003 				 Bomb, bullet attack on rival goon
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Gunshots sparked panic on Ripon Street on Thursday morning. A gang of unidentified goons fired at 25-year-old Mohammad Arshad Alam repeatedly from close range. Neighbours and the police rushed him to National Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition. One person, identified as Pushan, was arrested later in the evening. 																								Local shop-owners downed their shutters and the sound of shots sent people scurrying for safety. Police said Arshad had a criminal record. He used to extort money from traders in the New Market area. He belonged to the group led by Gabbar, now behind bars. Recently, however, Arshad had formed his own gang. 																								Police feel the attack may have been masterminded by Guddu, a Gabbar associate. After preliminary investigations, they have found that he deployed four men for the attack.																								At 9.15 am, witnesses said, Arshad was standing near a building under construction. Suddenly, four youths arrived in a car, armed with bombs and revolvers. They hurled the bombs at him but missed their target. 																								Then, the volley of gunfire followed. The first two bullets missed Arshad. The third pierced his left shoulder. Arshad fell to the ground, and the criminals, taking him for dead, fled.																								Park Street police station was alerted and officer-in-charge Faiz Khan arrived with a posse. 																								He disclosed that Arshad had fallen out with Gabbar, and had been under the latters surveillance for some time now. However, the assailants must have been new on the job, Khan said, considering that the shots and bombs had missed their target.

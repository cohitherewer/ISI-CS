 Friday, October 03, 2003 				 Hospital row after nurse death
 							 - Family alleges operation without consent, cries negligence A STAFF REPORTER 																								Trouble broke out at Medical College and Hospital on Thursday morning after a 35-year-old nurse died a few hours after giving birth to a baby boy. 																								Family members went on the rampage from 7 am on Thursday, alleging negligence on the part of the hospital authorities. They claimed that the caesarean section on Tripti Biswas was done without their permission. A probe was ordered into the incident.																								Biswas, who had been working as a nurse for eight years, arrived at the gynaecological ward for a check-up around 8 pm on Wednesday. We knew that she was in an advanced stage of pregnancy, but we were kept completely in the dark about their (doctors) plans for an emergency surgery, said Triptis husband Asit Biswas.																								According to hospital authorities, after a brief check-up on Wednesday evening, doctors advised Tripti to get admitted in the hospital. Around 10 pm, she was rushed to the operation theatre for surgery. 																								Around 10.20 pm, the gynaecological department team announced that Tripti had given birth to a healthy baby boy. 																								At this point we knew that Tripti and the child were fine after the emergency delivery. However, doctors said she was still under observation, said Swapan Biswas, Triptis brother. 																								With no news coming out of the operation theatre, family members started making inquiries. After a lot of persuasion they told us after midnight that Tripti had developed some cardiac problems. We were shocked, said husband Asit.																								Around 1 am, the hospital authorities asked the Biswas family to arrange for blood and medicines and to get in touch with an anaesthetist for another possible surgery. 																								Around 4.55 am, more than three-and-a-half hours after doctors pressed the panic button, Tripti was shifted to the cardiology department for immediate resuscitation. However, at 5.45 am Tripti died from a massive cardiac failure and possible post- operative infection. 																								As soon as the news broke, the family along with its Madhyamgram neighbours rushed to the hospital. They beat up security guards and heckled doctors at the gynaecological department.																								Head of the gynaecology department Mumtaz Sangamita claimed everything was done following medical norms. 																								Family members are not convinced. They have threatened to drag the hospital authorities to court for medical negligence. 																								Superintendent of the hospital K.K. Adhikari said a four-member team had been constituted to look into the case. A police picket was posted to thwart any untoward incident.

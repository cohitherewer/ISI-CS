																																																																																		The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the state government to constitute a special pay commission for Calcutta High Court employees. A three-judge bench comprising Justices S. Rajendra Babu, D.M. Dharmadhikari and G.P. Mathur said the special pay commission consisting of judges and the administrators shall be constituted by the chief justice (of Calcutta High Court) in consultation with the government to make a report... On receipt of such report, the chief justice and the government shall thrash out the problem and work out an appropriate formula with regard to pay scales to be fixed for the high court employees. The apex court also directed the Bengal government that such action be taken within six months from today. The apex court made it clear that it would continue to monitor developments in Calcutta, saying the petition should be listed for further hearings after receipt of the report from the high court or the government. The High Court Employees Welfare Association had brought the case before the apex court after the state government rejected the pay scale on the grounds of financial inability.

 Saturday, July 12, 2003 				 Pre-dacoity swoop nets gang of six
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A dacoity was foiled by the police in Thakurpukur early on Friday. 																								Acting on a tip-off, they arrested six armed men from a house near the market, where the group had assembled and was planning out the dacoity. All the men were wanted in a number of cases of dacoity and extortion in Behala and Thakurpukur. 																								Deputy superintendent of police (town) H. Kabir said on receiving information that the gang had gathered near the market, officer-in-charge of Thakurpukur police station Shyamal Ghosh rushed to the spot with a strong force and cordoned off the area. The dacoits were not aware that they were surrounded because they were drunk. 																								However, when they realised, they ran out of the house, firing from country-made revolvers and hurling bombs to cover their tracks. On hearing the blasts, the areas residents switched on their lights, which helped the police locate the fleeing criminals. 																								Six of them were rounded up and we recovered revolvers and cartridges from them. We are looking for the owner of the house they had assembled in. He has fled, deputy superintendent Kabir said. Three of the arrested were identified as Prabir Kanthal, Pulak Kanthal and Ramjan Mollah, most-wanted criminals involved in a number of cases of dacoity and extortion.

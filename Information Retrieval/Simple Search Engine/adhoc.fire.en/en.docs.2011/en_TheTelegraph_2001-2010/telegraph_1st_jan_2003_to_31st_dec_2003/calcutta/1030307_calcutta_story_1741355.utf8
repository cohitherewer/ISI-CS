 																											- From Boston, marketplace tips for entrepreneur programme  A STAFF REPORTER																								To help first-generation entrepreneurs turn their start-ups into success stories, the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BNCCI) is organising a five-day training programme (March 10-14), in association with Boston University. 																								The focus will be on small and medium enterprises. We have identified some promising entrepreneurs and we think they can imbibe a lot by interacting with the resource team from Boston, said a spokesperson for the Entrepreneurship Development Initiative (EDI) cell of the city-based chamber. The cell, in association with the government of West Bengal, organises regular training programmes for budding entrepreneurs. 																								The team from Boston will comprise Peter R. Russo, Erik Molander and Anil Khurana  all from the management school of the university  and consultant Partha Ghosh, who heads Boston Pledge, an association of Bengalis in North America. 																								From feasibility of financing and the need of innovation to role of government policies and use of modern management principles, the BNCCI-Boston University initiative will focus on the challenges facing entrepreneurs from the grassroots. 																								In todays marketplace, entrepreneurs must be well-aware of the gamut of issues related to their particular business. Besides, to access finance from institutional lenders, one has to follow certain procedures, explained the spokesperson. 																								To involve the local academia, the organisers have tied up with premier institutions like the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management and the business management departments of Calcutta University, Jadavpur University and Shibpur B.E. College (Deemed University). 																								Besides, industry captains and representatives from financial institutions and banks  like Sidbi and Nabard  will also be present at the meet. 																								And its not only conducting sessions. The team from Boston will also call on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and some of his Cabinet colleagues to draw up a course of action in the state.

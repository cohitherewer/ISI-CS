The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, May 14, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	Most public libraries in the city are in bad shape. Large  stocks of rare and valuable books are being damaged due  to lack of maintenance. Most of these libraries suffer a  chronic funds crisis and cannot even appoint a trained librarian.  As disinfectants are not sprayed regularly, old books are  damaged by moths. The condition of several libraries in  north Calcutta, especially Chaitanya Library, Bagbazar Reading  Library and Boys Own Library, is deplorable. It is high  time the state government took steps for their restoration  and channelled adequate funds. Calcutta has a rich heritage  of reading which should be always be encouraged.

	Several shopkeepers have encroached on the pavements of  Jadu Babus Bazar. They run business from the footpaths  and use the shops as godowns. This, coupled with hawkers  squatting on the remaining space, makes it difficult for  pedestrians to move. The civic authorities must check this.

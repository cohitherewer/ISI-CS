The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 16, 2003  Horse sense
 An Eye on Calcutta / Kiran  Uttam Ghosh I know its the time for reflecting  on the year past and the year ahead, but suddenly Ive been  reminded of the here and now. This is a horsy time of year.  Now, I dont mean people horsing around in the spirit (or  under the influence of spirits) of New Year revelry, but  the equine species.  Last week, horses made news for  all sorts of reasons  and most of it was uncomfortable  reading or viewing. The most disturbing concerned a horse  called Its My Style, said to be a docile horse with the  Kolkata Mounted Police (KMP). The poor beast bleeding from  an injury, bolted over the AJC Road flyover after throwing  off her rider.  Its a double tragedy, for horse  and rider, but arent they both victims of a system whose  sun should have set with the Raj? The KMP, a second report  alleges, is under-staffed or rather, under-horsed. With  the result that even sick horses are forced out on parade.  Of course, we can all understand that these imposing beasts  tower over football and cricket fans who might otherwise  go berserk. But shouldnt there, in this day and age, be  other, more practical, methods of controlling crowds?  The right night Recently, ghazal moghul  Jagjit Singh sang love songs at The Taj Bengal for a chilling  cause. With one lakh women being sold into the flesh trade  in India every year, the action taken by the NGO Apne Aap  Women Worldwide, is timely. Started a year ago by Emmy-winning  documentary-maker Ruchira Gupta, its mission is to end trafficking  of women and children and to assist those who are trapped  in the gross industry of selling their bodies. There was no missing the irony.  Jagjit Singhs immortal love songs resounded during an evening  meant to end man-woman relationships where love has no place.  Corporates, diplomats and activists came together to try  and prevent girls at risk in Topsia from being trafficked.  The gathering included the consul-generals of the United  States of America and Nepal, film stars Arjun Chakraborty  and wife Nilanjana, Rupa Ganguly and painter Wasim Kapoor.  Calcutta seemed to revel in one of the first cool evenings  this year with an assortment of jaamevars.  Maiden victory True to Calcuttas spirit, two  of its most celebrated clubs, the Tolly and CC amp;FC have  this friendly tradition of playing each other once a year  at golf  at the Tolly  and cricket at the CC amp;FC. The  tradition is even more heartening since many participants  are members of both clubs and have to decide their loyalties  for this match, which is then played with feisty spirit.  Showing some consideration, CC amp;FC  is known to play its Saturday side. The 25-over match is  always, but always, keenly fought. Last week, Tolly turned  history on its head by walking away with the honours, beating  CC amp;FC at its own game. Tollys 176 in 24 overs and 5  deliveries was helped by the spirited chip-ins from the  captain, Deb Mukherjee, Calcuttas super cop Murlidharan,  golf pro Inderjit Bhalotia, Arunava Chakravarti, Kiran Desai  of Tata Tea and Navendu Mathur. CCFCs 176 runs in 25 overs  came with good help from Subroto Das and Sunny Puri while  Abhijeet Mazumdar captained. Sorely missed on the Tolly  team were Ashok Malhotra, Ranadip Moitra and Joydeep Mukherjee.  The smallest party  You dont have to take a survey  to guess the most common question for December. Its the  perennial, Whatre you doing on New Years Eve? If Im  honest, left to myself, the answer would be, Nothing. Of course, nothing doesnt mean  an absence of things to do and be done. What I really mean  is that were staying home. If thats a surprising answer,  consider this: New Years Eve parties are festive, and they  can be great fun, but dont you sometimes catch yourself  thinking youd rather be elsewhere? Dont you sometimes  think, is there more fun happening somewhere else? Is it  possible to be partied-out? Weve had five consecutive years  of big, big bashes. The Millennium shindig at a mansion  in Scotland, two years in the Far East, and last year, a  blast at ITC Sonar Bangla, complete with sumptuous barbecue  and a cutting-edge fashion show. This year, the Born To Party club  will be throwing its bash at the ITC Sonar Bangla Sheraton  lawns, with a theme based on the movie, The Matrix.  The Tolly Club will be hosting its signature bash and so  will the Saturday Club and the RCGC and many many more  parties to the midnight hoot of steamers.  Id like to attend them all, but  since that would be crazy, this year, forget the hype, were  reverting to type. Just the two of us and a gourmet meal.  Six courses that neither of us has ever cooked before   three by me and three by my man. There might be some mistakes,  but I know therell also be some wondrous winners. Add some  fine wine, champagne at midnight, beeswax candles, dressing  up just for each other, and you have a great evening.  Jagjit Singh performs  at The Taj Bengal  Just do it So whats the second-most common  question to be heard this month ? You got it: Whats your  New Years resolution? But hey, put the New Year on hold.  Before the old one slips out, and the new one comes trumpeting  in, there are things I have to do this year.  Like, catching up on Kevin Spaceys  weird thriller movie, The Life of David Gale; reaching  for the book Ive been meaning to start for a while, Plato  Not Prozac; listening to Alicia Keys latest album.  And making more time for my best friend. Because thats  what happens  the year sneaks away, almost unnoticed and  there is so much still to do. And dont you just hate to  leave so much undone this year and burden the next with  all that extra baggage. Time management would be among  the toppers on my list. Investment in relationships would  be another. Making the effort to keep in touch with old  friends. Just one call a week to someone whos slipped off  the speed dial on my cell phone might make a difference  to both our lives.  And heres one that my mentor  laid on me: make time to do something for somebody less  fortunate. A thing that is its own reward. To paraphrase  Nike  Just do it.

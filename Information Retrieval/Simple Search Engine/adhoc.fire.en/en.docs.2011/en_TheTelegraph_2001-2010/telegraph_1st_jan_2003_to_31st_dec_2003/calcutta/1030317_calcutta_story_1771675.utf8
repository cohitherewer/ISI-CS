 Monday, March 17, 2003 				 A ray of hope
																								Lead kindly light, amid the encircling gloom/ Lead Thou me on!/ The night is dark, and I am far from home / Lead Thou me on!  (Hymn)																								When a tired and bruised soul seeks shelter and comfort, he/she turns to the Almighty for help. But what about those children of a lesser God who have been deprived by the Creator? They suffer mutely for no fault of theirs. Their parents see their bundles of joy and dreams wither silently in front of their eyes. Is it because no help is forthcoming from a society that rejects anyone who refuses to toe the pre-ordained pattern of behaviour set by it? But then, Light breaks where no sun shines; / Where no sea runs, the waters of the heart/ Push in their tides (Dylan Thomas). This is evident at the ongoing exhibition of paintings made by differently abled children of Defence personnel. Their creativity has been given the right direction by the sincere members of the Eastern Command Army Wives Welfare Association who have set up Asha School. The exhibition is an eye-opener for all and exemplifies that no sincere effort goes unrewarded.																								When: Till March 21; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

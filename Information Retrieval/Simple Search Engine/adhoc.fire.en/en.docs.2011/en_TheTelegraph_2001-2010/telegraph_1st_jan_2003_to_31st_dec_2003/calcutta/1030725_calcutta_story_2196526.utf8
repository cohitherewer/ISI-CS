The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, July 25, 2003  Of any face, from any place
 Greek to Gujarati, Aloke Thakore  has been presented every opportunity to seize a descent, and  found himself hopelessly unequal to the task The journalist sized me up, a  rather voluminous task, took a close look at what a friend  in advertising had described as my A-4 size business card,  shifted quick glances between my face and my name, and,  setting his large frame down, rattled: You must be having  a business in Calcutta, must be staying in Bhowanipore,  so what place do you come from in Gujarat? I said something about not being  from Bhowanipore, of being a diaspora long before the word  was heard east of the Jordan, of not all Gujaratis being  businessmen, of having my family origins in north Gujarat.  The prabasi Bangali was not convinced. His cultural  geography refusing to slot me anyplace and anytime else,  we moved to talking shop about violence, newspapers and  reporting. A few hours later, his friend  dropped in and enquired from which part of Gujarat I belonged.  I tried Mehasana, the district in north Gujarat, and was  promptly told how I mixed the shrewdness of the region with  the intellectual inclinations of Bengal. Intoxicated with  this heady mix and knowing all too well the pretensions  of people east of the Hooghly, I had barely become comfortable  with the presence of this friend when he, apparently now  convinced that I was betraying sensibilities other than  what he had predicted, asked me if I was a Bhramakshatriya.  I replied that I was not and in  fact if caste characteristics was indeed what he was after,  then I was a Nagar. With his small eyes shining through  oversized glasses that sat clumsily below a bald pate he  exclaimed that he should not have mixed the Greek descent  that was so obvious in me. Reconciling my pint-sized self  with the thoughts of having descended from warriors engaged  in bloody battle with Xerxes brought me close to schizophrenia.  Seeing the symptoms of the identity  conflict with the ease of an experienced phrenologist, the  friend comforted me with the information that all this confusion  was to be attributed to Chanakya. It was he who had gotten  the Greek women that Seleucus brought to marry members of  all the four castes. I wanted to be reassured and was almost  tempted to ask if he was present at the site of this miscegenation.  I refrained. I knew I would never be pilloried as a foreigner  and could still aspire to the highest seats in the land,  all the while knowing that there was still some foreign  blood in me! But was he right about these Greek  nurturers? I remembered the university orientation many  moons ago in Chicago when a mathematician had come right  up to me and with a tug at my elbow launched into what sounded  like fluent Portuguese. Could it just be that it was not  after all Greece, the cradle of everything, but distant  Portugal where my Ur-mother was buried?  How could I as a self-respecting  Calcuttan live with the thought that it was not the Greeks,  but the Portuguese whom I would call cater-cousins? And  what of that Nairobi-born Gujarati who claimed to be from  Vadodara and who had told my friend with a gesture towards  me that he could bring his non-Indian friends along for  the Diwali night. I thought you are from Italy, he remarked  later. No. They were wrong. I was a Brahmo,  a true-blue one who lived less than a yojan from  where Maharshi Debendranath meditated. And had I not been  assured as much by the mother of a middle-aged spinster  after she had heard me render Akash bhora surjyo tara  in, what she said was, the deepest baritone the other side  of river Kansas. I had merely complemented her daughter  on a rather spirited dance performance. It must have taken  a lot of work and energy at that age to dance to Sheeter  hava laglo nachon amlokir eyi dale-dale. She had walked up and said that  my large forehead, which, if truth be told, was not large  but an unending one, was the unmistakable family resemblance.  Perplexed, I had asked which family. With the coy, obsequious  manner of a prospecting mother she had pointed out the Tagores.  But all it took were a few indiscreet queries and all my  hopes for chhanar dalna, sukto and dal had  disappeared like effervescence over Kansas. The enquiries  had apparently revealed that beneath that characteristic  forehead hid a non-Bengali brain. But what of the beard,  that unmistakable commonness between any two Brahmo faces  left fallow, I had almost protested under my breath thinking  of dalna, be assured not the daughter? But it was later that I realised  that if there was a family resemblance that my facial hair  had it was not to the Brahmo, but the Hasidic. On Rosh Hashanah  day as I trudged down the Library Mall, a young Hasidic  boy came up and with greetings presented me the flowers.  He must have seen the slight amused look for he asked: You  are a Jew, arent you? In that one moment, my head spun  as I tried to inherit all the intellectual capital of the  race from its Marx to its Einstein and then stillness came  over me, numbing my faculties and I swallowed my saliva  down into the trachea, coughed and returned the flower,  inheritance and all. From the Greeks to the Gujaratis,  I have been presented every opportunity to seize a descent,  an inheritance, and I have found myself hopelessly unequal  to the task. After muttering some protests about being from  one place or the other, I wonder what happens to me when  in a somnolent state I announce that I am from Calcutta. But once back in the city, who  dare question me, who ask me for my origins? Is it not written  on my characteristic jaw, nose, forehead, gait, beard, mien,  pout and paunch?  Fie on that man on Tuesday last  who as I entered New Market slid up to me and asked: Exchange  sir, good rates, handicrafts.

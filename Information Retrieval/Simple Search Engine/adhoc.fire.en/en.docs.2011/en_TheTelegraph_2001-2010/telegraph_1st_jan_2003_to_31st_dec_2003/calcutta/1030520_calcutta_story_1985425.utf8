The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, May 20, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Cher. You may be touchy  about certain issues. Try not to lose your temper while  dealing with people in high positions. You dont like being  tied down by routine. The year marks growth and prosperity.  You may be dragged into controversies.  Kusum  Bhandari

		 Tanusree DasTanusree Das																									Here aint trying to rival the Big B. She is quite happy taking it a day at a time, while shining in her many chosen areas of interest. Dont believe her friends who call her Abby as an affectionate, smiling insult meaning abnormal!																									And theres proof enough of that. Just ask the gang at Padatik, the cultural centre where she has been active as a teacher for years. But her talent can be spotted way back when this 23-year-old was in Class VIII, at St Augustines Day School, Barrackpore. Thats when she was adjudged the best athlete, as well as winning laurels for singing. The next year, she bettered this by including an award for best actress in an inter-school drama competition. The house captain shifted school for HS, and Sri Shikshayatan saw her continued participation.																									Shone through at Tanus next academic stop: Gokhale College where she pursued a degree in English. She was one of the thrilled participants of a workshop conducted by Gautam Haldar of Nandikar. It resulted in a play, Shadamata Meye, which travelled all the way to the National Drama Festival, New Delhi. Despite a lack of formal training, our gal has been involved with Padatik since 2001. She has played an interesting role in a comedy, entitled Choo Mantar, and has taken part in a workshop conducted by Elan, a Welsh group, in collaboration with Seagull Foundation and the British Council, ending in a performance montage Shovabazar 36.																									For other arts enthusiasts, did this girl. Answering the multi-tasking mantra, this first-year masters student of English at Calcutta University wrote and directed a short play for the junior theatre wing of Padatik, called Kandogyan. She has even put on trainers shoes for a workshop at Birla High School, writing and directing a play for the boys. Now, she is busy directing her peers, having just concluded her role as director in Zoo Story, staged by Theatrecians on October 30.																									Is what this Virgo is looking forward to. Tanushree has no plans of putting away her books after completing her MA, and is thinking about a future as a professor.

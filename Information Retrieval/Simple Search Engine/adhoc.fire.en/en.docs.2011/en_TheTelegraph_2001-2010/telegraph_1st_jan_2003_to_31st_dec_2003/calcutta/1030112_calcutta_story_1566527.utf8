 OUR CORRESPONDENT IN DURGAPUR																								The power situation in the state is looking up and Bengal is even earning revenue by selling 500 MW to other states every month. 																								This was stated by power minister Mrinal Banerjee at a seminar organised in Durgapur jointly by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and the Asansol Durgapur Development Authority (ADDA). 																								The power situation, he said, had improved especially after the signing of papers related to the commissioning of the fourth and fifth units of the Bakreswar thermal power plant with the government of Japan. A capital investment of Rs 1,600 crore would be required to commission the units, Banerjee added.																								The minister also expressed satisfaction at the revenue collection by the West Bengal State Electricity Board. Collection has increased by about Rs 100 crore a month compared to that two years ago, he pointed out. 																								In the current year, the collection has been more than Rs 3,100 crore, while the corresponding figure in 1997-98 was Rs 1,670 crore.

																								As part of Nandikars on-going 20th National Theatre Festival, Natrang, Jammu, presents Balwant Thakurs play based on a Dogri folk tale. A newly-wed bride, on her way up a hill to her in-laws house with the wedding party, feels very thirsty and asks for water, but none pays heed to her pleas. As the group reaches atop the hill, the bride is exhaused. The source of water is miles deep down, and nobody is willing to venture and fetch water for her. A youth volunteers to go down. Now the pompous bridegroom challenges the youth and says if he succeeds in getting water for her at one go, the dulhan will be given to him. The young man rushes down and brings water, but falls dead out of sheer exhaustion. Now the dulhan refuses to go ahead with the wedding party, as she declares she is now a widow. The bridegrooms pleas fail to move her. Instead, she gives Ghumayee, sanctifying the significance of human relationships rather than of the bonds of a wedding ceremony. The play is conceptualised, scripted, designed and directed by Balwant Thakur.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

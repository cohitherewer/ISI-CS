																																																																																		Alarmed at the rising incidence of their member franchisees defecting to other service providers, leaving behind huge outstandings, the 30-odd cable TV master control rooms (MCRs) of Calcutta have joined hands to bring the defaulters to book. In a meeting attended by representatives of 27 city MCRs on Monday, it was decided that such quot;rogue operators quot; wont be allowed to go scot-free any more. The MCR cartel decreed that in case a cableman crosses over to another multi-system operator (MSO) without clearing his dues to the master control room concerned, the MSO quot;sheltering quot; the defaulter, will be asked to either clear his outstandings to the pay broadcasters, or disconnect the defaulter. quot;If the MSO refuses to oblige, not only the affected master control room, but also all others would stop payment to their respective umbrella MSOs in sympathy, quot; said a member of the MCR alliance. The coalition will inform all the three MSOs in the city and the pay channels about its decision within three days.

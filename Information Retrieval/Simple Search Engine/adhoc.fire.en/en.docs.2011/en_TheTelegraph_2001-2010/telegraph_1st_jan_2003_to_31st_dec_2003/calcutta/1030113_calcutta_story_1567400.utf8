The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, January 13, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The tank on the Brigade Parade Ground, opposite Fort William, is in a sorry state. It seems as if the value of the tank, once a part of our history, is nothing more than scrap now. Earlier, the machine had a wire enclosure. It wont be surprising if some of its parts go missing. Why is the government so callous about protecting an important piece of our heritage? 				 																																									Sumant Poddar,				 																																									Kyd Street.				 																																									The government should consider constructing a footbridge over Strand Road, near Fairlie Place. The rush of vehicles makes it very unsafe for pedestrians to cross the road.				 																																									Nilesh Gattani,				 																																									Cossipore Road.

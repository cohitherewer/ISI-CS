The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, March 15, 2003 				 Light rain in season of Norwesters
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Dark clouds hung over Calcutta and its suburbs on Friday, with some parts receiving light rain. The weatherman predicted a cloudy sky on Saturday, with the chance of a few light showers.																								The day remained pleasant, with the maximum temperature touching 30.6 degree Celsius, three degrees below normal.																								Deputy director-general of the Alipore regional meteorological centre R.N. Goldar said a black mass of drifting thunderclouds was visible over Nadia on Friday afternoon, that indicated heavy rain in the city and its adjoining areas. But the raincloud drifted across to Bangladesh. So, there is nothing to fret about and we dont expect heavy rain in the city immediately. All eyes are, however, on the radar, he added. 																								Goldar attributed the cloudy sky to a trough of low pressure that is spread from Vidarbha to south Bengal, across Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. In addition, moisture-laden south-westerly winds were blowing from the Bay of Bengal. This condition has been causing the development of clouds since Thursday, an official said.																								The Met office said the season of Norwesters had set in and occasional storms and showers were likely till next month. The city received its first Norwester on Wednesday.																								The Norwester brought the day temperature down. If there are a few more over the next few days, the temperature will continue to remain pleasant, said a weather office spokesperson.

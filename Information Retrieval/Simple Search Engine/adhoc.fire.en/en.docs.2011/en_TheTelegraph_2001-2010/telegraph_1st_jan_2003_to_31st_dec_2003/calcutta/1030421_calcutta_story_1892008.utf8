 Monday, April 21, 2003 				 Depression over sons health led to suicide bid 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A relative of the former bank employee from Durgapur, who had attempted suicide with his family in a lodge near Sealdah on Saturday morning, said Satya Chatterjee was an employee of UCO Bank. 																								Satya, 58, and his wife Chhaya had taken poison along with their son, Deepak, because they were unable to meet the cost of treating the son, who was deranged and physically handicapped. Deepak died after consuming poison.																								Satya took voluntary retirement a year-and-a-half ago so that he could lay his hands on a large sum of money necessary for Deepaks treatment. Satyas relative, Subhas Ghoshal, who came from Durgapur after the couple was admitted to hospital, said: Deepak would come to Calcutta for treatment once a month along with his parents. 																								The family had spent several lakhs on Deepaks treatment and it left them bankrupt. Satya became a victim of depression after he realised that the chances of his son ever recovering were remote, said an officer of Muchipara police station, close to the lodge. Police found that though they would come to the city once a month, it was the first time that they stayed in the lodge. Deepaks father told the manager that he would check out on Saturday morning. He bought food from outside on Friday night. We suspect he poisoned it, said the officer.																								Police found Deepak dead and his parents writhing in pain in the lodge on Saturday morning. Local police admitted the couple to the NRS Hospital, where their condition was stated to be critical even 24 hours after admission. The couple remained unconscious till Sunday night.																								Their relatives said doctors did not attend to the couple till 5 pm on Saturday. Doctors should have paid a visit, as their condition is critical. A nurse told me that since it was Sunday, one doctor would visit the ward, said Subhas Ghoshal. Deepaks body was handed over to his relatives on Sunday afternoon.																								Deepak, said to be mentally deranged, had attempted suicide 10 years ago by jumping off the rooftop of their Durgapur quarters. He received serious injuries on his right leg and became handicapped, said Zulfiquar Hasan, deputy commissioner of police, central division.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Crimelord Rashid Alam, better known as Gabbar, was sentenced to life behind bars by a city court on Wednesday for attacking policemen in 1996. Magistrate P.S. Banerjee of the city sessions court (third bench) also slapped on him a fine of Rs 1,000 and another one-year jail term.																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said the punishment was a rare victory for the force. No other extortionist has been served a life term in the recent past, he added. Apart from the attack on policemen, there are 20 other cases, including murder, attempt to murder and extortion, pending against Gabbar.																								The 33-year-old criminal stepped into the world of crime in 1992. His high-profile lifestyle, combining days of dare and nights of revelry, quickly earned him a prominent place in the city underworld. 																								On July 25, 1996, Gabbar and his associates had attacked a police picket at the intersection of Royd Street and Park Lane. He hurled bombs and fired at the policemen. Constable Rajendra Murmu was seriously injured. We arrested Gabbar a month after the attack and booked him for attempt to murder, added Mitra.																								Gabbar had been on the run for the past few years. Police had initiated an extensive search for him following the murder of Sanjib Julka, alias Bunty, on May 22, 2001. The crimelord was rounded up from a club in Phoolbagan last year during a late night swoop.

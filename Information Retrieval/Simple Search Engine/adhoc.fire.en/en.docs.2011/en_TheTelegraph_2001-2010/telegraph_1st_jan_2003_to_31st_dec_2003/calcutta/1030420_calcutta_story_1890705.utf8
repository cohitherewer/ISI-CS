 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 35-year-old handicapped man was found dead and his ageing parents writhing in pain in a lodge near Sealdah on Saturday morning. The couple is now fighting for life in a city hospital and has been kept under observation for 36 hours.																								Preliminary investigations reveal that the three had attempted suicide by consuming poison. However, no suicide note has been found in the room.																								The couple, 58-year-old Satya Chatterjee and Chhaya, had come to the city from Durgapur two days ago for their son Deepaks treatment. They had rented a room at a lodge in the Muchipara police station area last Thursday. Chatterjee had told the lodge manager that he would check out on Saturday morning, said Zulfiquar Hasan, deputy commissioner of police, central division.																								The couple was reportedly depressed. Apparently, the sons medical report brought some bad news. On Saturday, when the family did not come out till around 11.30 am, an employee of the lodge knocked on the door. When there was no response, the youth peered through the keyhole and saw the couple lying on the floor, Hasan said.																								The Muchipara police broke open the door and rushed the two to Nilratan Sirkar Medical College and Hospital. We have sent Deepaks body for a post-mortem, said an official.																								n Six held: Six persons were arrested late on Friday on charges of duping the New Alipore branch of Allahabad Bank. Police said they had taken personal loan from the bank by submitting forged documents.

D  Deforestation will cause devastation 																								An extract from a list of sentences prepared by former green bench judge of Calcutta High Court Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee to create awareness about environmental pollution among children.																								Banerjee, the chairman of the environment appellate authority, has set up a school in Salt Lake for children aged two to five years. They will be taught the basics of environment, for which Banerjee has drawn up a list of sentences starting with the 26 alphabets. 																								Our move is aimed at making children aware of the environment and the hazards of pollution. Though the subject is taught in school and college, I think it is more essential to start at the nursery level, Banerjee said on Saturday.																								Vice-chancellor of Visva Bharati Sujit Basu, who inaugurated the school in the presence of Salt Lake municipality chairman Dilip Gupta, appreciated the move.

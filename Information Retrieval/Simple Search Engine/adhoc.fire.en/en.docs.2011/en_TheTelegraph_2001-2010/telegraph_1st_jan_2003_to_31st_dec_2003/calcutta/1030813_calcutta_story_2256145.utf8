 SOUMITRA DAS				 	 Some of the sculptural toys of Sukumar Dutta on display at the exhibition, Recent Works, that opened at CIMA Gallery on Tuesday evening. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								The sculptural toys of Sukumar Dutta come as a big surprise at the exhibition, Recent Works, that opened at CIMA Gallery on Tuesday evening. The 70-year-old Dutta clothes wire frames with fabric and paper to create a skin that he stitches together to create folkloric figures of Ganesha, a tiger, or large faces as whimsical as some of Paul Klees works. One figure is disconcertingly faceless. Without anything arty about them the colourful figures bear a distinct resemblance to patchwork quilts and look quite as vibrant.																								The 10 artists whose works are on display at the exhibition are not big names. However, the works of some of them have a certain freshness about them. 																								Seema Ghurayya, for example, does abstract oil paintings where various almost invisible geometric plains with subtle gradations of tone  very pallid buff on buff or grey on grey  overlap each other at the centre, creating a luminous surface. If one looks closely, one can detect certain markings, some seemingly with crayons. Ghurayya is from Bhopal. It would be interesting to find out how she has evolved as an artist. However, it must be admitted that her work produces a great sense of contemplative calm.																								Ketakee Roy Choudhury, who was trained at Santiniketan and has lived for years in the Kumaon hills, depicts nature in solitude, at times turbulent, at times peaceful. She exhibits glass paintings, which show a glacial-green stormy sea, a mist as heavy as a veil and a forest fire in molten colours. 																								They look almost as realistic as photographs, but for the eerie light that suffuses them and lends weight to the mist and the wave about to crash.																								Dilip Samanta does collages using paper, gauze, pages from newspapers and moulds. This he supplements with drawings. With a profusion of colours, the effect is playful. 																								Maya Burman, whose mother is French, has executed several large but delicate pen-and-ink drawings of women, both clothed and unclothed, reaching out to each other in idyllic settings. Before one jumps to conclusions, one should take a closer look to discover a couple of pretty boys in the crowd. A visual tease? Arunima Choudhurys ceramics on enamel are also very feminine. But her tiny dishes, with creepies and crawlies and a trickle of blood, are more interesting.																								Uday Mandal seems to have applied paint in a frenzied manner but impressions of figures emerge distinctly enough. Often, these are juxtaposed with images from what looks like fashion magazines. In spite of warm-to-bright colours, Swapan Bhandary has not shaken off his fascination with cubism. Mustak Khan Chowdhury and Sohini Dhar demonstrate the influence of two Bengal masters.

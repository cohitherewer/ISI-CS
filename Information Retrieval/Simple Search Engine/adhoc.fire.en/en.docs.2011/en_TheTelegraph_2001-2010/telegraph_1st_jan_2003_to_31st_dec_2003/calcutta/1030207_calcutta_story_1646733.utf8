 Friday, February 07, 2003 				 Fake OK tags on flight tickets
 A STAFF REPORTER																								CISF personnel manning the city airport claimed to have busted a racket of passengers travelling on tickets with fake confirmation slips. Over the past few weeks, half a dozen people have been detained and four arrested for trying to sneak into the aircraft with such tickets.																								There have been some significant arrests of a few people, who managed to enter the security area with tickets which had fake OK stickers on them. They were all arrested at the segregation counter. City-based travel agencies and even some airline staff are involved in the racket, said a senior CISF officer associated with the probe. We are now looking into their version, he added.																								The CISF, which has introduced special security measures, is discussing the matter with the Airports Authority of India for a thorough probe. 																								The first of the series of arrests was made in December last year, when Santosh Kumar was travelling to Bangkok on a fake ticket. Kumar told CISF personnel near the departure zone that he should be let in on the strength of his OK ticket. But a quick scrutiny revealed that the confirmation sticker on his ticket was fake. He was handed over to the police.																								A few weeks later, Md Sohail and Gurmeet Singh, both Bangkok-bound, were similarly caught with fake OK tags on their tickets. They revealed the names of some agents, who had the right contacts with some airlines staff as well. 																								In some cases, CISF officers say they got hold of printouts of fake OK labels. A passenger was given these by agents to paste on his ticket and then board a flight.

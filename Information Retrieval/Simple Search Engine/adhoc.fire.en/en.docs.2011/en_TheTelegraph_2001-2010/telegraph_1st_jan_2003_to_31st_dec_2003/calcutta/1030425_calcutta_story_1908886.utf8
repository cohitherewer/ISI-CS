The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, April 25, 2003 				 Elvis, the undisputed king of rock
																								Nothing really affected me until Elvis, said John Lennon. The Beatles were Elvis Aron Presleys biggest fans! He was a golden voiced country Adonis with a lock of hair falling on his brow and a curl to his lips. When he sang Heartbreak hotel or Dont be cruel hed swivel his hips and twitch his legs, and when he crooned Love me tender, the girls would swoon. The sexy physicality of Presleys explosive performances brought the forbidden into the open for teens in the 1950s. His singing style bore the unmistakable stamp of black rhythm and blues. By carrying its message to a national audience, he changed popular music for ever. This prolific singer had the greatest number of consecutive hits, more gold and platinum records than any other performer and spent more weeks at the top of the charts than any other artiste. By the end of the 50s he had 14 consecutive million sellers (of his eventual 79) and had begun making Hollywood B-grade movies such as Jailhouse Rock  charging $ 1 million for each. When the end came, Presley had become one of the greatest stars of the 20th century. Mira and Daleep Kakkar (picture above) are making an audio-visual presentation on Elvis life and music with Sumit Roy rendering the songs.

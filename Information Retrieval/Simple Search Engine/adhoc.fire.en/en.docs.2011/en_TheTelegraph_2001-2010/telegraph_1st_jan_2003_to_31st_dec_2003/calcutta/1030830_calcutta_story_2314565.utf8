 Saturday, August 30, 2003 				 Court stays rail eviction
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The move to evict squatters by the railway tracks between Ballygunge and Lake Gardens, on the Sealdah-Budge Budge section, suffered a jolt following admittance of a petition by the Supreme Court filed by 150 shanty-dwellers of the area. The apex court, on August 25, admitted the petition and asked Eastern Railway not to evict the squatters till the disposal of the case.																								The squatters alleged that the railways had not served them an eviction notice, making the move illegal. Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, who moved the petition, said he had communicated the order to the railway authorities and the state government.																								This comes in the wake of a recent Calcutta High Court directive to the railways to ensure eviction of squatters within three weeks to clear the tracks for the Rabindra Sarobar flyover.

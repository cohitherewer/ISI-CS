The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, September 08, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The idea of setting up plastic bins on vital road crossings was an encouraging step on the part of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. But it does not seem to be concerned about cleaning the boxes. This prompts people to throw litter on the ground. 				 																																									Sumant Poddar,				 																																									Kyd Street.				 																																									While travelling towards the Brabourne Road flyover from Howrah bridge, I have noticed that police put up a no-entry sign on the right flank without any purpose. This puts pressure on the left flank and as a result it takes more than half-an-hour to reach BBD Bag, which is merely a kilometre from the flyover. 				 																																									B.L. Chandak,				 																																									Salkia.

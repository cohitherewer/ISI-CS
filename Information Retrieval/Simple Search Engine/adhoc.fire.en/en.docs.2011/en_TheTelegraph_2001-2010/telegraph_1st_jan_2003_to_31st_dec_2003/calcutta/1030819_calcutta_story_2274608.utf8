With the creation of the universe many forms of life originated on earth, culminating in Man, the most superior of all creatures. God endowed him with rationality that helped him rise above other creatures. However, man acquired darker and complex negative instincts: Kama (lust), Krodha (anger), Lobha (greed) , Moha (obsession), Mada (arrogance) and Matsarya (jealousy). These evils gave birth to impious acts and thus man, the supreme inhabitant of this universe, entered into a dark satanic world. Anubhavaamah means We feel. We, the human descendants, have inherited all these flaws, but it is within us to suppress and control our evil instincts and lead a pious life because a flaw can lead to a catastrophe. Through the various aspects of Manipuri dance, martial art movements and other art forms of Manipur, the many facets of human weaknesses have been portrayed in this ballet. Traditional Manipuri music, both classical and folk forms have been used extensively. The stories have been selected chronologically from epic, mythology and history. The story of Surpanakha illustrates the effects of Kama and Krodha, the ancient Greek myth of King Midas aptly demonstrates the consequences of Lobha and Moha and history proves how Mada and Matsarya paved the way for King Ashokas destruction when he tried to conquer Kalinga. Set to music by N.Tiken Singh, the concept and choreography is by Bimbavati, who also performs in the ballet (picture above).

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 Neuro unit languishes in apathy 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A decade ago, when it was founded by the government, the Bangur Institute of Neurology (BIN), on the state-run SSKM Hospital campus, was regarded as Bengals answer to the cutting-edge establishments in the South, especially Hyderabad and Chennai. The infrastructure and in-house expertise at BIN were considered among the very best in India.																								But a decade down the line, the scenario is different. The authorities pin the blame on the government, for ignoring the hospitals requirements in terms of modern equipment and manpower. 																								It is extremely sad that our hospital, despite being the only super centre for neurological diseases, has not shot into the limelight. The hospital has great potential, but very few people know about it and rush to other states. The government should have paid more attention to the hospitals requirements, said Bibhukalyani Das, head of department of neuroanaesthesiology and pain clinic, BIN.																								On the eve of the two-day national conference on Neuroanaesthesiology and Critical Care, starting Saturday, Das explained how the equipment broke down often and how BIN had been clamouring for better infrastructure, in terms of manpower and beds, without success. At present, BIN has 106 beds. 																								We also need a specialised course in neuroanaesthesia, Das added. Its a pity that people in West Bengal are ignorant about all neurological facilities, Das added.																								Director of medical education C.R. Maity said: Efforts are being made to upgrade the facilities at the institute and the government plans to introduce courses in the super-speciality subject of neuroanaesthesia.

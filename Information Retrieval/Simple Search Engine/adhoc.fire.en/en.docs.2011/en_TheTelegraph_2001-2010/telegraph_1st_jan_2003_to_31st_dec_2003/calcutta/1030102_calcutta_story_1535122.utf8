 Thursday, January 02, 2003 				 LPG-filling centre debut on Thursday
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The first LPG-filling centre for vehicles becomes operational from Thursday at Indian Oils Prince Service Station, on Prince Anwar Shah Road. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty will inaugurate the centre, in the presence of chief secretary S.N. Roy.																								Indian Oil officials said construction of 14 more such centres in and around the city is in progress and should be ready within four to six months.																								Fearing that the Supreme Court will soon issue a directive on converting petrol-run vehicles into LPG-driven ones, the state government has gone on overdrive to build infrastructure for the conversion process, including setting up LPG centres.																								Transport department officials said four major oil companies would build 43 LPG-filling centres in and around the city within six months. Prashant, joint secretary of the department, has been appointed nodal officer to monitor speedy construction of the filling centres. Ramalesh Das, Indian Oil general manager, is coordinating with all the oil companies.																								Setting up an LPG-filling centre is not as easy as constructing a petrol pump, because additional fire-prevention measures are required, as per the Indian Explosives Act. So, it is not possible to instal LPG machines at all petrol pumps. The filling stations have to dispense LPG exclusively and for that we need a chunk of land, Das said.

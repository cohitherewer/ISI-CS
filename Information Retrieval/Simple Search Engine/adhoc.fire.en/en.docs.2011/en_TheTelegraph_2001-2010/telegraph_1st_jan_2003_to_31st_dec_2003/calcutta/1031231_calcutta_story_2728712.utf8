 																											- Simple procedure at city hospital shows results within a month SUBHRO SAHA																								For 32-year-old Srimoyee, the tale of woe started three years after her wedding. All of a sudden, she noticed a remarkable change in her appetite. After a heavy breakfast of bread, butter, omelette and milk, she could hardly wait for lunch and gorged on a packet of biscuits in between. But despite her voracious appetite, she began to lose weight. Worse still, she was unable to conceive.																								Bouts of palpitation and unexplained sweating led her to a cardiologist, who first suspected thyrotoxicosis, a condition where the thyroid gland secretes an excess of hormones, namely T3 and T4. Located at the base of the neck, this butterfly-shaped gland regulates growth and maturation of tissues and controls a wide array of activities.																								Patients suffering from hyper-functioning of the thyroid present bizarre symptoms, like losing weight despite excellent or increased appetite, chronic loose motion, tremors, warm moist hands and palpitations, explains Debasish Chowdhury, head of the department, nuclear medicine, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.																								The multiple complications created by an overactive hyperthyroid gland make it almost impossible for female patients to conceive. At a later stage, the eyeballs protrude out of the sockets, a condition known as proptosis.																								For years, this condition has been treated with anti-thyroid medicines, which are linked to side-effects like bone marrow depression, greying and falling of hair, mouth ulcers Such medication cant be continued for long in most cases, and in later stages, the condition has to be managed by surgery or radioactive ablation, entailing huge expenditure and often post-operative complications.																								But now, with the remarkable progress of nuclear medicine, it is possible to provide complete cure to a large number of thyrotoxicosis patients with a single dose of radioactive iodine, Chowdhury declares. Known as I-131 therapy, it aims to normalise thyroid function. Even slightly hypothyroid status is acceptable to us, since it can be easily treated with exogenous thyroxine, which is cheap and can be continued for long without any side-effect.																								Done on a routine basis at Apollo Gleneagles, it is an amazingly simple outpatient procedure, completed within minutes. All that the patient needs to do is walk into the hospital, sip a few ml of the colourless liquid containing radioactive iodine, which tastes like water, and walk out to resume his/her daily activity. It acts only on the thyroid gland, with negligible radiation to other organs, says Chowdhury. Patients generally start feeling benefits of the therapy within a month, as symptoms like tremor, palpitation, anxiety, etc, improve.

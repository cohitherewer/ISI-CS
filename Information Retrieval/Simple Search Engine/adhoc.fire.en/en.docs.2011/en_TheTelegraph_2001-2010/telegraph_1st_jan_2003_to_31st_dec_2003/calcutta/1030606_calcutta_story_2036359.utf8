The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, June 06, 2003  Moksha through money
 Catering only to our acquisitive instincts  today, the world of pink gin and Proust has been banished  forever from Camac Street, says Soumitra Das  Burrabazar has changed Camac Street  beyond recognition. Airy bungalows and shaded sidewalks,  once the hallmarks of one of Calcuttas best addresses,  have given way to multi-storeyed office complexes and shopping  malls of amazing ugliness. Caught between the fervid flyover-building  activity at its AJC Bose Road end, and the feeding frenzy  of thousands of office-goers, who are compelled to buy the  hearty yet cheap meals that only kerbside vendors can serve  up, sleepy Camac Street has become Calcuttas upcoming  commercial hub.  Of late, British Council has moved  into this street from its Shakespeare Sarani landmark, and  it shares the squat L amp;T Chambers with Microsoft. Council  director Sujata Sen says of course she misses the garden  on the former premises, but she does appreciate the integrated  premises on this street. But like everybody else here,  what she minds most is the flooding of Camac Street for  three to four hours at a stretch after a heavy shower. Once  in use, the newest state secretariat built recently here,  will only compound the streets problems.  The bungalows of Camac Street  used to be few and far between. Three-fourths of each plot  used to be leafy and green. The bungalow occupied the rest.  Industry House, the first highrise that raised its head  way above the two-storyed norm of this neighbourhood in  the late Sixties, is the only new building with adequate  frontage. But further down the street, the more-recently-built  highrises leave less and even less open space in front.  The newest ones have forgotten to leave any at all. The space separating one highrise  from another is so limited, one wonders if this was done  to promote neighbourly feeling -- allowing the occupant  of one building to shake hands with his friend in the building  in the adjoining plot. This feeling of camaraderie between  two next-door buildings is taken to its logical conclusion  in the two leaning towers of Urbashi and Usha Kiran that  tilt their heads to such an extent that they actually hug  and kiss in mid-air. From isolated bungalows to cramped  highrises -- the density of population has shot up by leaps  and bounds here. Which is natural -- 10-12 times the earlier  floor area has been developed. But the corporation failed  to make corresponding investment in civic amenities. To  be fair, there has been no proportional rise in civic revenue  either. But what do occupants of highrises  do in the event of a fire? With little elbow space, fire  engines will never be able to squeeze in-between the towering  infernos. But nobody seems to be bothered  least of all  the occupants or landlords of these structures. And what if there is an earthquake?  Then these towers are bound to shake, rattle and roll.  The wide pavements of Camac Street,  the widest anywhere in the city, onceboasted coppiced borders.  Now the barren pavements are used for parking, lots for  that purpose being absent here. Reliance of death trap fame shares  Azimganj House with a giant toyshop.  The culture of greed that has  beset this street is seen at its worst in this toyshop.  Of course, one can call it a mere shop only at the risk  of disregarding its enormous proportions and the mind-boggling  variety of its stock-in-trade. It is actually a glitzy mall  with a mezzanine floor. With its profusion of toys of every  description, size, shape and colour stuffed in all imaginable  nooks and crannies, it is every childs fantasy come  true. But it is not for every child. Without money to burn  you feel like a beggar here. Hordes of brats holding talkathons  on their mobile phones descend on this mall with their doting  parents in tow. Picking and choosing being inconceivable  to them, they grab whatever comes their way. They know for  sure that mama or papa will pay up without demur. This is  the nursery school of conspicuous consumption. But Calcutta is a city of paradoxes.  White-capped Nizam Palace soars proudly above the flyover.  From the terrace of any highrise clumps of trees are still  visible. Industry House is flanked by two bungalows cocooned  by foliage. No 9 looks unchanged from without. But it was  partly reconstructed in 1974. A shrine has come up behind  the main building. The marble was torn off the floor of  a large hall and replaced with mosaic tiles. The hall is  an office now, its walls lined with legal tomes. Rajendra  Kumar Jain, 50, estate manager of sorts, is busy working  at his computer. He says the house originally belonged to  the Lahas. In 1961, businessmen who owned collieries in  Raniganj, purchased the house. Both the buildings at Number 10  have steadfastly resisted change, though the one in the  rear looks sad and shabby. The only resident of the latter  is Leela Dasgupta in her 70s. She lives alone with her maids  in one of the impossibly large flats, eroded by age.  This invaluable property used  to belong till the Eighties to Gerald Neil Craig, a man  who led a charmed life. Besides being one of the richest  landlords of Calcutta, he was a walking dictionary on Western  classical music, besides being the music critic of an English  daily in the early Eighties. Craig inhabited the recherch  world associated with pink gin and Proust. A pianist himself,  he kept open house on Thursdays, when drinks were served  by liveried bearers. Craig died at 72 in October, 1985.  Of late, the executor of his will, Sammy Sadka, has been  living in Craigs flat. Jewish like his friend Craig, Sadka  lies alone in bed after his recent illness, immersed in  an ocean of ancient documents that smother the floor and  the furniture, and like parasites, seem to have a life of  their own. He is a deep-sea diver coming  up with precious nuggets of memory. At 83, he speaks with  relish about tennis ace Gussy Moran of black lace panties  fame when she was invited to South Club, and the British  Jewish bomb Suzy Sofa, whose horse Winged Tiger had won  the Viceroys Cup. She lived in that flat before Craig.  Sagda casts a searching sidelong glance, and with his aquiline  nose tilted in the right angle, he looks disconcertingly  like John Gielgud.

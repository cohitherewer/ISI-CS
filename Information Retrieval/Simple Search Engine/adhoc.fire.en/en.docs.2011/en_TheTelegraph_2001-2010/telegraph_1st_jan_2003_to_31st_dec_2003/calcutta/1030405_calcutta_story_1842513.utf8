 Saturday, April 05, 2003 				 Clash of wills over canal clean-up silt
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A row has broken out between the CPM and Congress commissioners of South Dum Dum Municipality over silt from the Beleghata canal, now being excavated, being dumped in the grounds of a school in Bangur. The Congress commissioners claim the silt will pollute the locality. 																								The municipality has ordered an inquiry into the dumping. Municipality chairman Sreehir Bhattacharjee told Metro on Friday that he had received complaints from some Congress commissioners and had ordered an inquiry. Personally, though, I dont think the silt will harm the environment or pollute the locality. I have instructed my officials to conduct chemical tests and check if there is any possibility of pollution, he added.																								Congress commissioner Mriganka Bhattacharjee, on the other hand, alleged that residents of the area and sportspersons, who use the school grounds for outdoor games, had lodged several complaints with him about the dumping of silt for the last two weeks. The residents held a meeting on Friday night and decided to mobilise public opinion to protest the incident.

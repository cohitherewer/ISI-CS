The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, November 28, 2003  Exit the Dragon, enter CIT
 The Chinese have all but receded into  the background in the Tiretta Bazar and Chhattawala Gali area  in the heart of the city, says Soumitra Das In the fifties and Sixties, when  I was in school, a particular teacher, exasperated with  a student, would scream in despair that the errant kid should  be banished to Chhattawala Gali. For this Anglo-Indian teacher  this alley was perhaps like the lowest pit of hell to which  the wicked, irrespective of caste, were relegated. And a  fate worse than this was unimaginable for a man so obsessed  with colour and class. That, for me, was the first intimation  of the Galis existence. Years later I discovered that  Chhattawala Gali was opposite the Lalbazar police headquarters  right next to the famous musical instruments shops of Lower  Chitupur as Rabindra Sarani was called. I expected to see  the Chinese there, but they were all over central Calcutta  and in this neighbourhood in particular. After the Chinese aggression in  1962, and subsequent humiliation and harassment of the Chinese  population in Calcutta, many had chosen to leave this country.  Chinatown was virtually wiped out after the Calcutta Improvement  Trust (CIT), Haussmann-like, mowed down the shantytown in  Sun Yatsen Street, Blackburn Lane and Phears Lane in the  1963-64. A large synagogue, we are told, had fallen victim  to the CITs reformatory zeal. After India Exchange Place  Extension, as New CIT Road has been rechristened, was laid  out, and Sun Yatsen Street was extended the lanes were dissected.  Hence the Chhattawala Gali addresses have clung on to both  Kamar Hotel and Tota Shah Imambara, though they both face  the new road. The large playground near Nanking (22 Blackburn  Lane) restaurant has vanished, and Blackburn Lane has been  dismembered. The Zonal Training Institute (East Zone) is  saddled with three street names 7 Lu Hsun Sarani, New CIT  Road, Tiretti Bazar Street. Not being able to put up with  arm-twisting by unionised labour most Chinese owners have  abandoned the famous shoe shops of Bentinck Street. They  are Chinese only in name. Literally. Now the only visible  relics of that once self-contained and self-supporting Chinatown  veiled in the mystery of gambling and opium dens are the  Sea Ip Church next to the CIT building, and even more prominent   once grand, now disreputable Nanking restaurant, nestled  between the two wings of the Telephone Kendra building. So when the sweepers employed  at Lalbazar, who live, cook, wash, chat and play games of  carrom and thrive in Chattawala Gali, said a Yahudi family  lived inside what seemed little better than a dump of polythene  sacks filled with bottles, I couldnt believe my ears. Of  course, years ago the Jewish people prospered in the neighbourhoods  of central Calcutta and street names and synagogues vouch  for it. But hadnt they started leaving for Israel or for  greener pastures in the Forties? Then a large boy appeared at the  point where the lane narrows into a pathway barely wide  enough to allow a single person to walk through without  soiling his trousers in the permanent trickle of urine at  one edge. The young man nodded as a gesture of confirmation  when I asked him if a Jewish family lived inside the dark  passage. The sweepers live in tiny rooms on the groundfloor.  A man, seemingly without a care in the world, watches news  on a colour TV set. A woman cooks dinner on a chula.  The entrance is darker and leads into a courtyard surrounded  by arches and columns. But every inch of all that space  has been turned into a dump. Large industries may have said  goodbye to Bengal but junk-based ones such as the kabadiwalas  grow and grow. The ground floors of most double-storey houses  in this alley are factories for washing and recycling used  bottles, and signboards pitch for the ghee and condiment  containers on sale here in bulk. Hence the sacksful of bottles.  Hence the dumps. The terrace is hemmed in by neighbouring  houses. Out of the blue, a few notes are played on a harmonium.  Later, I found a musical instruments shop downstairs run  by an enterprising Bengali named Rabin Das. The modi  (grocery) shop closer to B.B. Ganguly Street belongs to  a Bengali. Near 50 now, Samar Chandra De comes all the way  from Sodepur everyday. He has been commuting since the 70s  when his father was in charge. The large boy introduces me to  his mother Emma Malhotra, in salwar kameez and sporting  a nose pin. The large room is bare save a big coach. Malhotra  is her married name. Her grandfather Jeremiah, a Baghdadi  Jew, had come to Calcutta and they have lived here for three  generations. Two or three Jewish families used to be her  neighbours. They got the house on lifelong lease from a  Bengali landlord (the Ghoshals). It is only of late that  the scheduled castes have blocked the passage, says Mrs  Malhotra, a teacher by profession. Her two sons Jeetu and  Amit are waiting to finish their education. Then they will  leave for Israel, like the rest of her family. There are other Bengali landlords  here. The Seal family has ruled the roost in this Sino bastion  for three generations. Some family members are in the transport  business and huge lumbering trucks parked in the gali  hardly leave any elbow room for passersby. The owner of  Tung Nam eatery was nice enough to introduce me to Janaki  Seal, 63, of that family. He says the opium dens have disappeared.  Opium has been replaced by hooch right under the nose of  the police. One finds drunkards spreadeagled in the alleyways  at all hours of the day. Chinese labourers of shoe shops  were their tenants. Life was tough for the Chinese. When  I was a little boy my father would send me everyday to collect  rent from them. Or else they would blow it up on opiates,  says Seal. A venerable Chinese gentleman  with a walking stick sits in a chair in front of his house  next to Fook Chong eatery. Before Sun Yatsen Street was  extended the lane was very very narrow. There was no tall  house. There used to be hundreds of tiled (khola chaal)  huts, he says in pidgin Hindi, indicating with his hand  a huge swathe of land. From outside, his house is a block  of cement with holes for windows. The first and only floor  is crowded with airless cubby holes where the upcountry  Hindu and the Chinese are neighbours. The wooden beams are  ancient. The courtyard is cluttered with washing on a large  water reservoir. A fierce black dog stands guard. This house  had seen better days but there is no lack of creature comforts.  Some rooms are air-conditioned. The new landlords young  granddaughters surf the Net. The cupboards in their room  are plastered with the posters and pictures of pop stars.  The family owns a large Chinese provisions store. This used to be the property of  the De family of Bowbazar. It came to the family through  a court sale in 1929. Only recently, the Des sold it to  the Chinese family. (To be concluded)

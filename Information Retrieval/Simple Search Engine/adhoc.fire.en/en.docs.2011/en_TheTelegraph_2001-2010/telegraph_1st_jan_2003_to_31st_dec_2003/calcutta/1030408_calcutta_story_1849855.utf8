		 Sreyashi ghosh 																									You may call her, as all her friends do. The student of La Martiniere for Girls, who has just completed her ISC exams, earned the name for her finicky ways. 																									She is not afraid to get, however, when it comes to the issue of violence against women. She may be only 17 going on 18, but she needs no older and wiser man telling her what to do, as she proved during the fortnight of activities about violence against women organised by Swayam, an NGO, last year. She initiated the youth action programme, getting students involved in a film festival, music concert and awareness rally on wheels.																									Is the boost she got from asserting her rights as a women (or girl, in this under-aged case). But that is not the end of her fire, as she plans to get involved with the activities at the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy as soon as she can. The Cancerian also plans to follow this flair up by studying sociology in college. Though she still calls herself an introvert, she had the chance to come out of her shell in Class XI and XII, taking part in public events. 																									In melody. From the age of four, Reeti has been learning to sing. This member of the LMG Indian and Bangla cultural clubs has appeared for the fourth-year exams in Rabindrasangeet and topped the tests in classical vocal from Pracheen Kala Kendra, too. For the past couple of years she has started to learn the sarod from Pratap Kumar, a disciple of Amjad Ali Khan, though regrets not being able to give the instrument enough time. Sings at all school functions, with Rabindrasangeet solos being her first choice. Started taking part in fests, bagging a few prizes with her classical strains.																									Is what she hopes to create with a career in the developmental sector or journalism. Has tried the scribes hat on as well, writing for city newspapers, conducting interviews of artistes like Bikram Ghosh and Birju Maharaj, santoor player Rahul Sharma and Governor Viren J. Shah. Lofty aims aside, she has her heart set on a red Ferari of her own.

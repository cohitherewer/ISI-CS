The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A bumper harvest
  Of those many obsessions Calcuttans have, art happens to be a major one. As a result, both senior and upcoming artists consider this place a mecca for exhibiting their works. Hence, exhibitions continue, round the year, some good and memorable ones, some eminently forgettable ones. However, once in a while, exceptionally good, original works emerge, sparkling like a meteor which captivates viewers. Madhukanta Sen is one such artist whose very first solo exhibition of acrylic on canvas paintings is sure to stir the art world. A minehouse of talent, this promising artist prefers to express herself through abstract form, or rather by re-defining the form herself. Sen uses bright colours, but maintains a perfect balance between colours and shapes. In fact, her canvases convey a calmness, a serenity that emanates from within. Her first solo show will be inaugurated today at 4 pm by Professor Dipali Bhattacharya. When: Till March 16; 4 pm - 8 pmWhere:  Copyright

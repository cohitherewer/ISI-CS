		 Monday, January 20, 2003 				 Clerks in the dark about new rates
								Tushar Bhadra: I am a law clerk. The problem that I and many colleagues face is that we are not yet aware of the new structure of the court fees, as the necessary notices did not come to us even two weeks after gazette notification. Is there any way to avert this crisis? 																																																													That is really strange. The gazette notification was out on December 12, 2002, and you say that law clerks are still in the dark about the changes in fees. It was a serious lapse on the part of government procedure.

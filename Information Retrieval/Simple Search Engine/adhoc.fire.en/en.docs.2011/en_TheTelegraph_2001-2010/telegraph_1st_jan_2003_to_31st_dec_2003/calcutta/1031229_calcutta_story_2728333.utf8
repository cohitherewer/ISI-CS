The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Sunday of shivers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								For Calcuttans, it was the seasons first shivering Sunday. A thick cloud cover hid the sun and the maximum temperature crashed to 18.6 C, eight degrees below normal. The minimum temperature was normal at 14.2C.																								The Met office recorded 4.6 mm of rain between 5.30 pm on Saturday and 5.30 pm on Sunday. A low-pressure system over Bihar and eastern UP and adjoining north Bengal and Sikkim had led to a cloud cover, it explained. In addition, a clockwise wind circulation over the Bay of Bengal, off the Andhra coast, had brought in a lot of moisture.																								Ten long-distance trains arrived hours late at Howrah and Sealdah due to the dense fog in north India. A number of trains had to be rescheduled. The fog upset local train services, too, till about 9 am on Sunday.

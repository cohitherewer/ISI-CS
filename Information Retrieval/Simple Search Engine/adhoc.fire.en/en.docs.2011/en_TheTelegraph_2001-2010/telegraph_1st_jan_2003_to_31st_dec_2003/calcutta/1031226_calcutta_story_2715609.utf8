 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Forgotten pioneers of modern art
																								City connoisseurs of art are once again lucky to get a glimpse of some rare paintings by one of the pioneers of modern Bengal art, Sudhir Ranjan Kahstgir (1907-1974) currently being exhibited at Galerie 88. Khastgir was a much adored and acclaimed artist and teacher of fine arts in undivided India. He studied art at Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan (1929) and at Duetch Academy, Munich, just before World War II, when he travelled through western Europe. He had a solo exposition in India House, London. He was a sculptor-painter. He later trained as a carver under the guidance of the renowned sculptor, Ganapat Kashinath Mahatre, in Bombay in 1933. His works are a personal quest for moral and artistic integrity during a time when the country was trying to gain freedom. It is an incandescent narrative of people as they work, congregate, sing and dance, relive their past, and suffer in isolation. Exquisite landscapes also form part of his vast volume of works. His people are stylised, elongated and there are elements of abstraction. The arrangement is mostly two-dimensional with occasional suggestions of built-in three dimensional space. 																								When: Till December 31 (except Sunday); 3 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Galerie 88, 28B Shakespeare Sarani

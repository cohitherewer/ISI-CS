 Saturday, September 27, 2003  The City Diary
																																																		People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC), an NGO, filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in Calcutta High Court seeking an order to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) against the demolition of a portion of Bishops House on Chowringhee Road. The organisation also urged the court to give a guideline to protect other heritage buildings of the city. The petitioner asked the court to pass an order restraining the Bishop of Calcutta, P.P.S. Raju, from demolishing the building. Annexing a story published in The Telegraph, the petitioner said the Bishop House was a historical building and should be protected. The CMC had granted permission to Bishop Raju to demolish the rear portion of the building to construct a highrise for commercial use. The heritage commission, the CMCs heritage committee and the state government have been made respondents to the petition. Fridays hearing could not take place as the bench handling PIL matters could not convene. 																																																		A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday rejected the bail petition of Sahana Roy of Baranagar, arrested for taking a loan from a nationalised bank by submitting forged documents and changing her name. Sahana introduced herself as Rubi Sarkar and obtained the loan from a bank in Salt Lake by furnishing a deed of a building which does not exist. According to police, a racket operates in taking such loans from nationalised banks. Sahana, they suspect, is part of that group. To date, the racket has pocketed a total of Rs 15 lakh from different banks in the city. 																																																		The results of the current years BA and B.Sc Part I (honours and general) examinations of Calcutta University will be announced on Monday, Suranjan Das, CU pro-vice chancellor, academic, said. Nearly 75,000 examinees had appeared in the exams. The marksheets will be sent to respective colleges on Monday morning. They will be distributed among students the same afternoon, Das said.																																																		A 12-year-old girl, Shilpa Pal, who was rescued by the Government Railway Police officials of Naihati on Thursday night from a Kankinara-bound local train, was directed to be kept in safe custody at Barrackpore sub-jail by the sub-divisional magistrate of Barrackpore court on Friday. According to police, though Shilpa had identified a couple from Anandanagar in Naihati as her parents, the couple had refused to accept her as its daughter. The couples daughter, too, went missing a few years ago. Police are now probing if the girl really belonged to the family or came from elsewhere. 																																																		Police found the body of Santosh Gore, 30, in Tollys Nullah on Friday afternoon. There were cut marks on his neck. Police said his identity had been established from the driving licence which was found in his pocket.

Police said Biswas was admitted to a private hospital, where his condition was stated to be critical.																																																		A 40-year-old man tried to commit suicide at Girish Park Metro station on Friday but was rescued. According to a Metro official, Din Dayal Agarwal, a resident of Raja Katra in Burrabazar, jumped on the tracks at 3.32 pm just as a Dum Dum-bound train was entering the platform.

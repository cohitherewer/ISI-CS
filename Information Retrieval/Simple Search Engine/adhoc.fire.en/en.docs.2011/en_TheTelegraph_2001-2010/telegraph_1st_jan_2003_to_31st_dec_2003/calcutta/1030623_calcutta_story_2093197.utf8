 Monday, June 23, 2003 				 Court order on logo use
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) has secured, through Delhi High Court, an undertaking from the Calcutta-based Global Institute of Fashion Technology (GIFT) to desist from using the identical acronym and logo for its promotional activities. 																								GIFT gave an undertaking before Justice Manmohan Sarin that it would not use the acronym and logo. 																								The court, however, said GIFT would continue to use the same name. 																								NIFT counsel Pravin Anand had alleged that GIFT had adopted a similar acronym and logo to present itself as being associated with NIFT. He contended that the reproduction of the logo amounted to an infringement of copyright.

		 Gargi Sen Gargi Sen																									Comes naturally to Gargi, specially when she is armed with oars. This rower became a national medal holder while she was in Class XI. That aside, acting and event management keep the first-year student of St Xaviers College busy.																									She is, after taking to the bleachers for a year to study for her exams. Having started rowing in 2001 at Lake Club just for kicks, she was soon chosen to represent her school, La Martiniere, in inter-school regattas. The gal who has dabbled in karate and tennis and has even been on the school choir, was selected as one of the members of the Bengal four-girl team for the national meet held the same year in Bangalore. She brought home the silver.																									And then some, in other arenas. The theatre  in the wings and on stage  is where this 18-year-old is showing off her skills nowadays. She has been involved with Theatrecian for a while, learning the backstage-management ropes and even facing the camera for Hi Mom!, the groups first feature film venture. She acted and helped direct Method to Madness, an experiment in coffee theatre held at Coffee Pai a few months ago, and is involved with the groups upcoming ventures as well. Gargis pretty face was used in an ad for a cyber caf recently, but she is not interested in acting on any screen  small or large. The stage is where she is happiest, though the small screen may see her in a rather different role  she would like to pursue a career as a TV anchor or newsreader.																									Is what she captured with her latest foray into event management. Just before the Pujas, Gargi helped toddlers strut their stuff in a fashion show at a city Montessori, where skipper Sourav Ganguly was chief guest and judge. The same sense of style comes in handy when she helps her mother design clothes for her Salt Lake ethnic-wear boutique.																									For the student of English, as she is back to practising her rowing everyday, with an eye out for Fridays selection for the university team for an inter-varsity national competition. A chance to represent her college is what she is waiting for.

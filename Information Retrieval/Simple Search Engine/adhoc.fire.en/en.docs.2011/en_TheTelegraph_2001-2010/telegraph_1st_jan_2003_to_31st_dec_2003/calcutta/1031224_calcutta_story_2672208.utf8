 NISHA LAHIRI				 	 Elizabeth Burns. Picture by Pradip Sanyal																								Marriage between science and art is the essence of life for Elizabeth Burns. Shes a research scientist, an artist, a photographer and a bit of a playwright. She is a doctor of molecular and cellular biology from Oxford, but is more famous back home in the UK for her paintings.																								The twist  the subject of her art is her work in science, from cell chromosomes and DNA strands, to viruses and diseases. Lizzie Burns passion is to help others understand the complexities of life. She adds a dash of colour and imagination to drab diagrams from textbooks, and makes them larger than life.																								On a three-week tour of India, the 29-year-old spoke before varied audiences  scholars, scientists, researchers, doctors, students and even at a management institute. But it is the exhibition of her artworks, often combined with her black-and-white photography, that she enjoys most. Her works are on display at the British Council.																								Her oil paintings adorn the covers of science journals, and a book. Some things are too small to even be seen through a microscope, like carbon atoms, which form the basis of life. Others are colourless. I try to explain them, too, with a little imagination. Its not just about the evil of diseases, I want to show the hope science offers as well.																								Lizzies aim of bringing the cellular complications  causing things like blood clots and diabetes  to life, convinced the Medical Research Council, UK, to give her a grant. So, the resident of Oxford has gone about pursuing her mission of taking science to the masses.																								On the side, the University of York graduate has been interviewing scientists, to find out what makes them tick. Often, its a teacher that inspires an interest in science at an early age. I conduct workshops at schools, telling students to do what I do  make the biological processes as fantastic and colourful as they actually are.																								The daughter of a biology teacher-father and a photographer-mother, she acquired a bit from both. Her personal crowning glory was writing a play on cloning human cells a decade before Dolly, the sheep. Staged a couple of years ago during National Science Week, the play has since been shown at Oxford Universitys biochemistry department  to spark a debate on ethics  and during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.																								And to think it all began with a dream  A friend was dying of cancer. It struck me that the very cells causing death are immortal themselves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

	Rates of tickets at the state government-controlled Nandan  have soared by Rs 10 and Rs 15. Though the jump is nothing  compared to that in commercial theatre halls, shouldnt  the government keep the ticket prices here within the reach  of less-affluent cine-goers?

	While the city and its suburbs reel under extensive power  cuts in summer, streetlights are on even during the day.  The CESC is extremely concerned with power pilferage, but  it doesnt bother to pay attention to the huge quantity  of power wasted in this way. Moreover, the authorities concerned  neglect the upkeep of light posts and switch boxes. Most  electric fixtures are exposed to rain and heat, which damage  the wiring and cause short circuits. There should be regular  supervision to ward off accidents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, August 20, 2003 				 Dispelling doubts on diabetes
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Is bitter gourd a cure for diabetes? What is the relationship between diabetes and heart disease? Should I have more cucumbers than medicines to bring down blood sugar levels?																								Questions like these were fired at doctors during a doctor-patient interaction session, organised at Nilratan Sirkar Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday. Dispelling doubts and answering queries was Samar Banerjee, head of the hospitals department of medicine.																								Banerjee also released a book written by him, Diabetes niye du-char katha, the first updated book in Bengali on diabetes. I have found in the past 18 years of my career that patients, and even doctors, to some extent, are ignorant about diabetes, and have no idea how to go about treating it, said Banerjee. 																								Speaking on the spurt in diabetes and heart diseases, Banerjee said a change in lifestyle and easy availability of amenities had robbed Calcuttans of the tendency to exercise. This lack is taking its toll on our lives, he added.

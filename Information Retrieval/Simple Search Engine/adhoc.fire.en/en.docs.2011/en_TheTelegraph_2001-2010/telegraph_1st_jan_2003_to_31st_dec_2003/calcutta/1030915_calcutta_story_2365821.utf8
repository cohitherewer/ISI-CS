 Monday, September 15, 2003 				 Judge call to cops over Maidan row with lawyers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A section of lawyers and two Mounted Police personnel were involved in a row near the Customs tent on the Maidan on Sunday afternoon, police said.																								Three advocates, watching a football match involving their colleagues, were drinking on the lawns outside the Customs tent, deputy commissioner (headquarters) Kuldiep Singh said.																								Mounted Police sergeant Supriyo Kolay and constable Raj Kumar Singh, who were patrolling the area, objected to the advocates drinking in the open, and asked them to move inside the tent instead, Singh added.																								The three first stood their ground, but when the policemen insisted, they went inside.																								According to police, the trio soon re-emerged from the tent, this time accompanied by several colleagues. They were, apparently, furious at the police high-handedness and asked the sergeant and the constable to mind their business.																								The altercation drew the attention of those engaged in a game of football on the adjoining ground. Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta was there and he asked the two policemen to see him in his chamber at 10 am on Monday, deputy commissioner Singh said. They are going to be there, he added, clarifying that neither side had pressed any formal charge.																								Justice Sengupta could not be contacted, but police officers said the issue would be sorted out. There have been a few police-lawyer showdowns in the past, but this is unlikely to blow up into one, an officer said.

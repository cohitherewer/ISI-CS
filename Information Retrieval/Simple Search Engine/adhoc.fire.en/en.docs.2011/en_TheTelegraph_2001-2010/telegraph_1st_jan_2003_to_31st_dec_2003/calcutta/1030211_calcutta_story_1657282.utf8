Barsha Chabaria,M.Com, Part I, Calcutta UniversitylMichael Bevan is my man for this World Cup. Batting in the middle order and averaging around 55 in ODIs is no mean achievement. He is one of the top contenders for the player of the tournament trophy. GenX may not like him for his placid and undemonstrative attitude but he knows his job and delivers the goods in a crisis.Subhobrata BasuIIIrd year, Asutosh CollegelThe player to be watched this World Cup is Virender Sehwag.

His stroke play is a delight. Im especially looking forward to his contest with Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar.Suyash Jaiswal,Class X, St Xaviers Collegiate SchoollMatthew Hayden of Australia could be the dangerman this World Cup.

	 Making waves on air Voice check at Xavier's. Picture by Pradip Sanyal It was a call for all those who consider themselves hip, young and energetic. In a rare road show, Power 107.8 FM, soon to hit the city, took to the streets to find a few radio jockeys (RJs).Colleges and youth hangouts were the first targets. From St Xaviers, Presidency and Jadavpur University to Jogesh Chandra and Andrews College, the crew  including some RJs  went around town last week for on-the-spot auditions. Nicco Park, the Salt Lake swimming pool stretch and New Empire were some of the non-campus stops for the current hit radio channels Star Power talent search.Two RJs have already been spotted through the Star Power campaign.

 There is good news for parents struggling to cope with their toddlers mood swings or fretting over their kids first lessons. Just 4 kids, the only preparatory and Montessori in Howrah on 13, Watkins Lane targets tots between two and four. The school that opened its doors last July promises to take care of the kids, provide them their first brush with education and prepare them for interviews to gain admission into other schools.With the overall development of children figuring high on Just 4 Kids priority list, there is very little emphasis on books and hardly any pressure of homework. These are the two things that put children off studies, says Tejal Kakad, the brain behind Just 4 Kids. Instead, we have fruit days, vegetable days, alphabet days and so on. On fruit days, for instance, children are given plastic models of fruits for easy identification before they are given the real things. They are allowed to taste them, so we also get to know their likes and dislikes, says Mayank, Tejals brother, who also chips in with his share for her dream project.For alphabets and numerals, computer games have been designed specifically to keep the kids interested. After all, which child does not like to see cartoons and play games? observes Tejal. Ask a three-year-old at Just 4 Kids why August 15 is a special day and s/he will come up with the right reply. That is because here every occasion  from a birthday to a national festival  is celebrated together with the kids. And it is this edutainment that is being welcomed by parents who would rather have their child play games, interact with others of the same age and pick up a variety of things rather than find them glued to the television.
	 Prized momentsHope Foundation-Ireland and its local counterpart, Hope Foundation-India, celebrated the second foundation day at Bowlers Den, Nicco Park, on Friday, with more than 2,000 children in attendance. The chief guest, Patrick Scullion, first secretary, embassy of Ireland, was present at the ceremony. The celebration began with underprivileged children performing a song and dance item. Prizes were given to participants  three to 16 years of age  for high attendance, bravery and good performance in education. The children were entertained through the puppet and magic shows by Salil Kumar Basu. The day ended with them being taken for rides in Nicco Park.  Copyright

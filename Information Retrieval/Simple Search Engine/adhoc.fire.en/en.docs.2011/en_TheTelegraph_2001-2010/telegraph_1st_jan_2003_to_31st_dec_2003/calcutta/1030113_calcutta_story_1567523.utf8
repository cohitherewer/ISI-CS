		 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 Courts now beyond commoners reach
					 CROSSING THE BAR: Lawyers and litigants  at Calcutta High Court 					 					 					 			 Arun Kumar De: Lawyers continued their agitation for nearly a month and a half. What were the minimum demands? Even during the movement, why was it said that the demands would be reviewed later?																																																													It should be remembered that an agitation is not a luxury. No one treads the path of agitation unless driven to it. The government has increased every type of fee, be it in schools, colleges or courts. Even electricity charges were raised. The court fees were hiked beyond the capacity of the common man. As a result, common people will not be able to move court, which ultimately will mean denial of justice. The government has not withdrawn attendance fees. It was also said that the value of adjournment petition fees will either be reduced or withdrawn, but we want its total withdrawal. Moreover, in some cases, the court fees have been doubled, as in cases of getting a succession certificate, probate and will.

 Thursday, October 23, 2003 				 Wireless pilfer bust
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta Police on Tuesday night recovered part of a consignment of wireless sets, meant for the Central Reserve Police Force, that was stolen a couple of months ago from Sahibgunge, in Bihar. 																								During the raid, they also arrested Aslam, the brain behind the sudden disappearance of the two boxes holding the equipment, from a Nagaland-bound train. 																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said equipment and accessories worth Rs 2.5 lakh were recovered by the officials of Jorasanko police station.																								Based on information provided by the police intelligence network, the team of officials of the local police station raided a house in Sambhunath Chatterjee Lane, in the Kalabagan area of central Calcutta, Mitra said. 																								There, the team from Jorasanko arrested Aslam, who had lifted the consignment from the train, and recovered the goods.																								The wireless set accessories were packed in two boxes and, amidst tight security, were sent from Chandigarh in May this year.																								It is only a small part of the consignment, which was worth Rs 22 lakh. The officials are interrogating Aslam and they hope to find the rest of the merchandise, Mitra disclosed.																								Aslam was the one who had stolen the goods and had sold them off in small quantities in Bihar. Some of it had also been disposed of in West Bengal, deputy commissioner Mitra added.																								Aslam, a resident of Bihar, arrived in the city barely a few days ago and our men were on his trail from the very beginning. It was only after we got the confirmation from our intelligence network that our officials raided the house and arrested him, said an official of Jorasanko police station.

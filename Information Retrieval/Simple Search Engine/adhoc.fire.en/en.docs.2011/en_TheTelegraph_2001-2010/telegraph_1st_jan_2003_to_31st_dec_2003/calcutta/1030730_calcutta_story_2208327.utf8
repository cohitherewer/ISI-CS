The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, July 30, 2003 				 For a more human face of the force
 															- Computer, law, public relations included in qualifying test for constables SWATI SENGUPTA																								Computers, public relations, environmental laws, problems faced by children and women along with legal and social measures to deal with them, human rights and the role of police in society... Its time for constables of Calcutta Police to catch up with the top cops.																								It would be useless to make only senior officers learn computers and update them with the new laws on environment, women and children, since it is constables who deal more directly with people on the streets, DC (headquarters), Kuldeep Singh, said.																								The issues would be incorporated in the six papers in the qualifying exam: police organisation and administration, forensic science, criminology and forensic medicine, functioning of police, police and society, and two papers on law. 																								Already officers-in-charge in most of the 45 police stations of Calcutta have started registering first information reports on computers. The city police authorities felt the need to have even constables get used to operating computers so that they can handle them in the absence of their seniors. An additional 50 marks for training in computers has been added to their curriculum, taking the total up to 650.																								The 440 selected constables who take up their course in August would be the first batch to learn computers and the nitty-gritties of human rights and environmental laws. Constables form nearly 18,000 of the 26,000-strong force of Calcutta Police.																								There are no big hopes because the minimum qualification for the job is passing Class VIII. But it is very essential to keep pace with the times, Singh said. 																								Calcutta Police recruits constables through employment exchanges according to vacancies twice a year  in January and July. Physical fitness is tested first, and those selected are then interviewed. There is no provision for written test for the preliminary selection. The 440 constables selected in July would be trained for six months at Police Training School on AJC Bose Road. They are then scheduled to appear for the final examinations in December.																								Calcutta Police authorities hope that the next batch of constables would be better equipped to deal with people. The course should give a more human touch to the force, Singh said.

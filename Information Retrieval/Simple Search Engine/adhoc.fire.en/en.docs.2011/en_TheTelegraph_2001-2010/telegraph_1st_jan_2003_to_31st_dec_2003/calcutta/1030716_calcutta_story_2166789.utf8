 in the morning. This particularly inconveniences commuters of long-distance trains, as most of these are scheduled to reach the city at daybreak, between 3.15 and 4.20 am. Often delayed arrival of trains and bandhs put passengers in a spot as they cant contact their families. The same problem crops up if their relatives on either side of the road from the Tollygunge crossing to Kudghat bus stand, cause traffic congestion during peak hours. The poles almost take up half the roadspace as a result of which two buses moving in opposite directions scarcely have space to manouevre. The situation is further compounded by the presence of three schools in the area. Unauthorised shops that have sprung up all along the way add to the chaos, too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, October 02, 2003 				 Time for fun, friends and family
 SOURAV AND DONA GANGULY Then (Sourav): My first  memory of Durga Puja dates back to 1978, when as a five-year-old,  I remember the excitement of wearing new clothes and spending  time at the para puja. But my most memorable association  with the Puja during those days was my revolver. For, this  was the time when I would be constantly armed and would  continuously burst those cap crackers. I would spend a  lot of time at the puja pandal in my para  Barisha  Players Corner  and I remember hanging out mostly with  the older boys of the locality. Then (Dona): Durga puja  always meant wearing new clothes, eating out and spending  time at the para puja (the same as Souravs). It  has always been a time for fun, to be spent with family  and friends. Now (Sourav): After becoming  committed to cricket, I have hardly had the chance to spend  a full Puja in Calcutta. Several Durga pujas have been spent  on overseas tours, when one hardly realises that the festival  has come and gone. But whenever I have got the chance, I  have made it a point to enjoy every moment of it. Most of  my time is spent at the para puja, with which I am  quite involved. I take an active interest in this puja and  do what I can in my personal and professional capacity to  make it memorable. The four days go by catching up with  family and friends. Now (Dona): Since my marriage,  weve almost always been on the move during this time of  the year. Ive spent the Pujas in so many different places  that now its difficult to keep track. But I remember that  the first year after our marriage, I was in Delhi, where,  unlike Calcutta, there are lots of cultural functions during  the festivities. The same holds true for Mumbai As for  Pujas spent abroad, accompanying Sourav on tour, I remember  the times spent in Harare and Toronto. Durga Puja 2003 (Sourav): This  time, I am home for the entire Pujas, before leaving for  Ahmedabad on Dashami. I plan to spend my time almost entirely  at home or at the para pandal. Durga Puja 2003 (Dona): For  once, Sourav will be here for one more day than me during  the Pujas. I leave on Navami for a function in Mumbai. From  there, Ill join Sourav in Ahmedabad. But theres a lot  happening on all the Puja days. Sashthi is reserved for  the thakur ghore puja, that keeps me busy almost  all day. On Saptami, theres the ESPN programme at Barisha  Players Corner. The whole thing will have to be monitored  from home, and Ill have to make sure everything goes off  smoothly till the guests leave.																								This will be a special puja for Sana. She is a year-and-a-half now and she will be able to enjoy herself. She has seen me perform as Durga on stage, so she often says amaar ma Durga. She is quite intrigued by the goddess in the pandal, though I feel she is more fascinated by the asur and the baagh. She spends a lot of time imitating asur marchhe, baagh haan korchhe

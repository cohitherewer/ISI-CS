		 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Pak envoy meets Vajpayee
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 20: Within 48 hours of Pervez Musharrafs offer to drop his countrys traditional demand for a UN-mandated plebiscite in Kashmir for lasting peace in South Asia  the subsequent attempt by Islamabad to backtrack notwithstanding  Pakistani high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan held a meeting with Atal Bihari Vajpayee this evening.																								The 20-minute meeting has been described by both sides as nothing more than a courtesy call. But the fact that Khan was granted this exclusive meeting with the Prime Minister more than six months after he presented his credentials as his countrys envoy in India, gather special significance.																								Though Vajpayee has officially announced his decision to attend the Saarc summit in Islamabad from January 4 to 6, Delhi has so far not clearly stated whether or not there would be any exclusive meetings between the Prime Minister and the Pakistani leadership, particularly President Musharraf.																								Pakistan made it clear that the high commissioner was not carrying any invitation from either Musharraf or Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali for exclusive meetings with Vajpayee. 																								Sources in the high commission, however, pointed out that it is a Saarc tradition for visiting heads of governments to hold separate bilateral meetings with the head of state and head of government of the host country.

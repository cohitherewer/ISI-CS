Court bans K3G for insult to anthem JABALPUR (PTI): Terming as objectionable the singing of the national anthem in Kabhi Khushie Kabhi Gham, Madhya Pradesh High Court on Thursday banned its screening till the scene is removed. The court has asked the censor board to withdraw clearance to the film till the scene is deleted. In a 45-page judgment, a division bench of Justices Dipak Mishra and A.K. Srivastava held that the manner in which the national anthem was sung in the film was an insult to the anthem. On a writ petition filed by S.. Chouksey, a retired engineer, the court directed the producer and director of K3G, Yash and Karan Johar, to remove the objectionable scene and also asked them to pay Rs 15,000 to the petitioner. The film would not be screened in any cinema house until and unless the objectionable scene is removed, the bench ordered. It also directed national TV channels and cable operators not to screen it without deletion of the objectionable scene.The petitioner had challenged the portion of the movie on the ground that the national anthem cannot be used for any commercial purpose. There is a national anthem code listing the occasions for singing of the anthem and mentioning the manner in which it should be sung, the petitioner said. Indian migrants in Lanka netCOLOMBO (PTI): Sri Lankan authorities on Thursday arrested 175 would-be illegal immigrants from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh as part of its drive to stop the island from being used as a hub for human smuggling. A police spokesperson said the men arrested from the beach resort of Mount Lavinia, just south of Colombo, were being questioned to establish their identities and nationalities as most of them did not have valid travel documents. However, it is believed that they entered Sri Lanka legally because the country grants visa on arrival to nationals from South Asian countries, a concession which was earlier available to those from developed nations. The latest information showed that 86 Indians were arrested on Thursday.The police were also investigating if the immigrants are being duped by agents who charge over $3,000 promising them safe passage to destinations such as Italy and ensure that they are arrested in Colombo and deported.

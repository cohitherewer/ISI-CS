The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, February 06, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Court strikes down DIG appointment				 																																																	 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the appointment of senior IPS officer R.K. Sharma as deputy inspector-general of Punjab Police and ruled that his first VRS application in 1992, though withdrawn later, be treated as accepted.				 																																																	A division bench of Justices S.S.M. Quadri and S.N. Variava said there was no need for the government to issue a termination letter to Sharma as his services would be treated as having been ceased from May 1993.				 																																																	The bench also directed that the police officer should surrender to the government and added that Sharma should avail only VRS benefits and not any pecuniary benefit he had derived after May 1993.				 																																																	Sharma was sent to the Punjab government in October 1990 from the Research and Analysis Wing.				 																																																	Sharma took leave and went to England but he continued to be absent beyond his leave period. When the state government declined to extend his leave, Sharma opted for voluntary retirement in 1992 but withdrew the application through a telegram. 				 																																																	He opted for VRS again in May 1993, but withdrew it immediately. On his petition, Punjab and Haryana High Court ordered that Sharma be allowed to join as Punjab police DIG. This petition was challenged before the apex court by one P. Lal, another senior IPS officer. Allowing Lals petition, the Supreme Court said Sharmas first VRS application itself should have been treated as accepted.				 																Engineer in CBI cyber crime net				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): The CBI has secured its first conviction in a cyber crime when a designated court here convicted an engineer but released him on probation for one year on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 20,000 and a surety of the like amount.				 																																																	The designated court convicted the engineer under Sections 418, 419 and 420 of the IPC but took a lenient view due to his young age and qualifications, an agency official said.				 																																																	The accused was arrested in July last year by the CBIs cyber crime cracking cell on charge of defrauding a US citizen of $ 578 by misusing her credit card through the web. He had ordered a colour television and a cordless phone using her card through online shopping site sony-sambandh.com. 				 																																																	On a complaint from Sony India, searches were conducted at the residence and offices of the accused, where a letter proving that the goods were delivered to him were recovered.				 																																																	The US national, who had a problem with the billing status of her credit card, consulted a call centre for a solution.

The secretary of the Uttar Pradesh Education Board has directed the regional director, Meerut, to file criminal complaints against all the school managers and principals who had allegedly bungled the intermediate examination fees.

The immigrants were wheeled across the Lowu border from Shenzhen after paying between $ 250 and 300, the report said.

		 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Capital party for Valley schoolchildren
 SEEMA GUHA				 	 The children from Kashmir with those of Sri Ram School on Saturday. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, Dec. 20: Removed from the violence back home, the group of Kashmiri schoolchildren were the same as those of Sri Ram School where they were invited for an interactive session with stars and children here.																								Their icons  Shah Rukh Khan, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Zahir Khan, Kapil Dev, Ajay Jadeja, Kajol and Kareena Kapoor  were no different from the children in this elite school in Vasant Vihar.																								The experiment of inviting children from Kashmir, and underprivileged schoolchildren from Lucknow and Pune to spend time in an elite Delhi school, has been the joint effort of Sadbhavana Trust, the Sri Ram School and the CII. The project, named Shri Maitri, is an attempt at reaching out and showing that we care. At widening the horizon of not only displaced children but also our own children, school principal Maneka Sharma says.																								The session proved to be rewarding for 12-year-old Sigatullah from Baramullah. He met his cricketing idol Kapil Dev here. He bowled to me and spoke to all of us, says Sigatullah. But no, he does not want to be a cricketer. I want to be a doctor and help my people, the solemn-eyed boy says. Kapils daughter, a student here, also came over one afternoon and played with the children.																								My favourite is Ajay Jadeja, quips 13-year-old Neeru Bhat. She has been living in a camp in Jammu ever since her parents fled the Valley when militants turned their guns on Kashmiri Pundits. She met Jadeja during his interaction with the children here. I asked him, whether he preferred to be a film star or a cricketer and he said cricket was a passion and acting was just a fun thing he wanted to try out. Neeru is starry-eyed about Jadeja and cannot get over the fact that she actually met him. She dismisses the violence in the Valley: I have not experienced it. I have heard from my parents and elders in the family, how they had to flee. They speak of the good old days when all Kashmiris lived together and kidnappings and killings were unheard of in the Valley.																								Zora Tabbassum is exceptionally pretty and a self-assured 12- year-old from Dodas Chenab Valley Public School. She seems to have taken the violence in her stride, saying life at home is not so bad. Newspapers and television reporters are always exaggerating, they magnify every small incident and want to say that nothing is right in our state, Zora says. Things are not so bad, she mumbles, as if to assure herself. 																								All the children are excited about the new BJP MP, Hema Malini, though none were born when she was the reigning queen of Bollywood. The actress spent time with the children as did Raveena Tandon, but the kids remember to mention only Hema. She is very beautiful. She sang for us and talked to all of us, says Zora.																								Nearly all of them have good words for Sri Ram School and the kindness shown by the staff. The teachers are so loving and nice, Zora says. 																								The children were impressed by the books, paintings and drama classes which are part of the curriculum in most schools here but quite unheard of in the Valley.																								They were in no mood to talk about the violence and unrest back home though each one came from an area affected by militancy. The children seemed to have deliberately shut their minds to these ugly aspects, concentrating instead on the excitement and joy.																								This is the first instance the children spent time away from home. They were too excited to miss their people in the Valley.

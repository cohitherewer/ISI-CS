		 Sunday, June 22, 2003 				 Muslim board plea on Kalyan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 21: The Babri committee of the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board, which met here today, decided to call for the examination of Kalyan Singh by the Liberhan Commission. 																								Singh, who was Uttar Pradesh chief minister when Babri Masjid was demolished, has so far avoided appearing before the commission probing the incident. He had got a court stay.																								After the Centres counsel accused Singh on Thursday of failing to protect the mosque, he hit back saying deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and other BJP and RSS leaders had hatched the conspiracy to demolish the mosque behind his back.																								Contradictory statements are appearing, so it is important that the commission should examine Singh, said S.Q.R. Illyasi, board convener and spokesman. The committee decided to take its appeal to Delhi High Court or any other court.																								Naidu reaction																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu today described former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singhs charge against Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee and other BJP leaders as absurd, baseless and frustrated utterances of a new convert to pseudo secularism.																								It took years for the political afterthought of Kalyan Singh (to be uttered), Naidu said in Hyderabad of the charges made by the Rashtriya Kranti Dal leader. Naidu said the events in Ayodhya in 1992 were unfortunate, uncontrollable and unintended.																								adding that a change in the political stand of individuals was the order of the day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, March 11, 2003  Temple fireworks spark audience salvo
 - The Telegraph Calcutta Club Debate A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, March 10: A battle  of wills, ideals, principles and philosophies. Or, as one  participant put it, a shouting match between politicians. Whatever the description, The  Telegraph Calcutta Club National Debate  In the opinion  of the house, religion has derailed democracy in India   saw a punch-up that was alternately booed and applauded  by a 3,000-strong audience yesterday. Ayodhya was on top of everyones  mind as the past was raked up and instances in history were  used by both sides to hit at each other. Congress spokesman  Jaipal Reddy, Samajwadi Partys Amar Singh, CPMs Sitaram  Yechuri and journalist N. Ram argued for the motion with  focus on the Babri Masjid demolition and last years Gujarat  riots. On the other side of the fence  were law and justice minister Arun Jaitley, information  and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, journalist-writer  Mark Tully and journalist Swapan Dasgupta.  Jaitley hit back, saying majority  bashing (was) becoming the norm and protection of minorities  and secularism were clouding peoples judgement. Moderator Jairam Ramesh of the  Congress deftly juggled the strident opinions as the participants,  including the excited audience, chastised him for taking  sides. The audience, who Ramesh did not allow to question  the participants as it was beyond the rules, appeared to  enjoy the political firecrackers and shouted out their opinions.  Ramesh decided to let comments fly to get people to react. Tully nearly took the steam out  of the debate when he said: I am not aligned with any party,  so, perhaps, I am the most impartial person here. And I  propose that it is, in fact, democracy that has derailed  religion, and not the other way round. He appeared to strike a chord  with the audience when he said religion is merely used by  those running the country as a smokescreen to hide their  inadequacies and inability to address the real problems  of the people. Put to a vote, the motion was  rejected as roughly 60 per cent of the participants believed  religion had not derailed democracy. Tully, however, was the ultimate  victor when his opinion was put to an impromptu audience  vote. Around 95 per cent of the audience believed he was  right. Ramesh summed up the debate, saying:  The real battle for secularism is not between majority  and minority issues. It is actually a battle between those  who are intensely religious but practise in private, and  those who bring it into the limelight because they want  to use it for public mobilisation. He appealed to the people to find  a middle ground between the traditional, orthodox secularism  and fundamentalism.  But most people are not able  to find it because they are not being allowed to, Ramesh  said. Lookad Advertising was the associate  sponsor of the debate and ITC Sonar Bangla the official  host.

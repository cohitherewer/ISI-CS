The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, October 26, 2003 				 Paid, but not for parade
 							 - Rape victim junks Digvijay claim, rises to Uma defence RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Oct. 25: Jamnibai today confirmed chief minister Digvijay Singhs claim that local BJP leaders gifted her a fixed deposit of Rs 1 lakh but denied it was to parade her at the Prime Ministers rally.																								I was dying of hunger and nobody came forward. Bai (Bharti) came forward and helped me out. I would campaign for her and even contest elections if she wants me to, said the rape victim, whose exhibition at Vajpayees public rally on Sunday had sparked a political turmoil in the state.																								Digvijay had said yesterday that the BJP had opened a fixed deposit account of Rs 1 lakh in Jamnibais name a few days before she was paraded at the rally.																								Jamnibai confirmed Digvijays statement but disagreed with his allegation that the fixed deposit was a fit case of allurement to ensure her presence at Vajpayees public meeting. 																								Bailing out a beleaguered Bharti, Jamnibai concurred with her stand that the move was a spontaneous one and, therefore, did not amount to violation of privacy.																								She turned the heat back on the Congress, saying the party had asked her to change sides. 																								On October 22, Lalit Sustani and Bapu Singh belonging to my community came to meet me and suggested that I call on Raja sahib (Digvijay). But I declined. When I needed help, the BJP helped me.																								Jamnibai said she failed to understand the fuss over her public appearance, saying everyone she knew was aware of her humiliation by goons, who, she claimed, continued to threaten her even a decade after the incident.																								She denied knowledge of some women NGOs like the All India Womens Conference approaching the national human rights and womens commissions about the violation of her privacy and rights.																								I know just one thing. Where were these people when I stopped getting (the) states family pension and was on the verge of dying of hunger? Jamnibai asked.																								Congress leaders, taken aback by Jamnibais spirited defence of Bharti, alleged that she was being tutored by the BJP to say things that would help the partys chief ministerial candidate tide over the controversy.																								The Congress also claimed that Vajpayee was uncomfortable and upset over Bhartis gesture to drive home the point that women were not safe in the Digvijay regime.																								Waxing eloquent on Bhartis kindness, Jamnibai said: Bai met me during the rainy season. I cried and she told me not to cry. She said the people who have tortured you would cry in the long run.																								Subsequently, Jamnibai said, former BJP legislator Raghunandan Sharma met her and opened a fixed deposit account of Rs 1 lakh in her name.

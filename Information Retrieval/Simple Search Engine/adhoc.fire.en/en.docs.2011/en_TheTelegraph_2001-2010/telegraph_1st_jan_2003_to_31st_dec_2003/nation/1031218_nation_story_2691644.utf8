 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chandigarh, Dec. 17: After the Northeast and Maharashtra, it is now the turn of political outfits in Punjab to demand that the state is for Punjabis only.																								While the Shiromani Akali Dal wants to disenfranchise migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the Panthic Akali Dal and the Dal Khalsa, an Akali outfit whose aim is to create Khalistan and whose leader Gajinder Singh figures on the countrys 20 most-wanted list, want them to leave.																								Non-Punjabis should not be allowed to buy land in Punjab. Migrants from Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh form nearly one-tenth of the population as of now and are getting jobs easily. That has to come to a stop sooner than later, said Dal Khalsa secretary-general Kanwarpal Singh Bittu. The situation is explosive. It is worse than Maharashtra or Assam, he warned.																								The Dal Khalsa recently held a seminar in Amritsar, demanding an ordinance to fix a ceiling on jobs for migrants, barring outsiders from purchasing land and introduction of quarantine measures for migrants who have settled in the state.																								However, most parties have refrained from going public with the demand to stop migrants from entering Punjab. Akali Dal president and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal refused comment, but said the situation needed to be studied carefully before arriving at a conclusion. You cannot stop people from moving from one part of the country to another, he said.																								A senior Akali Dal leader said that while the party had discussed the issue a number of times, no directive has been given to party workers to start an agitation against migrants.																								A government spokesman said only chief minister Amarinder Singh could comment on the Dal Khalsa demand. Amarinder was unavailable as he was in New Delhi trying to iron out differences with his No. 2 in the cabinet, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.																								A study conducted by the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development in the mid eighties had found that 95.71 per cent of migrants in Punjab were from Bihar. They were seen as honest, docile, submissive, obedient and unconscious of their rights.																								But the study concluded that there was hostility between migrant labourers and local workers. Almost all local workers said the migrants should be stopped from entering the state and even threatened to take matters into their own hands. Thankfully, nothing has happened. The migrants paid with their blood during the terrorism era with 45 losing their lives, although no one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.																								Studies say migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar first came to Punjab in the fifties and worked only in the paddy transplantation season.

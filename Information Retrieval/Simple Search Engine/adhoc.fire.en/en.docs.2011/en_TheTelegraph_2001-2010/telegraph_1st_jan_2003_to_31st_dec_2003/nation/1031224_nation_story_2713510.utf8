The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Calcutta stop for Baghdad shoppers
 ANIEK PAUL				 	 The Iraqi delegation in Calcutta. Picture by Rashbehari Das																								Calcutta, Dec. 23: American guns still boom in his war-ravaged country, but the clean-shaven man who looks like a Russian believes its time to move on.																								Only, he isnt a Russian but an Iraqi and the way to revival, according to him, lies through things Indian.																								The war is over and Iraq is a free country. Its time to rebuild, says H..B. Saffar, who has arrived with five businessmen from his countrys apex chamber of commerce. The six are on a shopping spree  from petrol-vending devices to ceramic tiles, and oxygen plants to china.																								No one can beat our price, Sir. If we got bulk orders from Iraq, we could supply at $3.5 a square feet, says a Bangladeshi selling ceramic tiles at the Industrial India Trade Fair.																								But Saffar and the others are not interested. Where are the Indian stalls? Saffar, the lone English-speaking member of the delegation, asks the organisers. We are more interested in Indian products.																								The team, which includes presidents of three regional chambers, reached the city this evening on an invitation from the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industries.																								While the US is locked in bickering with coalition partners and those that opposed or stayed out of the war on awarding contracts for rebuilding Iraq, these businessmen are looking to open a parallel line of trade with low-wage countries like India where they could buy cheap.																								Its a free country now and its the duty of every Iraqi (businessmen) to contribute to the reconstruction of Iraq, says Saffar.																								Forging trade ties with Iraq could take a long time. There is hardly any port now  the Basra port is in tatters  and not many Indian banks would offer credit for supplying to Iraq.																								But the Iraqis are unfazed. Well arrange something. Port isnt a problem  the goods could land in a neighbouring country, and from there we could have them transported to Iraq by road, says Saffar.																								And credit? For a moment Saffar looks puzzled, but recovers quickly. 																								I am sure something could be arranged, he says.

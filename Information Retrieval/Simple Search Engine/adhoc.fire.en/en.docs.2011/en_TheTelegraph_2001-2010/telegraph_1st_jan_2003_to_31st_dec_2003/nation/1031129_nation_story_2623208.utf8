		 Saturday, November 29, 2003 				 Hurriyat talks date
																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: The decks have been cleared for talks between deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, but negotiations are likely to start only after the winter session of Parliament ends on December 23, reports our special correspondent.																								Advani will be tied up with Parliament and can only find time after the session is over. The deputy Prime Minister has also been too busy campaigning for the Assembly polls to go into the nitty-gritty of a formal dialogue with the Hurriyat led by Abbas Ansari, senior officials in North Block said. 																								However, Union home secretary . Gopalaswami has been regularly chairing meetings of the co-ordination group on Jammu and Kashmir. 																								Home ministry officials dealing with the Valley, representatives of the directorates of Intelligence and the Research and Analysis Wing and a PMO official have also been meeting to take an overview of the situation in the state ever since the Hurriyat decided to hold talks with the Centre.

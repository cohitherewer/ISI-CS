																								New Delhi, Oct. 26 (PTI): India has asked Germany to extradite Amrendra Ghosh, wanted in connection with a bank fraud, along with the 8-cm knife in his stomach if he continues to avoid operation for its removal.																								The CBI, through the external affairs ministry, requested the German government to hand over Ghosh as he was deliberately not consenting to the removal of the knife. This would help the accused in not facing the trial in the court and justice would be denied, the CBI request said.																								Fearing extradition, Ghosh had swallowed a knife after the German supreme court upheld the lower courts order that he be sent back to India.																								He hurt himself while swallowing the knife prompting German authorities to send a message to India immediately urging that the extradition process be put on hold.																								The fugitive continues to remain elusive from the CBI as he has refused to give his consent for an operation to remove the knife. According to German laws, no patient could be operated without his or her or an immediate kins consent. 																								The CBI pleaded that Ghosh was not giving consent as he did not want to face the courts in India. If Ghosh is given a final ultimatum, he might as well give the consent for the operation as well, the agency said. 																								Ghosh is admitted to a hospital in Munich and the doctors are treating him to prevent any infection in the body because of the knife.																								He was chargesheeted by the CBI last year for entering into a criminal conspiracy with the senior manager of Allahabad Banks Calcutta branch, S.R. Ramanani, and getting high-valued bankers cheques issued in the name of fictitious persons.																								Later, in conspiracy with the branch manager of Punjab National Banks Calcutta branch, Nilopam Das, the accused allegedly opened four bank accounts and credited the cheques of Rs 10.84 crore.																								Ghosh was also facing an inquiry in three other cases where Rs 16 crore had been swindled. He was declared a proclaimed offender in April, 2002, and Interpol arrested him in Munich.

		 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Uma review of Digvijay orders
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Dec. 25: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti has decided to review all decisions taken by the Digvijay Singh regime in its last six months and introduce the anti-terror law in the state.																								The former Congress chief ministers major initiatives such as providing free power to farmers, community fine against those booked in communal- and caste-related violence and free land lease to the urban poor may be the first to go.																								The BJPs newly elected chief minister, however, is treading cautiously on the power issue. Aware that her predecessors downfall was mainly because of acute power shortage, Bharti is planning to introduce assured power for farmers, instead of free power.																								Bharti recently told senior power sector officials that she was opposed to making big promises such as free power, when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the Centre was committed to largescale power reforms.																								The chief minister argued that her government should try to provide assured power in rural areas as parts of the state had gone without electricity for days when farmers needed it the most during sowing season. Bharti has directed the officials to initially ensure six hours of assured power across the state.																								Sources close to her said she was planning to introduce the anti-terror law at the next cabinet meeting on Saturday. Her rationale is the precarious security situation and rise of fundamentalism across the country.																								Digvijay had resisted introducing the law in keeping with his partys stand that it was draconian and uncalled for and because there were several legal provisions to deal with national security.																								Bhartis government is also set to shelve Digvijays move to slap community fine on those found guilty of fomenting communal trouble over Bhojshala in February.																								Four persons had died in violent clashes between the majority and minority communities over the 11th century monument in Dhar district that Hindus consider a temple and Muslims a mosque.																								The Digvijay regime had imposed a community fine of Rs 86,85,955 on 326 culprits for damaging public and private property. During the recent Assembly poll campaign, Bharti had dubbed the measure feudal and draconian, alleging false implication of many innocents. She had added that the measure prevented the law from taking its course.																								His government had also slapped a fine of Rs 25,78,600 on 521 villagers in his home district of Rajgarh for burning or damaging crops of Dalits who were given free land lease.																								The BJP has maintained that free land lease to Dalits is ill-conceived as many forward castes and the Other Backward Classes, too, need land on grounds of their poor economic status.

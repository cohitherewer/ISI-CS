 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, Dec. 25: The road to House No. 6, Zokaki No. 25, Mohalla No. 306, Hay al Maghrib, Adhamiya, Baghdad, was littered with spent bullets in the early days following the fall of the Iraqi capital this April. Somehow now, the road to the mansion housing the Indian embassy in the embattled city has been stretched  stretched so much that it passes through Washington.																								In April, the caretaker of the building, Hadi Saleh, was its only inhabitant. Ambassador B.B. Tyagi and first secretary Pandey have since re-taken their offices. Only, if they have to be telephoned, they connect through Washington.																								Executives of Indian companies wanting to do business in Iraq have been handed out two telephone numbers of the Indian embassy. The numbers are of the US. Presumably, the Indian embassy is working on satellite phones with SIM cards bought or procured from a US service provider.																								After Washington barred Indian companies  along with the French and the Russian  from bidding for major contracts in the reconstruction of Iraq, hawks in the establishment here are again questioning New Delhis rationale behind not sending troops to Iraq despite repeated requests.																								The argument is that sending Indian troops will relieve the pressure on the American military and Washington, in thanksgiving, will award a slice of the Iraq contract pie to Indian companies. US policy on awarding contracts in Iraq continues to be access according to boots on the ground.																								Undeterred by the logic of contracts-for-troops, however, a clutch of Indian companies is despatching executives to Iraq pronto.																								Vrijesh Chawla, a deputy general manager with a Jindal Group company, is one of them. He has left for Baghdad, heart in mouth, because his $200-million firm, Saw Pipes Limited, has entered into a cartel that is confident of winning an order for supplies to a trans-Iraq oil and gas pipeline.																								We are lucky we have agents in Baghdad where we have done business in the past, said Chawla. Otherwise, accessing information is very difficult. It can be something as simple as paying $100 for tender documents because it is difficult to get the money across.																								Despite the recent memo from the US deputy defence secretary, Indian companies with a commitment in Iraq are still hopeful of circumventing the order.																								The US has listed small countries  such as Rwanda, Eritrea and Micronesia  as favoured nations. Indian companies are exploring the possibility of registering subsidiaries in these countries to win orders.																								The orders are in the nature of sub-contracts from major US reconstruction companies such as Bechtel with whom some of the companies are registered.																								Even before the order, the public sector BHEL and the Cosmos Group had begun exploring business in Iraq in a major way. Cosmos Group president Anil Agarwal is also the chairman of Ficcis India-Iraq Joint Business Council.																								Another Indian company, the Bombay-based KEC International, has airlifted engineers and workers to Iraq after winning a $36-million contract approved by the US Army Corps of Engineers to restore power transmission lines.																								The chairman of PCP International, H.S. Mejie, last month made a presentation before Ficci on how to do business in Iraq. PCP International is an engineering consultancy firm that has done longstanding business in Iraq through the years of the Saddam Hussein regime.																								India has to accept that the US is in Iraq for keeps and has to give and take with the Americans, Mejie told his colleagues from several companies.																								Mejies presentation was made around the time when an official from the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), James Sosnicki, visited Delhi.																								Sosnicki asked Indian companies to work through a CPA-sponsored outfit, the Baghdad Business Centre.																								But the general impression of company executives is that they are making do with crumbs despite the risks they are taking. And even if Indian troops were to be in Iraq, it is difficult to believe that American companies will part with the Iraq pie. Maybe, well get more crumbs, one said.

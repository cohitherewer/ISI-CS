 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Amarmani Tripathi																								New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Central Bureau of Investigation will file the chargesheet in the Madhumita Shukla murder case in a Lucknow court tomorrow.																								The bureau has decided to file the chargesheet that names Amarmani Tripathi and five others as accused, though the former Uttar Pradesh ministers wife Madhumani  also an accused  is absconding.																								Unconfirmed reports suggest she has left the country. The bureau will move the court to declare her an absconder, sources said.																								The other accused are Prakash Chander Pandey, who is alleged to have shot the poet, his accomplice Santosh Rai, Rohit Chaturvedi, who allegedly hired the two killers, and Uttar Pradesh police inspector Yagya Narain Dikshit, who is alleged to have suppressed facts at Tripathis behest.																								The former minister was the first to be arrested on September 21, following DNA reports that confirmed he was the father of the child Madhumita was carrying at the time of her murder on May 9 this year.																								The CBI has filed the chargesheet within the stipulated 90 days of Tripathis arrest.																								Sources said Tripathi would be charged with criminal conspiracy to kill Madhumita, who was resisting an abortion, as well as with suppressing evidence through inspector Dikshit. The CBI will annex the polygraph test report, which clearly indicated that Tripathi had lied on most of the questions put to him.																								A statement made by Chaturvedi before a magistrate in which he had reportedly confessed that Tripathis wife had asked him to get rid of Madhumita would also be attached with the chargesheet.																								In his statement, Chaturvedi reportedly said he had approached Rai, who contacted Pandey to execute the murder at the poets Paper Mill Colony residence in Lucknow. 																								A confession before a magistrate can be used as evidence in court.																								The CBI has also seized the country-made revolver that was used in the murder.																								Former chief minister Mayavati had handed over the case to the CBI on June 24 after buckling under the political pressure by Opposition parties.																								The Opposition had alleged that the Bahujan Samaj Party leader was shielding her cabinet colleague.

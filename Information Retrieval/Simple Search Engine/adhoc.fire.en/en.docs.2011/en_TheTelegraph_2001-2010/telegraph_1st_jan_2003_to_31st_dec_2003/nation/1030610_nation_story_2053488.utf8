		 Tuesday, June 10, 2003 				 Gehlot minister on CBI radar
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, June 9: Rajasthan home minister Gulab Singh Shaktawat may soon be questioned by the CBI over the alleged murder of his domestic help, Badan Lal Rawat.																								A seven-member special team of the bureau, led by deputy inspector-general Harbans Singh, started investigations on reaching Jaipur on Saturday.After going through the FIR filed in the case, the team questioned Badans father Hama and brother Roop Lal yesterday and today. 																								The two had alleged that Badan, whose body was found near Durgapura station here on May 22, was murdered. The sleuths visited the site on Saturday and decided to talk to people in the locality and eyewitnesses, if any, to the incident. City superintendent of police (south) Sanjay Agrawal met the team yesterday.																								Police had at first registered a suicide case at Sanganer police station, within whose limits the Durgapura station falls.																								Later, a murder case was registered at Sodala police station, prompted by a court order on Roops complaint that the police were refusing to file his complaint.																								Roop had contested the police theory that his brother committed suicide by throwing himself before a train. In his petition to the court, he said there was what looked like a bullet wound on Badans head, indicating murder. Roop also demanded that Shaktawat be brought under the purview of the probe. As a result, the minister was made a respondent in the court petition.																								Following the demands by Badans family for registration of a murder case, the government recommended a CBI investigation.

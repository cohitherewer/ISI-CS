 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 29: Calcutta High Court today gave a man a taste of law after he disobeyed the courts order to spend a week with his wife at his in-laws.																								The division benchs attempts to reunite the deaf-mute couple went in vain and it rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Debasish Mitra, his father Jatindranath, mother Nandita, brother Dibyendu and aunt Shova Das.																								Kajori had filed an FIR at Serampore police station against husband Debasish and her in-laws for torturing her.																								After Kajori pleaded with the judges not to send her back to her in-laws home at Sarsuna in Behala, the bench had on August 22 ordered Debasish to spend a week at her home. Justices A. Talukdar and A.K. Bishi told the couple to come back to court next Friday.																								Today, a lawyer for Debasishs family told the bench that a lawyer had escorted him to Kajoris house in keeping with the courts order. But the next day, the lawyer escorted Debasish back to his home at Sarsuna. When the bench asked why, the lawyer said it was unwise for a man to stay with his wife at the in-laws home.																								Kajori submitted in court that they were happy at her home for the brief period but Debasishs family took him away.

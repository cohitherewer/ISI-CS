		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Delhi upset over Russia help to Pak
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Dec. 11: Indias time-tested ally Russia has let down Delhi, and that too to humour Pakistan when Islamabad managed to push through a resolution at the UN early this week. 																								The wrinkle in India-Russia ties showed up when Pakistan decided on a resolution on confidence-building measures to resolve regional and sub-regional conflicts. 																								It was passed in the UN General Assembly with 73 votes, though the US, the European Union, India and 58 other members opposed the move. Russia, however, abstained along with 48 others. 																								India, though not unhappy with the outcome of the voting, was disappointed with the Russians. They were aware of our discomfiture over the resolution and instead of opposing the resolution, Moscow decided to abstain. This is really disappointing, a foreign ministry official said. 																								The silver lining, according to the official, was that this must be a major setback for Pakistan as it could not garner more than 73 votes in its support for the resolution. 																								On the face of it, there is nothing wrong with the resolution and under normal circumstances, it would have had Indias support as well. But then, Pakistan had made it clear the resolution had the subtext of South Asia and its tensions with India.																								While speaking on the measures, the Pakistanis had stressed the need for the UN to play a monitoring role in maintaining peace between two warring sides.

		 Tuesday, October 07, 2003 				 Sari scam reprieve
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Oct. 6: A Tamil Nadu special court has acquitted all six people, including a former minister, on charges of involvement in the Rs 11.42-crore sari and dhoti scam that dates back to Jayalalithaas 1994-96 regime.																								Todays acquittal of Indira Kumari, former social welfare and handlooms minister, along with five others is another in the long list of corruption cases against ADMK ministers and bureaucrats to have fallen through.																								Chargesheets have been filed before special courts in 25 of the 46 corruption cases that the previous DMK regime had brought against ministers and officials of the Jayalalithaa government.																								The chief minister and some of her former cabinet colleagues and officers have already been acquitted in the coal import case, the Pleasant Stay Hotel case and in two Tansi land deal cases. An appeal in the last Tansi case is pending in the Supreme Court.																								Only four major graft cases remain before special courts now. These include the Spic disinvestments case, which is being probed by the CBI, the free footwear distribution scam and the main disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa and her friend Sasikala, besides what is dubbed the London Hotel case.

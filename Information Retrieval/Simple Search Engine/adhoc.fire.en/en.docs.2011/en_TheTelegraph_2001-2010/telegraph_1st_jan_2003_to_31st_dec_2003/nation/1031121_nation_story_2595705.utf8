 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 20: The Indian and US navies are working on joint exercises of their special forces. A two-day meeting of the executive steering group of the two sides was considering an exercise schedule that would involve Indian marine commandos (marcos) and US Navy Seals.																								Indias marine commandos are involved in counter-insurgency operations in the Wular Lake in north Kashmir.																								Defence sources said the meeting of the executive steering group was also considering exercises in salvage, diving, submarine search and rescue (Sarex) and counter-terrorism warfare in the seas.																								The deputy chief of the navy, Vice Admiral S. Gopalachari, and Vice Admiral Robert Willard, commander of the US Pacific Commands seventh fleet, were leading the delegations. The Indian Navy has been looking to acquire underwater systems. In 1998, India was negotiating to buy submarine rescue gear from the US when Washington barred military sales following the nuclear tests.

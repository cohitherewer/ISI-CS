The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 BJP sweep links rivals in Andhra 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Dec. 25: The BJPs recent Assembly poll sweep in the countrys north has brought Opposition parties in Andhra Pradesh to the negotiating table.																								After months of deliberation, the Congress, the CPM, the CPI, the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti met for the first time today and decried the attempt of the government to malign them over alleged irregularities in the electoral rolls.																								The leaders of the five parties told the reporters later that the ruling Telugu Desam Party and its ally, the BJP, had made a tamasha of the roll revision and was passing the buck to rivals. The Telugu Desam is responsible for the large number of bogus voters and the latest spate of 51 lakh applications for new voters, alleged state Congress president D. Srinivas.																								In a resolution passed at the meeting, the parties urged the Election Commission  two teams of which are in the state to look into the allegations  to weed out the bogus voters.																								Separate machinery should be deployed for the purpose of conducting gram sabhas. Even if the process is time consuming, thorough scrutiny is essential to stop official rigging of the polls, the resolution said.																								The Opposition proposes to make a representation to both governor Surjit Singh Barnala and the poll panel to extend the time for the revision and not allow a hasty exercise to suit the Desams political objectives. The visiting panel officials had on Monday ruled out any change in schedule for the roll revision.																								The meeting, however, did not throw up any firm Opposition alliances or even a new platform. We have discussed all issues but will keep them in the backseat till the announcement of elections, Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao said.

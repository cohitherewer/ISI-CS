		 Saturday, August 02, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Apex court notice on mad cow check				 																																																	New Delhi: Amid fears that India will be the worst-hit if there is an outbreak of the mad cow or the foot-and-mouth disease in the coming years, the Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to the Union industry and environment ministries and the Central Pollution Control Board, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																										The notices were issued on a petition cautioning that there was a risk of the diseases being spread by the over 3,600 abattoirs and slaughter houses in the country due to unhygienic disposal of animal wastes.				 																																																										A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and B.. Agrawal also issued notices to the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Development Corporation and the Agricultural and Processed Food Industries Export Development Authority on the allegation of the petitioner that efforts were on to establish one more abattoir in Aligarh without facilities for disposal of animal wastes.				 																																																										The petition, filed by a member of the National Commission on Cattle, Laxmi Narain Modi, contended that biological and microbial environmental pollution were reaching dangerous levels in the country and would result in the intense spread of epidemics, particularly bovine spongiform encephalopathy or the mad cow disease.				 																																																										Appearing for Modi, senior counsel Ranjit Kumar contended that the court should issue appropriate orders to make it mandatory for all abattoirs, slaughter houses and meat processing units to incinerate all animal wastes.				 																																																										If incineration were not done, various viral and bacterial pathogens breed in the very animal wastes and have potential to infect humans and other animals, the counsel argued. He also pointed out that the mad cow disease had the potential to spread in epidemic proportions.				 																Assent to prisoner transfer bill				 																																																	New Delhi: A bill to help transfer of foreign convicted persons to their country and reception of Indian prisoners from foreign countries was adopted by the Lok Sabha on Friday, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										India has bilateral treaties that enable transfer of prisoners with only three countries  the UK, Canada and Norway. The law would help enter similar treaties with other countries.				 																																																										Replying to a brief debate on the Repatriation of Prisoners Bill, 2002, minister of state for home I.D. Swami said the humanitarian law in conjunction with bilateral treaties would help transfer of foreign convicted persons languishing in Indian jails to their countries and vice versa.

Track obstruction				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): An inquiry into the derailment of a train at Konkan railway in June has revealed that the accident was caused by obstruction of track. The derailment of Karwar-Mumbai Central Holiday Special on June 22 between Vaibhavwadi and Rajapur stations, in which 52 people were killed, was caused due to obstruction on the track, an official release said.

Prior to the terrorist attacks on July 21 near Katra and on July 22 in Akhnoor, around 3,500 pilgrims used to leave Jammu for the cave shrine every day. On Friday, only 724 pilgrims embarked on the pilgrimage.

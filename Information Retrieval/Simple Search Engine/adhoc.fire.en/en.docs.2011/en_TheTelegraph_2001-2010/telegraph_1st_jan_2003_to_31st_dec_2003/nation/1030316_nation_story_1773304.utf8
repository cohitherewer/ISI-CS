		 Sunday, March 16, 2003 				 Sangh in shakha ban challenge
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 15: The RSS has dared the Delhi government to ban its shakhas at municipal parks and public places after mayor Jai Shree Panwar said yesterday that the shakhas were indulging in politics in the name of morning exercises and should be stopped.																								Sangh shakhas can be stopped only by the Sangh. We are treating the mayors statement like a mere statement. If she really wants to stop the gatherings, the procedure is to get the MCD (Municipal Corporation of Delhi) to pass a resolution to this effect, RSS spokesman Ram Madhav said.																								Madhav questioned the corporations right to give such an order and said if the mayor had a problem maintaining the parks because of a cash crunch, the RSS would do the needful. If such an order is given, we will reply to it in a constitutional way, he added.																								Madhav said that before Independence, the British rulers had directed government employees in the Central Provinces to stop attending shakhas when the RSS had made inroads in the region in a big way. Those who think of following the Britishers footsteps should remember what happened to our former rulers, he warned.																								Addressing reporters at the Sanghs Delhi headquarters, Madhav also distanced himself from the support offered by the organisations Hindi mouthpiece, Panchajanya, to beleaguered Union minister Shanta Kumar, who was in the line of fire for allegedly scuttling the BJPs prospects in the recent Himachal Pradesh elections. Its an internal party matter and the way the issue is being handled is correct. The Sangh has the image of a disciplined organisation and anyone who tries to sully this image has no reason to be tolerated, he said. 																								We are happy with the partys move, he added, asked about the BJPs decision to issue Kumar a show-cause notice. 																								Panchajanya had backed Kumars statement made soon after the BJPs dismal showing in the hill state  in which he said bad governance was the main factor for the partys defeat.

		 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Terror law four get bail on fourth attempt
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Dec. 18: Madras High Court today granted conditional bail to the jailed Tamil Nationalist Movement leader P. Nedumaran and three others following the Supreme Courts directives on Tuesday on bail provisions under the anti-terror law.																								A division bench of Justices V.S. Sirpurkar and M. Thanikachalam ordered the release of Nedumaran, Suba Veerapandian, Pudukottai Pavanan and Thyappan, who have been held under the law for over a year now, on furnishing personal bonds. All had been accused of supporting the banned LTTE at a public meeting in the citys old Anand Theatre premises.																								Nedumaran was arrested on August 1, 2002, under the laws Section 21, the same provision that sent MDMK chief Vaiko to prison. The bail petitions of Nedumaran and the others followed the anti-terror law special courts rejection of their bail applications three times. 																								While upholding the validity of the anti-terror law on Tuesday, the apex court had ruled that those accused could seek bail even before the expiry of the one-year period and normal bail provisions would apply after a year, without the rigours of Section 49(7). 																								Nedumaran may not be able to come out of jail immediately as he has to get bail in a few other non-Pota cases. 																								Vaiko said in a statement the apex courts observations and instructions while disposing of his writ petition challenging Section 21 was a partial victory to me. Jaya divestment case																								Chief minister Jayalalithaa today told a special court hearing the Spic disinvestment case that her governments nod to state-owned Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation to renounce its rights in the joint sector company, Spic, had caused no loss to the exchequer.

		 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Double remand blow to Daler 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Daler Mehndi at the district court in Patiala on Wednesday. (PTI)																								Chandigarh, Dec. 24: For the first time in his career, Punjabi pop star Daler Mehndi will not usher in the new year regaling fans on stage. He will be behind bars.																								The police remand of Daler, accused in an illegal trafficking case, was extended today by four days till December 28 today by Patiala senior civil division judge P.S. Dhanoa after police submitted to the court that they had to recover some documents from the singer.																								Daler has also been sent to judicial custody till January 4 in another case in which he has been accused of threatening a computer operator in the police department.																								His brother Shamsher, a co-accused in the illegal immigration case, is in judicial custody along with three others. 																								We sought extension of (the) police remand as Dalers passport and other documents relating to the number of shows the singer has conducted abroad are yet to be recovered. We will be able to get evidence from copies of his old passports, Patiala senior superintendent of police A.S. Rai said.																								Daler, accompanied by superintendent of police Ratan Lal Monga, heading the special investigation team probing the immigration racket, will be taken to Mumbai and Delhi for the recovery of the documents. 																								The singer has already been questioned on his trips abroad, troupe members, associates, bank accounts and some documents seized from his office and residence in New Delhi.																								Daler today complained that he had been subjected to over 20 hours of interrogation and bombarded with the same set of questions. He said he was suffering from high blood pressure and doctors attending on him did not prescribe any medicine. I am innocent, the singer stressed. 																								The bhangra star has alleged that the corrupt Patiala police had demanded Rs 1.5 crore from him to clear his name in the case.																								Patiala police are also investigating whether Daler and his brother were involved in arranging NRI marriages in Punjab. There are many instances where young girls have been duped by NRIs. They come on a holiday and marry. They promise to send relevant documents. But once they leave India, that is the last anyone hears from them, a police officer said.

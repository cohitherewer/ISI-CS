When the matter came up for hearing before Justice Vijaya Tahilramani on September 30, the judge said in the open court that Avinash Sanas wife came to her residence and tried to influence her.				 																																																										Sanas, a former secretary to a Maharashtra minister and a Class-I employee of the state government, had allegedly played a major role in the multi-crore answer paper scam that rocked the Maharashtra Public Service Commission.				 																																																										This, the judge said, is a serious matter and, hence, she would not like to hear the bail plea of the accused.				 																																																										Justice Tahilramani referred the petition to Chief Justice C.K. Thakker and urged him to assign the matter to another judge.				 																																																										The Anti-Corruption Bureau had recovered crucial evidence from his house and obtained statements from witnesses about his role in the scam. He also allegedly had links with co-accused and dismissed deputy municipal commissioner of Thane Vishwanath Kelkar.				 																																																										Sanas had urged the court to grant him bail as he had been in custody for the past one year.				 																																																										According to the bureau, 24 accused in this case had connived to substitute answer papers of 399 candidates who had taken written tests for the posts of mantralaya assistants, police sub-inspectors and sales tax inspectors in 1999.				 																Minister injured in lift crash Bareilly (PTI): Union minister of state  for heavy industries Santosh Gangwar was injured when an  elevator carrying him crashed to the ground following a  power failure.

The lift came to a halt about five feet from the ground due to a power failure, trapping the minister inside for a few minutes.				 																																																										When power was restored, the lift started descending freely as the cable holding it had broken and crashed with a heavy thud, the sources added.				 																																																										Gangwar, who suffered a fracture in his left leg, was admitted to a local hospital. Arrangements were being made to shift him to Delhi, the sources said.				 																2 held for army job racket				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): With the arrest of two persons, including a deputy director with the food and civil supplies ministry, Delhi police claimed to have busted an employment racket.

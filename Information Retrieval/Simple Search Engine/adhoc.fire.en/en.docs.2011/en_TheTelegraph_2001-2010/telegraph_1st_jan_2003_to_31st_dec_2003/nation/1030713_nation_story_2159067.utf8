		 Sunday, July 13, 2003 				 Roop Kanwar case reopens in Jaipur
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jaipur, July 12: Hearings have resumed in the Roop Kanwar case after a decade, with the Supreme Court lifting a stay on the trial of the accused under the prevention of sati act.																								The Rajasthan BJP vice-president and the newly-appointed state chief of the partys youth wing are among those against whom the Jaipur district and sessions court has resumed legal proceedings for allegedly glorifying sati.																								Rajendra Rathore and Pratap Singh Khachariawas, chief of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, were chargesheeted after the 1987 sati incident at Deorala village near Jaipur, where Roop Kanwar jumped onto the pyre of her husband.																								Khachariawas is the nephew of Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, who was leader of the Opposition in Rajasthan at the time the 18-year-old Rajput bride committed sati.																								Rathore was health minister when a Shekhawat-led BJP government ruled the state. He was elevated recently after Rajasthan unit president Vasundhara Raje reconstituted the state executive.																								The Supreme Court had stayed proceedings in the lower court following appeals by the accused, but it dismissed all the petitions in April. This led the sessions court to reinstate proceedings after 10 years.

		 Saturday, September 13, 2003 				 Central rule cry with ethics dig
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 12: Within hours of the Supreme Court pulling up the Gujarat government for its eyewash of an appeal in the Best Bakery case, the Congress sought to remind A.B. Vajpayee of his raj dharma lecture to Narendra Modi.																								An anguished Prime Minister had told the chief minister after a tour of riot-hit Gujarat in April last year that he should follow raj dharma (ethics of governance).																								The Congress said Vajpayee should clamp Presidents rule on the state. 																								If the Supreme Court has found the Gujarat government guilty of not following raj dharma, it is time for the government of India and the Prime Minister to follow raj dharma. The Prime Minister should introduce Presidents rule so that rule of law could be revived in the state, Congress chief spokesperson S. Jaipal Reddy said.																								He added that the apex courts indictment of the government over its omissions and commissions and attempt to sabotage the prosecution of the accused was unprecedented. 																								Reddy said it only confirmed the charges that had been levelled against it by the National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission for Women.																								Reddy said the indictment called for drastic action and added that the Centre should invoke Article 356 and sack the government to restore rule of law in the state.																								The spokesman said the Congress had demanded imposition of Presidents rule earlier, but now we are convinced more than ever before that the Gujarat government will never bring the guilty to book.

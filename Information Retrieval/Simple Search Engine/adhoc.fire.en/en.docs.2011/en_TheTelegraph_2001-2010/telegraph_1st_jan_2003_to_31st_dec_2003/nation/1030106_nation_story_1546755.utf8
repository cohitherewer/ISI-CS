																								Mumbai, Jan. 5: The Maharashtra government has ordered a probe into a controversial AIDS awareness campaign in the city, reports our correspondent. 																								The popular campaign, featuring Balbir Pasha, a character created to symbolise the freewheeling urban Indian male, drew protests from NGOs for sending out wrong signals, especially in its depiction of women as the source of the HIV virus.																								Yesterday, state health minister Digvijay Khanvilkar directed health secretary Navin Kumar to look into complaints that the campaign was in bad taste. 																								The campaign had also led to a heated discussion in the Assembly during the winter session.																								The health department will seek information from the Population Services International, the NGO that has issued the campaign.

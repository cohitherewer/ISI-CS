		 Monday, October 20, 2003 				 Govt contests Salman order
																								Mumbai, Oct. 19 (PTI): The Maharashtra government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging a Bombay High Court order which dropped the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Salman Khan in a hit-and-run case.																								The petition will come up for hearing after October 27, official sources said today. The actor will be defended by criminal lawyer Dipesh Mehta.																								In view of this development, the trial in a magistrates court may not commence on Tuesday. It is likely to be adjourned till the apex court decides on whether the offence falls within the scope of Section 304 (2) of the IPC, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which attracts a 10-year jail term.

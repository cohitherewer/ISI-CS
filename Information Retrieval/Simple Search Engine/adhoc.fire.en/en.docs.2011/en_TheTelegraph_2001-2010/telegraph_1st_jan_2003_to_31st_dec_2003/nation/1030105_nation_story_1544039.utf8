		 Sunday, January 05, 2003 				 Kalam call for Mission Space
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Jan. 4: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam once again combined his roles  that of First Citizen and renowned scientist  to call for evolving a common minimum global space mission to solve the impending crises regarding energy, water and mineral resources.																								The President also urged all the countries in the world to initiate a global force to protect the worlds space assets.																								Kalams presentation, at the Space Summit session of the 90th Indian Science Congress here, was the first by any President in the history of the congress.																								By making the presentation, the former missile scientist bypassed many protocols, especially the custom that gives the President the position of the inaugurator or chief guest at any meeting.																								The Space Summit session was inaugurated by Union minister for space Vasundhara Raje Scindia, with Kalam playing the role of a special speaker.																								Kalam pointed out, to the 2,000 scientists assembled at the congress, that advancing the common minimum global space mission is important because the Earths resources are getting depleted rapidly.																								Kalam said the space mission would become a reality only if the countries of the world agreed to have a 50-year perspective of international co-operation.																								My suggestion to the global space community is: if you have knowledge, let others light their candles at it... and thus share the goodness of life and mind across all humankind, the President said.																								Indian Space Research Organisation chief K. Kasturirangan told the summit that Indias lunar mission was slated to take off in 2007. He added that India planned to develop high bandwidth agriculture satellites.

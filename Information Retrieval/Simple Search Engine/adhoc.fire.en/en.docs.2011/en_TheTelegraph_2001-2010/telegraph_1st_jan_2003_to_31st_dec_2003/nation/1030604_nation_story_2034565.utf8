		 Wednesday, June 04, 2003 				 Power crisis adds to Orissa woes
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, June 3: A freak windstorm yesterday uprooted two power transmission towers in Orissa, plunging five districts into darkness instead of bringing relief to residents battling the hottest summer in several years.																								Power had not been restored in most areas of these districts till late this evening. Officials of the Grid Corporation of Orissa (Gridco) said engineers were working round-the-clock on the damaged towers, each of 220-KV capacity, and hoped to complete the task within the next 24 hours.																								The windstorm swept through Nayagarh district, causing the maximum damage to the Bhanjanagar-Chandaka transmission line and cutting off power supply to Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Nayagarh, Puri and Ganjam. 																								Though Gridco drew power from Talcher thermal power station and supplied it through the Choudwar-Mancheswar 132-KV line, there was intermittent loadshedding in most places. Bhubaneswar continued to reel under power cuts today.

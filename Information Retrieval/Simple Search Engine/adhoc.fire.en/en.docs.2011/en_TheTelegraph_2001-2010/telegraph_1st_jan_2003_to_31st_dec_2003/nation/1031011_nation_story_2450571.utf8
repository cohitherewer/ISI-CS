 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 10: Expressing shock over the theft of computer discs from the Defence Research and Development Organisations facility in the capital, the Opposition Congress has demanded a probe and an explanation from the Prime Minister.																								We are deeply shocked to learn about the huge theft. We demand that the Prime Minister make a comprehensive statement on the extent of the damage inflicted on the nations defence, party chief spokesman Jaipal Reddy said today.																								Reddy also expressed shock at the disclosure that neither the DRDO nor the defence ministry took the matter seriously even five days after the discovery of the theft of the highly-sensitive data.																								He said the lost data also included vital information on the countrys nuclear command-and-control systems and secret encryption codes for top defence communications.																								The chief spokesman said he was surprised that the defence minister did not inform the external affairs ministry, the Research and Analysis Wing and the Intelligence Bureau about the extent of the loss of data. It should have been done without wasting time to pre-empt attempt to undermine the national security apparatus, he added.																								In view of the implications for national security, the Opposition party spokesman said the investigation must be entrusted with a joint team of the RAW and the Intelligence Bureau.

		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Khaki shuffle in wake of scam
 ANAND SOONDAS Mumbai, Dec. 11: The special  investigation team, probing the fake stamp paper scam, today  questioned a former chief of the state police even as the  government went in for a major revamp in the department,  transferring 48 officers.																								The shuffle came on a day Opposition leader Narayan Rane created a stir by alleging in Nagpur that deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbals nephew, Sameer, was questioned in the same case. The SIT, however, refused comment.																								Bhujbal, whose Nationalist Congress Party is part of the Congress-led coalition that rules Maharashtra, dismissed the allegation, saying Sameer was not in the country. He is in the US, the minister said.																								Bhujbal himself has been feeling the heat with the Opposition BJP and the Shiv Sena demanding an investigation into his role in the scam as he is in charge of the police department. Without naming anybody, Opposition leaders have also been saying that a senior NCP leader was aware of the scam and had taken money to help out many of the accused.																								Tired of the mud slinging, Bhujbal had yesterday announced that the state government was ready to have the scam investigated by the CBI as nobody in the ruling coalition had anything to hide.																								The morning, however, began on a familiar note. The SIT called to Subhash Malhotra, a former director-general of police, and put him through two rounds of intense grilling for about eight hours. Called around 11, Malhotra left the investigating teams Worli office at 7 pm. 																								Malhotra was Maharashtra police chief when the Rs 39,000-crore scam, masterminded by Abdul Karim Telgi, came to light two years ago. He is believed to have given the arrested former Mumbai police commissioner, Ranjit Singh Sharma, a clean chit even after the Jaiswal committee, which probed the role of police officials in the interstate racket, held him guilty on certain counts of omission and commission.

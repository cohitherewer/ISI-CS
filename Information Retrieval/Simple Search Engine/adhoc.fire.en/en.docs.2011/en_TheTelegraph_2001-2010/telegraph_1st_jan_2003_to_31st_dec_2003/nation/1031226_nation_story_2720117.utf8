		 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Pawar U-turn on ultimatum
 ANAND SOONDAS				 	 Mohite Patil in Maharashtra on Thursday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Dec. 25: The Nationalist Congress Party has named Vijaysinh Mohite Patil as a replacement for Chhagan Bhujbal who resigned as Maharashtra deputy chief minister on Tuesday over an attack on a television channels local office.																								It also decided to continue its alliance with the Congress for next years Assembly elections. NCP chief Sharad Pawar today backtracked on the ultimatum given to the Congress yesterday to decide on an electoral ally and even said Sonia Gandhis foreign origin was not an issue.																								Even as the NCP launched a damage-control exercise, the embattled Bhujbal was rushed to Breach Candy hospital here with complaints of exhaustion, sleeplessness and very high blood pressure. The controversial designer suit-loving, self-confessed narcissist was admitted to the same hospital last week with similar ailments.																								His party chief Pawar was a changed man at the NCP headquarters today. We are a small party and are in no position to issue any ultimatum, he said. 																								Pawar was responding to yesterdays statement by some party colleagues on the opening day of the two-day NCP convention that the Congress should announce a pre-poll alliance by next Wednesday.																								They had warned that the NCP would fight all 288 Assembly seats alone if the deadline was not met.																								The party today steered clear of contentious issues and said it would be happy to ally with secular parties. Pawar said he had already had positive discussions with chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, who belongs to the Congress, over a possible tie-up.																								Pawar said his thoughts were focused on the Lok Sabha elections. If the two parties agree to tie up, the alliance will hold gold for both the Assembly and general elections, he said.																								The NCP chief went all out to placate Marathas by naming members of the community for Bhujbals twin posts of deputy chief minister and home minister. The latter post has gone to R.R. Patil. Pawars decision to make Bhujbal, a Mali, the deputy chief minister in 1999 had not gone down well with the Maratha lobby.																								Mohite Patil spearheaded the campaign to oust Bhujbal once it was alleged that he had shielded Abdul Karim Telgi, mastermind of the fake stamp paper scam. 																								The new deputy chief minister led a chorus of disgruntled NCP leaders, saying Bhujbal was doing nothing for the partys declining fortunes and had instead become a liability.																								The deputy chief ministers credibility hit rock bottom after police inspector Dilip Kamath, himself in jail for his links with Telgi, wrote a letter to the governor alleging that Bhujbal had a major role in the racket.																								Matters went out of hand when Telgi, through his lawyer Abdul Rehman, alleged that Bhujbal was the scam mastermind.

		 Saturday, November 15, 2003 				 Pak boy goes home
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chandigarh, Nov. 14: Delhi took another step to improve relations with Islamabad when a Pakistani boy, Dinesh Kumar, walked into his country at Wagah today.																								The 16-year-old, whose release coincided with Childrens Day, said he was taking with him fond memories of his stay at the Faridkot observation house, otherwise called juvenile jail.																								I will always remember the sweet behaviour by jail members, particularly jail cook Ram Piari, he said as he bent down to touch her feet. Dinesh also praised jail teacher Inderjit Singh. He not only delivered good books on regular basis to all the Pakistani boys during detention, but also helped strengthen our moral values and brotherhood. The boy from Sindhs Amarkot had strayed into India a year ago.  Jamali talks offer																								Pakistani Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali today said in Islamabad he is ready to visit India any time to discuss all the problems, including Jammu and Kashmir, if Atal Bihari Vajpayee agrees.

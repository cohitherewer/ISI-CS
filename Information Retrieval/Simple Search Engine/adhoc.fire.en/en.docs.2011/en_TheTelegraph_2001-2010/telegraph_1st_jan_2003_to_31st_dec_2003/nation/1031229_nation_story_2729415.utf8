 DEBABRATA MOHANTY 																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 28: Bijlee, sadak, pani was the cry in 2003. But in 2004, the mantra will be jal, jungle and zameen to woo tribals here. 																								The old chant that won the BJP Chhattisgarh is now being remodelled by the Sangh parivar to win tribals in backward areas in Orissa with an eye on the nearing general elections. 																								The Sangh top brass is unsure if the earlier slogan will pull tribals in the state. Therefore, the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, a Sangh outfit, is slowly working on issues concerning tribals here, keen to cash in on the feel-good factor. 																								The step also seems to have Atal Bihari Vajpayees blessings.																								I was specifically asked by the Prime Minister to look into different problems such jal, jungle and zameen being faced by tribals. The tribals are the real owners of forests, land and water. The Vajpayee government is determined to make a 20-year vision plan for the abandoned community of the country, chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Dilip Singh Bhuria, told a gathering of about 15,000 tribals here on Friday. 																								The meeting was organised by the Ashram as part of its golden jubilee celebrations but turned into a BJP campaign platform. 																								Never before have tribals in the country got so much of attention as under Vajpayee, Bhuria said, projecting Vajpayee as the messiah of tribals. 																								He also reminded the gathering that Lord Ram was the god of tribals. We are passing through a governance similar to Ram rajya. 																								Union tribal minister and state BJP leader Jual Oram also joined in singing paeans to the Prime Minister. He thanked Vajpayee for creating a new ministry to address problems being faced by the tribal community. 																								He said his ministry had sanctioned funds for making 200-odd films which would highlight the rich tribal culture. 																								The tribals have sacrificed a lot for the progress of the nation. Though they are the real inhabitants in forest areas, they were evicted from forestlands for establishing factories and projects, the minister said. 																								The Union minister is being tipped to become the Orissa BJP chief with an eye on the Lok Sabha elections. 																								About 22 per cent of Orissas population is tribal. 																								If there was praise for Ram rajya, there was also a veiled attack on Christian missionaries and tribals who had converted to Christianity.																								Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram president Jagadev Ram Oram demanded that tribals who converted to Christianity should not be provided reservations. According to him, after embracing a different religion they no longer remained tribals. 																								He said the Ashram had decided to organise trips for tribals to places like Puri. Tribal communities from Orissa and its neighbouring states would be taken to Puri to offer prayers to Lord Jagannath. 																								The organisation would reach out to at least 1 lakh tribal families to sensitise them on their rich culture. 																								An 80-member team would visit 120 big cities to make the plan successful, he said.

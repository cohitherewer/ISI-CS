		 Sunday, October 12, 2003 				 Mufti plea for emissary change
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Srinagar, Oct. 11: Frustrated with little progress in the proposed dialogue between the Centre and separatist leaders in the state, chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has requested Delhi to nominate another emissary in place of .. Vohra.																								During his visits to the Valley, Vohra was unable to draw much response from the separatist conglomerate, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, for his dialogue offer as its leaders chose to wait for an invitation for talks from the Prime Minister. 																								Sayeed is eager that the process gets under way between the central leadership and the Kashmiri separatist leaders as it is crucial to address what he calls the internal dimension of the Kashmir problem. 																								But the chief minister might have to wait longer even if the Centre agrees to nominate a high-powered interlocutor who has a more ostensible official status than the retired bureaucrat, as the Hurriyat leaders had been calling Vohra. 																								The Hurriyat is a divided house today, with two rival groups claiming to represent the real Hurriyat. 																								Any progress seems unlikely till the Hurriyat is able to sort out the mess or till such time as one of the two factions, led by Syed Ali Geelani and Moulvi Abbas Ansari respectively, accepts the supremacy of the other. 																								The chief minister, who came to power on a promise to involve Kashmiri separatist politicians in talks with the Centre, is acutely feeling the need for initiation of the dialogue because of the surcharged atmosphere after the failure of India and Pakistan to break the ice on the diplomatic front.

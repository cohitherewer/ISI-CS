The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, April 17, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Kidnapped industrialist freed				 																																																	 calcutta: Kidnapped industrialist Naresh Agarwal and his driver Sahadev Kandu were freed on Wednesday evening at Gobindpur near Dhanbad. They were reported missing 13 days ago while travelling by road from Jhalda in Purulia to Durgapur, reports our bureau.				 																																																	Police and CID have now confirmed that the industrialist had been kidnapped. This was the first such incident in Purulia and had drawn the attention of the Governor and the chief minister, both of whom were constantly inquiring about the developments in the investigations.				 																																																	We received a call this evening that they would be at this spot near Dhanbad. I went there with my associates and brought them back, Bishnu Agarwal, the Jhalda-based industrialists younger brother said. They returned home around 9 pm. Both appear to be in good physical health, but it has been a tremendous mental torture for them.				 																																																	He did not say whether any amount had to be paid as ransom. We had prepared ourselves for that, but apparently the constant pressure applied by the police and the CID made the abductors decide to release them, Agarwal said. Everyone in the family, including my 65-year-old mother, is so happy that Bhaiya has returned safely.				 																Noida officer jailed in land case				 																																																	 New Delhi: In a move that would act as a deterrent on land officials across the country in allotment of plots, the Supreme Court on Wednesday sentenced an official of the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) to one-week imprisonment for giving false facts about availability of plots in sector 42 of the industrial suburb of Delhi, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	A bench of Justices S.N. Variava and B.N. Aggarwal found S.C. Paberja guilty of contempt of court as he gave false facts and then apologised to the court in reply to a petition by the Uttar Pradesh Resident Employees Cooperative Housing Society.				 																																																	The judges refused to accept the apology of the official, holding we are not satisfied that the apology tendered is genuine or bonafide. We do not see any reason to accept the apology. The court had earlier asked the Noida authority to find out and inform the court about the availability of plots in sector 42. 				 																																																	The official in an affidavit on behalf of the authority stated that the petitioner society could not be allotted any land in the sector as no plot was available.				 																																																	But another official, on the directive of the court, filed an affidavit stating that land was available in the very sector.				 																																																	The apex court said Pabreja has given a false statement and we hold him for contempt of court and termed his apology an attempt to get out of the consequences of the false statement.				 																Joyride turns deathride				 																																																	 sonepat (PTI): Joyride on an autorickshaw proved costly for two children, who lost their lives, and left two injured after one among them started the vehicle but failed to control it, police said.				 																																																	The incident occurred at Rubra village, about 45 km from here, when children playing in the street found an unoccupied autorickshaw and decided to take a ride on it. On hearing loud cries, villagers rushed to help them, but two of them, identified as Dilsher and Deepak, succumbed to injuries before receiving medical aid.				 																Ganga diversion				 																																																	 dehra dun (PTI): Pilgrims at Hardwar will miss water of the Ganga from Wednesday night as the river is being diverted for a bridge construction. The arrangement will continue till April 29, during which pilgrims will not be able to take holy dip in the river at Har ki Pauri.				 																Tejpal warrant				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): A Delhi court has issued a bailable warrant against Tehelka chief Tarun Tejpal for not turning up at the hearing of a defamation case, filed by Samata Party leader Jaya Jaitley for allegedly linking her name to the defence scam. Jaitley claimed the statements on the Tehelka website were totally false.				 																Aravalli order				 																																																	 NEW DELHI (PTI): Concerned by the continuing mining activities in the eco-fragile Aravalli Hills despite a ban order, the Supreme Court has sought reports on the status of mining in Gurgaon and Faridabad districts of Haryana. The court order has come despite the Centres plea that most mines be allowed to operate as they complied with guidelines issued by the environment protection authority. 				 																Lawyers sacked				 																																																	 lucknow (PTI): The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court has quashed the appointment of 15 government lawyers made in contravention of rules and regulations. A division bench passed the order on a petition, which submitted that the state government had appointed lawyers who did not fulfil the required criteria as stated in the legal remembrance manual.				 																																																	In the wake of the growing demand for Hindi literature among migrant Indians in Australia, the Hornsby library in Sydney has opened a Hindi section. It has been started in association with the Indo-Australian Bal Bharathi Vidyalaya-Hindi School Inc.

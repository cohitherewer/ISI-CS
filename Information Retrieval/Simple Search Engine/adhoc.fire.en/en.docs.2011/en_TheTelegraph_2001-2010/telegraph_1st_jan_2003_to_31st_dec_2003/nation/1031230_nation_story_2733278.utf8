		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Scandal-hit Amarinder keeps quit letter ready
 GAJINDER SINGH Chandigarh, Dec. 29: Punjab  chief minister Amarinder Singh is expected to hand over  his resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi  within a day or two.																								Amarinder, who has been battling dissidence in the party for nearly a month, has decided to approach Sonia over allegations in the media regarding his son Raninders involvement in hawala transactions.																								A local daily yesterday carried a report alleging that Raninder had received $100,000 in the capacity of a partner in an IT firm called the Punjab Intranet Company while another $900,000 was awaited. Raninders partner in the company is reportedly called Leonard Freeke. 																								The chief minister admitted yesterday that Freeke was close to the family and used to stay with them during his visits to India.																								The report also alleged that crores were transferred by the firm from Amarinders New Moti Bagh Palace residence in Patiala.																								The chief minister and his son are clean in the matter. The only problem is that Freeke is known to them, said his aide.																								Now it is up to Sonia to decide whether Amarinder continues as chief minister or resigns. The chief minister will be carrying his resignation letter when he meets her.																								The allegations have come as a huge blow to Amarinder who had till Saturday managed to contain a rebellion in the Congress led by senior colleague and no. two in the cabinet Rajinder Kaur Bhattal.																								Quick to seize the initiative, Bhattal today demanded a CBI probe into the charges. Amarinder has been stating that his crusade against corruption cuts across party lines. Why is he silent when his son is being named for transferring money illegally? There should be a CBI probe into the affair and not by the state vigilance which has become Amarinders personal tool to intimidate his political opponents, Bhattal said.																								She said the corruption case against her was transferred from Bathinda to Chandigarh in 24 hours so that no one could accuse the Congress of going slow on a cabinet minister. 																								But more than that now its (the) chief ministers son who faces an allegation. The CM should adopt the same parameters for his family, she thundered.																								Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal, who like Bhattal, is facing corruption charges, had yesterday demanded Amarinders resignation over the allegations against his son. The BJP, too, today sought the chief ministers removal, saying two Punjab government officials were sent to the Netherlands to assess Freekes IT proposals to the state.																								Congress sources close to the chief minister compared the newspaper report to the St Kitts affair, which led to the downfall of Vishwanath Pratap Singh.																								Amarinder has so far ruled out ordering a CBI probe into the allegations.

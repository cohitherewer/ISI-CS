		 Wednesday, November 19, 2003 				 Srinagar test for CRPF
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Srinagar Nov. 18: Two days after the Central Reserve Police Force took over from the Border Security Force in the heart of Srinagar, the paramilitary force came under militant attack today.																								Late this evening, militants hurled grenades and opened fire from automatics near the headquarters of the CRPFs 15 Corps, killing one trooper and badly injuring two others, who are now at the Bone and Joint Hospital.																								We immediately rushed reinforcements and sealed the area, CRPF inspector-general V.B. Singh said.																								Late tonight, he said the exchange of fire in the area has stopped. Army and CRPF troops are jointly searching the Indira Nagar locality, Singh added.																								The militants have either escaped or, maybe, they are hiding in the area. We will again search the locality tomorrow morning, Kashmir range police chief K. Rajendra said. 																								Security around the corps headquarters was beefed up and traffic on the highway outside diverted. In the first phase of moving out the BSF from Kashmir, five of its battalions have been relieved by the CRPF.

		 Tuesday, November 04, 2003  Mayavatis chance to settle a score  and prove a point

They  will demonstrate whether the Mayavati-led Bahujan Samaj  Party will successfully emerge as a decisive force in the  central Indian state. In 1998, the Congress beat the  BJP by 2 per cent, but netted a comfortable majority. The  BSP had cornered 6 per cent of the votes. A cent per cent  addition of the Congress and the BSP votes, a near impossible  task, would have wiped the BJP off the map. In fact, the devil is in the detail.  The 1998 polls saw the BSP contest only 121 seats, but in  these it managed to corner more than one in 10 votes. These hold the key if  and only  if  the party manages to transfer its votes. Mayavati will also have to contain  any damage by Phool Singh Baraiya of Gwalior, the former  state unit chief who has parted company. Gwalior lies in  the Vindhya Pradesh region. It is here and in Madhya Bharat  that the BSP has actually grown into a formidable force.  In addition to Dalit youths, it has managed to reach out  to sections of the backward classes. These are all part of the Congress  traditional vote bank and any accord with the BSP, however  partial, will take the heat off the ruling party. There  is ample scope of a tie-up on the ground. The BSP won seven  seats and came second in 11. These 15-20 seats may well  be no-go zones for the Congress. The BSP in turn may be willing  to pull out in about 40 seats. Here, it polled less than  5 per cent of the votes, or finished in fourth or fifth  place. Its own votes would not be sufficient to build a  base for victory. But they could be critical in ensuring  the party falls in line with its leader Mayavatis newfound  dictum: defeat the BJP at all costs. Hurdles remain, especially in  the 58 seats where the smaller party finished in third spot.  It is here that there will be a lot of hard bargains to  be done. It is only by contesting more seats that it can  hope to increase its MLAs. Ideally, the party would like  to have the Congress reliant on the BSP to form and run  a government. Power can only come within its grasp if Mayavati  can play kingmaker. But the Congress in turn is no  pushover. It would try bowing to the smaller party but only  up to a point. The Congress would hope to win a secure majority  but draw in the BSP to beat back its arch rival. If the  BSP gets more seats in the bargain, it is fine by the Congress.  But the fragmentation of the polity beyond a point will  also harm the Congress prospects in Madhya Pradesh in the  long run. Unlike in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar,  the party has been alert to the aspiration of Dalits. The  Dalit Agenda two years ago has been followed by the largest  land reform programme in any north Indian state. This makes  any tie-up with a Dalit- led party of a finite nature. There is a meeting of minds at  the juncture due to the bitterness in the BSP leadership  after the recent break-up with the BJP in neighbouring Uttar  Pradesh. This has given the Congress just the chance it  was looking for. There is still a hint of anxiety  about an open alliance. The reasons are both tactical and  strategic. In 1993, an alliance in Uttar Pradesh brought  little cheer to the Congress and actually contributed to  erosion in its ranks. Local leaders denied tickets had little  incentive to stay on in the party. In Madhya Pradesh, the party is  far stronger than in Uttar Pradesh. After all, it has been  in power for all but four years since 1980 when led back  to office by Arjun Singh. The problem is that the Congress  is a multi-class, umbrella party that cannot afford to lose  out on the support of the upper castes and the Other Backward  Classes. It is still unclear whether they will vote for  a BSP candidate or not. An open alliance would actually  enable the BJP to reap the benefits of an anti-Dalit backlash.  It is to avoid this that Mayavati and Digvijay both favour  a tacit accord to an open alliance. It is still too early to say whether  this move can ensure another spell in power for the Congress. The fact is, the election is being  fought on caste and community lines. Unlike in his first  term, the chief minister is not confident of banking on  his record of governance. This has opened up space for ties  with the BSP. These may well see a sea change in state politics  with the advent of a third force in electoral politics.

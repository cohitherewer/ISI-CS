 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Judeo																								New Delhi, Dec. 17: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee may have used unkind words against him in the Rajya Sabha, the CBI may be at his heels and his party may be in no mood to rehabilitate him. 																								But none of this seems to have ruffled BJP leader Dilip Singh Judeo as he strutted outside Parliament today, twirling his moustache like Naseeruddin Shah in his tirchi topiwaale act in Tridev. 																								Chhattisgarh won on what the BJP says was the Jai Judeo factor, the protagonist of the cash-on-disc scandal today proved what stuff he is made of. 																								Driving into the Parliaments parking lot reserved for MPs late in the evening, Judeo, accompanied by two aides, shouted salaam as he spotted a group of journalists. 																								The chauffeurs of other MPs cars and hangers-on watched in rapt attention as he emerged in his trade-mark black safari suit, the only change being his full-sleeved shirt.																								Only one person was not impressed  the driver of the car next to Judeos Santro. He protested that the BJP leader had parked his car in a tirchi (crooked) angle, making it impossible for him to wheel his one out without denting Judeos. 																								But Judeo did not take any notice. He looked peremptorily at the driver of the car, which bore the official red light. 																								Waise bhi yeh buri tarah fansa hai, aur fansega, dekhna aap (as it is, he is badly trapped, now he will get into more trouble), the driver grumbled as Judeo walked away.

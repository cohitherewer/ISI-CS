																								Hyderabad, Aug. 28: Actress Jayaprada, the erstwhile president of the Telugu Desams womens wing, is all set to join the Congress, reports our special correspondent.																								Jayaprada had garnered the support of women for . Chandrababu Naidu after he parted ways with Desam founder .T. Rama Rao, but has kept herself away from the party as she was not nominated for another term in the Rajya Sabha.																								The actress, who was a regular participant at all Janmabhoomi programmes of the Desam, did not in the last two years attend the partys annual convention at Visakhapatnam and Tirupati, following her ouster from the politburo and the womens wing.																								Jayaprada is likely to call on Congress president Sonia Gandhi next month in Delhi and formally join the party. 																								Although she had initially shown an inclination to join the BJP, she seems to have had second thoughts in view of the existing relations between the Desam and the BJP.																								Jayaprada told The Telegraph over phone from Mumbai  where she is shooting for a Hindi film  that she has no plans to become active in the Desam. As it is an election season, I am being approached by all parties including the BJP, she said. The former MP added that she had confidence in Sonias leadership and the Congress support for womens rights.																								The BJP also faces a similar situation in Andhra Pradesh with actress Vijayshanti of Ishwar fame, who is the vice-president of the BJP mahila morcha, all set to join the Telengana Rashtra Samiti.

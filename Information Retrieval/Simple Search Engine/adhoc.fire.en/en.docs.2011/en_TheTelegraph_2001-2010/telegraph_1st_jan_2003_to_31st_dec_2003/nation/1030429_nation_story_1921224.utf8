(AFP) Debabrata  Mohanty Bhubaneswar, April 28:  Almost four years after the supercyclone ravaged the Orissa  coast, many survivors are still emotionally disabled, says  a report evaluating their psychosocial condition. The study was conducted by the  National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans),  Bangalore, and Action Aid India, a non-government organisation,  in the coastal districts of Puri, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara. The effect of the disaster was  so terrible that people were crying, sobbing, stupefied  and numb whereas a few were laughing without any apparent  reason in the first three months of the cyclone, the study  says. Depression was the predominant  mood for most. Some were easily irritable, were getting  angry, abusive and trying to hit each other on trivial matters. The symptoms were discovered during  Sneha Abhiyan, a psychosocial intervention by the NGO in  affected areas. Though things have improved over  the years, there are several victims who still experience  emotional upheavals and need psychiatric help. The supercyclone had ripped through  Orissa on October 29, 1999, killing about 10,000 people,  destroying over a million homes in 12 districts, and inflicting  damage worth Rs 20,000 crore. Immediately after, the government  and several NGOs had stepped in with the basic necessities  of food and cloth and withdrew after granting compensation  and rebuilding houses. But they overlooked the survivors  need for psychological help. The study has found that a year  after the supercyclone, some victims were suffering dissociative  convulsions and high suicidal tendencies. The youths were found to be more  addicted to country liquor and many shirked work and became  dependent on relief material. Almost 30-40 per cent of women  and adolescent girls of a specific community were found  to have become sexually promiscuous. As many as 54 per cent  adults complained of headaches and 44 per cent said they  couldnt sleep soundly. Psychological morbidity was found  to be high among adults, especially women. In ground zero,  Ersama, alone, 15 per cent of those diagnosed with post-trauma  stress were found to be heading for major depressive disorders. Nearly 35-45 per cent of the survivors  were perpetually scared and suffering from nervousness,  queasy stomach and difficulty in thinking. The study has sounded an alarm  for the current level of disability measures high on the  World Health Organisations disability assessment schedule. The survivors biggest disabilities  are being emotionally affected and its interference with  life. The study concludes that proactive  community intervention, including professional support,  is necessary to protect the vulnerable after such a disaster. The study was conducted with a  team of evaluators such as Dr R. Srinivasa Murthy, psychiatry  professor, Nimhans; Dr Nilamadhab Kar, associate professor  of psychiatry, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal; Dr Sharada  Swain, associate professor of psychiatry in Puri, and Dr  K. Sekar, psychiatric social worker. Action Aid now plans to carry  out similar studies in earthquake- and riot-hit Gujarat  and Jammu and Kashmir. The scope for similar study in  Jammu and Kashmir, where decade-long militancy had ruined  the social fabric, was also being explored. People need  to come out of social depression, Umi Daniel, regional  manager, Action Aid, said.

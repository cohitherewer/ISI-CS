 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Dec. 28: The National Security Act (NSA) will be slapped on the four persons accused of attacking a cultural troupe from Jammu and Kashmir on its way to Calcutta for a performance last week.																								The deputy inspector-general of Patna railway police said notices have been served on municipal councillor Ashok Yadav and his accomplices Mukesh, Saroj Kumar and Sajjan Kumar  all residents of Patna  to appear before the superintendent of railway police to record their statements. The first two were named by the troupe director, Balwant Thakur, in his complaint faxed from Calcutta on Thursday.																								We have to chargesheet the accused first, and then we will initiate the process of booking them under the NSA, said the officer, Kumar Rajesh Chandra. The decision to use NSA was made because such incidents not only tarnish the image of the state but also create a sense of insecurity among people passing through Bihar, he added.																								Thakur, whose troupe was attacked on Tuesday on Himgiri Express between Ara and Patna, continued to be cautious of a flare-up of an anti-Bihar sentiment in Kashmir. It is not a Kashmiri versus Bihari issue. Criminals are (there) in every society. No doubt those who attacked us belong to those sections in Bihar, he said.																								He told reporters at Patna Junction yesterday, on the troupes way home, that he had rejected the idea of a Kashmir bandh, suggested through phone calls from his home state.																								But he emphasised his troupe wanted Bihar police to act immediately and decisively. Book the culprits based on their PNR numbers given by us, he said.																								The proposal for NSA has to pass through three stages  from the superintendent to the district magistrate and on to the state home department. It would then have to be cleared by a three-member bench of the high court.																								Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadavs name is unnecessarily being used by these criminals, Thakur added. It gives a wrong message.																								Ashok, the main accused, is said to be an active member of the ruling RJD. The municipal council ward member had earlier this year filed nomination to contest the municipal mayors post.																								Ashok withdrew after another RJD member, Mansha Devi, the wife of the chief ministers brother Prabhunath Yadav, entered the fray. Ashok, who is a contractor, makes arrangements for several state functions in Patna. The accused is said to be absconding as he could not be traced today at his Bhanvar Pokhar home in the citys Sabjibag area.																								According to Chandra, the police have already procured the list of passengers of the coach in which the troupe was travelling.																								Contrary to officer-in-charge of Patna railway police station inspector A.K. Singhs consistent remarks to the media that no accused has been clearly named in the FIR, Chandra today said clear evidence against the four accused was available.																								Emphasising none will be spared if found guilty, Chandra added: There is no special provision for politicians or bureaucrats under the IPC.

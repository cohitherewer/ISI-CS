		 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Rights panel call to probe paramilitary
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 27: The National Human Rights Commission is seeking the authority to investigate excesses by paramilitary forces combatting insurgency in Kashmir and the Northeast.																								The Centre has ensured that paramilitary forces are not subject to a rights panel scrutiny by clubbing the Central Reserve Police Force, the Border Security Force and other central agencies with the army, navy and air force.																								The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, says the term armed forces means not just the army, navy and air force but also any other armed forces of the Union. The rights panel wants this clause amended to exclude paramilitary forces.																								Its reasons for seeking the amendment are evident from the criticism at international forums. The panels lack of jurisdiction over military and paramilitary forces is pointed out as a serious infirmity affecting its credibility. As a result, Indias commitment to human rights comes under a cloud.																								The government is fully aware that the national human rights act, as at present worded, prevents the commission from itself initiating an inquiry into, or investigating, the violation of human rights by the armed forces and that this provision has been widely criticised both at home and abroad, the panel says in its annual report for 2002-03, placed before Parliament during the winter session.																								Rights panel officials say in private that the Centre would not allow any civilian authority to have jurisdiction over the armed forces personnel as the defence services conduct their own court martial. But the commission wants some say over any excess committed by paramilitary forces.																								Its request to the Centre has been pending for the last two years. The government had replied: The present system of inquiry by the forces and punishment of the guilty has been working satisfactorily and, in view of this, it is felt that there is no need at the present stage to change the procedure that has already been spelt out in the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, for dealing with armed forces...the Government of India is transparent in dealing with complaints and there is no apprehension on this account.																								The panel, however, is not convinced. It has pointed out that the Centre  even at the highest levels  has frequently referred to the commissions existence and functioning as a sign of the importance Delhi accords to human rights.																								While it pays lip service to all this, the government is not interested in amending some of the existing provisions to strengthen our hands and help us to truly uphold human rights in this country, said an NHRC official who refused to be identified.

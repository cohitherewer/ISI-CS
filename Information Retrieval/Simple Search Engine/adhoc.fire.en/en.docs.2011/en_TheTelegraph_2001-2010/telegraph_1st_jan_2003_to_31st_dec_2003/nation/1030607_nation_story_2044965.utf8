		 Saturday, June 07, 2003 				 Somnath sees master stroke
																								Chennai, June 6 (PTI): CPM leader Somnath Chatterjee considers the Prime Ministers remark about his deputy, .K. Advani, leading the BJP to poll victory a master stroke to consolidate his position in the party.																								Although Chatterjee said the remark was an internal matter of the BJP, he could not help saying that party president M. Venkaiah Naidu was now working overtime to be loyal to Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								Speaking at a news conference here, Chatterjee said this was evident from the way Naidu was going all out to say Vajpayee was the unquestioned leader of the BJP.																								Congress secretary Satyajit Gaikwad, who met reporters at Meenambakkam airport on his arrival here today, fielded questions on the same subject.																								He said the BJP was known for its doublespeak. They have the habit of not only confusing people, but also their own rank and file.																								Yesterday, Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma had described his partys assessment of the recent contradictory statements by senior BJP leaders as an unmistakable power struggle between vikas purush Vajpayee and lauh purush Advani.

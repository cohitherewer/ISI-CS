		 Wednesday, April 16, 2003 				 Cop shunted for stripping colleague 
 MUKHTAR AHMAD 																								Srinagar, April 15: A day after a policewoman was stripped and paraded by her colleagues in the heart of Srinagar, after being reportedly arrested under mysterious circumstances from a house, the station house officer responsible has been relieved of the charge of Kral Khud police station.																								The Srinagar district police chief is looking into the incident of the SHO, Ghulam Nabi, and his men parading their colleague naked.																								An official of the police station said Ghulam Nabi had caught the woman in what he claimed to be a compromising position inside an abandoned house in the heart of the city. She was arrested along with four persons.																								The police handed over the woman to her parents today. The woman was sent for medical examination immediately. The four arrested with her are being held in Kral Khud police station. 																								Witnesses said the SHO had thrashed the woman and later paraded, after stripping her, in the locality on way to the police station. 																								If they were trying to teach the accused policewoman a lesson, the Kral Khud police have stretched this punishment too far. No one can imagine handing down a sentence like that. We can accept that the accused was nabbed in a compromising position. But is there some law in this land or not? asked a senior lawyer of Srinagar.																								The SHO of Kral Khud has been stripped of his charge and is now attached with the district police lines in Srinagar and will face an inquiry.																								We will take stern action against the officer once the inquiry is complete. This is a serious incident and we have ordered a high-level inquiry, said a senior police officer of the central Kashmir range. A case has been registered against the police officer.																								Suicide attempt																								Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds beautification drive has driven a man to attempt suicide after bulldozers razed his house and shop.																								Mohammad Maqbool, a resident of Kulgam town in Anantnag district, set himself on fire after finding his house razed by bulldozers. The demolition squad deployed by the man with the healing touch, for whom Maqbool had voted in the Assembly elections, had earlier destroyed his shop.																								The shopkeeper, who was at his wits end after losing both his home and his means of livelihood, sprinkled kerosene all over his body and set himself ablaze. He was taken to hospital with 90 per cent burns, where doctors gave him a slim chance of survival.

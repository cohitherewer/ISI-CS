		 Saturday, June 28, 2003 				 VHP spits fire, BJP plays it cool
 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES				 	 LK Advani with anti-corruption activist from Maharashtra Anna Hazare in Delhi on Friday. (PTI)																								Raipur/New Delhi, June 27: Threatening an aggressive mass movement, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad today stepped up its attack on the Centre though BJP sources made light of the outfits stridency.																								Ruling out talks with the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Praveen Togadia said: The Vajpayee government is again talking to those who do not respect the Indian Constitution or Supreme Court and are a body of fundamentalists.																								He was speaking at a press conference after the inauguration of the VHPs two-day national executive meeting in Raipur.																								We are preparing for a big fight for Ram temple construction but there will be no dharam sansad and a high power committee of sants will meet next month to take a final decision on the issue, he said.																								Vowing to finalise a Hindu agenda at the meet for the countrys saffronisation, Togadia hinted at drawing up a comprehensive strategy tomorrow.																								BJP sources said the Sangh outfits rhetoric might finally reinforce the impression that the VHP is unreasonable.																								We are not worried, a party office-bearer said. This is one initiative (Kanchi Sankaracharyas temple move), which if it succeeds, will earn us the goodwill of Indians for years to come. Anyway, Kashi and Mathura were never on our agenda. If Ayodhya is resolved, its good. They (the VHP) can shout and scream about the other places.																								An eye on gaining a simple majority in the Lok Sabha next year, the BJP realises it can no longer ignore the Muslim vote.																								Hindu votes are so badly split on caste lines that we can no longer bank on just those to cross the 180 mark. Getting 5 to 6 per cent of the Muslim vote is crucial, sources said.																								With both its progeny squabbling, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is torn over who to support in the Ayodhya dispute.																								At the core is the BJPs hint of support for the Sankaracharyas reported proposal delinking Ayodhya from the Kashi and Mathura shrines, and the VHPs firm rejection of such a move.																								The RSS will thrash out its dilemma at a high-level executive meet in Kanyakumari on July 4. A senior RSS source said: On the one hand, we cannot leave our ideological position, and on the other, we also have to take care of the BJPs interests.																								The RSS, however, is firm on its support to the VHPs demand for a central law to hand over the undisputed land to the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas. Spokesman Ram Madhav said they would pass a strong resolution on Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura, which would be a direction to all our organisations, including the BJP. Venkaiah vows unity																								BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu today tried to counter the impression that the Sangh was falling apart on the Ayodhya dispute. 																								If the government has to step in (at a later stage), it will take everyone into confidence, including the VHP. Nothing will be kept in darkness, he said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Jayalalithaa and Sassikala pray at the Chennai temple after being acquitted in the Tansi case on November 24. (PTI)																								Chennai, Dec. 2: ADMK ministers past and present are queuing up outside temples in ostentatious displays of thanksgiving after the threat to Jayalalithaas reign posed by the Tansi land deal case in the Supreme Court blew over. 																								Jayalalithaa had profoundly thanked God and visited an ancient Shiva temple on the outskirts of Chennai with friend Sassikala the day they were acquitted.																								Public works minister . Pannerselvam, who stood in for Jayalalithaa when she had to step down in connection with the case in 2001 and was being considered for the role again, stood out as the most loyal to Jayalalithaa when he offered prayers at the famous Lord Ayappa shrine in Sabarimala in neighbouring Kerala.																								Quietly driving down from Chennai, Panneerselvam, according to reports reaching here today, took a dip in the Pampa river on reaching the foothills of Sabarimala. Cleansed, he organised a feast for devotees by the river and went up to the temple to offer special prayers on behalf of the ADMK chief. He also donated Rs 10,000 to the All India Ayappa Seva Sangh there. 																								More spectacular was former minister Sarojas show of gratitude. She made a pilgrimage to the famous Murugan temple perched on the Palani hills in Dindigul district and tonsured her head. 																								Along with her family members and party supporters, Saroja then pulled the temples golden chariot through the four prakaras (enclosures) praying to the Lord that Jayalalithaa should continue to be the chief minister of the state.

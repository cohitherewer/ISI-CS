The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, July 06, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Vehicle certificate damages on bank				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi consumer court has ordered Citibank to compensate a client who had lodged a complaint stating he could not sell a vehicle that had been financed by the bank despite having cleared loan dues for the same.				 																																																										The bank has been ordered to pay compensation and cost of Rs 10,000 for refusing to issue a no-objection certificate to Ashok Kumar, a resident of east Delhis Laxmi Nagar.				 																																																										Denial of noc by Citibank to the complainant is an act of deficiency in service, New Delhi District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum president L.C. Jain and member Janak Juneja said in the order.				 																																																										In his complaint, Kumar stated that he had purchased a vehicle in August, 1997, under a hypothecation agreement with the bank for two years. But even after having paid all the 24 instalments, Kumar said he could not sell the vehicle for want of the certificate (form number 35) from Citibank.				 																																																										The bank, he alleged, deliberately did not issue the certificate and harassed him. 				 																																																										Kumar claimed compensation of Rs 1,57,420, including Rs 1 lakh for the reduction in value of the vehicle since June 1999, when he had wanted to sell it.				 																																																										Citibank argued that as its name was entered in the RC book as the lien holder of the vehicle till the complete repayment of the loan, it required the book to delete its name to remove further lien on the vehicle. But despite repeated reminders, the complainant had not furnished the book, it alleged.				 																																																	ejecting this argument, the forum said: RC book is issued by the registering authority and nobody can make changes in the book except the authority.				 																Boy beaten up by teachers, dies Ghaziabad (PTI): Police have registered  a case against a school headmaster after the parents of  a 14-year-old boy complained that their son had died because  he was beaten up brutally by him and other teachers.				 																																																										The student, Vasim, was allegedly beaten and kept without food for four days at Jami-a-Hizful Islam School at Jannat Masjid for breaking the wooden stand on which the Quran was kept, circle officer Dharam Bir Singh said.				 																																																										Vasim was then sent home where he died from the injuries despite being given medical treatment, Singh said.				 																																																										He said other students confirmed that he was beaten up badly by the headmaster and the teachers, who are absconding. 				 																Lahore bus from July 11				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): Suspense and confusion over the date for resuming the Indo-Pak bus link ended on Saturday with Delhi Transport Corporation announcing the relaunch of the Delhi-Lahore service from July 11.				 																																																										The relaunch of the service, snapped after an attack on Parliament by Pakistan-backed militants, is another confidence-building measure between the two countries after the Prime Ministers peace initiative in April.				 																Power cut violence				 																																																	Allahabad (PTI): Two state buses were set ablaze by a mob that had blocked traffic on Allahabad-Varanasi Road in protest against prolonged power cuts in the region. Police had to resort to a lathicharge to bring the situation under control on Friday evening. Traffic was restored later in the night. 				 																Man kills children				 																																																	Jaipur (PTI): A mentally deranged man killed his three sons and a daughter before allegedly committing suicide in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan. Police said Ganga Ram, 30, served rice mixed with poisonous substance to his children aged between four and 12 years and hanged them after they fell unconscious, in Samiter Phala village on Friday night.				 																Life imprisonment				 																																																	Hisar (PTI): Eleven persons were sentenced to life imprisonment by a fast track court here on Saturday for murdering a person nearly three years ago. The court, however, acquitted seven others also charged with the murder of Mani Ram in Sadalpur.				 																Engine derails				 																																																	Kochi (PTI): The engine of the Kottayam-Ernakulam train went off the tracks on Saturday morning near Ponnurunni bridge. Sources said no one was hurt and the cause of the mishap is not yet known. Rail traffic between Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram has been disrupted.				 																Tutor held 				 																																																	Kochi (PTI): A 16-year-old boy, caned by his tuition teacher for allegedly not concentrating in the class, was hospitalised at nearby Fort Kochi on Friday. Police have arrested the teacher, Saheer, and registered a case against him. Saheer runs the tuition centre at Chitrattapalam.																		Human resources development minister M.M. Joshi has promised assistance for preserving Persian. All Persian works and manuscripts are part of our national heritage and will be preserved through micro-filming and digitalisation, he said.

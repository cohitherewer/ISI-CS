		 Saturday, February 15, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Witness recall plea in Staines trial				 																																																	Bhubaneswar: The three defence counsels in the Graham Staines murder case have filed a petition before a trial court seeking the recall of 16 prosecution witnesses who were earlier cross-examined, reports our correspondent.				 																																																	The defence counsels led by Shyamananda Mohapatra said the recall was necessary as their deposition before the trial court of district judge M.M. Patnaik contradicted their earlier deposition before the Justice D.P. Wadhwa Inquiry Commission. 				 																																																	The defence counsels requested the court to call for the records, examine them and draw up proceedings against the four witnesses.				 																																																	However, CBI counsels led by K. Sudhakar argued that the deposition by the prosecution witnesses should not be linked to their statement before the Wadhwa commission.				 																																																	The court reserved its order on the petitions till Saturday.				 																																																	Four of the prosecution witnesses  Paul Maurmu, Mathai Marandi, Raghunath Dehury and Solomon Marandi  belong to Manoharpur village in Keonjhar district, where the Australian missionary and his two young sons were set ablaze. Staines had gone to Manoharpur to attend a convention. 				 																																																	The trial, which started on March 1, 2001, has so far seen the cross-examination of all the 55 prosecution witnesses. The examination of the prosecution witnesses was completed on January 27. On Friday, the court was supposed to record the statement of the accused. 				 																Pre-historic paintings found				 																																																	Kota (PTI): Archaeologists have discovered pre-historic rock paintings in the Dura wildlife sanctuary near here.				 																																																	The paintings, belonging to the Upper Palaeolithic era dating back to around 37,000 years, were discovered by researcher Tej Singh Mawai in Tipatia area inside the sanctuary, historian Jagat Narayan announced here.				 																																																	The paintings would throw light on the culture and history of prehistoric time in this region, said Narayan, who discovered the first rock paintings at Alania in Kota district some years ago.				 																																																	As the etchings by pre-historic human beings on rocks had been covered with orche and yellow colours, it is difficult to decipher the original ones, he said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 21: The price war raging in the cellular phone segment appears to be spreading to the fledgling limited mobility segment as well.																								Tata Teleservices today announced two tariff packages for its WiLL-based limited mobility telecom services, taking the fight into the Relaince Infocomm camp. Under the first payment plan, the Tatas are offering a monthly rental of Rs 450 and 190 free outgoing calls (of three minutes each at Rs 1.10.). Under this offer, customers can get a CDMA mobile connection, including the handset, at an initial cost of Rs 2,600, making it Indias cheapest mobile phone offer.																								The initial payment of Rs 2,600 includes Rs 2,075 as the first instalment for the handset and Rs 525 towards activation charges. The remaining price of the handset will have to be paid for in 24 equal monthly instalments of Rs 150 each.																								Under the second plan called Tata Indicom 3000, a subscriber will have to pay a monthly rental of Rs 599 and get 400 free calls. The subscriber will have to pay an initial amount of Rs 3,600, which includes Rs 3,075 as the first instalment for the handset and a monthly rental of Rs 599. 																								The remaining price of the handset will be recovered in 10 equal instalments of Rs 250 each. The subscriber will get 400 free outgoing calls; and calls made beyond that limited will cost Re 1 each.																								Under both the schemes, the subscribers will get a 20 per cent discount on international long-distance calls.																								Tata Teleservices offers limited mobile services under its brandname Tata Indicom. It has over 4,65,000 customers spread across six circles Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat and Delhi. 																								The twin objectives of the offer are to break the entry barrier for CDMA mobile phones and bring down the ownership cost, said S. Ramakrishnan, managing director of Tata Teleservices.

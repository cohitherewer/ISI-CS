		 Thursday, May 22, 2003 				 Laloo repeats Biswas arrest call
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, May 21: RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav today said he was surprised that former CBI officer Upen Biswas had not been arrested yet.																								On Monday, the Narcotics Control Bureau arrested members of a multi-crore international drug cartel from Biswass Calcutta house. The cartel members had rented Biswass ground-floor flat.																								Attacking Biswas, Laloo Prasad said: The reach of the cartel members holed up in his house extended to China and USA. And Biswas is pleading he was ignorant.																								The RJD chief said Biswas was wrong in saying that Laloo Prasad had violated Supreme Court guidelines in commenting on the fodder scam while reacting to the drug seizure. Biswas had played a major role in Laloo Prasads arrest in the fodder scam.																								Calling for a CBI probe into the drug haul, Laloo Prasad said he was ready to go to jail again if he was found guilty of violating guidelines.																								The RJD chief said Biswas was constantly changing his story. Laloo Prasad said the officer first said he had rented out his flat to San Niang Thanga, an inner-circle member of the cartel, on the basis of a letter of introduction from a senior Mizoram government official. 																								Biswas then said he got a verification certificate from an armyman. Now it appears that Biswas had only spoken to some clerks in Mizoram Bhavan, Laloo Prasad said.																								He said he would raise the matter in the Rajya Sabha. He said Biswas was being protected by the NDA government. Instead of explaining his role in the matter, the officer had begun harping on the fodder scam, Laloo Prasad said.																								I had the courage to face the court and I am doing that. Biswas should have the courage to give himself up in the court admitting his lapses, Laloo said.																								By giving shelter to drug cartel agents who are foreigners, Biswas has become liable for prosecution. Dont tell me he mistook the foreigners for Mizos, Laloo Prasad said. Wasnt he in charge of the entire eastern region when he was CBI additional director? Did he make the same mistake in identifying the accused in cases he investigated earlier? he asked.

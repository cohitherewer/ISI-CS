																								Hyderabad, Aug. 8: Andhra Pradesh High Court today dismissed a public interest litigation seeking immediate ban on the sale of soft drinks, reports our special correspondent.																								The PIL was filed by the Indian Young Lawyers Forum, led by K.K.Vijay Azad. The petition questioned why soft drinks allegedly containing pesticides should not be banned. 																								The politicians and members of Parliament were selfish as they prohibited serving of soft drinks in Parliament House, caring less for the common man,Azad said in the petition.																								The PIL had sought a hundred million dollars in compensation from the soft drinks manufacturers.																								The health department of the state government had sent the samples of soft drinks to the Institute of Preventive Medicine to test for presence of pesticides.

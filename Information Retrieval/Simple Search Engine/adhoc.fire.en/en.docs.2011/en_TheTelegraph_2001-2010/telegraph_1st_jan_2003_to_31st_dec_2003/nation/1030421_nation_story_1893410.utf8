		 Monday, April 21, 2003 				 Sangh seeks Ayodhya rethink
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 20: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has sought a review of the Supreme Court ruling on Ayodhya, rejecting the Centres plea to allow religious activity on the undisputed portion of the temple-mosque complex.																								RSS spokesman Ram Madhav told reporters: The SC judgment merits review and recall because we feel it contravenes the earlier judgment of May 1994. Para 56 of the (earlier) judgment says if (the) government so desires, it should restore land to its original owners. In a sense, that judgment is final.																								Madhav, however, was evasive when asked who would file a review petition. It is for the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, since they are a party to the dispute, to go for a review. We will discuss who should do it, but the RSS will not (file the petition).																								Madhav was silent when asked how the Nyas could contest the ruling as it wanted the temple issue settled in the peoples court, not the legal court.																								He moved on to Praveen Togadias remand in judicial custody in Ajmer by releasing a statement from RSS sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan, alleging Rajasthan governments sinister political conspiracy against the Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader.																								He (Togadia) was first arrested for violating the ban imposed by the state government on distributing tridents. This ban in itself is patently illegal and unconstitutional. He ought to have been released immediately, the statement said.																								But the state government, betraying its unethical and vengeful attitude, slapped fresh cases of sedition subsequently under Section 121A of the IPC with the express aim of denying freedom to Togadia, Sudarshan said.																								He further charged the Ashok Gehlot government with creating countless hurdles in Togadias bail process.																								The government, Sudarshan said, is greatly worried over the rising tide of Hindu awakening in the entire country in general and in Rajasthan in particular and (thus) resorting to illegitimate and provocative acts in desperation.																								The RSS chief warned Hindu society will be compelled to launch a massive movement in the state (Rajasthan) if Togadia is not released immediately.																								Madhav demanded a repeal of the Arms Act enacted by Rajasthan which legislated the ban on tridents. But he would not say if the RSS wanted the Centre to intervene in Togadias case.

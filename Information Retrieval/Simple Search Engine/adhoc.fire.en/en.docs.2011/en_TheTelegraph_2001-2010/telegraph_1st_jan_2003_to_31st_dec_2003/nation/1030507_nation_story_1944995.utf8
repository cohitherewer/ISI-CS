		 Wednesday, May 07, 2003 				 Medical seats row in Delhi
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, May 6: The Supreme Court has ruled that admission to Delhi Universitys postgraduate medical courses will be subject to its final order. Thousands of outstation students had recently agitated after being denied admission to these courses.																								A five-member constitution bench of Chief Justice V.N. Khare and Justices R.C. Lahoti, B.N. Agrawal, S.B. Sinha and A. Lakshmanan said in its May 1 order: We are not inclined to pass any further interim orders. However, the admission of petitioners in postgraduate courses shall be subject to the decision in these petitions.																								Earlier, the many students flocking to Delhi from other towns could get admission on the basis of entrance examinations. But this year, Delhi University decided to hold entrance tests only for students staying in Delhi. Thousands of outstation candidates as well as students who had left Delhi to do graduate studies elsewhere but wished to take up post-graduate medical courses here were thus debarred from taking the tests.																								The Supreme Court had in January directed that these students could sit for entrance tests. But the university only declared the results of Delhi-based students.																								Parents and students questioned how the university was determining outstation candidates. Shweta Gupta, who has finished her MBBS and is awaiting admission to a postgraduate medical course in Delhi, said: We criticise political parties for saying that a state capital belongs to a particular community. Here, a university is applying such divisive criteria. 																								But with no definite interim Supreme Court order, the fate of outstation students continues to hang in the balance. These students continue to throng the Delhi University premises and the Supreme Court complex.																								The university courses began on May 2, but the judges have indicated that if their verdict goes in favour of the outstation students, they will be admitted to the course at a later date.

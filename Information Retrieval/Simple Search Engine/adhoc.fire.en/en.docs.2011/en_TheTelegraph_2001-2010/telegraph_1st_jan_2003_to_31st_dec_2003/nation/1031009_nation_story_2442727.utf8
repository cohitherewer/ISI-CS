		 Thursday, October 09, 2003 				 Fun, funds and friends hope for children films
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Raveena Tandon																								Mumbai, Oct. 8: Some eyebrows are still raised, but Raveena Tandons appointment as chairperson of the Childrens Film Society of India is being looked at as a shot in the arm for the lifeless organisation.																								The actress is expected to turn things around at the society that has been suffering from lack of funds as well as ideas. There are whispers that her appointment is political. But industry watchers are ready to brush them off in favour of Raveenas youth and enthusiasm and give the mast mast girl  also a National Award winner  a chance.																								She is expected to inject youthful enthusiasm, Bollywood business savvy, big bucks, and no less important, a large dose of fun into the societys films. For though the motto of the society is A Childs Right to Entertainment, not many children think of the societys films that way. Not many get to watch them in the first place. 																								It is a problem that Raveena is fully alive to. Exuberant after her first meeting at the society today  she took over on October 6  she gushes about bringing new life to the organisation with a little bit of help from her Bollywood friends. 																								The main problem is reaching the films to the children. I will try to put in place a distribution network for the societys films, she says. I will try to get theatrical releases for the films, she promises.																								I will talk to financiers, she adds, since the current budgets for films produced by the society are pitifully low, about Rs 42-45 lakh. An animation film is produced on an average budget of Rs 12 lakh. 																								Former chairperson Sai Paranjpe, from whom Raveena took over, had often spoken about the budgetary constraints that prevented the making of good films. 																								Society chief executive officer Satish Pendherkar, however, believes that reasonably good films can be made on these budgets.																								With knowledge of other aspects of the mainstream cinema  the actress also produced the film Stumped  Raveena says she will try to marry art and parallel elements for the society. 																								Given the shortage of funds, she says she will try to persuade her Bollywood star friends to make guest appearances in the societys projects. 																								From now, Raveena says, it will be quality, not quantity that counts. There are several films churned out by the society, but not many are appreciated. 																								We will make two films every year, if necessary. We will try to get good directors and good projects. Worldwide it is childrens films like Harry Potter that rule. Why cant we do it here? she asks. 																								We will make films that are good entertainment, she says.																								Now, her priority is the festival that is kicking off on Childrens Day, in which some of the films from the existing repertoire will be shown. 																								The actress says she is keen to work with NGOs like CRY for screening of films for children. 																								Raveenas are unorthodox views, coming after the lacklustre tenures of actress Jaya Bachchan and Paranjpe. But not many  even those involved in parallel cinema  are complaining. 																								She just might be able to revive the society, says critic Amrit Gangar. She is young and dynamic and the society needs funds, he adds. 																								We cant write her off saying that she is from mainstream cinema and doesnt have experience of childrens cinema, says film journalist Rauf Ahmed. That way, anyones credentials can be questioned. She may be able to pump in Bollywood resources into the society, he adds. 																								But we will have to see how much she lives up to the promise, he says.

																								Amritsar, Jan. 15 (PTI): Investigators into the alleged Rs 150 crore kidney transplant scam today claimed that the arrested doctors had disclosed they bought kidneys from 300 Bihari migrants.																								The kidney transplant committee continued with its unethical practice of clearing transplant files despite knowing that all donors are giving fake affidavits with fake antecedents, Punjab inspector general of police S.K. Sharma said. 																								He said during the interrogation of the arrested doctors  O.P. Mahajan and P.K. Sareen  it came to the light that all the donors were kept in rented houses in the city, hired jointly by transplant surgeon, P.K. Sareen and Mumbai-based middleman Vickey Bhatia.																								While dr mahajan, who was principal of the government medical college is accused of illegal clearing cases for the transplants as chairman of the committee authorised to do so, dr sareen, was the nehpro-surgeon at the kakkar hospital, the only centre in the city authorised to perform such operations.																								Meanwhile, the punjab civil medical service (pcms) association leaders have decided to donate their body for organ transplantation after their death to popularise the concept of organ transplant.																								Dr hardeep singh president of pcms association said in a statement that to prevent trade in human organs there is need to provide alternative in the form of popularization of donation of organs after death for transplantation.

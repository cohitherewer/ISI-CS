		 Monday, May 12, 2003 				 Terror camp reminder to Dhaka
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 11: India has handed Bangladesh a list of 155 terrorist training camps operating there, many with the help of Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence and al Qaida, and asked it to shut them down. 																								Conveying its concern over some Bangladeshi fundamentalist organisations support to militants in the Northeast, India also sought deportation of 85 insurgents at the foreign secretary-level meeting and the one between the directors-general of the BSF and Bangladesh Rifles recently, official sources said today. 																								The number of camps cited this time  with pin-pointed locations  are 56 more than that furnished by Delhi six months ago. These lists have been handed over despite Dhakas repeated denials of existence of training camps for Northeast insurgents in the country. 																								We have information that ISI activities directed against India are on the rise in Bangladesh. ISI men, along with al Qaida operatives, are imparting training at several of the camps, the sources said. 																								Reports suggest that sophisticated weapons are being smuggled into India from various places in Bangladesh, including Coxs Bazaar, Sylhet and Chittagong, and ISI operatives are playing a key role in this, they added. 																								Even terrorists operating in Jammu and Kashmir are also being sent via the Bangladesh border because its is a (more) porous frontier than the western border, they said. 																								Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar had raised an alarm last year when he submitted a list of 151 camps in Bangladesh to the Union home ministry, saying unless these were eliminated, insurgents would keep on striking terror at will. 																								Delhis list mentions training camps run by the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and the All Tripura Tigers Force, the Ulfa, the Dima Halam Daoga, the Muslim United Liberation Tigers of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Boroland of Assam, the Achik National Volunteers Council of Meghalaya, the Peoples Liberation Army of Manipur and the NSCN (I-M) of Nagaland. 																								Among the insurgents from Assam, Nagaland, Tripura and Manipur that India wants deported are top Ulfa leaders Anup Chetia and Babul Sharma, the sources said. 																								Some of the others on the wanted list are Bendage Wati, Chooba alias Madan, Tusi, Champa alias Chaoba, Kaning Aum (all of the Ulfa), Sohan Debbarma and Ghanta Debbarma (of the Tripura Tigers Force), Saul Borok, Dhingro Debbarma, Makshod Morok, Saybam Debbarma and Kumon Debbarma (of the NLFT).

		 Monday, April 14, 2003 				 Mulayam fires land salvo at Mayavati
 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, April 13: On the eve of chief minister Mayavatis pardafaash rally to expose the Samajwadi Party chief, Mulayam Singh Yadav today accused her government of ordering the illegal sale of thousands of acres of government land across the state.																								Agar zameen ghotalon ki jaanch ho gayi, to dono bhai-bahen jail mein honge (If an inquiry is ordered into the land scam, both the sister and her brother will land in jail), he told party workers here.																								The bhai was a reference to Mayavatis rakhi brother, urban development minister Lalji Tandon of the BJP.																								The Samajwadi has decided to counter Mayavatis rally by getting its workers to fan out in villages and distribute copies of the chief ministers incriminating videotapes. They have also been told to launch bicycle yatras across the state to wage the decisive battle against the Centre and the state.																								Mulayam himself will ride a bicycle to flag off the yatras on April 19. The village-to-village campaign will culminate in a Lucknow rally on May 15.																								The Samajwadi chief took a dig at Mayavati when he vowed to prosecute her whenever the Samajwadi came to power in the state. However, unlike her, I will not use the anti-terror law against her.., he said.																								Mulayam, under attack by Mayavati for allegedly overspending from the chief ministers discretionary fund when he was in power, defended his generosity. He said most of the money was given to the poor for medical treatment or marriages of their daughters.																								I have not robbed the money from the public to fill my coffers like these people have done. Every penny has been well spent in my regime, he said.																								Mulayam did not spare the Centre either. The Prime Minister and his party are equally responsible for the scams taking place in Uttar Pradesh. The pardafaash rally is actually a DM-SSP (district magistrate-senior superintendent of police) rally because every official in the state machinery is busy organising it, he said.																								According to Mulayam, every police station has been asked to contribute a minimum of Rs 15,000 for the rally. The BJP, I am told, is now getting a 25 per cent share in the loot, he said.

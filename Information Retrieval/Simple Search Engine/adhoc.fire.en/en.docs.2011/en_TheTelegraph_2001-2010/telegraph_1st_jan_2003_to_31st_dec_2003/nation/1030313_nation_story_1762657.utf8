		 Thursday, March 13, 2003 				 SP heaps mud on Mayavati
 KAY BENEDICT																								Agra, March 12: In the backdrop of its war with Mayavati, the Samajwadi Party national executive committee met today to discuss the political situation in the state and at the national level, the Ayodhya issue and Iraq. 																								Mayavati-bashing dominated the agenda. Party general secretary Amar Singh ridiculed the Uttar Pradesh chief ministers statement equating herself with Jawaharlal Nehru, S. Radhakrishnan and Choudhury Charan Singh and said she had insulted them with the comparison.																								The BSP leader had yesterday justified celebrating her birthday as Swabhimaan Divas, pointing out that the birthdays of Nehru, Radhakrishnan and Charan Singh were also celebrated as Childrens Day, Teachers Day and Farmers Day.																								Without naming the Congress, Singh today said: We are fighting their (Congress) battle for Panditji (Nehru). He added that the Congress stand in the Assembly this time was good.																								We expect help from all, but will not wait for anyone. It is shameful that Union agriculture minister Ajit Singh, whose party is a coalition partner in the BSP-BJP government, is suffering Mayavati who not only equated herself with his father Charan Singh, but had also earlier called him manuwadi, he added.																								Protesting against her birthday bash, Singh said if it was a government programme as Mayavati claimed, the donations she received on the occasion should be deposited in the state exchequer.																								Flanked by party colleagues Raj Babbar and Azam Khan, Singh blasted the BJP for collaborating with her. The BJP will lick Mayavatis spit to remain in power and in view of the next Lok Sabha polls, he said. The slogan in vogue now, he said, is: BJP ki majboori hai, behen Maya jaroori hai. 																								Taking potshots at Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees office for denying that he blessed Mayavati in Delhi last Friday, Singh said: Now the Prime Minister also got a taste of her medicine. (The chief minister had allegedly misled the media, saying Vajpayee had given her aashirwad for the good work she is doing in Uttar Pradesh.)																								The Samajwadi leader reeled off names of politicians with criminal antecedents with whom Mayavati allegedly had links.																								Singh also accused Mayavati of massive misuse of government funds and alleged that budgetary allocations were made for constructing a house for BSP chief Kanshi Ram and an office for the party.																								Though cagey about a second video tape exposing the chief ministers corruption, Singh denied Mayavatis charge that the first tape that caught her asking MPs and MLAs for a share of their constituency development fund was doctored. 																								Even deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani and parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj had stated that there was no need for any inquiry (into the veracity of the tape), he pointed out.																								Atalji and Advaniji got Bangaru Laxman to resign, Jaya Jaitly quit as Samata Party president and even George Fernandes resigned in the wake of the Tehelka tapes but Mayavati is still crying foul, saying the tapes are doctored, he said. 																								On Iraq, Singh described the Prime Ministers statement in Parliament today as most disappointing. The government should take a strong stand against the war. No facility should be given to the US in the event of a war, he said.

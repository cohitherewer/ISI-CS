		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Panel to vet PSU vigilance system New Delhi: The Central Vigilance Commission  has appointed a high-powered team to look into the working  of vigilance administration in government-controlled companies,  reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										The step comes after alleged disclosures about demands made by ministers on public sector enterprises.				 																																																										The object of the committee is to study the existing workings of the vigilance administration in public service enterprises to evolve systems and procedures that would empower the companies to strengthen their internal vigilance structure and deal with vigilance issues on their own under the guidance and review of the CVC, a statement issued by the vigilance commissions office said, explaining why one more panel was formed to examine the vigilance structure.				 																																																										Public sector companies have always borne the brunt of political interference, resulting in a bloated workforce. Politicians have regarded these companies as places where job-seekers from their constituencies and friends and relatives have to be accommodated. As a result, most PSUs are inefficient white elephants. The government has already begun the process of selling these unhealthy enterprises. 				 																																																										The team formed by the CVC will visit various PSUs and interact with those who manage them. 				 																																																										A website, pandecommittee.nic.in, has been launched and individuals and organisations have been asked to send in their suggestions to the committee. Details of where they can be contacted are also available on the website.				 																Zahira statement by January 2 Vadodara (PTI): Vadodara police will  visit Mumbai before January 2 to record the statement of  Zahira Sheikh, a key witness in the Best Bakery case, her  mother Sehrunissa, brother Nafitullah and others.				 																																																										Their statements would be recorded in connection with a complaint registered against BJP MLA Madhu Srivastav and others for threatening them, assistant commissioner of police Raj Parghi said on Tuesday.				 																																																										The decision was taken after telephonic talks between the police and Teesta Setalvad of the NGO that had given shelter to Zahira, Parghi said.				 																																																										Setalvad informed Parghi that the Vadodara police could visit Mumbai between December 30 and January 2 for recording the statements.				 																																																										In his complaint on October 6 last, Nafitullah had alleged that Srivastav had threatened him and his family to refrain from testifying in court during the trial of the case or face dire consequences.

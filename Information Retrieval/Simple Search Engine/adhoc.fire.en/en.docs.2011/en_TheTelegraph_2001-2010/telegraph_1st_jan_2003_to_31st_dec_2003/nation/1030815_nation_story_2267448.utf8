		 Friday, August 15, 2003 				 Jaya mulls staff transfers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Aug. 14: The Jayalalithaa government plans to revamp the seat of power  the secretariat at Fort St George  and has appointed a four-member reorganisation committee for this purpose.																								The committee, headed by home secretary Syed Munir Hoda, will examine a number of issues, including transferring secretariat staff to district and taluk headquarters. Until now, the staff have enjoyed fixed postings in the capital.																								The move may hurt government employees who have been stunned into silence by the ferocity with which the chief minister cracked down following last months statewide strike. Jayalalithaa sacked lakhs of employees. Though she later took back most, the government told the Supreme Court last week that 6,072 employees cannot claim a right to be reinstated. The pleas of these employees will be heard by three retired judges, the names of which were announced by Madras High Court yesterday.																								Of these 6,000-odd employees, 2,215 workers and 534 officers holding high positions have seats in the secretariat. The planned overhaul could jeopardise their future further. The government said: The age-old work culture of the secretariat has to undergo a sea change.

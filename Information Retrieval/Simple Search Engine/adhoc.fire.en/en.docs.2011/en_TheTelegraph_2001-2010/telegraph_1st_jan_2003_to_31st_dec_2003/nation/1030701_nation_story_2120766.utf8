		 Tuesday, July 01, 2003 				 Dakar hand in envoy recall
 PRANAY SHARMA New Delhi, June 30: The  recall of the Senegals ambassador in India, Ahmed el Mansoor  Diop, may have had to do with more than the murder charge  brought against his son.																								Diops running battle over policies with a key aide of the Senegalese President appears to have played a crucial role in the recall.																								Diop, who was the dean of the diplomatic corps in India as he was the longest serving diplomat here, and his family left for Dakar on Saturday.																								South Block had sought Diops recall after his son, Mansoor Ali, got involved in a controversy over allegedly killing his Indian driver last month.																								Though Diops exit ended weeks of speculation over his fate, he left behind an undated statement claiming his son was innocent.																								Assane Ba, a key adviser to President Abdoulaye Wade, had run into serious problems with Diop. Ba, also chief of the Indo-Senegalese task force and reportedly Wades prospective son-in-law, often found his suggestions ignored by Diop.																								In the past, Wade and his supporters had unsuccessfully tried to replace Diop in Delhi. But the ambassadors relations with an important religious family in Senegal silenced his detractors, ensuring his long stay in Delhi.																								Ba may have finally found the opportunity to remove Diop when Ali got into an argument with his driver, Dilawar, on May 24 outside a five-star hotel after celebrating Africa Day.																								Ali refused to be driven home by Dilawar, who was said to be drunk. In the resultant altercation, Ali allegedly pushed Dilawar, who fell and hit his head on a hard object. Hours later, he was declared dead in a city hospital.																								Delhi police registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Ali. But he could not be interrogated as he enjoyed diplomatic immunity.

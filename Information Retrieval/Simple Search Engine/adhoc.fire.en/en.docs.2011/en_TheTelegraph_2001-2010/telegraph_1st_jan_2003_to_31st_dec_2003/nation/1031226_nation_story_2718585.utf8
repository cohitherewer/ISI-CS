DeMille 1956, The Sound of Music/Robert Wise 1965, Titanic/James Cameron 1997 Kal Ho Naa Ho/ Karan Johar 2003.																								The current Bollywood rage joins the best and the biggest of Hollywood as the first Indian script at the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts amp; Sciences in La Cienega Boulevard, Beverly Hills  better known as the Oscar library.																								I am still in shock. The letter came absolutely out of the blue, Johar said from Mumbai, five days after his script was solicited by script librarian Gregory Walsh.																								There is reason for the writer of a story in a lifetime in a heartbeat to be thrilled. The Margaret Herrick Library, supported by the Academy Foundation, the educational and cultural arm of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, has one of the worlds most comprehensive research collections on films.

As the letter to Johar points out, the library makes the scripts in its collection accessible for research purposes only; actors, students filmmakers and writers are our regular patrons.																								So, at Dharma Productions, preparations are on to send the script from Mumbai to Beverly Hills. They have asked for the shooting script.

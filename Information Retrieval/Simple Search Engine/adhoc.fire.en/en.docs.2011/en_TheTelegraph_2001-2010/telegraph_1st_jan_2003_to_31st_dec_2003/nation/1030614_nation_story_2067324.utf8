		 Saturday, June 14, 2003 				 Lahore bus overhaul
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 13: The two buses that plied between Delhi and Lahore are being overhauled as a technical team from Pakistan is expected here on June 18 to discuss the resumption of the service from July 1.																								Delhi transport minister Ajay Maken today said the team from Pakistan Transport Development Corporation will talk with their counterparts in the Delhi Transport Corporation. Increase in fares and logistical support will be discussed threadbare, he said.																								India and Pakistan decided to restart the bus service as part of the latest peace initiative. Political, diplomatic and transportation ties with Pakistan were snapped over a year-and-a-half ago after the attack on Parliament.																								The government may bring up at the meeting the Rs 24 lakh-plus dues the Pakistan corporation owes the Delhi transport department. Maken said it may be referred to, but is not a pre-condition to run the service.																								Going back on its decision to buy two new buses for the Delhi-Lahore route, the department will ply the two gold-coloured luxury coaches that were in use earlier, according to Maken.																								If we get more time, we are ready to buy new buses. But, as the situation stands today, we have decided to use the two vehicles which were plying on the route earlier, he said.																								The buses are being overhauled to keep them ready for service whenever required. According to Maken, the manufacturers have said the buses would be fully fit once some parts are replaced.																								The condition of the buses deteriorated as the Delhi transport department was using them on inter-state routes all these months.

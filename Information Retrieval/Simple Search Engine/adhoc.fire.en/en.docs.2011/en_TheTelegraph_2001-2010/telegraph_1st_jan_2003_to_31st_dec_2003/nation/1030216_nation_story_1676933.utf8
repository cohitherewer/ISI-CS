In the evening, Vajpayee will host a dinner meeting for all National Democratic Alliance partners to discuss the governments counter-strategy and other issues coming up before the House. The meeting will also be attended by Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee.

Other important leaders include former Prime Ministers Chandra Shekhar and H.D.

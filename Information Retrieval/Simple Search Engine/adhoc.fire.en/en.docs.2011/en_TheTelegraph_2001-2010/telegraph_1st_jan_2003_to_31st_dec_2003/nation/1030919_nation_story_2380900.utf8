		 Friday, September 19, 2003 				 Eight Pak prisoners to go home
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 18: The Supreme Court today accepted an order of the Union government to deport eight Pakistani prisoners to their country.																								Attorney-general Soli Sorabjee told a division bench of Justices Ruma Pal and P. Venkatarama Reddi that the Union government has decided to deport Pakistani nationals who had already served their jail terms in India, which the judges accepted.																								Sorabjee said the Centre has fixed September 30 as the deportation deadline.																								Another petition that came up before the apex court today was on prisoners from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK), which argued that the prisoners could not be treated as foreigners as PoK technically was an Indian territory and hence the foreigners act could not apply to them.																								The matter was heard by a bench of Justices M.B. Shah and B.. Aggarwal on which Sorabjee suggested issuing of notices to the advocate-general of Jammu and Kashmir as the state government had detained several PoK residents under the states Public Order Act.																								Sorabjee said the law provided for detention of residents of the Pakistan-occupied territory for alleged offences in the state and that the state government could alone reply as to how long the PoK prisoners could be detained. The bench accepted Sorabjees suggestion and issued notices to the advocate-general.

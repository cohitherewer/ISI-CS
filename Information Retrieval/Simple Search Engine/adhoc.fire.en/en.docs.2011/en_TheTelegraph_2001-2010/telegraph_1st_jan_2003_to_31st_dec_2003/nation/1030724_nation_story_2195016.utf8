		 Thursday, July 24, 2003 				 Taj pledge in Parliament
																								New Delhi, July 23: The Centre today assured the Lok Sabha that the government was committed to preserve and protect Taj Mahal even as Opposition members tried to put Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati in the dock for covertly permitting construction of a heritage corridor near the monument, reports our special correspondent.																								Culture and tourism minister Jagmohan said: The government is fully committed to preserve the area in and around Taj Mahal and we will ensure that not even the slightest damage is done to the monument.																								Jagmohan has visited the site in the wake of media reports and stopped the construction work.																								Environment minister T.R. Baalu said his ministry had suggested construction of pathways and not the corridor.																								But several queries from the Opposition, as to who is supposed to collect data, how and why the construction work was started keeping the Union tourism ministry in the dark, went unanswered.

Lata Mandal, a 25-year-old member of the Orissa Association of the Blind, was hit on her head by a policeman. Her condition is stated to be serious, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										Frustrated with the empty assurances and callous attitude of the government, 35-year-old Panchanan Nayak had vowed to immolate himself today near Lower PMG Square when the police arrived and tried to evict the protesters from the spot.

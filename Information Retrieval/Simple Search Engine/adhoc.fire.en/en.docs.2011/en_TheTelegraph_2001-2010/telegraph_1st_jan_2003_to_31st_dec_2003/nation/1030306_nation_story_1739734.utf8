																								New Delhi, March 5: The BJP has attacked the Congress for choosing Veerbhadra Singh as the chief minister of Himachal Pradesh, saying he was allegedly involved in a corruption case regarding the allotment of khair wood from the state forest corporations stock when he was the chief minister from 1993 to 1997, says our special correspondent.																								Party spokesman V.K. Malhotra said: The Congress has to reply to this as the judge has said there is sufficient ground to proceed against the accused persons and one of them is the prospective chief minister. Malhotra said Singh was released on bail by a special court in Shimla and added that it would come up for hearing on March 7.																								He criticised the Congress for demanding the resignation of L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti in the Babri case when its leaders were involved in corruption cases. The Ayodhya charges were politically motivated but the Congress kept stalling the House because of this case.																								A further irony, the BJP spokesman pointed out, was the Congress refusal to treat George Fernandes as the defence minister after the Tehelka revelations and put questions to him in the House, although he had not been chargesheeted while its own chief minister-to-be was on bail.

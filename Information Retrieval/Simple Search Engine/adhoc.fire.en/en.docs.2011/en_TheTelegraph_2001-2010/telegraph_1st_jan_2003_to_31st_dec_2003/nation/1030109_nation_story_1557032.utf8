		 Thursday, January 09, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																SC steps in to rid Agra of garbage				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): Concerned over the filth and garbage reappearing on the roads of Agra, the city which is known for the Taj Mahal, the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Agra City Corporation to clean the city within a week.				 																																																	When amicus curiae Vijay Panjawani brought to the courts notice that the corporation had not filed its waste disposal report with the Central Pollution Control Board, a bench of Justices M.B. Shah and D.M. Dharmadhikari observed that the city had again become dirty. Earlier, the city used to be kept clean on the directions of the apex court.				 																																																	Agra Nagar Nigam is directed to clean the city within one week, the bench said.				 																																																	Panjawani also drew the courts attention to its May 2, 2002, directive in which the Uttar Pradesh government was asked to take steps to relocate monkeys at Sikandra, provide clean drinking water at the Taj, construct a solar energy project at a cost of over Rs 4.5 crore and arrange for battery-operated buses for transport of tourists to the Taj Mahal.				 																																																	Appearing for the state government, advocate Ajay Agrawal stated that the government has already taken steps to relocate the monkeys and is acquiring land for the solar project. He said the government has advanced money for the battery-operated buses to Bhel and will shortly commission a drinking water plant at the Taj. 				 																Students grade teachers				 																																																	 Jaipur (PTI): In a reversal of roles, students of a public school gave performance appraisal reports to their teachers on Wednesday.				 																																																	The teachers of Subodh Public School, a senior secondary institution and the only one having ISO 9002 certification, were assessed on 11 parameters by students from Class VI to XII, using a specially-created computer software that kept the identity of the students secret.				 																																																	The teachers, getting grades on a four-point scale of average, good, very good and excellent, received their scrore cards in the assembly of students in the morning.				 																																																	The unique approach was adopted to give students a say in assessing the performance of their teachers, principal of the school, Bela Joshi, said after the ceremony. The experiment would help teachers keep themselves updated and go beyond the outdated superficial pattern of education and reach classrooms better prepared to make learning lively and interactive, Joshi said. The three teachers graded highest would be honoured on Teachers Day, she said.				 																Indians die on Slovak border				 																																																	 Bratislava (AFP): Three Indian illegal immigrants were found dead at Vysna Rybnica, near the Slovak-Ukrainian border, a Slovak interior ministry spokeswoman said.

Seven other Indians were found near the border and interned in a camp in eastern Slovakia. 				 																Pornography case				 																																																	 Mumbai (PTI): A Swiss couple, held on charges of luring children into pornography, has withdrawn its bail petition after Bombay High Court indicated that it was not inclined to grant them liberty.

		 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Cong betrays post-Shimla slumber
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 BJP President M. Venkaiah Naidu with Congress leader Jaipal Reddy in Parliament on Tuesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Dec. 16: Sonia Gandhis Aligarh unity call must have disappointed potential allies hoping for an alliance signal from the Congress. On Saturday, the party chief called on all secular forces to join hands against those who subvert constitutional values behind a reformist veneer, but said little she had not already mentioned during Julys Shimla conclave.																								Congress chief spokesperson S. Jaipal Reddy has sought to put a positive spin on the party chiefs statement, saying: What Sonia Gandhi has said in Aligarh is consistent with our Shimla (conclave) position. He also sought to clear doubts about whether Sonia would continue to lead the party in the wake of the recent Assembly election debacle.																								In doing so, the spokesperson virtually acknowledged that the Congress had not followed up on its Shimla unity call. At the July conclave, the party had said it would explore possibilities of alliances with secular parties with a view to forging a Congress-led secular front to take on the National Democratic Alliance.																								But five months on and following the election rout, the Congress is still searching for answers. The Aligarh unity call neither elaborates on the July agenda nor is it an attempt to firm up the Shimla line.																								Even today, Reddy was not forthcoming on poll alliances, choosing instead to speak in riddles. The Congress is prepared to go the extra mile to accommodate secular parties. The approach and situation vary from state to state. If this made it seem the party would be flexible towards allies, the spokesperson sounded a note of caution. Our consistent position is that based on ground realities, secular parties must come together, Reddy added.																								The Congress appears in no hurry to identify potential allies or the states where an alliance is needed. In Uttar Pradesh, it is unable to decide whether to go with the Bahujan Samaj Party or the Samajwadi Party. Till a month ago, the party was reasonably sure the DMK would be on its side  but it is no longer certain.																								The Congress does not believe it can travel the extra mile to accommodate smaller secular allies in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh even though it was humiliated in these states recently. The party feels it is simplistic to assume that all secular votes would have come its way if the BSP and the Samajwadi were not in the electoral fray.																								The Congress leadership appears anxious not to reveal its alliance strategy too soon lest its prospective allies prove too demanding and troublesome in the run-up to the polls. This would explain why it did not consider open electoral adjustments with the BSP and others during the elections earlier this month.																								Perhaps, the first real test of the Congress seriousness in forging alliances will come in Maharashtra where it has headed a coalition government with the help of Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party for the last four years. Pawar has asked the Congress to decide on a pre-poll tie-up by year-end. Pawars request is under consideration, Reddy said. 																								But he added that the Congress would decide on alliances only at the right time.

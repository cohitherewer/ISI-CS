		 Saturday, September 06, 2003 				 Mother to get body of militant
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 5: A special court has directed Delhi police to hand over the body of an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammad militant killed in an encounter on Saturday.																								Rafeek Uzzma Ahmed, alias Guddu, was one of the two suspected Jaish militants shot dead near Nizamuddin Bridge.																								Uzzmas mother Shakila yesterday filed an application in special judge S.. Dhingras court, pleading that the postmortem be conducted by a board of doctors. 																								She also requested that her sons body be handed over to the family so that they could perform the last rites at Sikandrabag in Bulandshahr, western Uttar Pradesh, where they come from.																								Shakila had to move court after the police allegedly refused to hand over the body. She said in her petition that she had contacted the assistant commissioner, Delhi police special cell, Rajbir Singh, on September 1. But Singh told her he could hand over the body only if she agreed to perform the last rites in Delhi.																								Shakilas petition also said that some plainclothes policemen had visited her Sikandrabag house a day before the encounter pretending to be Uzzmas friends. They dialled a number and handed her a cellphone, asking her to speak to her son. The moment she heard a hello from the other side, the policemen took the phone from her. The house was searched, but the police found nothing, the petition said.																								It alleged that the policemen demanded Rs 1.5 lakh, but she did not have the money. They called up her son again, who asked her to arrange the cash.																								The petition said the policemen returned on August 31 and took some money. On the same day, they took away three other sons  Rais, Atiq and Laiq. Rais and Atiq were arrested on terror charges.																								Dhingra ruled that the body could be taken after the post-mortem today, Shakilas lawyer .P. Malviya said.

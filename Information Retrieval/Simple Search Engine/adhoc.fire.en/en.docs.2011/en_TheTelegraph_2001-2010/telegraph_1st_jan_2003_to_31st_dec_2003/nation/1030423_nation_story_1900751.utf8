 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY Laloo Prasad Yadav and Arjun Munda at the function. (PTI) Patna, April 22: Keya Marandi, tumhara barandi khatam ho gaya (Hey Marandi, have you run out of your bottle of brandy)? Laloo Prasad Yadav plunged the knife of insult into the heart of Babulal Marandi, the former Jharkhand chief minister. Then he began twisting it.

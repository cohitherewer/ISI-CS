				 	 Urmila Matondkar performs at the show. (AFP)																								Durban, June 29 (PTI): Bollywood stars were greeted by rows of empty chairs at a heavily- promoted extravaganza in a cricket stadium here which was expected to draw more than 20,000 spectators. 																								Only 2,000 people turned up at the show which saw performances by Kareena Kapoor, Akshay Kumar, Fardeen Khan, Urmila Matondkar and bhangra singer Daler Mehendi. Those who attended the show at the Kingsmead cricket stadium attributed the poor turnover to highly-priced tickets, some at Rand 700 (Rs 4,200) each. 																								Despite the poor turnout, the stars got into their act in the right spirit to give the spectators their moneys worth. Akshay Kumar won their hearts with his non-stop 40-minute sequence of dance, song and interaction with the people. Mehendi also got the people singing and dancing with his bhangra numbers.

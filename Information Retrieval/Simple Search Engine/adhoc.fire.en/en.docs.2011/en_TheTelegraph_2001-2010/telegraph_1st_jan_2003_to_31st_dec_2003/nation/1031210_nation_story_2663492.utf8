		 Wednesday, December 10, 2003 				 Ojha for MP case transfer
 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES																								Dec. 9: D.P. Ojha, who was removed as Bihar director-general of police, today said he would move the Supreme Court within 15 days for transfer of all cases relating to Mohammad Shahabuddin, an MP who belongs to Laloo Prasad Yadavs party.																								Ojha, who is in Delhi to seek legal advice, said he would request the apex court to try the jailed Shahabuddin outside Bihar, preferably in Delhi.																								Ojha was removed after he publicly said power had passed into the hands of hoodlum politicians.																								The dawn-to-dusk Bihar bandh, called by the National Democratic Alliance to protest the ouster of Ojha, evoked a mixed response. Rail services on the Howrah-Delhi line were affected.

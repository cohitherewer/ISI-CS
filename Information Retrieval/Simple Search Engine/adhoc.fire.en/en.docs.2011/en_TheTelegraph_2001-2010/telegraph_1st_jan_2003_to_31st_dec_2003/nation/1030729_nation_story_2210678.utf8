		 Tuesday, July 29, 2003 				 Moderate for Jamaat
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, July 28: Syed Nazir Ahmad Kashani has been elected the new amir (chief) of the Jamaat-e-Islami.																								Kashani, perceived to be a moderate, enjoys the confidence of hardline Jamaat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who recently opened a Pandoras box within the All Parties Hurriyat Conference by seeking the expulsion of the Peoples Conference  founded by slain leader Abdul Gani Lone  from the separatist conglomerate.																								Geelani alleged that the Peoples Conference had damaged (sic) the objectives of the Hurriyat by fielding proxies in last years Assembly elections. Geelani has been boycotting Hurriyat executive meetings.																								A Jamaat spokesman said here this evening that 97 members  the house of representatives chosen from 2,000 basic Jamaat members  voted this afternoon for the post of amir. Kashani won the polls with an overwhelming 59 votes, while outgoing chief Ghulam Mohammad Bhat got only 30 votes, according to the spokesman.																								Jamaat sources said Kashani is a known moderate but has the support of Geelani.																								With the election of the new amir, some Hurriyat leaders who were banking on Geelanis recall by his party from the conglomerates executive would find themselves in an unenviable position. 																								With his man heading the Jamaat, Geelani is likely to pursue his demand for the expulsion of the Peoples Conference more vehemently.

		 Friday, June 27, 2003 				 Vasundhara fires aid salvo at Gehlot
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, June 26: Rajasthan BJP chief Vasundhara Raje has turned the gun back at chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who has been complaining of the Centres inadequate assistance for the drought-hit state.																								At a news conference today, Vasundhara  whose Parivartan Yatra has covered 117 of 200 Assembly seats in 18 of 32 districts  said what she saw on the ground showed the state had wasted most of the Centres Rs 6,500-crore assistance.																								Gehlot has been frequently writing to the Prime Minister, accusing the Centre of providing inadequate drought assistance. 																								Of the central assistance provided in cash and 36 lakh tonnes wheat, the grain was sufficient to be distributed among 4.2 crore villagers at 480 kg a family or 85 kg a person, Vasundhara said. Yet there was all-round complaint from labourers against non-distribution of wheat, she said. Vasundhara has addressed 235 public meetings, so far, in the course of her yatra.																								She alleged 2-2.5 kg wheat was being given to each worker in the initial stages of the relief work. At best, the quantity rose to 8 kg, she said. 																								Where has all the wheat gone? In fact, a large part of this central assistance has been misused to pay the salaries of government staff, Vasundhara alleged.																								She next emphasised farmers complaints about unavailability of seeds to sow, now that the monsoon is here.																								Wherever I have gone since the onset of rains, peasants were complaining of non-availability of seeds as they could not grow seeds on their own fields due to successive droughts. The state agencies had failed to supply their share, she said.

 DALIP SINGH																								New Delhi, March 10: Information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has sought a report from the National Film Development Corporation director on the status of the inquiry against one of its senior officers who was asked to proceed on leave over corruption charges.																								Prasad has recently asked for the judicious disposal of the case against Ravi Malik, the officer charged with graft. 																								Ministry sources said Prasad was not aware when the disciplinary action against Malik was initiated.																								A senior manager with the financial division of the corporation that funds film production, Malik, who has been with the corporation for more than a decade, is facing many complaints of financial misappropriation. 																								He was asked to proceed on leave more than a fortnight ago. NFDC chief Deepankar Mukhopadhyay confirmed he had asked the NFDC officer to go on leave so that the inquiry against him could be conducted in a fair manner.																								There are many complaints against him and the department is going through them. It will take some time before the inquiry is complete, the NFDC chief said. 																								Mukhopadhyay refused to go into the details of the complaints. 																								There is no point in talking about the allegations till these are proved, he said. 																								No case, however, has been registered by the broadcasting ministrys vigilance commission.																								Malik was allegedly taking cuts from the producers whose films the corporation was sponsoring.																								The corporation is now getting its accounts audited after a long interval. 																								This should expose misappropriation of funds, if any, on commissioning of films and other deals the corporation struck with private parties.																								Reportedly, there is also a stand-off between the NFDC and Doordarshan as the former owes crores to the state-owned broadcaster.																								Of late, the corporation has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The CBI had booked one of its senior officers some time ago for possessing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.

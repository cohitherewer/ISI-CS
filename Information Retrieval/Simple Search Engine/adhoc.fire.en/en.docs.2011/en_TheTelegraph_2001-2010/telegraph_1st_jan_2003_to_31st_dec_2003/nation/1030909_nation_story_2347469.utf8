		 Tuesday, September 09, 2003 				 Digvijay drops Sangh bomb, Uma says cool it
 RASHEED KIDWAI Bhopal, Sept. 8: Digvijay  Singh has alleged that he has evidence of the Rashtriya  Swayamsevak Sangh training its cadre on how to make and  plant bombs.																								The accusation instantly drew fire from Uma Bharti, who advised the Madhya Pradesh chief minister to relax a bit, seek psychotherapy, try homeopathy and go for yoga and meditation.																								Digvijay, however, remained unruffled, saying he had evidence to nail the RSS.																								He said some RSS activists  who were allegedly involved in the killing of a Youth Congress leader  have confessed that they were trained to make and plant bombs.																								I will disclose further, Digvijay said, adding that police investigations were on into such incidents where RSS volunteers were reportedly involved. He said a huge cache of arms was recovered from Bhopal railway station in January this year coinciding with a Muslim ijtema (gathering) in the city.																								Digvijay told Congress activists that the RSS was imparting training in a neighbouring state of Madhya Pradesh. The chief minister said he had come to know that these miscreants had confessed throwing a bomb at a place of worship in Mhow to disturb communal peace.																								Bharti, Union minister Prahlad Patel and BJP general secretary Shivraj Singh Chauhan reacted angrily, alleging that the chief minister was trying to provoke RSS workers and sympathisers.																								Patel said the outcome of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections would explode on Singhs face.																								Chauhan said if Digvijay had evidence of the RSS involvement, why was he waiting. He must explain how, where and when he came to know and what is the nature of evidence that he has been talking about.																								Bharti, the BJPs chief ministerial nominee, went a step further. She said she had a feeling that Digvijay was losing his balance and suggested ways like yoga and meditation that the chief minister needed to keep his cool. Perhaps the electioneering for the coming Assembly polls is being too stressful, she added.																								The state BJP leadership alleged that it was the Congress that had been patronising anti-social elements. He must first set his house in order instead of levelling baseless charges against us, Bharti said.																								Digvijay has had uneasy relations with the RSS. A few months ago, the chief minister had threatened to sue RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav for alleging that he and his father were part of the Hindu Mahasabha. 																								Digvijay has also alleged that the RSS had a tacit understanding with the Jamaat-e-Islami, a hardline Muslim organisation, and often challenged the formers locus standi in championing the Hindu cause.

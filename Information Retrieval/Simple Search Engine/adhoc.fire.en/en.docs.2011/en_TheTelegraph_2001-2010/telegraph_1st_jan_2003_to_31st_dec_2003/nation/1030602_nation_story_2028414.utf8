Tax refunds to be made digitalNew Delhi (PTI): In a bid to make the income-tax department more people-friendly, the government is thinking of transferring excess tax deductions electronically into the bank accounts of tax payers.The move comes close on the heels of the governments decision to outsource the issue of permanent account number to UTI services to speed up the process.An official source said electronic transfer of excess deduction was likely to begin from this fiscal and the income-tax department would make it mandatory for tax payers to mention their bank accounts while filing returns. This would enable the department to send a statement to the Reserve Bank of India to transfer the amount directly.In another move to make payment rules simpler, the department is also planning to nominate certain registered agents like chartered accountants and consulting firms who will certify the accounts and transfer them online to the department.The basic purpose is to keep the crowd away and render transparent and hassle-free service, the source said. The department is also trying to encourage companies, which deduct taxes at source from their employees, to use the benefits of the existing suvidha scheme, under which the employer can file returns on behalf of their employees.Naxalites kill Desam leaderHyderabad (PTI): Naxalites gunned down a Telugu Desam Party leader and blasted a farmhouse of a mandal parishad president on Saturday, police said.Three armed members of the CPI(ML) Janasakhti group barged into the house of Pramila, sarpanch of Ramaraopalli in Karimnagar district on Saturday night and ordered her husband Pothuganti Bhaskar, a Desam leader, to come with them, a report from Karimnagar said.They took him near a bus stand and shot him, the police said, adding that the Naxalites had suspected him to be a police informer.In Anantpur district, members of the Peoples War Group set off a blast at a farmhouse belonging to Desam leader and mandal parishad president Prabhakar at Tagarakunta village, the police said.

																								Mumbai, Dec. 4 (PTI): The special investigation team probing the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam tonight arrested retired Pune assistant commissioner of police Mohammad Chand Mulani for his alleged role in the scandal.																								Sources in the team said Maharashtra State Electricity Board chairman and former additional chief secretary (home) Ashoke Basak was questioned today on the scam developments during his tenure as additional chief secretary (home) and the role of police officers, including the former police commissioner of Mumbai, R.S. Sharma.																								Basak had been informed about the Karnataka government intercepting telephone calls between Telgi and others, the sources said. The calls showed that Mulani had demanded a bribe of Rs 15-lakh (of the total Rs 3 crore he allegedly demanded to dilute the police case) to delete the names of Telgis relatives from the chargesheet.																								Basak had accordingly informed Sharma, who was then Pune police chief, about the allegations against Mulani. Yet, a few days later, Sharma included Mulani in the team investigating the scam, the sources said. 																								Sharma will be confronted with Basaks statement, once it is recorded, they added.

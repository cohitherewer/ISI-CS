 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kohima, Dec. 23: Gunmen fired a few rounds at a makeshift market within a Kohima playground this afternoon, causing a stampede in which several shoppers were injured and jolting the Nagaland capital out of its Christmas reverie.																								The incident brought back anxiety over law and order in Kohima, where markets used to close well before dusk until recently and people considered venturing out in the evening a risk.																								Witnesses said two men fished out pistols and opened fire at nobody in particular around 3 pm. The ground was teeming with shoppers when the sound of pistol shots rent the air, leading to a stampede. Several women and children were injured during the panic rush to safety. 																								The police reached the spot one-and-a-half hours later, but the officer who was on duty at the North police station claimed a team went there immediately on receiving news of the firing. By the time we reached the spot, the miscreants had run away, he said. 																								After the stampede, a woman was spotted collecting oranges strewn on the ground near the playgrounds northern gate. A witness said some people, with children in their arms, scaled the wall around the ground. At the adjoining supermarket, shopkeepers downed shutters. 																								The makeshift market where the incident took place is primarily for woollen garments. 																								The market was set up despite chief minister Neiphiu Rio announcing last month that the playground was exclusively for sporting events.

		 Friday, September 26, 2003 				 Sangh steps in to end feud
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Sept. 25: Two days after deciding to remain neutral on the Murli Manohar Joshi resignation saga, the RSS today again tried to straighten things out in the divided BJP house.																								Last night, Joshi met RSS sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan and teammates H.V. Seshadri, Mohanrao Bhagwat and Madan Das Devi over dinner at the Sanghs Jhandewalan campus here.																								Today, the main protagonist of the anti-Joshi camp, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, met Sudarshan. He was accompanied by Devi, who had gone to the party office for a function marking Jan Sangh founder Deen Dayal Upadhyayas birth anniversary. But RSS spokesman Ram Madhav said both Joshi and Naidu had sought an appointment with his chief.																								Sources explained the Sanghs renewed interest in BJP affairs as stemming from the need to set things right before the elections and not allow the Joshi-L.K. Advani factional feud to get out of hand. Though Advani was not directly present in the picture, BJP sources close to him conceded his acolytes were fighting the battle on his behalf.																								While iterating that a final decision on the human resources development ministers resignation would be taken by the Prime Minister, the BJP and Joshi himself and the RSS would stay out of the process, Sangh sources emphasised that larger issues were involved.																								The first is that it impinges on the fate of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement. If the BJPs idea is to distance its leaders from the issue and pursue coalition politics, then alternative strategies have to be devised by the RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, a source said.																								The second is the partys behaviour with its senior leaders and the question of whether it has turned its back on value-based politics.																								The first issue was a fallout of the Rae Bareli special courts exoneration of deputy Prime Minister Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case and the BJPs purported conversion of the event into a celebration while reacting with complete indifference to the negative verdict on Joshi and other Sangh parivar leaders.																								The RSS reportedly took note that not a single BJP leader of consequence visited Joshi and a party spokesman close to Naidu made derogatory remarks about him to the press.																								According to the Sangh sources, Sudarshan advised Joshi to withdraw his resignation if his party so desired and not prolong the controversy because he reportedly believed that enough damage had been done, not just to the BJPs image but also the RSS.																								Sudarshan however, clarified he would not convey any message to Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his return from the US. The RSS leaders are leaving Delhi tomorrow.																								But he did hear out Joshi, who said he could not have known the BJPs line if he was kept out of party strategy sessions held at Advanis house before the verdict. Sudarshan reminded Naidu that he ought to have a mechanism to ensure collective decision-making as elections were near.

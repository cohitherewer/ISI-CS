		 Wednesday, December 10, 2003 				 MP son in flare-up net
																								Hyderabad, Dec. 9: Andhra Pradesh police have taken the son of A. Narendra, the BJP MP from Medak, into custody for his alleged role in the communal flare-up here on December 6, reports our special correspondent. The legislator is a prominent leader in the Telengana Rashtra Samiti.																								Five persons died in the communal violence in the old city area and 22 were injured on what was being observed by some people as a black day in memory of the Babri Masjid demolition 11 years ago. 																								Additional commissioner of police A.K. Khan said about 300 people were taken into custody. The official said curfew was relaxed for three hours this morning to allow people to purchase essential commodities. On pleas of residents of the old city, the curfew was again relaxed from afternoon till 5 pm but clamped again for the night. 																								State BJP leaders, however, blamed the police for their failure to stop the killings and also charged parties run by minority-community members for hatching a well-oiled conspiracy to attack innocent residents of other communities in the old city. 																								Party leaders, including state president . Indrasena Reddy and deputy leader in the Assembly K. Lakshman, called on chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu and urged him to take stern action against the erring police officials.

		 Tuesday, June 10, 2003 				 Namdev rerun in Srinagar
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, June 9: Another Central Reserve Police Force constable did a Raj Namdev last night  this time at the indoor stadium here.																								Constable Kaptan Singh went berserk after an altercation with colleagues at the battalion headquarters in the stadium, police sources said.																								He sprayed bullets from his automatic rifle and shot dead two of his colleagues. The death toll could have been more had the alert sentry not opened fire on Kaptan Singh killing him on the spot, a police officer said.																								The incident was similar to CRPF constable Namdevs killing of his superior at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai.																								The firing at Gogjibagh triggered tension as the soldiers mistook it for a militant attack and opened fire in retaliation.																								Senior police officers rushed to the stadium and cordoned off the area.																								According to officials, angry soldiers have shot dead their officers and colleagues earlier also. These are stress-related incidents, built up because of continued discharge of duties in highly tense situations and long periods of absence from families, a source said.																								The chief provocation has often been the refusal of leave, the source said.																								At Shopian in south Kashmirs Pulwama district, police opened fire to disperse an unruly crowd protesting against alleged atrocities by security forces. At least three civilians were seriously injured.

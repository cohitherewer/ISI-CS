		 Saturday, May 03, 2003 				 Court blow to Salman
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Salman Khan, escorted by his bodyguard, arrives at the sessions court in Mumbai. (AFP)																								Mumbai, May 2: A sessions court today rejected Salman Khans plea to drop charges of culpable homicide in a hit-and-run case which killed one person and injured four on September 28 last year.																								The court observed that prima facie Salman appeared guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder  which warrants a maximum of 10 years rigorous imprisonment  and opened the door for 10 charges to be framed against him.																								The case has been posted for further hearing to July 2. 																								A drunk Salman had allegedly rammed his Toyota Landcruiser into five persons sleeping on a Bandra pavement. One of them, Noorullah, died on the spot while the others sustained severe injuries. 																								The court today held that the actor appeared to be prime facie guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder as he had the knowledge that rash and negligent driving may kill people. 																								Salman, however, pleaded that the culpable homicide charge be dropped as it was a case of rash and negligent driving. 																								A much lighter charge, rash and negligent driving carries a two-year sentence.																								The other charges against Salman include causing death by negligence and causing grievous hurt. He will also have to strand trial for damaging property and for other smaller offences like driving without a licence and under the influence of alcohol.																								Salmans lawyer Adik Shirodkar said his client was unaware of the consequences of his action and should not be held guilty of culpable homicide.

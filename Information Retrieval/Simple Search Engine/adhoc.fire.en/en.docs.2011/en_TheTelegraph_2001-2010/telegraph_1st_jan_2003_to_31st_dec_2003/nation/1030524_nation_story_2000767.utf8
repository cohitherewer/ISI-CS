Mayavati probe notice to UP Lucknow: Allahabad High Court has asked  the Uttar Pradesh government to show cause why investigations  into the murder of poet Madhumita Shukla should not be handed  over to the CBI, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The notice was issued after a former mayor of Allahabad on Thursday filed a public interest litigation in the high court, demanding a CBI probe into the murder as it allegedly involved a state minister.

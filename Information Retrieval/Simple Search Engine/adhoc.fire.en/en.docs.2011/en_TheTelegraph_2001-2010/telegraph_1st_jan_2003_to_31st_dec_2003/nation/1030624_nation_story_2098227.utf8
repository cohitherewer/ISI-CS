																								Calcutta, June 23: The hearing on the merit of the copyright violation case, slapped by Barbara Taylor Bradford on Sahara Manoranjan, ended in Calcutta High Court today. Justice M. H. S Ansari reserved his order and indicated that he will pass the judgment shortly. The author had earlier won an injunction from the Supreme Court over the broadcast of Karishma: The Miracles of Destiny after accusing the television channel of basing the serial on her best-seller A Woman of Substance. 																								Staying all the previous proceedings, Supreme Court had referred the case back to the Calcutta High Court last month.

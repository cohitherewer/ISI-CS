		 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Modi retort
																								Aurangabad, Dec. 14 (PTI): Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi today said he was willing to face Marathi playwright Vijay Tendulkar and give him a chance to be a martyr.																								Tendulkar, a noted litterateur from Maharashtra, had created a ripple when he had said he would kill Modi if he had a revolver. 																								From the podium of the Maha Expo 2003, Modi said he is never in tension and always in attention. Modi was replying to comments made in a lighter vein by Maharashtras former deputy chief minister Gopinath Munde that the organisers have kept Tendulkar out and there was no need for Modi to be tense.

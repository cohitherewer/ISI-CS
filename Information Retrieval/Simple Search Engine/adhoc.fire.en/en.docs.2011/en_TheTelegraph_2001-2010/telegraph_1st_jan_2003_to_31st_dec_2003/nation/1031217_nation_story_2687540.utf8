		 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Naidu liquor case
																								Hyderabad, Dec. 16: Prominent Supreme Court advocate R.K. Anand today said the liquor procurement case against chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu was crystal clear and strengthened by the states own vigilance commission, reports our special correspondent.																								Anand was representing the Congress legal cell convener . Krishna Kumar Goud in Andhra Pradesh High Court against the Naidu administration. The court has reserved its verdict until Monday.																								Goud recently filed a public interest litigation in which he referred to a vigilance commission report of 1997-98 that the Naidu administration had fixed abnormal purchase prices for Indian Made Foreign Liquor from select companies, causing a Rs 200 crore loss.																								Anand today said: What more proof is needed when a government agency itself had reported of excess payments to a cartel of liquor companies. The case was another example of grassroots corruption in the administration, he said, adding that the government had robbed its people in the name of relaxing prohibition in October 1997.

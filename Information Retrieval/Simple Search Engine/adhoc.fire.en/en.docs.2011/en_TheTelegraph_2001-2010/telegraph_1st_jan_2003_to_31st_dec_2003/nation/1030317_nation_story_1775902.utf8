		 Monday, March 17, 2003 				 Conversion ban 
																								Jalandhar, March 16 (PTI): Union minister and general secretary of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa today said the state government should bring a Bill to impose a complete ban on religious conversion in the current session of Assembly. 																								Expressing concern over the reported largescale adoption of Christianity by Dalit Sikhs, he said these incidents are dangerous and pose a threat to the hard-earned peace and harmony in the state. 																								Being a border state, Punjab can easily be engulfed in communal crises if the present trend is not checked at the highest level, Dhindsa said, adding that there was a need to evolve a national consensus on the issue by initiating a dialogue among representatives of various religions and faiths. 																								He said the state government should immediately bring a Bill to completely ban conversion to avoid any confrontation among different communities on this issue.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 18: Bhutans military operation against insurgents from Indias Northeast is a signal to Bangladesh to act against militants based in its territory.																								Sources in the Indian security establishment say Dhaka is consistently denying that militants from India have taken refuge there despite specific evidence. Earlier this month, Border Security Force director-general Ajai Raj Sharma said India had given Bangladesh a list of 155 camps of the United Liberation Front of Asom, All Tripura Tigers Force and other rebel outfits active in the Northeast.																								The countrys official BSS news agency today said Bangladesh had sealed its borders to prevent Indian insurgents from seeking shelter in its territory following the Bhutan crackdown.																								The BSF had also proposed joint patrolling of certain stretches along the India-Bangladesh border with the Bangladesh Rifles. Dhaka refuses to acknowledge that its territory is being used by the insurgents.																								Military intelligence from the eastern command has also reported movement of insurgents into Bangladesh. Based on the reports, the sources now say the days when Indian militants could take shelter in neighbouring countries are numbered.																								The reason for using the Bhutan model to act against militants was the absence of any condemnation  international, regional or local  against the ongoing operations in south Bhutan.																								The assessment here is that Bangladesh has not even shied away from brazenly defending militants. In a parliamentary debate in Dhaka earlier this year, Prime Minister Khaleda Zias adviser referred to Ulfa general secretary Anup Chetia as a greater freedom fighter than the father of the leader of the Opposition.																								The leader of the Opposition is Awami League chief Hasina Wajed whose father Sheikh Mujibur Rehman had led the Bangladesh liberation struggle. The sources here claimed the speech was greeted with thumping of desks and even the Bangladesh premier applauded.																								In another instance, when Ulfa activist Sanjoy Burman completed his term in a jail in Bangladesh, Delhi was informed he would be handed to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka. Sigma Huda, the wife of Bangladesh minister Najmul Huda, however, moved court and, now, Burmans whereabouts are not known. Sigma was also Chetias lawyer.																								The sources said the fundamental difference in Bhutans and Bangladeshs approach was that Thimphu acknowledged the presence of Indian insurgents on its soil. 																								We see the current military operation as the kings reassertion of his right over his own domain because the insurgents were disturbing the peace, the sources said.																								They point out that the conditions in which the insurgents set up camps in Bhutan 12 years ago were vastly different. Thimphu was sorting out its problems with the Nepalis in its south. In Bangladesh, the Awami League was in power and it had refused to support the militants.																								Since then, Bhutan and Nepal have entered into an agreement over the question of settling Bhutanese of Nepalese origin.																								Most importantly, the sources assess, the Ulfa is weakened after 9/11. The atmosphere is such that there is no condemnation of military action against terrorists.

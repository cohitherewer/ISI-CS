		 Friday, August 01, 2003 				 Code debate
																								New Delhi, July 31: The Lok Sabha Business Advisory Committee has rejected the demand for a discussion on the need to enact a law on an uniform civil code for all communities, reports our special correspondent.																								The demand was raised by Shiv Sena floor leader Chandrakant Khaire today. 																								He did not get any support from any parties, including the BJP, even as parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, who represents the government at the BAC meetings, kept silent. Most of the BJPs allies are opposed to the idea.																								 The Telugu Desam Party, the DMK and the Samata Party have already gone on record questioning the need for such a law when several burning problems are yet to be solved.																								Sources said Trinamul Congress leader Ranjit Panja, who attended the meeting, was also opposed to any move to enact a common law.

		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Bargaining gets off the ground
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pawar: Fifty-fifty																								Mumbai, Dec. 30: The first round of hard bargaining has begun in Maharashtra.																								Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), now the junior partner of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, has tested the waters by saying that it would not settle for anything less than half of the Lok Sabha and Assembly seats in the state.																								The NCP has 58 legislators in the 288-member House and the Congress 73.																								NCP spokesman Praful Patel, a close aide of Pawar, said the seat sharing formula with the Congress would have to be on a 50:50 basis. We should be fighting in 144 Assembly and 24 (out of the total 48) Lok Sabha seats, Patel said. We wont settle for less than that.																								The assertion came after the NCP held a meeting of top leaders, including the recently appointed deputy chief minister Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil and home minister R.R. Patil.																								NCP sources said the claim was made after a survey of the 288 Assembly constituencies in the state.																								The NCPs strongholds are in western Maharashtra and Marathwada, but its optimism stems from the outcome of the recent zilla parishad and local body polls. The NCPs score was higher than expected and the party bettered the Congress performance.																								Reacting to the NCPs demand, Congress leader and minister for home Kripashankar Singh said the partner was taking a rigid stand. 																								The matter has yet to be discussed at a proper forum, he added.																								Congress leaders said the issue would be sorted out when formal discussions begin on sharing seats.

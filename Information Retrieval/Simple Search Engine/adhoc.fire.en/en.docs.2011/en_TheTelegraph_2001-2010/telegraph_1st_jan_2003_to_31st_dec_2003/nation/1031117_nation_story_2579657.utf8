		 Monday, November 17, 2003 				 Notice countdown to Madhumani swoop
 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, Nov. 16: The CBIs hunt for Amarmani Tripathis wife continued today when it pasted another notice at the former ministers Lucknow home summoning Madhumani for questioning.																								Sources said the exercise was a prelude to her arrest in the Madhumita Shukla murder case in view of the Allahabad High Court order that said she should not be arrested without irrefutable evidence. The court also had ordered Madhumani to make herself available for questioning whenever required.																								After serving three notices, the CBI will be free to raid her suspected hideouts, a bureau official said. Given the nature of her involvement in the murder, the possibility of her arrest after being interrogated cannot be ruled out, he added.																								The latest notice pasted at Tripathis Lawrence Road home records that Madhumani did not turn up today at the CBIs camp office in Lucknow as required by an earlier notice.																								The bureau searched for Madhumani by visiting Tripathis official home here for the second consecutive day today, her native town of Ram Nagar and relatives houses in Delhi and Gorakhpur, CBI sources said. She went missing after the November 10 arrest of Prakash Chander Pandey, the alleged killer.																								The case has been worked out. All that is left now is to arrest the (former) ministers wife and those who subsequently furthered the murder conspiracy by destroying evidence, a bureau official said.																								The CBI has already arrested Tripathi, his cousin Rohit Chaturvedi and the two alleged killers, including Santosh Kumar Rai alias Satya Prakash, and recovered the suspected murder weapon from the former ministers hometown of Gorakhpur.																								A CBI official of inspector-general rank arrived in Lucknow this evening, indicating stepped-up efforts to arrest Madhumani. The official will also monitor the bureaus inquiry into the role of those who helped Tripathi and his wife cover up the murder trail because some senior state politicians and officials are suspected to be involved, the sources said.																								The CBI has already served a notice on state minister Shyam Narain Tewari to appear before it in Lucknow on November 19.																								Tewari, who is Amarmanis uncle, was elected on a Congress ticket. He subsequently defected to the BSP and then to the Samajwadi Party to become minister of state for social welfare.																								The summons to Tewari was prompted by his reported contact with Tripathi during his judicial custody.

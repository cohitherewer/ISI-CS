		 Tuesday, December 02, 2003 				 CAT hunt for press worker
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 1: The CBI is hunting for another employee of the semi-government press that prints the CAT question papers for the Indian institutes of management.																								Sanjeev Kumar of the Mumbai-based Institute of Banking Personnel Services is alleged to have given out the papers to the accused for over Rs 10 lakh, sources said. He has been on the run since the paper-leak was discovered on November 23.																								Sanjeev was also said to be involved in leaking papers for the Probationary Officers examination to the State Bank of India in Nalanda, Bihar. The sources alleged that Hari Shanker Chaudhary, one of the four the CBI arrested the same day as the paper-leak, had a role in the bank-examination case.																								Yesterday, the bureau had arrested a peon of the printing press for allegedly accepting Rs 2 lakh to give out the papers. CBI officials claimed he was part of a group that was active in leaking CAT papers.																								Sources said the alleged kingpin, Ranjit Singh, told interrogators he was not involved in the CAT leak, but accepted his complicity in procuring papers for previous CBSE medical examinations. He also told the sleuths he had come to meet Arun Kumar Sinha when both were picked up on November 23 from Shanti Palace Hotel in southwest Delhi.																								The duo was arrested along with Manoj Kumar and Hari Shanker as they were allegedly handing over the question papers to some students.																								The CBI is yet to give a clean chit to IIM Ahmedabad, one of the six IIMs entrusted with the task of holding tests this time.																								Bureau sources said sleuths would question some of IIM Ahmedabads employees to ascertain the process of setting question papers, at what stage these are sent to the printing press and how these reach the examination centres. Their questioning would be corroborated with the depositions of the accused.

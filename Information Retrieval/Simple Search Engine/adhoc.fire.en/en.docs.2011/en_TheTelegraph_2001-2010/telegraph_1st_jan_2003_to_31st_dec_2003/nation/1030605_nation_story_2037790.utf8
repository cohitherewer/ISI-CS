		 Thursday, June 05, 2003 				 Vidya takes a cue from Nisha
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, June 4: Nisha Sharmas rebellion has reached conservative Chennai.																								Like the Noida girl, Vidya, a 26-year-old from an orthodox West Mambalam family, called off her marriage hours before the ceremony early today after the grooms parents asked for more dowry.																								Initially, the girls family had reportedly agreed to give 15 sovereigns of gold jewellery and 1.5 kg of silver utensils. But the grooms side kept raising their demand.																								Last night, there was a showdown over the size of the utensils, with the grooms family insisting that they were too small and would have to be changed. Vidya decided enough was enough.																								Inspired by Nisha, who got her would-be husband arrested on their wedding day, Vidya went to the all-woman police station at Ashok Nagar here at the break of dawn and filed a complaint, police said. The muhurtham was scheduled between 10 am and 11.15 am.																								Balaji, the groom, his father Kannan and mother Bhanumathy were arrested by Chennai police under the Dowry Prohibition Act and remanded in judicial custody for 15 days.																								Deputy commissioner of police R. Samuthirapandi had earlier said Vidyas complaint had been registered and the police would seek legal opinion before proceeding with the case.																								There was high drama at the police station after Vidya filed her complaint. 																								Some policewomen tried to persuade Vidya to reconsider her stand and change into her bridal finery while the grooms relatives made a desperate attempt to make peace.																								One of them even prostrated before one of Vidyas relatives in the corridor of the police station and begged for forgiveness. But Vidya stood firm.

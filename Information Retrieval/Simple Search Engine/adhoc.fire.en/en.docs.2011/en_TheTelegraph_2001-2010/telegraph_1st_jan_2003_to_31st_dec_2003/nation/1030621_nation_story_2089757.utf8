		 Saturday, June 21, 2003 				 Fiery Kalyan spills BJPs Babri secret
 YOGESH VAJPEYI		 Kalyan SinghLucknow, June 20: Stung by the Centres deposition before the Liberhan Commission, Kalyan Singh, who was Uttar Pradesh chief minister when Babri masjid was demolished, today accused the BJP of betraying him.																								The Centres counsel, Lala Ram Gupta, had yesterday told the commission that Singhs government did not have a contingency plan ready. The state government failed in its duty to deploy the already stationed Central forces, Gupta had said.																								Lashing out at deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, human resources development minister Murli Manohar Joshi and six others chargesheeted in the Rae Bareli CBI court, Singh threatened to testify against them in the court.																								The Rashtriya Kranti Party chief alleged Advani and senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leaders had kept him in the dark about their deep and secret conspiracy to demolish the mosque. They not only kept their designs hidden, but also betrayed me, Singh said.																								The then BJP leadership, even after assuring me that nothing would go wrong in Ayodhya, stabbed me (in the back) on the issue.																								Singh said he was prepared to stand by his allegations in the Rae Bareli special court. If the court summons (me), I will depose against the BJP leadership responsible for the 1992 incident.																								As the chief minister then, Singh said he was only morally responsible for the demolition and had owned up by going to jail for a day. The BJP is trying to make me a scapegoat. But I know it will never succeed, he said.																								Singh said Gupta was wrong in inferring that the state or the Centre  of P.V. Narasimha Raos Congress  had not prepared a contingency plan.																								I also want to clarify that the Central forces which were rushed to Ayodhya for protection of the mosque were not allowed because of the conspiracy of these (BJP and RSS) leaders, he said in a carefully worded statement.																								At their instance, the mob put up roadblocks in the narrow lanes leading to the disputed site to ensure none could enter without using brute force.																								If the forces were given orders to move ahead by using bullets, he emphasised, there would have been a massacre which would have had nationwide repercussions.																								The BJP leaders, Singh said, did not have the courage to own moral responsibility. They are simply trying to tarnish my image because I am trying to forge a national alternative to the BJP at the state as well as the national level.																								The RKP chief presented an 11-point clarification to prove he was unaware of the BJP and RSS leaders plans.																								The Supreme Court, Singh said, had not banned the entry and movement of kar sevaks in Ayodhya on the basis of an affidavit he signed along with other leaders such as Chinmayanand, now minister of state for home, and Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, the late BJP leader. The kar seva, the affidavit had assured, would be symbolic.																								The affidavit was completed in the presence of lawyers, including Lala Ram Gupta. Now he is stating just the opposite, and has betrayed me, Singh said.																								He also raised the question why had Advani and others criticised the then Union government for dismissal of my government when the BJP-led NDA government says my government was at fault?

		 Tuesday, September 30, 2003 				 VHP hints at temple vow
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA Hyderabad, Sept. 29: Vishwa  Hindu Parishad leader Acharya Giriraj Kishore today said  his organisation was confident of building the Ram temple  in Ayodhya with the full support of Uttar Pradesh chief  minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.																								Mulayam Singh vachan se baddh hai (bound by his promise) that he will not stop people from going for darshan of the deity at Ayodhya, the VHP international vice-president said.																								Kishore, who was in the Andhra Pradesh capital to generate public opinion in favour of speeding up construction of the temple, quoted the Samajwadi Party leader as assuring him that the Ram mandir will be certainly built in my tenure itself.																								The two had reportedly met at the wedding of BJP leader Vasundhara Rajes daughter recently.																								The VHP leader said his organisation was disappointed with the BJP and added that the Rae Bareli courts order to frame charges against Murli Manohar Joshi in the Babri Masjid demolition case would not result in any poll advantage for the party.																								Joshi, counted among the BJP top three with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, had resigned as human resources development minister after the verdict.																								Kishore said the government should convene a special session of Parliament to enact a law to hand over the disputed land in Ayodhya for construction of the temple.																								If the Union government could take such an action with regard to the Shah Bano case, why not on an issue which involved the vast majority of the population? he asked.

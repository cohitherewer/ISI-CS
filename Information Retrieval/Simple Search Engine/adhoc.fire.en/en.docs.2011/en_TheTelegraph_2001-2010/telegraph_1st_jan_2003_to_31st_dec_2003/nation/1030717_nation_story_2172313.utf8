Muslims question Bhojshala orderJabalpur (PTI): A group of Muslims have filed a writ petition in Madhya Pradesh High Court challenging the order of the Centre and the state government to open the controversial Bhojshala shrine every Tuesday for worship by Hindus.The 85-page petition contended that a mosque could not be used for any other purpose according to the principles and tenets of Islamic law. But Union of India and superintending archaeologist along with Madhya Pradesh government... arbitrarily and capriciously attempted and ostensibly converted the said mosque into a pujaghar and also without the consent and concurrence of the Muslim denomination of Dhar, so that with the passage of time the character of the said mosque could be converted to a different desired goal and purpose inconsistent with its long-standing existing character, the petition said. Challenging the Madhya Pradesh governments April 7 order, the petition said it was bad in law to permit Hindu community to a right of access and, therefore, deserved to be annulled.The petition said the government order constituted not only a flagrant violation of the Indian Constitution but also utter transgression of Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958 and of Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991.The petition was filed two days back and is yet to be listed for preliminary hearing.Woman suspect in pistol theftNew Delhi (PTI): Almost three weeks after a pistol handed over by Pakistani troops during the 1971 surrender mysteriously disappeared from the high-security national museum here, Delhi police seem to have got a crucial clue from a close-circuit TV recording.The TV footage, watched by officials of police and navy, allegedly showed a woman opening the screws of the small glass case in which the pistol had been kept, police sources said.

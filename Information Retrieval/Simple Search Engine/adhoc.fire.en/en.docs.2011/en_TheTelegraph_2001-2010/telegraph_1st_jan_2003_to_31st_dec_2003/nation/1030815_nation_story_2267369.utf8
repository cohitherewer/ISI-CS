 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 14: The CBI, which is probing the Madhumita Shukla case, has taken former Uttar Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathis blood samples. Sleuths believe the samples could throw light on who fathered the murdered poets unborn child.																								Tripathi, one of the prime suspects in the murder, was asked to report to the CBI headquarters in the capital last evening where he was questioned and his blood samples taken.																								It is not known how the CBI persuaded Tripathi to give his blood sample as he had refused to give it to the Uttar Pradesh Crime Branch-CID.																								Sources said the CBI would now send the samples to the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnosis in Hyderabad to establish the parentage of the foetus Madhumita was carrying when she was murdered. The state police had sent the foetus to the diagnosis centre 18 days after she was found brutally murdered at her Paper Mill Colony residence in Lucknow on May 9.																								In her diary seized by the police, Madhumita had claimed Tripathi was pressurising her to get their child aborted. She also said Tripathis wife Madhumani was aware of their relationship and had even visited her residence.																								The CBI had earlier taken Tripathis statement and confronted him with the diary. During questioning, he is believed to have admitted that he had a relationship with Madhumita, but denied any involvement with the murder.																								Sources said Tripathi was in constant touch with Madhumita even on the day she was killed. The last call he made to the poet was around 12 noon. About four hours later, she was shot dead by two unknown assailants.																								The two assailants  one of them had introduced himself as Satya Prakash  were carrying a chit, which had Madhumita Shukla (kavitri), Paper Mill Colony, and her two mobile numbers scribbled on it. They had given the chit to her servant Deshraj, who had passed it on to her. The two had come to Madhumitas house a day earlier also and handed this slip to Deshraj, who returned it as no one else was there at the house at that time.

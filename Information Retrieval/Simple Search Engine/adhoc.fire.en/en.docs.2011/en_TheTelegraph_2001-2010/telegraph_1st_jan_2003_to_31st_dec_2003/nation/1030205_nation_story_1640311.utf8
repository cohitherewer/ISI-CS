		 Wednesday, February 05, 2003 				 CBI taps Dubai for arrest news 
 DALIP SINGH																								New Delhi, Feb. 4: The CBI today dispatched a written communication to Dubai authorities through Interpol, requesting them to confirm whether they had detained underworld operatives, including mafia don Dawood Ibrahims brothers Mohammed Noora and Mustaquim.																								The official note was sent after a high-level meeting of the CBI. Till late in the evening, the CBI had not got a reply from Dubai authorities, sources said.																								The others on the list of six that the CBI has asked Dubai to confirm include Azaz Pathan and Mohammad Dossa, both accused in the 1993 Bombay blasts case, and Aftab Batki, who runs a counterfeit currency business of D-company. Pathan belongs to the Karachi-based Tiger Memon group and functions independently of Dawood.																								As government officials explored all channels to establish the names of the detained criminals, intelligence agencies backed them up by preparing a dossier on three Dawood brothers and two Dossa brothers, including Mohammad Dossa. This will soon be handed over to Dubai authorities to pinpoint their role in criminal activities.																								The UAE is turning the heat on the underworld because it feels that if their nefarious activities are not stopped now, it would lead to inter-gang war, bring terrorist activities to Dubai and soil its image as a peaceful business centre.																								Officials said it was okay as long as Dawood and his men indulged in criminal activities outside their country. Dubai has so far not objected because of the heavy investments D-company has made in the Gulf, including jewellery, electronic and garments shops.																								Sharad Shettys murder in full public view at an Indian club in Dubai recently is said to have been the turning point. Shetty, dubbed the betting king, was gunned down for fatally attacking Chhota Rajan in Thailand two years ago. 																								According to government officials, Dubai police have already arrested two Nepalis, with Indian passports, for their alleged role in Shettys murder.																								The officials feel that due to increasing mafia activities, the UAE was being subjected to unwelcome pressure from Pakistan, India and Islamic nations, which it was no longer willing to take.																								The CBI is working quietly this time because it feels that the hue and cry after the arrest of Dawoods brother Anees Ibrahim last year had messed up things. It had alerted Pakistan, which pulled strings to get Anees deported to their country on the premise that he had a Pakistani passport.																								Sources feel the situation will be clear in another day or two after which the government will decide its next step. 																								There are reports that Dawood  who resides on the second floor of Moin Place in Clifton area of Karachi  has been asked to wind up his business in Dubai. But government officers are not confirming it.																								The shops run by Dawood in Dubai include Moins Readymade Garments, Kings Video, Choice Departmental Store and Al Barka Electronics.																								According to a dossier prepared on D-company, Dawoods five brothers and three sisters are running his multi-million empire from Dubai.																								They lead a lavish lifestyle and own more than three houses in Dubai alone. Apart from Anees, Dawoods other siblings are Noorul Haque alias Noora, Mustaquim, Humayun and Iqbal Hassan.																								His sixth brother, Shabir, was killed by the Pathan brothers of Karim Lalas gang in 1981. His three Dubai-based sisters are Zaitoon, Farzana and Mumtaz. The only person in India is Hasina, who lives in Mumbai.

		 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 Police fail to file Togadia chargesheet 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Jaipur, April 30: Police today failed to file a chargesheet against Praveen Togadia for lack of evidence as investigation is incomplete. The court adjourned the hearing in the Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders case till June 19, giving the police 45 days to complete their investigation.																								The case came up for hearing in the court of additional judicial magistrate Indu Pareek. Togadia appeared in court in connection with criminal cases under the Arms Act and various sections of the IPC, including Section 121-A (waging war against the state and use and display of criminal force).																								Togadia had been released on conditional bail on April 22 by district and sessions judge Hari Singh Poonia after being arrested on April 13 for distributing tridents and making an inflammatory speech in Ajmer. He was remanded in judicial custody on April 14 where he remained till his release eight days later.																								Togadia reached the court with his counsel Onkar Singh Lakhawat this morning. Lakhawat urged Pareek to sign on every page of the case diary as he felt police might tamper with it.																								Speaking later to the media, Togadia said the VHP would hold trishul-worship ceremonies wherever chief minister Ashok Gehlot goes. These ceremonies would be held a day before or after Gehlots visits to protest against his ban on tridents. Similar protests would be organised against deputy chief minister Kamla who accepted a sword at a cattle fair last week.																								Togadia slammed the Gehlot government for banning trident-worship but not treating distribution and display of swords as an offence under the Arms Act. The VHP leader said the governments actions were politically motivated and had hurt the feelings of Hindus. They had created a communal divide, he added.

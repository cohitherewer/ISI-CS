His earnings for serving as chief minister for seven days in 2000 amounted to Rs 2,937.40.				 																																																	n receiving the money, Kumar, who is now the Union railway minister, said: The delay in making payment to the former chief minister shows the state governments extraordinary efficiency.				 																																																	The money was deposited in a bank in New Delhi as the minister does not have any account in Patna.				 																																																	Kumar was made chief minister of Bihar on March 11, 2000, but had to step down after seven days when he failed to prove his majority in the House.				 																																																	The state government cited the lack of a bank account in Patna as one of the primary reasons for the procedural delay, and also the fact that Kumar was not an MLA when he became a chief minister. He was still an MP and his salary as MP had to be adjusted with his salary as chief minister during the period, said one officer.

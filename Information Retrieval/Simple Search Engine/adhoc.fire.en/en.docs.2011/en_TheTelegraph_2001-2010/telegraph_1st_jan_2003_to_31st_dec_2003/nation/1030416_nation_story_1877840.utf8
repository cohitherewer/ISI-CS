The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, April 16, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Govt buries onion export phobia				 																																																	 New Delhi: With a glut of onions in the market and the resultant tumbling of domestic prices, the Cabinet has decided to allow the export of onions without quantitative restrictions, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Onion exports have been a political hot potato for the BJP government. The partys Sushma Swaraj lost the 1998 Assembly polls in Delhi mainly because the price of onions in the capital had shot up to Rs 80 a kilogram.				 																																																	From October that year, the Centre had stopped export of onions. Later, when the situation improved, onions were exported under a quota regime.				 																																																	With production peaking at 54.84 lakh metric tonnes during 2001-02, onion growers have been suffering. Indian exporters believe the country is losing out in markets in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, UAE, Bangladesh and Singapore because of the quota.				 																																																	In 2001, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had fixed an annual ceiling of 500,000 tonnes for export, which was raised last year to 700,000 tonnes.				 																																																	The Centre denied its export regime resulted in the fall of domestic onion prices. The Cabinetgave its consent to the removal of quantitative restrictions on exports of all varieties of onions, a government statement said after the Cabinet meet.				 																Doubts on PWG role in bus attack				 																																																	 Hyderabad: A day after a bus was burnt between Dachepalli and Hyderabad and the Peoples War Group blamed, questions are being raised about whether Naxalites were involved in the attack, reports our special correspondent. 				 																																																	Superintendent of police Ravi Shankar Ayyannar, who reached the spot on Tuesday morning, said he was not sure if the attackers were PWG men. But the modus operandi was the same. Some of the splinter groups of extremists have turned out to be robber gangs on highways, he added. The police suspect some splinter bodies of the Kondapalli group to be involved.				 																																																	The attackers only carried sticks and axes and were in plain clothes. Naxalites are usually armed and in army fatigues. 				 																																																	The PWG has denied any role in the incident. It is not our style to set fire to a bus full of sleeping passengers, said a spokesman of the Guntur district committee. 				 																3 militants shot dead in Valley				 																																																	 Jammu (PTI): Three Pakistani militants were among five killed in separate encounters in Poonch district where a Congress leader was killed by militants.

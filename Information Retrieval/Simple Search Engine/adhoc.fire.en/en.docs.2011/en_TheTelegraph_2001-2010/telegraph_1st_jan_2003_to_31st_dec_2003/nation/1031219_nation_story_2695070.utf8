		 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 SC lets lower court decide Salman fate
 R. VENKATARAMAN				 	 Salman																								New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Supreme Court today clarified it was up to the Mumbai magistrates court to decide if Salman Khan should be tried on a more serious offence in the rash and negligent driving case, depending on the material on record.																								The division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and B.P. Singh said: Any interference at this stage would not further the cause of justice and would lead only to delay the course of it.																								We think it appropriate that the proceedings before the said magistrates court should continue and the trial should proceed on the basis of the charges framed by it but we make it clear that at any appropriate stage if the magistrate comes to the conclusion that there is sufficient material to charge the respondent (Salman) for a more serious offence than the one punishable under Section 304A of the IPC (causing death by negligence), he shall proceed to do so without in any manner being hindered or influenced by the observations or findings of the high court.																								The judgment came on a criminal appeal by the Maharashtra government, challenging a Bombay High Court order that quashed a Mumbai sessions courts framing of the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, under Indian Penal Code Section 304.																								The law governing the trial of criminal offences provides for alteration of charges at any stage of the proceedings depending upon the evidence adduced in the case, the bench said today.																								The magistrate, it added, should decide about enhancing the charge to more serious offence or try Salman for simple rash and negligent driving.																								On the intervening night of September 27-28, 2002, Salman, said to be under the influence of alcohol, had driven his car in a rash manner and allegedly killed a person and caused grievous injuries to four others sleeping on a city pavement. 																								After todays judgment, the magistrates court would no longer be bound by the high courts observations in its order that trial for simple negligence alone should continue against Salman.																								The apex court said the magistrates decision to either continue the trial for simple negligence or enhance the charge shall be purely based on the material brought in evidence at the trial.																								The truthfulness, the sufficiency and acceptability of the material produced at the time of framing of charge can be done only at the stage of trial, the apex court said.																								The high court was not justified in this case in giving a finding as to the non-existence (of) material to frame a charge for an offence, it added.																								If the trial is being held before a court of magistrate, it is open to that court at any stage of trial if it comes to the conclusion that the material on record indicates the commission of an offence which requires to be tried by a superior court, it can always do so by committing such case for further trial to a superior court as contemplated in the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), the bench emphasised.																								Likewise, if the trial is being conducted in a superior court like the sessions court and if that court comes to the conclusion that the evidence produced in the said trial makes out a lesser offence than the one with which the accused is charged, it is always open to that court based on evidence to convict such accused for a lesser offence.

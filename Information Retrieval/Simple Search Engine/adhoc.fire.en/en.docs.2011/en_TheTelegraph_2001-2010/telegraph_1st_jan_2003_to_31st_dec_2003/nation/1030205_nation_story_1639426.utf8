		 Wednesday, February 05, 2003 				 Buddha date with Advani
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Feb. 4: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will meet L.K. Advani tomorrow afternoon at the airport where the deputy Prime Minister will stay for an hour on his way to Delhi from Singapore.																								Officials said at Writers Buildings today that the chief minister is likely to discuss the trouble on the India-Bangladesh border at Satgachhi in the Mathabhanga area of Cooch Behar district, where over 200 Bangladeshis have been pushed back, claiming they belong to India. 																								The problem has been continuing for the past few days and flag meetings between the Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles have so far been inconclusive, an official said.																								Bhattacharjee declined to comment, saying it was a matter where two countries were involved. But agriculture minister Kamal Guha, who is from Cooch Behar, said he would take it up at a Cabinet meeting tomorrow. 																								He said he had planned to visit Satgachhi either on February 7 or February 9 where 200 people, including children were positioned near the zero-line. However, I would like to talk to the chief minister about it as the issue is very sensitive, Guha said.																								A senior police official said the 5,000-odd villagers living close to the border have been alerted through panchayats that they might be evacuated in the event of a serious exchange of fire between the BSF and the BDR.

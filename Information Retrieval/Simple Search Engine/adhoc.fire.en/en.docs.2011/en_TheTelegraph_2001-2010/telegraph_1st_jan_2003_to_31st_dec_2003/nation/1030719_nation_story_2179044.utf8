		 Saturday, July 19, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Panels at odds on AIDS death				 																																																	New Delhi: No two investigative reports could have been more at odds with each other. 				 																																																										The National Commission for Women (NCW) and the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) have come up with completely divergent conclusions on the controversial death of Pavanamma, a 32-year-old AIDS patient, in Kuppam district in Andhra Pradesh, reports our special correspondent. Both organisations had sent teams to the spot to investigate the incident. 				 																																																										Pavanamma, a single mother with a six-year-old child, was allegedly abandoned by her brother and mother and left alone in the backyard of a house. On July 3, she was rushed to a crematorium and burned. 				 																																																										The NCW report presented before the media on Thursday said Pavanamma died an undignified death because of the callous attitude of her family and local authorities, including HIV/AIDS project officers, panchayat members and medical staff. The NCW also raised a question mark over whether she was dead at the time she was taken to the crematorium. aco countered, saying the patient died a dignified  death. Project director Meenakshi Dutta Ghosh said: The  family provided palliative care as best as they could with  their limited financial means. There is no reason to believe  she died of anything other than natural causes. Naco does  not lend credence to the NCWs suspicion that Pavanamma  was lingering when she was taken to the crematorium.  SC relief for vehicle owners  New Delhi: The Supreme Court has ruled that insurance companies  must pay the owner of a vehicle even if its driver has no  valid licence, provided the accident is not the drivers  fault, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																										Earlier, in a case involving New India Assurance Company, the apex court had ruled that if the driver had a fake licence or none at all, the insurance company would not be liable to pay the owner.				 																																																										But in the current case involving Oriental Insurance Company Ltd, a Maruti van caught fire due to mechanical reasons, with which the driver, who had no valid driving licence, had nothing to do, the court said.				 																																																										The Bihar state consumer forum and the National Consumer Forum had earlier cited the New India case to disallow the appeal of Jitendra Kumar, the vehicle owner.				 																																																										On appeal, a Supreme Court division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and B.P. Singh on Friday said the New India judgment would not apply to the case under consideration.

		 Monday, June 30, 2003 				 Push for probe into affair
																								Dehradun, June 29 (PTI): Former Uttaranchal revenue minister Harak Singh Rawat, accused of fathering an unwed womans child, today said he is planning to move the high court following the delay by the government in ordering a CBI probe.																								More than 10 days have passed since I resigned. But, to the best of my knowledge, the Prime Ministers Office has not asked the CBI to start an inquiry till now. Hence, I dont have any option but to move the high court for a DNA test and an early inquiry, he said.																								Obliquely criticising chief minister .D. Tiwari for allegedly giving a clean chit to the chief secretary and the director-general of police without holding any inquiry, Rawat said: I still stick to my statement (made in the Assembly) that bureaucrats are involved in hatching the conspiracy against me and the government must inquire into their role.																								He also said the speech he had made in the House on June 18 in his capacity as a Cabinet minister should be considered a statement of the government. 																								The former minister added he was surprised to know that the government had not taken cognisance of the speech. 																								Rawat claimed that he had been denied natural justice and said that if not as a minister or an MLA, as a citizen of a democratic country, his version should have been taken into account by the House committee that probed the scandal.																								Even a murderer is given a chance to present his version before being sentenced to death. But I was hanged simply on the basis of the statement of an unknown girl, he said. 																								Putting a question mark on the team of Opposition MLAs sent by Assembly Speaker Yashpal Arya to meet Jenni, the unwed mother, Rawat said it was still not clear whether it was a House committee or a probe team. 																								If it was a House committee, then it should comprise members from all parties, but that was not the case, he said. 																								According to the rules of the Assembly, the Vidhan Sabha secretary did not issue any notification for constituting such a committee, he said. This is a serious lapse in the probe.																								Rawat also denounced Tiwaris decision to forward his resignation to the governor for acceptance. If the chief minister considered my speech emotional, then why did he forward my resignation? 																								Rawat also wondered why the media was being prevented from meeting Jenni.

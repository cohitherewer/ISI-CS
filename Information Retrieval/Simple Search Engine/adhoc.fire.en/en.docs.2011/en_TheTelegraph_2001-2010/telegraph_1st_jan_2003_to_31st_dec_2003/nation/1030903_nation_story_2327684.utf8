		 Wednesday, September 03, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Turkey terror panel before PM trip				 																																																	New Delh: The cabinet approved the setting up of a joint working group to combat terror with Turkey on Monday, ahead of the Prime Ministers visit later this month, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										The decision to set up a working group had been taken during deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis visit to Turkey in 2001. The group will meet alternately each year in both capitals.				 																																																										India has set up such groups with several countries and officials say exchange of information with different governments has been an invaluable experience. Apart from foreign ministry officials of the two countries, intelligence and senior bureaucrats dealing with counter-terrorism swap experiences and learn about the different strategies adopted to combat terrorism.				 																																																										The working group will deal with organised crime and illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs, official spokesperson Sahib Singh said on Tuesday. It will also monitor activities of terrorists or organised criminal groups in their respective regions to implement the Security Council resolutions on fighting terrorism.				 																																																										The two countries would enhance mutual cooperation through arrest and extradition of terrorists, exchange of professional expertise, cooperation with Interpol and facilitate legal action to combat terrorism, he said.				 																																																										In an apparent attempt to counter the fallout of breaking its alliance with Mayavati in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP-led NDA at the Centre has decided to increase the scholarship and annual grants for pre-matric scholarship for children of Dalit scavengers and sweepers during the Tenth Plan.				 																Notice to Sachin on Ferrari				 																																																	Chennai (PTI): Madras High Court on Tuesday issued a notice to Sachin Tendulkar on a petition seeking confiscation of the Ferrari car presented to him by Italy-based Fiat last May.

Subhasan Reddy and Justice Prabha Sridevan also issued notices to the Union finance, commerce and revenue secretaries and the central excise and Customs departments. 				 																																																										Kuppiah, in a public interest litigation filed on August 29, claimed that the manner in which the car was imported was contrary to law and against the policy governing import of cars. Besides,the special treatment to the car was the clearest violation of the right of equality, he said. 				 																																																										The Centre had waived the Rs 1.13-crore import duty on the car.				 																SC eye on jailed Pakistanis				 																																																	New Delhi: The Supreme Court has given the Union government time till September 18 to state under what orders 11 Pakistani nationals were being kept in prisons despite having served their sentences, reports our legal correspondent.

The time was given by a bench of Justices M.B. Shah and A.R. Lakshmanan when attorney-general Soli J.

		 Wednesday, July 16, 2003 				 Mamata menu for Atal: berth and terror 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, July 15: The Trinamul Congress and the state BJP will draw the Prime Ministers attention to the increasing politicisation of Bengals bureaucracy and police administration under the Left Front rule during his brief stay at Raj Bhavan tomorrow. 																								Trinamul chairperson Mamata Banerjee will lead her party team and state BJP chief Tathagata Roy his.																								Mamata had failed to have a detailed discussion with Atal Bihari Vajpayee during her last visit to Delhi because of the Prime Ministers preoccupation with the China trip. 																								Pankaj Banerjee, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly, said Mamata will lead a 30-member team at 5 pm to inform Vajpayee about the post-rural poll terror unleashed by the Marxists.																								Apart from briefing him on the CPMs terror and the need for some kind of central intervention to prevent atrocities on women, the minority community, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, Mamata might also discuss her likely return to the Union cabinet. 																								An NDA fact-finding team had earlier this month visited the state and warned of corrective steps to prevent political terrorism during next years general elections. 																								She will also brief Vajpayee on her plan to raise the CPMs terror and murder of democracy in the Lok Sabhas monsoon session. 																								Mamata will not attend the monsoon sessions first day on July 21 as she will be addressing a rally here to commemorate the deaths of 13 party workers in police firing a decade ago.																								Roy said he was planning to lead a 17-strong delegation to the Prime Minister in the afternoon.																								We will discuss the general political situation in Bengal and seek his directives on certain matters. Our delegation will narrate to him the CPMs terror during the panchayat polls and highlight the increasing number of rapes and other kind of atrocities on women under the CPM rule, he said.

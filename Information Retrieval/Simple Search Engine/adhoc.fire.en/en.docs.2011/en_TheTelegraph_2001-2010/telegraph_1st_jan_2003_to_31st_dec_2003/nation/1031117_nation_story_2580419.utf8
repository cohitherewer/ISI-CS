		 Monday, November 17, 2003 				 DD turns to Murdoch
 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, Nov. 16: Doordarshan wants to get on to the Murdoch bandwagon in the UK even as the government has tried to distance itself at home from the media mogul.																								Frustrated that its propaganda gets little mileage overseas, the government has asked Doordarshan to get on to James Murdochs BSkyB platform in the UK.																								The Prasar Bharati chief executive officer, K.S. Sarma, and additional secretary Vijay Singh, the Union information and broadcasting ministrys nominee on the public broadcasters board, will be visiting London shortly to get Doordarshan a London address. Getting a British address is mandatory for television channels that are distributed in the UK. Doordarshan will target an Asian audience running into millions.																								The Prasar Bharati board at its last meeting authorised Doordarshans overseas venture. The decision was taken after it was concluded that Prasar Bharatis external services  mainly All India Radios foreign language programmes  were flops.																								For example, the ministry of external affairs recently forwarded a letter to the I amp;B ministry from a Persian scholar in Iran who had listened to AIRs Persian language programme. The scholar pointed out that the programme was of poor quality, the content bad and the pronunciation and diction of the broadcaster had him guessing if it was indeed Persian.																								The MEA has also reported that its feedback from embassies overseas on AIRs short-wave foreign language services is bad. Not only is the content found wanting, the quality of transmission is also poor.																								In course of time, Prasar Bharati may wind up or constrict the foreign language services of All India Radio. The external services cost Prasar Bharati about Rs 50 crore. The resulting savings would be utilised by the broadcaster to pay BSkyB  should it manage to enter into an agreement  and be distributed among Asian homes in the UK.																								Initial information available with Prasar Bharati suggests that it would have to pay DTH platform BSkyB Rs 5-7 crore a year to be distributed as a free-to-air channel. Prasar Bharati has earmarked three channels for distribution  Doordarshan National (the primary channel), DD India and DD News.																								Doordarshans decision would take it into competition with STAR and Zee for overseas markets, too. STAR and Zee are beamed for a primarily Asian audience in the UK.																								BSkyB is the leading satellite television broadcaster in the UK with a reach of about 7 million connections and a market share of about 50 per cent. Last week, James Murdoch resigned from father Rupert Murdochs holding company, NewsCorp, to take over as chief executive of BSkyB. NewsCorp has a 35 per cent stake in BSkyB. James is also head of STAR TV, NewsCorps primary platform in Asia.

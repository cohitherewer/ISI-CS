 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Aug. 26: The BJP is veering round to the view that the Uttar Pradesh Assembly should be placed under suspended animation rather than dissolved and elections called within the mandated six months.																								This view  described as a compromise formula  gained ground after divergent perceptions surfaced at a meeting called by the Prime Minister this morning.																								The central leaders  including A.B. Vajpayee, his deputy L.K. Advani and M.M. Joshi  reportedly kept their counsel to themselves and allowed the Uttar Pradesh contingent to speak. Sources said Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh and Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Vinay Katiyar argued in favour of an alternative government but Kalraj Mishra and Lalji Tandon felt central rule was the best bet.																								The leaders concluded that to maintain the veneer of democracy, it was best to put the Assembly under suspended animation and allow the single largest party  the Samajwadi Party  to play out its hand. Shortly after the meeting, Samajwadi leader Mulayam Singh Yadav staked claim to the government.																								The BJP is not enthusiastic about forming a government, so any option will suit us whether it is dissolution and governors rule or suspended animation. Suspended animation will enable the exploring of other possibilities so that no one can level charges that the Constitution was side-stepped, Mishra said.																								Sources said the arguments for keeping the Assembly under suspended animation are: The Srinagar inter-state council  meeting starting tomorrow. A dissolution straightaway may  have provoked the charge that the federal character of the  Constitution was not respected It could lead to a split in the  BSP, regarded a greater evil by the BJP than the Samajwadi  after the acrimonious divorce																								BJP sources were clear that Mulayam would not dare poach on their ranks because of the unstated understanding that we will not erect obstacles in his way if he was serious about installing another government. On the other hand, the sources said, nothing would be more joyous for the BJP than to see Mayavatis flock deserting her. Allow Mulayam to deal with the  law and order situation that could arise when the VHP launches  its campaign to reclaim the Ayodhya land on the basis  of the ASI report in Allahabad High Courts custody																								A high-pitched VHP campaign would embarrass the Centre if Uttar Pradesh was under Presidents rule because it would have to deal with the fallout. This way Mulayam can face the music, said sources. The political spin-offs of the  VHPs programme, the BJP believes, will benefit it in the  long run as Mulayam would be forced to take a confrontationist  posture to appease his minority vote-bank																								However, the Uttar Pradesh BJP has begun preparing for an election. A meeting of its MPs and legislators has been convened in Lucknow on September 5. 																								Katiyar will flag off a campaign similar to the VHPs for a Ram temple in Ayodhya.

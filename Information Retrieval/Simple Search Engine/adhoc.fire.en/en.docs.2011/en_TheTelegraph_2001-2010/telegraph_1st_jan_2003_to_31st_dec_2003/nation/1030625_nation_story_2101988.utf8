		 Wednesday, June 25, 2003 				 Assam hotelier found dead 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, June 24: A Guwahati-based businessman was today found dead in Muzaffarpur, two days after he went missing from Patna airports high-security zone.																								Vikash Singh, 40, had reached Patna from Guwahati on Saturday to attend a wedding in Muzaffarpur. A businessman with hotels and petrol pumps, Vikash was found in a jungle at Dronpur, Muzaffarpur superintendent of police Ravinder Kumar Singh said. He had a return air-ticket for June 24.																								There were no blood stains at the spot where the body was found, Ravinder said. It may be because Vikash had been murdered elsewhere after abduction from the airport, but the body was dumped here. He suspected old enmity to be the motive. Had it been a case of abduction for ransom, he would not have been killed so soon. No ransom calls were made.																								Samata legislature party leader Upendra Prasad Kushwaha raised the issue in the House. If a Guwahati-based businessman is abducted from the high-security zone of the airport, what message does it send to the rest of the world about the state? 																								Vikash had called a relative in Muzaffarpur at 3 pm from the airport after landing, to say he would hire a car. When he did not arrive late at night, the relatives went to the police.

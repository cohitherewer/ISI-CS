		 Saturday, September 13, 2003 				 Mamata calls on Advani
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 12: Trinamul Congress chief and Union minister without portfolio Mamata Banerjee called on deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani today and demanded an independent inquiry into the murder of a party youth leader in Chakda allegedly by CPM goons on September 8.																								Mamata, yet to get a berth of her choice, however, claimed she did not discuss the portfolio issue with Advani. I did not come for a portfolio. I am very happy. I am free. I can go to any ministry (to get work done for Bengal).																								The Trinamul chief, who took oath last Monday and did not accept the coal ministry, is pinning her hopes on the BJP Big Two for a suitable portfolio.																								Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee is leaving for Chennai tomorrow and will be in Delhi only on Sunday and Monday as he is leaving for his 12-day foreign trip on Tuesday. If Vajpayee does not find Mamata a berth before his departure, she may have to cool her heels for a few more days.

		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Rebels in family guise to face trial
 SEEMA GUHA																								New Delhi, Dec. 29: Many of the women Bhutan handed over to India along with Ulfa insurgents were combatants and not ordinary civilians staying with their men in the jungles of the Himalayan kingdom, sources in the government claimed.																								During questioning by police and army authorities in Assam, several such family members admitted they were trained fighters adept at handling firearms. These women will not be regarded as non combatants like the children, wives and girlfriends of the Ulfa militants.																								The sources said they will remain in the custody of the state police. Those involved in crimes like murder and kidnapping will have to face trial and will not be granted amnesty.																								The Centre is perturbed by local media reports about so-called atrocities committed against the families of Ulfa cadre. Home ministry officials have disputed these allegations, saying the rebels are behind these reports aimed at regaining the sympathy they have lost from the general public in Assam. The rebels also hope to bring about a strong public pressure on the Centre to start talks with the banned outfit, the officials said.																								The government has already made it clear that it is in no mood for talks with the militant group. The timing for negotiations is not now, a senior ministry official said, explaining that the Ulfa wants talks now because it has been badly hit and want a respite from the military operations. No self-respecting government would be foolish enough to give in to this demand, he said, adding that it would also give a wrong signal to Bhutan, which was reluctant to crack down on the insurgents. The official said the best strategy at the moment is to continue operations against the outfit.																								While those who surrender are being offered the Centres rehabilitation package, there is also the fear that the surrendered cadre might soon demand arms for their own protection and later use them for criminal activities.																								Assam has had too much of the Ulfa and Sulfa (acronym for surrendered Ulfa militants) violence for us not to worry about a future law and order problem, the official added. Earlier batches of surrendered Ulfa rebels have been involved in extortion activities and gunfights with Ulfa cadre. The Centre is aware of this, but there is not much it can do.																								The Centre has named K.S. Ramasubam as the nodal officer to co-ordinate with the Assam government. 																								In the initial stages of the crackdown by Bhutan, chief minister Tarun Gogoi had been largely kept out of the loop by the home ministry on the details of the flushout operations. Instead, the governor was kept posted. Although publicly Gogoi has said the Centre was not bound to inform the state about military operations in a foreign country, in private the government was furious that it was bypassed.

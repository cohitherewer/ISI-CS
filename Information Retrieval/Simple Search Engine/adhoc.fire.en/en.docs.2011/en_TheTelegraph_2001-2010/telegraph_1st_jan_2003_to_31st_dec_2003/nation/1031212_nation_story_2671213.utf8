		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 GT to PiTy: Court shows Bihar the way
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Patna, Dec. 11: Patna High  Court today made top government officials scramble to submit  a full-fledged report within five hours in the Satyendra  Dubey murder case.																								Do the job by taking it as a war, the division bench of Chief Justice Ravi S. Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh warned.																								Bihar home secretary V.K. Haldar, the commissioners of Patna and Magadh ranges and the police superintendents and district magistrates of Patna, Gaya, Aurangabad and Rohtas had appeared, as directed, to assure the court of a dedicated plan for the hassle-free completion of the Golden Quadrilateral highway project.																								When the officials failed to give satisfactory answers in the morning, the bench ordered them to file by 4.15 pm a full report on the states concrete plans to ensure completion of the project and total security for the staff concerned. 																								On December 9, the court had asked them to appear personally today.																								The action was prompted by a petition advocate M.P. Gupta filed on Monday following last months murder of Dubey, an IIT Kanpur engineer working as the project manager on the Gaya segment of the quadrilateral. 																								The engineer, who was to take charge as the project director shortly, had written to the Prime Minister and the National Highways Authority of India chairman about loot of public money in the execution of the project.																								Castigating state counsel A.K. Singh for contending that the murder was no reflection on the states law and order, the bench told the top officials to dispense with security and venture into Bihars interiors to get a first-hand feel.																								Are you prepared for a test ride? asked the judges. The chief secretary, the home secretary and you (the state counsel) should cover a 10-km stretch of the highways unescorted by police and without beacon lights fitted on your vehicles. If you return without being accosted by criminals, you will be fortunate, they said.																								The court had earlier directed the Bihar government to ensure full security to Dubeys family, besides adequate compensation and had asked about the states intention on a CBI probe.																								The Prime Minister on Tuesday disclosed the institution of a CBI probe and asserted that those responsible would not go unpunished.																								The court today reprimanded Singh for saying the state does not have enough resources to complete work. Borrow money, if needed, from wherever it is available, pitch tents every kilometre of the highway and put patrolling teams, the bench said.																								Reacting to the petitions claim that the poor condition of Bihars roads, such as GT Road, was responsible for its economic stagnation, the court said the state is a shame. GT road is PiTy road, Chief Justice Dhavan said. 																								The Bihar stretch of the quadrilateral is to be built on the Grand Trunk Road connecting four of the states districts.																								The bench will sit again tomorrow at 11.30 am.																								IIT Kanpur is planning a Satyendra Foundation Award.

																								New Delhi, Jan. 22: Police control room vans in the capital will go hi-tech from March in an effort to improve patrolling on city roads and combat increasing terrorist threats, reports our special correspondent.																								Delhi police will instal global positioning system (GPS) and computers in the 338 PCR vans and will also acquire 88 more of these vehicles. The GPS will keep a track on the position of each PCR van and display it on the monitor installed at a mother station in the central police control room. 																								It will also place the city police force on a par with their counterparts in developed countries like the US.																								The GPS is likely to be introduced within two months, joint commissioner of police (operations) A.S. Khan announced at a press conference.																								Khan said the GPS would be extremely useful in operational requirements like in the hot pursuit of a terrorist or a criminal. Each van will be fitted with a computer that will provide complete data on terrorists and criminals, making the job of the sleuths easier. It would be linked to the crime record office of Delhi police and through that with Polnet.																								Instead of keyboards, the computers will have scratch pads for writing messages by telephone operator to wireless operator. It will cut short the time now being spent in writing a message and then carrying it manually to the wireless operator, Khan said, adding that the problem of writing messages in mixed languages in a computer will also be done away with by using the scratch pads.

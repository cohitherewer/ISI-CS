		 Tuesday, April 29, 2003 				 Mahajan hints at early polls
																								Raipur, April 28 (PTI): BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan today hinted at early Lok Sabha polls and called on party workers to create history in 2004 by making Atal Bihari Vajpayee the Prime Minister for the fourth consecutive term.																								Addressing the national executive of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, Mahajan said Lok Sabha polls are scheduled for September 2004. But September is not a good time for polls due to rainfall. Hence, the election could be held either in the scorching heat of May or in the pleasant weather of January or February, 2004, he said.

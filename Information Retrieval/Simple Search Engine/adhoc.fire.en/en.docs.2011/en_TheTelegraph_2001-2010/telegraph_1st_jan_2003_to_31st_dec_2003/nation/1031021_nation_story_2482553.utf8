		 Tuesday, October 21, 2003 				 Mayavati under fire from Dalit stronghold
 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, Oct. 20: The very spot from where Mayavati had dared Mulayam Singh Yadav when in power, today reverberated with anti-Mayavati slogans.																								The Ambedkar Maidan here today played host to a rally by R.K. Chowdharys Bahujan Soshit Samaj Sangharsha Samiti (BS-4). Chowdhary is a former Bahujan Samaj Party member who is now a minister in the Mulayam Singh regime. Mayavati has reduced Dalits to a saleable commodity and after Kanshi Ram, they have no future in her Bahujan Samaj Party, he said at the counter-rally of Dalits.																								The crowd was no match for Mayavatis Dalit Swabhiman rally of six months ago, but the 10,000-odd present along with many expelled BSP leaders hinted at things to come. Having split Mayavatis party, chief minister Mulayam Singh appeared ready to nibble into her Dalit votebank.																								The former BSP leaders who attended the BS-4s show of strength included two-time MP Harbhajan Singh Lakha and Shivdhan Negwal from Punjab, Magheram Dharwad and Ajai Raj from Rajasthan, and Sunil Kumar Chittor from Delhi. All were close associates of the ailing BSP founder, Kanshi Ram, during the partys formative years.																								Chowdharys platform of the BS-4 is supposed to take after the DS-4 (Dalit Soshit Samaj Sangharsha Samiti), floated by Kanshi Ram before he launched the BSP in the mid-1980s. Plea for stay on arrest																								Mayavati on Monday moved Allahabad High Court seeking a stay on her likely arrest in the disproportionate assets and Taj heritage corridor cases, PTI reports.																								She also sought the quashing of FIRs registered against her by the CBI, in separate writ petitions filed with the Lucknow bench of the court.																								The petitions are likely to heard on Tuesday.

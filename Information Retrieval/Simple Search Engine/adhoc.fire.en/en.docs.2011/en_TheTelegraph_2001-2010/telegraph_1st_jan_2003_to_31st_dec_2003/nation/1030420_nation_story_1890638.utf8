George loyalists suspended New Delhi: In a jolt to Samata Party chief George Fernandes, three legislators from his Bihar camp were suspended from membership of the party with immediate effect, reports our special correspondent.Fernandes was forced to agree to the suspensions of Ganesh Paswan, Bhai Virender and P. K. Sinha to save the Samata from an impending split. But his loyalists are very upset that he allowed arch rival Nitish Kumar to consolidate his sway on the Bihar unit.Kumars supporters had passed a resolution in Patna on April 13 demanding the expulsion of five Fernandes loyalists. The five include the three suspended today and Lok Sabha MPs Raghunath Jha and Brahmanand Mandal.The decision to suspend the trio followed hectic discussions between Fernandes and Kumar early this week and a series of subsequent meetings between the Samata chief and party leaders. It was also decided that a disciplinary action committee would be set up to look into allegations of both factions and suggest remedial action.But the suspension decision was taken without waiting for the disciplinary panel report. A statement issued by party general secretary and Fernandes confidant Anil Hegde said the suspension has been done on the recommendation of Samata Partys Bihar state council and the state executive committee.Sinha clears air on US ties New Delhi: Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha on Saturday played down differences between India and the US on Iraq and said there was no possibility of Washington tying to intervene in Delhis internal affairs, reports our special correspondent.Let me make it clear that we neither need to panic over possible US intervention in our internal affairs nor should there be concern that our relations with the US are on the verge of collapse, Sinha said.The foreign minister made it clear that India cannot remain silent simply out of fear of incurring the displeasure of others. He expressed confidence that Indo-US relations were based on a whole host of objective factors and these factors continue to bring our countries closer.Sinha said Indias middle path stand on Iraq was chosen after considerable deliberations. There are some in our country who believe that india should have been in the trenches fighting the US and the UK troops with the Republican Guards of Saddam Hussein. There are others who would like us to be a vassal state and subordinate our thought and action to the rich and powerful. But India would go to neither extremes, the foreign minister said.Probe call into custody escape Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court on Saturday directed the Maharashtra government to file its reply in response to a petition seeking a CBI inquiry into the disappearance of Pota detenue Sayed Khwaja Yunus from police custody.The petition, filed by Yunus father, urged the court to direct the state and city police to produce the accused dead or alive and explain under what circumstances he had disappeared from custody.

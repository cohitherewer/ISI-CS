		 Sunday, March 09, 2003 				 Savarkar sting for Left, not Sonia
 							 - Sangh resolution rules out direct action RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Savarkars portrait in Parliament. (PTI) 																								Nagpur, March 8: The RSS resolution on Veer Savarkar, which was passed by its Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha today, singled out Left parties for its attack on anti-Savarkar forces.																								Although some delegates wanted the resolution to be equally sharp on the Congress and, in particular, its foreigner president Sonia Gandhi, sources said it was diluted because the leaders felt individuals should not be discussed, in keeping with the RSS tradition.																								The Sangh sought to play down the Congress boycott of the unveiling of Savarkars portrait in the central hall of Parliament, along with the rest of the Opposition, and claimed it was prodded by some Leftist pseudo-intellectuals to do so.																								However, Sangh spokesman Ram Madhav clarified that the organisation would not follow-up its attack on the anti-Savarkar forces with direct action in the form of protests and dharnas. We dont think direct action is needed. What was required was done by the President (A.P.J. Abdul Kalam) who ignored the elements in the Opposition and went ahead and unveiled Savarkars portrait, he said.																								The two-page resolution, titled Denigrating Heroes of Independence  Reprehensible, condemned the role of some Leftist pseudo-intellectuals in spearheading this controversy and prodding obliging parties like the Congress to rake it up. It said throughout history the Left had played a similar destructive, anti-national and anti-Independence role.																								The Sangh alleged that the Left had defiled and denigrated many a national leader and cited Subhash Chandra Bose and Gandhi as examples.																								They abused Bose as the running dog of Tojo and Gandhi as a stooge of British imperialists. They were the first to support the Pakistan resolution of the Muslim League. Their leader, P.C. Joshi, extended unconditional support to the British in their cruel attempts to suppress the Quit India Movement of 1942, pointed out the resolution.																								The accusations against the Left flew thick and fast. They propagated the multi-nation theory and tried to dismember India. They encouraged the Telengana and Kakdweep armed struggles to derail our newly-won Independence and wrote letters to Mao inviting him to liberate India from Indian rulers after Independence.																								Maintaining that the Oppositions attack on Savarkar was motivated by political reasons, the resolution recalled that it was the CPIs Hiren Mukherjee who proposed that the Lok Sabha pay homage to Savarkar two days after he died.																								The Congress was mentioned only in the context of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi extolling Savarkar as a great patriot.																								The resolution, plugged by Sangh sources as an aggressively worded one, ended up sounding defensive. The parivars longstanding grouse has been that Indian history was viewed through the prism of the Congress-Left combine. The effort to deify Savarkar was to set historical wrongs right, as a source put it.

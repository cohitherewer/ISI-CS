 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 5: The arguments on the sentence in the Naina Sahni murder case has been deferred till tomorrow after the court refused to go ahead with the proceedings due to chaos and disturbance inside the Tis Hazari courtroom today.																								There were several disruptions as additional sessions judge G.P. Thareja decided to start the proceedings at 2 pm. First, senior public prosecutor A.P. Ahluwalia was late, forcing Thareja to delay the hearing of the arguments for about 45 minutes.																								During this time, Thareja requested the audience, consisting mainly lawyers, to maintain a cool and calm atmosphere so that he could hear the matter.																								As Ahluwalia arrived around 2.50 pm, the judge criticised the Delhi police commissioner for allowing a demonstration outside the Tis Hazari court complex.																								The womens wing of the Delhi BJP today staged a dharna, raising slogans like Tandoori Congress hai hai. Thareja told Ahluwalia to convey to the commissioner that such demonstrations should not be allowed till the final judgment was pronounced.																								Ahluwalias arguments were heard for a brief period before the case was adjourned for tomorrow. The court ordered that the entry of lawyers and media persons would be restricted for tomorrows hearing. Only about 50 lawyers and one reporter from each newspaper and electronic media would be allowed to cover the hearing, Thareja ordered. Ahluwalia said Sahnis murder was a historical case and that no leniency was justified in this matter.																								When Thareja asked why he thought that this was the rarest of the rare cases, Ahluwalia said Sushil Sharma was a person in authority and exploited Sahni. He attacked a helpless Sahni and after shooting her dead, roasted her body in a tandoor. Ahluwalia added that even during the trial, Sharma did not show any sign of remorse.

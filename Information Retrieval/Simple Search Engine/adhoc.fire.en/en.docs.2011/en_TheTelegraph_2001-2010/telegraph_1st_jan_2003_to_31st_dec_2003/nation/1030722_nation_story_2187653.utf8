The division bench of Justices M.B. Shah and A.R. Lakshmanan on Monday heard the plea of Srichand, Prakashchand and Gopichand Hinduja.				 																																																										Their counsel, former Union law minister Ram Jethmalani, said the trial court had not heard the case expeditiously despite a Supreme Court directive. Hence, the brothers were seeking extension of the courts permission to go abroad together, he said.				 																																																										Last year, the apex court had directed that one of the brothers must remain in India while the others went abroad. But as trial proceedings kept getting delayed, the court had granted them permission to travel together.				 																																																										On Monday, the Hindujas sought extension of this permission on the grounds that the trial court had adjourned the proceedings till August 27 despite being directed to ensure a quick trial.				 																Thackeray kin held in idol row Ahmedabad: Junagadh police on Monday  arrested a distant relative of Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray  for vandalising a Ganesh idol, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										Suresh Thackeray, who has converted to Christianity, was arrested for allegedly flinging an idol at the Grace Ministry of India orphanage that he runs at Talala in Junagadh district.				 																																																										Samson Christian, joint secretary of the All India Christian Council, has alleged that the priest is being harassed at the behest of the VHP, which has launched a smear campaign against him.				 																																																										Christian said the VHP had used a bus driver employed by Thackeray to file a false FIR against the priest, alleging that he had damaged an idol.				 																																																										The priest was arrested under Section 103(a) and 153(a) of the Indian Penal Code, relating to hurting the religious sentiments of another community. The council secretary refuted the charge, saying there could not be a Ganesh idol in an orphanage run by a Christian organisation.

		 Thursday, July 24, 2003 				 Cyber police station 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, July 23: The full-fledged office of the countrys first cyber police station, which started functioning eight months ago, will come into being tomorrow.																								The Assembly brought a legislation eight months ago, empowering the state police to register cases against cyber criminals. 																								The cyber law empowers the police to make arrests and also produce the accused in court on the basis of fake emails or fake digital tools. 																								The CPU and the hard disk used will be treated as evidence besides the content of the emails on the hard copy format, said CID officer Madanlal Kumawat.																								The harassment of women through obscene emails, SMS and mobile calls and con games through emails and SMS, besides hi-fi digital crimes involving bank and company operations  all come under the cyber act under which the punishment is above two years rigorous imprisonment and a hefty fine.																								Among the prominent cases solved so far by the cyber police were one involving a teenager who had made obscene calls to a police officer in Visakhapatnam, emails sent to banks for the release of funds to a cooperative bank account of an NRI in Hyderabad, a racket selling software to produce fake SIM cards for AirTel and Tata mobile services and a software job racket generating fake emails from the US and the UK.																								The laptop recovered from the terrorists who attacked Parliament in 2001 was also sent to the Bureau of Police Research and Development in Hyderabad for analysing and retrieving information, after computer experts in Delhi failed to trace much out of its contents.																								However, the case that raised a storm was the one involving 32-year-old .S. Kishore of Visakhapatnam who claimed to be a member of the core team of Bill Gates in a major Microsoft project. He generated emails and also credentials of his being a Satyam employee on the eve of Gates visit to Hyderabad. 																								Although the newspapers lauded the local boys talent, the cat was out of the bag when Satyam declared him a fake and was soon followed by Microsoft, says Kumawat.																								Cyber policing has become a necessity in the city that boasts of nearly 8,700 cyber cafes. Around 18,500 systems are available for browsing in public outlets, besides nearly 67,000 homes with PC and Internet connection.

 Atal seals leaks to media on raids
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  New Delhi, May 8: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today told the Rajya Sabha that CBI officers have been asked not to leak any information to the media about the raids and recoveries conducted by the bureau. The assurance came soon after the government has passed a Bill guaranteeing every citizen the right to information.Raising the issue during question hour, Haryana Vikas Partys Swaraj Kaushal said such information given out by the CBI hurts the reputation of the persons involved. He alleged that later, when the cases are heard in court, the figures do not tally.

The CBI believes it is logical for information to be given out as there is a government-appointed officer to announce details of raids and recoveries. Moreover, the Bill ensuring right to information has been passed.Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav took the opportunity to air his grievance against the CBI, which he has accused of framing him in the fodder scam.The Rajya Sabha chairman, Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, snubbed Laloo Prasad, saying his grievance was not related to the discussion. Shekhawat himself had a question for Vajpayee.

Or, there could be some failing in the way cases are conducted. There could be other reasons as well.

The chairperson should understand my difficulty answering that question, Vajpayee said.I  Copyright

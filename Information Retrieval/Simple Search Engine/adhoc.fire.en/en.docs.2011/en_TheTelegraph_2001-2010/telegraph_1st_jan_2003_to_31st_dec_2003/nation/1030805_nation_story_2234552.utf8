																								New Delhi, Aug. 4: Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar today took exception to the Vajpayee governments alleged attempts to bail out former CBI special director U.. Biswas in a narcotics case, reports our special correspondent.																								All evidence is against him. He should have been arrested. But he has only been made a witness in the case of the narcotics racket run from his house in Kolkata, Chandra Shekhar said in the Lok Sabha during zero hour. 																								The retired officer resided in the same building a portion of which had been rented out to foreigners who ran the narcotics racket. Even a machine used for processing narcotics was found. Could all these things have happened without his knowledge, wondered the former Prime Minister. 																								Chandra shekhar alleged that Biswas was being shielded by the Centre and demanded an explanation from deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani. 																								Endorsing Chandrashekhars allegation and demand, Rashtriya Janata Dal floor leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh also accused Biswas of being hand-in-glove with his tenants in the racket. Otherwise, he would not have rented out the premises just for Rs 2,000, he remarked.

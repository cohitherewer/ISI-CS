				 	 Bachchan																								Mumbai, Sept. 19 (PTI): Bombay High Court has allowed Hindi film Boom to be released from today in theatres across the country after its producer agreed to settle the dues of Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the lead role in the film.																								The Bollywood star had moved the court seeking to restrain the producer from releasing the film unless his dues were settled. Hearing his plea earlier, the court had granted an injunction against the release of the movie.																								Both Bachchan and producer Ayesha Shroff later filed consent terms in the court saying they had settled the dispute.																								Accordingly, the court has allowed Boom to be released but its restraint order on the films satellite broadcast will continue.																								As per the consent terms, on receipt of Rs 25 lakh and post-dated cheques for Rs 30 lakh by Bachchan, the distributors, Adlabs Ltd, would be at liberty to deliver the prints for release of the film all over the country.																								Shroff of Quest Films gave an undertaking that none of the cheques issued by her would be dishonoured and also she would not instruct her bankers to stop payment of the cheques.																								She gave her word after the actor pleaded that earlier cheques had been dishonoured and the producer had instructed bankers to stop payment.																								Bachchan had signed a contract of Rs 2.5 crore in April last year with the producer for acting in the film. He was paid Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1 crore by cheques in instalments but the producer had not paid the balance instalments of Rs 30 lakh and Rs 1 crore, Bachchan said.

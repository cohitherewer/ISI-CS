		 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 TUs differ on strike against strike ban
 							 - BJP wing firm on seeking Vajpayee help MONOBINA GUPTA 				 	 Pandhe: Caught in conflict																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: The Centre of Indian Trade Unions is yet to persuade two trade unions to agree on a date for a countrywide strike against the Supreme Court order disallowing strikes by government employees. 																								We are worried because there is a delay in fixing the date, said Citu general secretary M.K. Pandhe. Central and state federations have decided on a February 11 date, but no major trade union other than the Citu, the All India Trade Union Congress and Hind Mazdoor Sabha has agreed to this.																								The Indian National Trade Union Congress and the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh are reluctant about the strike even though Intuc now seems to be ready for a meeting to fix a schedule, Pandhe said. He appeared unaware that the BMS made it clear in October that it would not join an all-India strike.																								We have already told Citu we will not be party to the strike, BMS general secretary Hansubhai Dave has said. 																								The BMS and the Intuc have been reluctant to adopt the Left unions strident stand on the strike ruling.																								Pandhe says Citu is willing to expand the scope of the strike from an action against the Supreme Courts ruling of August 6 alone to a protest against the Centres policies if this ensures greater co-ordination and cooperation among trade unions.																								But the BMS is not budging. It has said it will first seek Atal Bihari Vajpayees help before joining a general strike. On December 12, a BMS delegation met the Prime Minister and attempted to persuade him to try and reverse the court ruling. The union members said Vajpayee had expressed reservations about the ruling and said the Centre will consult legal experts to find a way out of the impasse.																								But Pandhe denied that the Prime Minister gave such an assurance. The Prime Ministers Office has already denied that the government is making any move to introduce a legislation that can undo the Supreme Court judgment, he said.																								At an Indian Labour Conference meeting last October, all trade unions said the Centre should introduce a legislation that would restore the right of government employees to strike.																								Union labour minister Sahib Singh Verma has said there is no need for such a legislation since the ruling does not take away the right to strike of those workers protected under the Industrial Disputes Act. 																								The ruling is applicable only to government employees who have signed contracts with their respective governments, he said.

		 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Sheila sniffs set-top scam 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Dec. 24: Delhi  chief minister Sheila Dikshits allegation that she suspects  a scam in the implementation of the set-top box regime has  thrown the Union information and broadcasting ministry into  a tizzy.																								The ministry is caught again in a dilemma  with political opposition to the set-top box regime brewing again in the capital on the one hand and cable operators threatening to switch off pay channel signals later this week when the India-Australia Test match is due to begin. 																								The ministry has taken the plea that the conditional access system (CAS) has to be implemented in south Delhi on the orders of Delhi High Court just as compressed natural gas for public transport vehicles was made mandatory here on the orders of the Supreme Court.																								Dikshit made the charge yesterday in the Assembly shortly after a meeting with I amp;B minister Ravi Shankar Prasad where the two agreed to chart a roadmap to make the implementation of CAS for cable television in the capital a role model for the other metros.																								But later in the day, Dikshit said it smelt of a scam. The Union information and broadcasting ministry is not clear on the issue, she said in the Delhi Assembly. She had demanded that CAS be implemented with a regulator in place for cable TV but had agreed to appoint sub-divisional magistrates as arbiters in the absence of a broadcast regulating authority.																								The ministry took exception to Dikshits insinuation that inferior technology was being imported from a single foreign company and being imposed on the people of Delhi. Her observations are unwarranted and do not at all represent the factual position, Prasads ministry said today.

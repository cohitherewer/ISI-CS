		 Thursday, August 14, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Amarmani to face CBI again				 																																																	New delhi: Former Uttar Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathi will be questioned by the CBI for the second time in the Madhumita Shukla murder case, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										One of the prime suspects in the murder of the poet, Tripathi was asked to report to the CBI headquarters in the capital on Wednesday. Sources said he would be questioned on Thursday on fresh developments in the case.				 																																																										The CBI had already taken Tripathis statement and questioned him after finding Madhumitas personal diary, in which the poet alleged that the former minister was pressurising her to get their child aborted.				 																																																										Tripathi is believed to have accepted that he had a relationship with Madhumita, who was killed at her Paper Mill Colony residence on May 9, but denied any involvement in the murder.				 																																																										Sources said Tripathi was in constant touch with Madhumita even on the day of her murder. The last call he made to the poet was around 12 noon. About four hours later, she was shot dead by two unknown assailants.				 																																																										The assailants, one of whom had introduced himself as Satya Prakash, were allegedly carrying a chit that had Madhumita Shukla (kavitri), Paper Mill Colony and her two mobile numbers scribbled on it. They had given the chit to Madhumitas servant Deshraj, who had passed it on to her. CBI sources said the assailants were known to Madhumita, otherwise she would not have invited them inside.				 																																																										However, the killers continue to dodge the CBI. Officials said that without the arrest of the assailants, it would be difficult to nail the prime suspect. 				 																																																										The CBI will soon question Tripathis wife, Madhumani.

The judges also found that the Union home ministry records produced by the government did not have the names of nine Pakistani prisoners who had allegedly served out their term in a Rajasthan jail.				 																																																										Additional solicitor-general Altaf Ahmad told the court that Indian prisoners in Pakistani jails should be secured in exchange for the Pakistani prisoners, for which the modalities are to be worked out.

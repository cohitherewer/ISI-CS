They were holed up in houses on the outskirts of Patna. The four have been identified as Dilip Kumar Shah, Raj Narain Yadav, Prakash Kumar and Roshan Rai. 																								All four are residents of the Terai region of southern Nepal and belong to various frontal organisations of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists).

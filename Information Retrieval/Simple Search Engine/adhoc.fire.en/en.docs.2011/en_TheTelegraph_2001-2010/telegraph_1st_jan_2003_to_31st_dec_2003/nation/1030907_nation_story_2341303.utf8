		 Sunday, September 07, 2003 				 Pandya turns to Advani on threats
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Sept. 6: The father of a slain former Gujarat home minister who accused Narendra Modi of getting his son eliminated has complained to L.K. Advani that he is receiving threatening calls.																								Vithalbhai Pandya, 76, whose son Haren was killed on March 26, told the deputy Prime Minister that he began receiving the calls soon after a Congress-sponsored Independence Day function at which he was the guest.																								Pandya, who again slammed the chief minister at the function, said he was told: Beware, call off all your campaign (against Modi) or you will be in trouble. Pandya said the people who threatened me spoke in Gujarati and Hindi and did not identify themselves.																								Pandya said he received such calls at least thrice, the second when Modi was on a week-long visit to Europe from August 17. 																								The septuagenarian, a retired English teacher, holds the chief minister responsible for the political murder of Haren, whom he considered a rival. Pandya says an impartial investigation into the murder is not possible with Modi at the helm.																								At a condolence meeting for his son, Pandya had told Advani in Modis presence that the chief minister had eliminated Haren.																								The former teacher wanted to hand over his letter to Advani personally today at a function here. But when the deputy Prime Minister did not turn up, Pandya handed the letter to Union minister Arun Shourie to forward it to Advani.

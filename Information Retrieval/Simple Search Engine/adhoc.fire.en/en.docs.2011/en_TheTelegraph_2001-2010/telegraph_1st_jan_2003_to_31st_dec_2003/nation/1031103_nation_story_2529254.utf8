		 Monday, November 03, 2003 				 Good fortune is blowin in the wind
				 	 Windmills stand tall against the skyline in Jaisalmer. (Reuters)																								Muppandal, Nov. 2 (Reuters): On the southern tip of the country, the once-impoverished people of Muppandal village are thanking Varuna, the god of the wind, for blowing unexpected good fortune their way.																								In the decade since the first giant power-producing windmill, towering above the palm trees with its whirring 25-metre blades, their lives have changed dramatically.																								Incomes have risen and thousands of new jobs have been created as dozens of wind energy producers swarmed the village, the showcase of a $2-billion clean energy programme in the country, the worlds fifth-largest producer of wind energy.																								In 10 years, my daily income has gone up to Rs 450 from Rs 45, says Koilpillai Gopal, a barber who has been able to convert his modest roadside kiosk into a glittering shop. It is all because of the windmills.																								In Muppandal, a hilly region in Tamil Nadu where the wind races in from the Arabian Sea through gaps between the mountains, the price of land for a windmill has soared to Rs 300,000 from Rs 40,000 in the early 1990s.																								Electricity produced from wind is costlier than gas, thermal or hydro-based units, but subsidies offered by the government through tax breaks, lower import duties on equipment and cheap loans keep prices competitive.																								With the subsidies, analysts say, the generation cost varies from Rs 2.25 to 2.75 per unit, or kilowatt-hour, which is slightly more than thermal electricity. Power produced by old hydro-based units costs below Re 1.																								The subsidies and a pow- er-starved market have attra-cted foreign firms such as Danish NEG Micon, the worlds third-biggest turbine maker, Germanys Nordex and privately-owned Enercon and General Electrics wind unit.																								India produces a total of 100,000 megawatts of power, about 12 per cent less than total demand.																								Nineteen-year-old Raju Palavoor, a watchman at a wind farm, pays his college fees with his salary and flaunts a flashy watch  a luxury in many villages. Thanks to the windmills, I can become a graduate. One day I can even get a government job, he says.																								Wind farms have sprung up all along the 30-km road from Muppandal to Kanyakumari, a town wedged between the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.																								Muppandal and other areas in Tamil Nadu generate about half of the countrys 2,000 megawatts of wind energy, itself about 2 per cent of Indias total power output.																								The government expects the sector to expand rapidly and pass its target of adding 5,000 megawatts of wind energy by 2012. The outlook is optimistic. India has the potential to generate 45,000 megawatts from wind energy, Ajay Vikram Singh, secretary in the ministry of non-conventional energy sources, said.																								Clean energy such as wind, biogas and solar energy offer an attractive option for the country that imports 70 per cent of its crude-oil needs at a cost of more than $17 billion a year.																								The ministry estimates that a 200-kilowatt wind turbine replacing a thermal power plant will save 120 to 200 tonnes of coal.																								And burning that much coal would add two to three tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 1.2 to 2.4 tonnes of nitrogen oxide and 300-500 tonnes of carbon dioxide.																								There is enormous scope for more wind energy projects, said M.P. Ramesh, head of the Centre for Wind Energy Technology in Chennai.																								State-run utilities, the wind farms main customers, often complain supply is erratic and seasonal and depends on the strength of the wind. But supporters say it is just an attitude problem.																								The trade is largely swap-driven, with the utilities drawing power from the farms and giving the owner an equal amount of electricity at their factory elsewhere, or paying a set price if the producer does not have other power needs.

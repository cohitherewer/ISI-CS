 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, April 7: A day after slain leader Haren Pandyas father Vithalbhai Pandya told deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani that his sons murder was politically motivated, the Congress today demanded chief minister Narendra Modis resignation to ensure an impartial investigation.																								Modi should not hold the post till he clears his name. He should step down to facilitate free and impartial investigation, leader of Opposition Amarsinh Chaudhary said. 																								The Congress leader also demanded that Modis name be included in the FIR. Citing the example of then Bihar chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav against whom the CBI had filed an FIR for his alleged involvement in the fodder scam, Chaudhary said the CBI should follow the same standard in Gujarat. 																								The Congress leader said he would write a letter to the CBI and place his partys demand. The CBI, he claimed, does not require any proof after Vithalbhais allegation. He is not the only one who holds Modi guilty. It has become the talk of the town. Everybody is saying so.																								 If necessary, he suggested, the CBI should approach the court to seek Modis remand and thoroughly interrogate him just as it did in the case of the former Bihar chief minister. 																								Chaudhary also lambasted Advani for trying to interfere and mislead  the investigation. Until the probe is over, he added, the deputy Prime Minister should not say Pandya was gunned own by underworld don Dawood Ibrahim or militants as such claims amount to influencing the investigation.

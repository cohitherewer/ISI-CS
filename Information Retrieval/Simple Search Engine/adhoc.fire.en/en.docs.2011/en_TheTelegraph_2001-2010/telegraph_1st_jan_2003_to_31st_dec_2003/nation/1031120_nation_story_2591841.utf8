		 Thursday, November 20, 2003 				 Sangh wages pamphlet war on minority
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Indore, Nov. 19: Uma Bharti and Narendra Modi may be harping on the theme of development in the run-up to the Madhya Pradesh polls, but at the ground level, Sangh activists are singing a different tune.																								The activists are busy distributing copies of an inflammatory pamphlet asking the majority community to wake up to end the hegemony of the 15 per cent minority.																								The pamphlet, Jago Janata Janardan (wake up masses), is specially aimed at tribals in the Malwa region who will play a decisive role in choosing who would rule Bhopal.																								Published by the Hindu Jagran Manch, the umbrella organisation that spearheaded the Bhojshala movement in the region, the pamphlet has pictures of the torched bogeys of the Sabarmati Express in Godhra and armed youths in traditional Muslim attire of skull cap and salwar-kurta. 																								Another picture shows burqa-clad women queuing up to cast their vote, with the caption Vote: jihad ka auzar (Vote: a tool for jihad).																								The four-page coloured pamphlet that The Telegraph gathered from a village in Dhar is replete with provocative slogans. Why in a country inhabited by Hindus, cows continue to be slaughtered is one such slogan. Another questioned why country was divided and why Hindus are forced to shave off choti, a religious symbol.																								Claiming that vote-bank politics had reduced Hindus to second-class citizens, the pamphlet cites several instances of discrimination:																								Haj pilgrims get subsidy of Rs 22,500 while Amarnath pilgrims face hardship																								Demand for reservation for Muslims gaining ground																								Separate personal law for Muslims																								Cow slaughter has not been banned countrywide																								Kashmiri Pundits rendered homeless in their motherland																								A box on page 3 claims that those who forced Hindus to shave off their choti were rewarded by the Madhya Pradesh government while deshbhakts (nationalists) like VHP leader Acharya Dharmendra were arrested for mobilising awareness among the majority community.																								Digvijay Singhs regime rewarded Gunj Basoda accused Mohammad Saleem with a Rs 7,000 cash award while Hindus were booked under the National Security Act, it said. 																								The backpage carries a multiple-choice questionnaire to drive home the point that Hindus should vote in large numbers.																								The first question asks the respondents to tick the average polling percentage. The next question is about the low percentage of educated and learned Hindus casting votes, followed by a query on voting percentage among Muslims.																								The questionnaire then turns to enquire about the rise of fundamentalism and separatism in the states gives four options  a) Muslim-dominated states, b) Christian-dominated, c) both and d) Hindu-dominated.																								The last query asks respondents about the factor that influences voting for a particular candidate. The options are: a) caste, b) opinion of friends and relatives, c) personal and local interest and d) for the cause of Hindutva.

 M.R. VENKATESH 				 	 Jayalalithaa inspects a guard of honour at the commission of the womens commando force in Chennai. (PTI)																								Chennai, June 3: After pioneering the all-women police stations, Tamil Nadu has now raised the countrys first women police commando force. 																								It is no more what women can achieve, now the question is what cant women achieve? chief minister Jayalalithaa said as she formally inducted the first batch of 151 women commandos in the Tamil Nadu police force at a simple function here last evening. 																								The chief minister pointed out that there was no difference in training for the women commandos, who, in fact, received additional instructions compared to their male counterparts. 																								Trainers from the National Security Guards hub in Haryana had been training the five platoons of women commandos since January 27. 																								Official sources said the areas of training included unarmed combat, bomb detection and disposal, map-reading, field craft, VIP security, ambush and counter-ambush, handling of weapons, shooting, wind sailing, parasailing, horse riding, driving, yoga and meditation. 																								Having been trained under tough circumstances, the women commandos put up a splendid performance when they recently covered a distance of 700 km from Kanyakumari to Chennai in a unique relay run, splitting themselves into 15 teams.																								Quoting Swami Vivekananda that women will work out their own destinies much better than men can ever do for them, Jayalalithaa called on women to emulate poet Bharathis ideal of the new, modern women. 																								Recalling the states contribution in setting up all-women police stations, Jayalalithaa said at present 148 were functioning in the state and another 40 would be started this year.

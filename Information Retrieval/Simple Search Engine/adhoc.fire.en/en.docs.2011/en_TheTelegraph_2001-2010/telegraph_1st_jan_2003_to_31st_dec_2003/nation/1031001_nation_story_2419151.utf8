		 Wednesday, October 01, 2003 				 Sorabjee shield for minister on terror law
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 30: The Centre feels that presidential sanction is necessary for a state government to arrest and prosecute a Union minister.																								The clarification was issued after Jayalalithaa wrote to Atal Bihari Vajpayee recently, telling him she would have to arrest Union minister of state for non-conventional energy M. Kannappan under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. 																								The Tamil Nadu chief minister said Kanappan had mentioned on September 16 that his party, the MDMK, still supported the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which she termed a terrorist organisation.																								Union law minister Arun Jaitley does not want to be dragged into the controversy. He would only say no such matter, whatsoever has reached me so far, be it a note or file seeking his ministrys opinion.																								But the state governments legal department feels the law cannot be applied differently to VIPs, saying a Union minister cannot escape punishment if he has committed an offence. 																								Law officials said the only requirement is that the Speaker of the Lok Sabha would have to be informed about filing a chargesheet before it initiates any action against a central minister.																								However, attorney-general Soli Sorabjee feels a mere speech by a minister, made to explain his partys stand, does not per se and prima facie amount to supporting a banned terrorist organisation. 																								Last January, Sorabjee had sent a note to the Centre, saying Kannappans speech was only to highlight his partys stand over the LTTEs struggle for a Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka.																								MDMK treasurer Kannappan has spoken in favour of the LTTE before and, a fortnight ago, had boasted that he had spoken 25 times in support of the LTTE and that (this) was the 26th time. 																								The MDMK minister also said he was not afraid of being arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and was ready to give up his ministership anytime.																								Rajinder Sachar, former chief justice of Delhi High Court, says a Union minister enjoys the confidence of the Prime Minister and the President, who administers him the oath of office and secrecy. Constitutional propriety thus demands that the Presidents sanction is obtained for arresting, chargesheeting or initiating any criminal action against a minister.																								The Jayalalithaa government arrested MDMK chief Vaiko in June last year for making a speech in support of the LTTE.																								The Centre had filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court contending that Vaikos speech taken in its entirety, and if properly interpreted and read in the entire context of the speech, does not attract Section 21 of Pota (Prevention of Terrorism Act). Vaiko was arrested under that section of the anti-terror law.																								The apex court had reserved judgment on Vaikos petition challenging section 21 of the anti-terrorism act and a Peoples Union for Civil Liberties petition that challenged the entire act. Both petitions were heard together.

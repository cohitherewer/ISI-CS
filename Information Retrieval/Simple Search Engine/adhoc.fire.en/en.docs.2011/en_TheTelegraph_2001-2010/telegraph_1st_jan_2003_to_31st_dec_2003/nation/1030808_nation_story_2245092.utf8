Sema, in a recent judgment, upheld the validity of the governors order in January 2000 to remit sentences of prisoners convicted of certain offences.				 																																																										One S. Satyanarayana, who was convicted in a dowry harassment case, had challenged the decision of the government not to remit his sentence. Rejecting his arguments, Justice Raju said the types of offences classified under the governors order show that the real object is to ensure that those who prey on community and violate fundamental values of mankind, society and national interest should not get undeserved benefit.				 																																																	ejecting that the order was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution guaranteeing the right to equality, he said: The classification therefore sounds just, reasonable, proper and necessitated in the larger interests of the society and greater public interest.				 																																																										The bench said the classification made by the Andhra Pradesh government to keep away convicts for crimes against women from the benefit of remission could not be said to be violating any reasonable principle or concept of law.

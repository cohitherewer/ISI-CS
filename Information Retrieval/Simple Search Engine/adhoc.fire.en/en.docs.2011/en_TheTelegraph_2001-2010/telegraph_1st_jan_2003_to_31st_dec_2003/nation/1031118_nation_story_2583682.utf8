		 Tuesday, November 18, 2003 				 Poll breather for minister
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 17: The Election Commission today cleared the nomination form of Haroon Yusuf, the lone Muslim minister in the Sheila Dikshit government for contesting the December 1 polls from Balli Maran Assembly seat in Old Delhi.																								Yusufs nomination had been put on hold after Independent candidates and those of the BJP complained to the poll panel that he holds a post of profit being the Delhi Wakf Board chairman and should, thus, be barred from contesting polls. 																								Poll panel guidelines disallow people from contesting polls if found to be drawing salary from a job.																								But the poll panel today cleared the food and civil supplies ministers papers, saying the Wakf board chiefs post is not an office of profit.																								Yusuf said he was not drawing salary from the post. I had consulted chartered accountants and lawyers before filing my nomination papers, so there was no cause for any problem, he said.																								The poll panel today was in the news over another controversy regarding the Delhi Assembly elections, with the Panthers Party alleging that the commission had allotted the bicycle symbol to it and the Samajwadi Party.																								The Samajwadi has been allotted the symbol in 29 constituencies, while the Panthers Party has been given the symbol in seven Assembly segments.

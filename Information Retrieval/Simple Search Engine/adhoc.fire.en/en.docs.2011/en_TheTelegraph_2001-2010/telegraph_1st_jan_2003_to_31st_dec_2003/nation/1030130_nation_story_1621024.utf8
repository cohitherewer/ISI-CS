		 Thursday, January 30, 2003 				 Rebels gun for Nitish scalp
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Jan. 29: The Samata Party in Bihar appears to be heading for a split with its former state unit president, Raghunath Jha, threatening to end railway minister Nitish Kumars fief in the party.																								Thousands of party workers, including five Samata MLAs, greeted Jha as his plane landed in Patna airport last evening after an overseas tour. All five legislators are known to be supporters of the partys rival faction, headed by defence minister George Fernandes.																								The reception at the airport gave Jha the necessary encouragement to launch a tirade against Nitish. I will not stop before I restore (the) democratic rights of the partys ordinary workers. I am in no mood to be cowed down by Nitish Kumars high-handedness, Jha said.																								Jhas convoy of nearly 200 cars took a trip around the capital with his supporters shouting anti-Nitish slogans. During brief stopovers near the Income Tax building and the statue of Jaiprakash Narayan, Jha continued with his Nitish-bashing.																								I had resigned from the party presidents post for the sake of the partys stability. But Nitish Kumar manoeuvred his way to dissolve the existing state executive body, which was illegal. Everybody in the party is stunned by Kumars high-handedness. George Fernandes is also not happy, he said.																								Jha, a prominent member of the George lobby, quit his party post last month and opted out of a race for a second term as president of the Samatas Bihar unit, averting a likely split. He embarked on a foreign trip soon after, during which Nitish Kumar installed Bashistha Narayan Singh as the state unit president and dissolved the state units executive body. Jha said he would meet Fernandes tomorrow and inform him about the party workers grievances. I will then attend a meeting on February 15 to take my decision, he added.																								The George lobby, including the five legislators who joined Jhas convoy  Sanjiv Singh, Ganesh Paswan, Md. Abdulla, P.K. Sinha and Bhai Virendra  has rallied solidly behind Jha. They claimed that more MLAs were waiting for the right opportunity to air their grievances. I dont bother how many MLAs are coming to me. I am more concerned about the rights of the ordinary party workers, Jha said.																								The Samata rebels accused Nitish of instigating infighting in the party at a time when Patna was witnessing one of the most violent protests over the killing of students by police.																								Kumar was actually helping Laloo Yadav by intensifying paroxysms in the party, said former party spokesman P.K. Sinha, who was unceremoniously removed from his post by Nitish.																								Nitish supporters countered Jha was planning to join Laloo Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal. They said a relative of Laloo Yadav was among those present at the airport to receive Jha.																								Speculations on Jhas next move stem from the fact that the former state Samata chief is a Lok Sabha member from Gopalgunge, a Brahmin-dominated constituency that the RJD wants to wrest control of with Jhas help.																								I am not going anywhere. That is the gossip being spread by my own party detractors, said Jha.

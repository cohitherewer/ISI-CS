		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 IIMC takes safe stand on grants
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 29: Watch  and not immediately follow  the leader. Thats the safe strategy the Indian institutes of management in Calcutta and Bangalore have adopted for the moment.																								Their Ahmedabad sibling decided on Saturday to decline the grant it receives from the Centre to meet recurring expenditure.																								We are very happy that they have taken a stance, and wish we could have also taken a similar step. The issue was discussed extensively here, but we are not near announcing something like that, said a senior faculty member at IIM Calcutta. 																								IIM Ahmedabads board of governors  headed by Infosys chairman .R. Narayana Murthy and with M. S. Banga of Hindustan Lever and K.V. Kamath of ICICI as members passed the institutes budget without taking into account the Centres Rs 10.5-crore grant-in-aid. The move is seen as a declaration of financial independence from the human resource development ministry headed by Murli Manohar Joshi, with which the IIMs have been locked in a battle to protect their autonomy.																								Our chairman made it clear that he was against taking extreme positions, said an IIM Calcutta board member. ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar is the chairman of the institute. 																								.R. Narayana Murthy has been proactive in safeguarding the institutes interest, a faculty member said.																								Now with IIM Ahmedabad making its stand clear, we will also have to spell out our position. And it will depend both on government reaction and internal discussions, he added. 																								A faculty meeting is being planned in the first week of January to discuss the issue. 																								The mood is much the same in Bangalore, where the board will meet in a fortnight. Our positions and concerns are different, and so we cant always match each other. But there is no doubt that on autonomy the IIMs will present a united face, said a member of the board of governors in Bangalore. 																								None of the three premier IIMs has signed the contentious memorandum of understanding, which is seen as the mother of all problems. 																								Joshis ministry has threatened to stop releasing funds if they dont sign up. 																								The issue of generating finances internally will surely come up as its extremely important for our existence as centres of excellence. We will weigh all options, said the IIM Bangalore board member. 																								But doing an IIM Ahmedabad  the richest of all the IIMs  will not be easy, admit institute sources in Calcutta and Bangalore. 																								IIM Ahmedabad has a nest-egg of around Rs 98 crore that it has built up with its own income. The amount is much higher than the free resources at the command of Bangalore and Calcutta. Besides, given the brand name, IIM Ahmedabads revenue generation ability is also higher.																								Its true that given our financial position, we can take a risk, which the other institutes will find difficult to do. Their reliance on the government for projects and consulting work is much higher than us, explained an IIM Ahmedabad faculty member. 																								According to him, the deficit without government grants is 10 to 15 per cent of the five-year budget, which, the governing board thinks, can be bridged.

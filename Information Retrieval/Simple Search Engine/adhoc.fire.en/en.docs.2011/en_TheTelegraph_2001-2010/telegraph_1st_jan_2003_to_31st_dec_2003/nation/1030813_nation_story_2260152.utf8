		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 After television, shadow on STAR radio
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug 12: Bringing cheer for the swadeshi lobby in the media industry, Union information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today ordered a probe into Radio City, the FM channel that is propped up by STAR.																								The inquiry into STARs eligibility to run the radio channel is on the lines of the investigation by the ministry into STAR News shell company Media Content and Communication Services.																								Radio City is aired in Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai and Lucknow.																								Only last week the Indian Media Group (IMG), a conglomerate of broadcasters and publishers, had met the Prime Minister, the deputy Prime Minister and the information minister and urged the cancellation of STARs uplink licence and had also alleged that the Murdoch groups operations were violating guidelines in television as well as in radio. 																								Many of IMGs members run businesses  like the Living Media Groups TV Today and Red FM and the Times of India Groups Radio Mirchi  that compete with STAR in television and radio.																								The licence to run Radio City is held by the Ispat Groups Music Broadcast Private Limited (MBPL). Digiwave, a subsidiary of STAR India Private Limited, is the exclusive content provider to MBPL.																								The ministers order points out that the norms lay down that the licensee (MBPL) cannot transfer the licence in any manner to a third party. Since Digiwave was effectively running the channel, the ministry has asked if it does not violate or bypass the rules on foreign equity in the FM business.																								The ministry has also taken note of a loan of Rs 58 crore given by Digiwave to MBPL. MBPL has an equity base of only Rs 1 lakh. The debt-equity ratio is a whopping 5800:1. The ministry questioned the deal because it is far more than the acceptable 2:1 ratio in small businesses. The ministry suspects that in effect Digiwave bankrolls Music Broadcast. The holder of the Radio City licence will now be required to explain the nature of its relationship with Digiwave.																								Current rules allow upto 20 per cent foreign investment in FM radio companies. Apart from Digiwave/MBPL, there are other FM companies, too, with foreign institutional investment. 																								The timing of the governments probe into Radio City makes the move suspect. While the inquiries into STAR News operations have been carried out when the company applied for an uplinking licence, the probe into Radio City is being launched after the business is up and running and after it has been granted a licence. The inquiry is not a quiet one and the ministry wants it publicised.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Dec. 8: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court today denied former Uttar Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathi  arrested by the CBI in connection with the murder of poet Madhumita Shukla  permission to attend the Assembly.																								It was acting on a CBI petition challenging a lower courts decision to allow Tripathi to attend the Assembly. But setting aside the court order does not amount to much as the Assembly session ends this week. However, it does bolster the CBIs case that Tripathi had misused the permission its special court had granted him to attend the session.																								The CBI had filed a petition alleging that Tripathi had misused the permission and headed to the secretariat annexe to meet chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and lobby for himself.																								The Lucknow bench today said an MLA did not have a fundamental right to attend the Assembly if he had been arrested for a non-bailable offence. He was arrested last September after DNA tests proved that Madhumita was pregnant with his child when she was killed on June 9.

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Gujarat government and its home ministry on the petition of a riot rape victim who sought a CBI inquiry into the state polices closing of several rape cases.																								The victim, Bilkis Yakub Rasool, a resident of Limkheda taluk in Dahod district, said police closed her case despite medical reports confirming she had been raped by a mob on February 28 last year, a day after the Godhra train carnage.																								The court also issued notice to the Dahod district superintendent of police. Harish Salve, senior counsel for Rasool, told the court that rape cases were being pushed under the carpet by the state police, which had rushed to close proceedings.																								Rasool said she was part of a group trying to escape a mob targeting the members of the minority community last year. But they were cornered at a secluded place near Panivela village. The mob (then) gangraped (the)  Muslim women and one of them, who was already pregnant,  died on the spot.

		 Saturday, June 28, 2003 				 Foreign tour offensive
 New Delhi, June 27: The  Congress today threatened to mount an offensive against  the Centre in the monsoon session of Parliament for refusing  to clear foreign visits by some party chief ministers, reports  our special correspondent.																								We will take up the issue in Parliament. The Vajpayee government cannot be allowed to get away like this, spokesperson S. Jaipal Reddy said. The Centre, he alleged, was discriminating against Congress chief ministers.																								According to Reddy, Congress chief ministers were being denied their right to travel overseas on official trips though junior Union ministers were being allowed to do so. He also cited deputy Prime Minister .K. Advanis recent trip abroad, when he went with a large contingent of senior and junior officials.																								Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singhs trip to Canada to attend a Dalit conference was recently vetoed. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot was still to get central clearance for a visit to the US though less than a week was left to the trip.

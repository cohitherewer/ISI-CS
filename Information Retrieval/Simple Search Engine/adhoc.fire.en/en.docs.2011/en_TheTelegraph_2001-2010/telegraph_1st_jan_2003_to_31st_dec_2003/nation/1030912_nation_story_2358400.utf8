		 Friday, September 12, 2003 				 Israel reminder on Kargil debt
 SUJAN DUTTA New Delhi, Sept. 11: Israel  recalled favours to India in Delhis time of need during  the Kargil war, asked for Indias participation in a submarine  development programme and sought repeated assurance that  information on technology being supplied will not be leaked  out, in wide-ranging talks that the Israeli Prime Minister  Ariel Sharon had with defence minister George Fernandes  and an Israeli defence delegation had with its counterparts  here.																								Fernandes met Sharon for a one-on-one last evening, shortly before the Israeli Prime Minister cut short his visit and returned after suicide bombings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.																								India owes Israel a debt of gratitude for standing by it during the Kargil war of 1999. During the Kargil war, they stripped their own army of weapons and had them flown across to aid us, defence ministry sources said. And after the December 13 Parliament attack, they wanted to assist us again. These illustrate the kind of relations that India and Israel have built over the course of the last few years.																								Fernandes talks with Sharon were not country-centric but Pakistan figured largely in the discussion. In the talks in the ministry, the Israeli team was led by Major General Amos Yaron, director-general in the Isreali defence minstry.																								The sources said Israel was keen to supply India electronic fencing, sensors and gadgetry that could be put on the borders not only in Kashmir but also in the eastern sector (along Bangladesh) where a lot of infiltration takes place even if it is not terrorist-related.																								The proposal to participate in a submarine development programme as a junior partner, they said, was independent of other projects such as the acquisition of Scorpene submarines from France and the indigenous Project 75. The Israeli project was on a conventional submarine. It has only been floated. Nothing concrete has emerged out of their proposal as yet, a source said.																								The Israelis asked repeatedly for assurance on secrecy in technology. Last year, the sources said, the Iranian President and defence minister had visited Delhi. The fear was expressed yesterday  and not for the first time  that information should not leak out. The defence minister assured the Israeli delegation that there was no way that there could be a leakage. Israel believes Iran sponsors Hezbollah militants.

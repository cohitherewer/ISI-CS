		 Saturday, April 26, 2003 				 Gangrape on train
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, April 25: A 26-year-old woman travelling on the Gorakhpur-Sonepur passenger last night was gangraped by six co-passengers in the presence of her husband, police sources said.																								The victim and her husband, who was throttled repeatedly, have been hospitalised.																								Around the same time, dacoits were looting travellers on the Howrah-bound Rajgir-Howrah passenger near More Halt station under East Central Railway, police sources said. 																								Twelve passengers of the train, which was running 14 hours behind schedule, were injured in the attack and money and valuables worth Rs 1 lakh were looted, police said.																								The gangrape, which took place between Bagha and Harinagar stations, on the Gorakhpur-Narkatiagunge section, has sparked a furore among railway police personnel. 																								According to an FIR filed on the basis of the victims statement, the train in which she was travelling with her husband was running late. When it stopped at Kharpokhra halt between Bagha and Harinagar around 11 pm, six people travelling in the same compartment overpowered them, gagged and then dragged them out of the train.																								The couple was taken to a desolate place where the husband was tied to a tree. As he watched helplessly, the wife was gangraped, the complaint stated.																								Early this morning, the two were spotted by local villagers. The woman was unconscious and the man struggling to free himself. The husband has lost his voice as he was throttled several times by the rapists when he tried to protest.																								According to deputy inspector general of police C.R. Kaswan, the police have got the woman examined to confirm that she was raped. 																								We are in touch with the railway police and are conducting raids to nab the culprits, he said.																								The police said the victim and her husband were going from Surat to Muzaffarpur to attend a wedding and had boarded the train at Gorakhpur.

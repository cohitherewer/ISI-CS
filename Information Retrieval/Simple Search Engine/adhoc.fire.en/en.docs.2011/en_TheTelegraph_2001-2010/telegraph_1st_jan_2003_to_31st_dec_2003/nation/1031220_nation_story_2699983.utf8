		 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Amarmani bail hopes dashed by chargesheet
																								Lucknow, Dec. 19 (PTI): The CBI has named former Uttar Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathi, his wife Madhumani, nephew Rohit Chaturvedi and three others in its chargesheet in the Madhumita Shukla murder case.																								The chargesheet was filed today before judicial magistrate Kumari Rita Gupta. Tripathi, who was arrested on September 21 after a DNA test of the foetus of 24-year-old Madhumita matched his blood sample, could have applied for bail tomorrow if the CBI had failed to file the chargesheet within the 90-day deadline after his arrest.																								Sources said the CBI has also named Prakash Chander Pandey (alleged killer), Santosh Rai (accomplice) and Yag Narian Dixit (a police inspector of Uttar Pradesh who reportedly suppressed the facts). Madhumani, they added, has been termed an absconder and Chaturvedi a conspirator.																								The chargesheet also contains a statement made by Chaturvedi under Section 164 of the CrPC in which he told the magistrate that Madhumani had asked him to get rid of Madhumitas unborn child.																								Defence counsels objected to the filing of the chargesheet in the judicial magistrates court, pleading that it did not have jurisdiction in the matter. They contended that a CBI court was specially created by a notification and the present court had no jurisdiction over the investigative agencys cases. The magistrate rejected their contention and ruled that the chargesheet would be sent to the competent court.																								Defence counsel Vijai Vikram said he was yet to receive a copy of the chargesheet but according to his information, Madhumani had been chargesheeted in absentia. Denying that she was running from law, he claimed that she had gone on a pilgrimage to a remote area.

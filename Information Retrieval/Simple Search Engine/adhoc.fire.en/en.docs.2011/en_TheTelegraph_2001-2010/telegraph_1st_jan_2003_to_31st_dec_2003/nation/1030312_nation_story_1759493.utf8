The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, March 12, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Naidu film to spur Desam campaign				 																																																	Hyderabad: Andhra chief minister Chandrababu Naidu is preparing for next years general elections well in advance  Telugu Desam mandarins are already working on a campaign film in Telugu, tentatively titled Ma Babu, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Former information minister N. Shiv Prasad is working on a script in which the protagonist will outdo ADMK founder M.G. Ramachandran and Desam founder N.T. Rama Rao as samaritan and social reformer. 				 																																																	However, Naidu is not expected to act in the film as he is not a stage performer but a visionary and master political strategist, Desam legislator from Chittoor Doraiswamy said. 				 																																																	Raghavendra Rao, the chief ministers media adviser, and Parchuri Gopalakrishna, the chairman of the official languages commission, have been roped in as talent scouts.				 																																																	Expected to cost over Rs 5 crore, Ma Babu is based on Naidus own story, from his student days to the present tenure as chief minister. It will portray Naidu as the only leader in India comparable to Malaysias Mahathir Mohammad and a politician with the vision of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Shiv Prasad said. A production team under Raghavendra Rao is also working on a television serial on Naidus development schemes. 				 																																																	The idea of films as campaign vehicles is not a novelty in Andhra Pradesh. N.T. Rama Rao made Brahmarshi Vishawamitra in 1989 and Major Chandrakant in 1994. 				 																TN judiciary in job freeze row				 																																																	Chennai: A stand-off between the judiciary and the executive, triggered by Madras High Court Chief Justice B. Subashan Reddys warning to recommend imposition of financial emergency in Tamil Nadu after the government pleaded its inability to allocate funds to appoint staff, entered its second week on Tuesday, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Reddy pointed out in court that as per a Supreme Court directive, the high court was obliged, in consultation with the state government, to create the additional posts of subordinate judicial officers and the necessary infrastructure.				 																																																	The chief justice said the apex court had set a deadline of March 31, 2003, and had specified that for a population of one lakh, there should be five judges. Given Tamil Nadus population of about 6.5 crore, we need 3,200 judges at various levels of the judiciary, Reddy said. 				 																																																	Even if this expansion was to be undertaken in five stages, we should now have 1,400 judges in Tamil Nadu, but we do not even have half that number, he added.				 																																																	It is our first duty to implement the order of the Supreme Court, the judge stressed, when the matter of unfilled vacancies came up before the first bench of the high court.

		 Friday, February 28, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Shivani case charges 				 																																																	New Delhi: A Delhi court on Thursday ordered framing of charges against R.K. Sharma, the suspended Haryana cadre IPS officer, and five others accused of conspiring to murder journalist Shivani Bhatnagar, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Additional sessions judge J.M. Malik has fixed March 3 for formally framing charges against R.K. Sharma, Sri Bhagwan, Satya Prakash, Pradeep, Ved Prakash Sharma and Ved Prakash, alias Kalu. The accused will have the option of either pleading guilty that day or facing trial.				 																																																	All six will face the common charges of conspiring to murder Bhatnagar at her East Delhi house on January 23, 1999, misappropriating property under Indian Penal Code Section 403 and associating with a gang of thieves under Section 401. Pradeep, Satya Prakash, Ved Prakash Sharma and Kalu will also be charged separately under various other sections of the IPC.				 																																																	The prosecution has fixed alternative charges against the accused, so that if the common charges fail at the end of the trial, the alternative charges will still hold up, police said.				 																																																	Bhatnagar was murdered after she allegedly threatened to expose R.K. Sharma by making public classified documents which he had leaked to her while he was posted in the Prime Ministers Office during I.K. Gujrals tenure.				 																Hindujas allowed to go abroad				 																																																	New Delhi: The Supreme Court has allowed the three Hinduja brothers, accused in the Bofors kickback case, to leave the country together after months of legal battles in various courts, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	But a division bench of Justices M.B. Shah and Arun Kumar made it clear that the reprieve would be valid till May 2, modifying an earlier order in which the apex court had allowed only two of the Hinduja brothers to go abroad simultaneously.				 																																																	The bench on Thursday allowed the Hinduja brothers  Srichand, Gopichand and Prakashchand  to leave the country together after their counsel and former law minister Ram Jethmalani gave an undertaking that they would not refuse to face trial in the Howitzer gun deal case.				 																																																	The Hinduja brothers have been pleading that their business interests demanded the presence of all the three abroad.				 																																																	The apex court allowed them to travel abroad together but said they would have to report to the trial court on May 2.				 																																																	The court had earlier stayed trial against the Hindujas and their appeal to quash charges is pending before Delhi High Court. Jethmalani said the three brothers would appear before the trial court once the Supreme Court disposed of their appeal.

The court ordered that the confession be placed in a sealed envelope and opened at an appropriate time. 				 																																																	Pathan told the court that the authorities did not stop him from sleeping, but he was not up to being interrogated because he suffered from headaches.

 BINOO JOSHI																								Jammu, Aug. 20: Beggars have benefited the most from the cellular phone service launch in Jammu and Kashmir.																								There were many beggars queuing up for Cell One application forms being distributed at Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited counters here. They had been roped in as proxies by shopkeepers and those who could not bear to queue up for hours to obtain forms.																								The beggars received Rs 10 and Rs 15 for every form they obtained. The forms are free.																								The last two days were good. I hope it will be the same tomorrow, Shashi Kumar, one of the beggars who stood proxy for others, said. He regretted that it was a holiday today.																								BSNL has distributed more than 38,000 forms to potential subscribers in Jammu and Srinagar over the first two days. There are five counters for distribution in Jammu and one in Srinagar.																								In view of the heavy demand for the forms, BSNL has kept another 35,000 ready for distribution, a company official said.																								BSNL general manager R.K. Koul said 25,000 forms had been reserved for Jammu and 10,000 were meant to be distributed in Srinagar until August 25, the last day for bookings.																								The overwhelming public response has meant that it takes long to reach the BSNL counters. 																								As a result, many have roped in beggars and migrant labourers to stand in for them.																								Some shopkeepers have obtained over 100 forms to sell in the black market.																								Not to be outdone, some policemen have disturbed the queues and pushed their own men ahead to obtain forms that are later sold at a premium.																								Cellular services were launched today with chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed speaking to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But ordinary subscribers will get their Sim cards only after a lottery draw on August 28.																								I think every body would have to wait till August 28, BSNL chief general manager Arun Kumar told reporters. He said he had also heard that beggars and migrant labourers had been roped in, but said he could do nothing about it.

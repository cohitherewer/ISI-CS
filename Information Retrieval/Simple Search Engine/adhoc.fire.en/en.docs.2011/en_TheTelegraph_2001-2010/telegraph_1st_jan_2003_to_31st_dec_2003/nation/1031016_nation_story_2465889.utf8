(AP/PTI)																								New Delhi, Oct. 15: Mother Teresa will be known as Blessed Mother Teresa of Kolkata after the beatification on Sunday.																								During the ceremony at Vatican City, Pope John Paul II will declare that she is a blessed person and will be known henceforth as Blessed Mother Teresa of Kolkata, Vincent Concessao, the Archbishop of Delhi, said today.																								This is the first step towards sainthood. If and when she is declared a saint, she will be known as Saint Teresa of Kolkata. Vatican distinguishes saints or blessed persons by the names of the places where they worked.																								Addressing a joint news conference with Catholic Bishops Conference of India deputy director Donald D Souza and CBCI spokesperson Babu Joseph, Concessao said the Centre has decided to send a delegation to Rome for the beatifica- tion after a request from the church.																								The team led by P.C. Thomas, the minister of state for law and justice, will have representatives from all major religions. 																								The Prime Ministers Office has also directed the social justice and empowerment ministry to work on a national award in honour of Mother Teresa, Concessao said.																								About 2,000 Indians are expected to attend the beatification, with the highest number from Calcutta. 																								A documentary on Mother Teresa, Call Within the Call, made by CBCI, will be telecast between 11.30 am and 12 on Sunday on DDI.																								Mother Teresa is the fourth Indian to be beatified by Pope John Paul II. The other three are Blessed Chavara Kuriakose Elias, Blessed Alphonsa and Blessed Mariam Teresa, all from Kerala. 																								On Tuesday, Concessao and Babu Joseph called President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and presented him with the first copy of the book, Tracing the Footsteps of Mother Teresa. 																								Edited by Joseph and published by CBCI and the diocese of Varanasi, the book contains thoughts and personal reflections of the President, the Prime Minister, former Prime Ministers, scholars, journalists, academics and religious leaders from within the country and outside. 																								Concessao said the beatification is an honour to the church all over the world, and especially to the church in India. 																								The schedule for its telecast on Sunday is: 11.30 am-12, DDI National:  A documentary 1.30 pm-4 pm, DD II Metro:  Live telecast of beatification ceremony  9 pm-10 pm, DD I National:  Highlights of beatification ceremony																								Star News, NDTV 24x7, Sahara TV, Jeevan TV and EWTN will give extensive coverage to the ceremony and related functions.																								On Saturday, Calcutta DD Kendra will show a special programme on Mother.

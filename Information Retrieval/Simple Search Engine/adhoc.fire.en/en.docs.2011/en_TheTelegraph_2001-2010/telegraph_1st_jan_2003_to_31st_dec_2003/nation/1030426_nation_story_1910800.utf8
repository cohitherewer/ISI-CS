		 Saturday, April 26, 2003 				 Quorum row
																								New Delhi, April 25: The government today faced acute embarrassment in the Lok Sabha when a ruling NDA member raised the issue of quorum, forcing adjournment of the House for the day ahead of schedule, reports our special correspondent.																								The House was discussing private members business on a resolution on the implementation of policies and programmes for Scheduled Castes and Tribes when C. Krishnan of the MDMK pointed out there was no quorum.																								It is the responsibility of the treasury benches to ensure quorum in the House and seldom does a treasury bench member raise the issue of lack of quorum.																								Parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, who was in a meeting with health officials, rushed to the House as the quorum bell rang. Despite the continued ringing of the bell, the requisite number of 54 members could not be mustered.																								Sushma was seen speaking to the MDMK member. It appeared that Swaraj was trying to persuade Krishnan to withdraw his plea so that the House could complete its business.																								Even as Union labour minister Sahib Singh Verma and BJP member Rassa Singh Rawat pointed out that Krishnan had realised his mistake and was willing to withdraw his plea, Janata Dal (United) leader Devendra Prasad Yadav, who was in the Chair, said the process to ensure quorum had already begun and it could not be reversed.																								Yadav then adjourned the House for 30 minutes and then for the day after it reassembled at 5.30 pm.

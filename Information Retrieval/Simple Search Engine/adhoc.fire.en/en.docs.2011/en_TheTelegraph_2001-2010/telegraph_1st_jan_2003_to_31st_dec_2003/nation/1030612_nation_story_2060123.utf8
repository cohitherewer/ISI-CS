		 Thursday, June 12, 2003 				 Cong team faces jeers in clash village
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Talhan, June 11: A Congress team sent here today by Sonia Gandhi after the Dalit-Jat clashes was greeted with black flags and anti-government slogans.																								The team was led by Manmohan Singh and included Ambika Soni and chief minister Amarinder Singh. This is the first time the chief minister has visited the village since the riots that spilled over to Jalandhar on June 5 and threaten to spread to other parts of the state. 																								Sporadic incidents of violence continued for four days and curfew had to be clamped. The two-hour relaxation in the curfew today passed peacefully.																								The Congress team met leaders of both communities to solve the dispute over control of the management committee of a shrine-cum-gurdwara. It is now under Jat control.																								Dalit Action Committee president Channan Ram, who is spearheading the agitation for adequate representation of the Dalit community on the committee, justified the demonstration. We did what we thought was proper. We want the government to do more than just transfer some officers and promote some.																								 The team was accompanied by five state Cabinet ministers.

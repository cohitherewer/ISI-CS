 AVIJIT SINHA 																								Jalpaiguri, Aug. 3: The three Ulfa militants killed in an encounter in the district yesterday morning were heading for Assam to extort money from politicians and state officials for their operations in Bhutan, police said today.																								After thorough investigation, we are certain that the militants were going to collect money from Assam and to bring it back to the camp in Bhutan, said Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Siddh Nath Gupta.																								Most of the letters recovered yesterday are written demanding large amounts of money. We have got the names of a few politicians of Assam and the sales tax officer of Chagulia checkpost in Assam, besides a few organisational and personal letters, Gupta added.																								The police also tapped experts to operate the radio transmitter recovered from the three militants.																								The transmitter is a sophisticated one, having a range of several kilometres, Gupta said. To get an idea about its utility and other details, we have taken the help of experts. 																								Police officers could not operate the equipment, manufactured by a reputed Japanese company, though they have recovered its manual.																								The third militant who was killed in the encounter at Dakshin Haldibari near Daldali was today identified as Khiten Roy of Golakganj in Dhubri district. The other two had been identified yesterday as Arup Sarma of Dhubri and Rajesh Chandra Roy, alias Dipu, of Gosaigaon.

A lower court of Jodhpur has issued showcause notices to Congress president Sonia, chief minister Gehlot, the chairman of the Urban Improvement Trust and the chief executive officer of Jodhpur municipal corporation.																								The notices were in response to a civil suit challenging the installation of the statue of the former Prime Minister on public land at Nai Sarak.

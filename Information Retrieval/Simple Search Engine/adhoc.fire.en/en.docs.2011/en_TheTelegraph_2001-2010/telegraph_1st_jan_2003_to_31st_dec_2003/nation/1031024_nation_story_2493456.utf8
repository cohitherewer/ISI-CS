 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 23: Pakistan believes the Baglihar power project in Jammu and Kashmir violates the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, though officially Islamabad has not yet conveyed this position to Delhi.																								A technical team from Pakistan which visited the site for an on-the-spot assessment left for Islamabad today. Sources said the members would go through the information gathered during their visit before coming out with an official report.																								But agency reports from Islamabad quoting the Pakistani daily Dawn said: The team has returned to Delhi and they will go home tomorrow by land. They have found that the various details of the dam clearly do not match the map they were given by the Indian side.																								Pakistans main objection is about the height of the dam and the water storage capacity of the 450 MW power project that India is building at Baglihar.																								 It feels the constructions are in violation of the existing treaty.																								Pakistani officials here said once the report is made available to the Indians, the two sides would try to go for a negotiated settlement.																								If that does not yield results, they said Islamabad will be forced to seek the mediation of the World Bank, which had brokered the treaty between the neighbours and gave Pakistan the riparian rights over the Indus, Chenub and Jhelum.

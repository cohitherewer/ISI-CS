																								Patna, Dec. 30 (PTI): Alarmed at the spate of eveteasing incidents and attacks on passengers, particularly in Bihar, rail authorities have decided to step up security on moving trains.																								Government Railway Police (GRP) and Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel will be deployed to increase security inside compartments. Danapur railway manager P.K. Goel said he discussed with the DIG, railway, Rajesh Chandra, ways to prevent hooliganism on trains and at stations.																								Goel said GRP and RPF personnel are being sent to the areas that have witnessed trouble and to patrol compartments on identified sections. The railway has planned to intensify ticket-checking and utilise available communication channels to co-ordinate better with the state administration. Some GRP personnel on the trains would be in plainclothes. Security personnel will also be taken by road for special checks, Goel said.																								 Railway personnel on stations have been asked to inform the presence of troublemakers to the control rooms without delay. The trains guards, drivers and station staff have been asked to use their walkie-talkies. Passengers have been advised to contact the ticket examiners and railway employees in case of trouble. 																								Goel said even if a train does not stop at a station, the tormented passengers can write a message on paper, wrap it around a heavy object and throw it on the platform to pass on information. 																								Within days of the alleged molestation of women members of a theatre troupe from Jammu and Kashmir on December 23, passengers from Northeast were harassed on Sunday. A group of passengers complained to the GRP at Mokama in Patna district about the molestation attempts. The theatre troupe was on its way to Calcutta on the Himgiri Express when they were tormented near Patna.  The attack and molestation of  passengers from the Northeast at Jamalpur in Munger district  last month had fanned anti-Bihari violence in Assam.

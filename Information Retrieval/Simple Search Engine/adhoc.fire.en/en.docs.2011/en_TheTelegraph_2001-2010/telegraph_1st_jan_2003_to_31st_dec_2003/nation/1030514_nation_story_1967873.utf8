Army school rules out data leak Mumbai: The National Defence Academy said it was highly unlikely that sensitive information could have fallen into the hands of Anwar Ali, a teacher at the premier institute arrested for links to the Mulund train blast, reports our correspondent. Major General I.A. Satur, who is with the academy, allayed fears that the former Students Islamic Movement of India activist could have passed on sensitive information on national security while teaching Urdu at the institute.

The Pune institute, one of the best defence schools in Asia, had come under fire for taking in Ali without verifying his antecedents.The institutes authorities today said Ali was first employed on a four-year contract from 1996 to 2000.

But he got back his job when the lecturer left the academy early this year.A routine inquiry by police had been done when Anwar Ali was employed for the first time, Satur said.

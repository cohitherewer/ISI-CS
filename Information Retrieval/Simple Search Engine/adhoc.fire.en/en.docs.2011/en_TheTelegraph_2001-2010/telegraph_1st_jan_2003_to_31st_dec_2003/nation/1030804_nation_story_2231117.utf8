 New Delhi, Aug. 3 (PTI):Prime  Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said today he had undergone  a political heart transplantation.																								I was the leader of the Opposition then (when the first heart transplant took place in the country). Now I am the Prime Minister. In a sense, I, too, have been transplanted in this place. What has effected this transplantation is not medical science, but the democratic process in our country, he said.																								He was speaking at the Heart Transplantation Day celebrations at his residence.																								Vajpayee said those who carry out political transplantation were not doctors but ordinary people of the country.																								But the people can do something which even specialised doctors cannot. They can also reverse this transplantation if they so want and vote leaders out of their offices, he said.																								The Prime Minister said August 3 would be observed every year as the National Heart Transplantation Day. 																								He declared that the organ retrieval banking organisation at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here would be a national facility.

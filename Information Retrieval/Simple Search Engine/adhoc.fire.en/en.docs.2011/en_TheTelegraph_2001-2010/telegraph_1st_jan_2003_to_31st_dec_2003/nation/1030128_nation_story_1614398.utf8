The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, January 28, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Airlines told to pay for seat goof-up				 																																																	new delhi (PTI): A consumer court has ordered Kuwait Airways and Indian Airlines to pay Rs 10,000 each to passengers for denying them seats despite having confirmed tickets.				 																																																	A person holding a confirmed ticket cannot be denied a boarding pass and, if denied, it amounts to deficiency of services, the New Delhi District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum said. It rejected Indian Airlines contention that the complainant, an IAS officer, had reached late at the checking counter on November 11, 1999. This plea is not tenable as there is no rule in which a confirmed passenger could be denied a boarding pass if he has reported within the stipulated time, the consumer court said.				 																																																	Kuwait Airways, which had denied seats to an Indian couple on the ground that the tickets were not reconfirmed 72 hours before departure, was also asked to pay Rs 10,000 to each of them and litigation costs.				 																																																	On the stipulation that tickets must be reconfirmed at least 72 hours prior to departure, the court said the words at least do not denote that the tickets should be reconfirmed only 72 hours before departure and not earlier than that. The airliner was also asked to return to M.P. Gupta and his wife the $1,050 it had charged to accommodate them in the business class for their flight from New York to Delhi. 				 																Court acquits Nedumaran				 																																																	Madurai (PTI): Tamil national movement leader P. Nedumaran was on Monday acquitted by a judicial magistrate court in Tiruchendur in a case relating to his alleged pro-LTTE remarks at a meeting in the town in Tuticorin district on June 26, 1992.				 																																																	Magistrate Baldurai ruled that police had failed to prove their charge by producing supporting documents and evidence.				 																																																	Nedumaran is facing two similar cases, including one under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, for allegedly making speeches in support of the banned outfit at different places.				 																																																	Police had recently filed chargesheets in these cases. In the Tiruchendur case, Nedumaran was charged with supporting the banned Sri Lankan outfit at a meeting organised by the local unit of the Tamizhar Marumalachi Manram.				 																																																	While the case was registered by police on July 27, 1994, the chargesheet was filed on November 21,1996. Nedumaran was produced in the court on September 2, 2002.				 																																																	Speaking to newsmen later, Nedumaran said justice has won and the false case filed against him has been defeated. The Tamil leader hoped that the other cases against him would also be defeated and justice would be established.				 																SC admits Stalin plealnew delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday admitted a special leave petition of DMK MLA and former Chennai mayor M.K. Stalin challenging the order of Madras High Court that unseated him as mayor for the second consecutive term, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	A division bench granted leave to the petition  which in legal parlance means admitting the petition for further hearings  and issued notices to the Tamil Nadu government. No date was fixed for the next hearing.				 																																																	The court had quashed a law of the Tamil Nadu legislature that barred legislators from simultaneously holding posts in rural or urban local bodies. Stalin, son of DMK president and former chief minister M. Karunanidhi, was an MLA when he was elected mayor of Chennai.

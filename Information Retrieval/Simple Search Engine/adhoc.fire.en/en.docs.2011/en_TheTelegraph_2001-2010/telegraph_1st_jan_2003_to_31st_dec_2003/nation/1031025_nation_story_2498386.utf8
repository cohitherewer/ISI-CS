The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, October 25, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Pak site carries Diwali greetings New Delhi: The Pervez Musharraf regime  might still be mulling the dozen conciliatory gestures India  announced on Wednesday, but an Islamabad-based NGO has greeted  Indians exuberantly on Diwali on behalf of all Pakistanis,  reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										The NGO has offered 30-odd greetings in its Diwali ditty to India, ranging from Ramchandra ka gyan to Madhuri ki smile. The web-poetry is light-hearted and does not smack of malice. Instead, it reflects how popular Bollywood stars are across the border and how closely Islamabad and the Pakistani intelligentsia follow important developments in India.				 																																																										Aap ko Diwali ke shubh avsar par/ Chandragupta ki shakti/ Meerabai ki bhakti/ Ramchandra ka gyan/ Karan ka daan.				 																																																										Einstein ki buddhi/ Nobel Prize ki siddhi/ Gandhi ki Ahimsa/ India ki parampara.				 																																																										Vajpayee ki maryada/ Nizam ki sampada/ Michael Jordan ki salary/ Abdul Kalam ki vocabulary.				 																																																										Bhagat Singh ka desh prem/ Sweetheart ka amar prem/ Microsoft ke share/ Rupiyon ke dher.				 																																																										Tata ke senses/ Ambani ke licences/ Birla ka bangla/ Daler ka bhangra.				 																																																										Amitabh ka style/ Madhuri ki smile/ Shah Rukh ki personality/ Aishwarya ki popularity.				 																																																										World tour ka ticket/ Tendulkar ka wicket/ Administrator ke passwords/ Jokes ke forwards.				 																																																										Mercedes ki car/ Diamond ka haar/ Aur logon ka dher sara pyar prapt ho...				 																																																										Pakistani sources said Islamabad is still assessing the proposals India has made to normalise relations. They say Delhis refusal to hold talks has disappointed the Musharraf regime.				 																																																										The foreign minister (Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri) as well as the foreign secretary (Riaz Khokar) are both out of the country. But sooner rather than later a response will come from Islamabad on the new offer made by India, a senior Pakistani official said.				 																Negligence bill on hospital New Delhi(PTI): The National Consumer  Disputes Redressal Commission has ordered a Mumbai-based  hospital to pay compensation of Rs 4.5 lakh for being negligent  and thereby causing the death of a diabetes patient over  a decade ago.				 																																																										Medical literature and the affidavit of Dr Rane  a DM in cardiology  are quite clear that insulin should have been given to control diabetes of the patient. This was not done. One does not require better evidence for establishing medical negligence, the commission said after finding Bombay Hospital and Medical Research Centre (BHMRC) guilty. 				 																																																										Deceased Kamlesh Aggarwal was undergoing treatment at Ranes hospital before she was shifted to BHMRC.				 																																																										The presiding member of the commission, Justice K.S. Gupta, and member B.K. Taimni also ordered BHMRC to pay litigation costs of Rs 10,000 to the complainant.				 																Man shoots brother Rampur(PTI): A man shot dead his younger  brother over a property dispute in the court premises here,  police sources said.

Badal son Chandigarh(PTI): Sukhbir Singh Badal,  son of former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal,  failed to turn up on Friday before state vigilance bureau  officials for the second round of questioning in connection  with a graft case registered against his family. Sources  close to Sukhbir claimed that he did not receive the notice  served on him by the bureau.

Shrine demolition Mumbai(PTI): The BrihanMumbai Municipal  Corporation is all set to demolish illegal shrines in the  metropolis from October 27 following a Bombay High Court  directive. Taking note of 854 illegal shrines in the city,  the high court on September 25 asked the corporation to  take action in accordance with law and file an action-taken  report by November 12. Although authorities were tightlipped  about the number of shrines to be demolished, sources said  the owners of the shrines would be heard before action was  initiated. 				 																Gang leader held Patna(PTI): The chief of Pandav Sena,  Sanjay Singh, wanted in about two dozen criminal cases in  central Bihar, was arrested from a house here on Thursday,  police said.

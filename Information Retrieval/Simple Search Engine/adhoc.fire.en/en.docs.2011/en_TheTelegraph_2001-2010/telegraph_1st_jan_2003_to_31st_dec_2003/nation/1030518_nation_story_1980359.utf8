The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, May 18, 2003 				 Seat surge in top B-school
 BASANT RAWAT 																								Ahmedabad, May 17: After nearly three decades, the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad has decided to increase its intake of students from 180 to 250 in the new academic session beginning next month. 																								This decision will make the institutes student capacity the highest among the IIMs. Since 1974, the number of seats at IIM-A had remained constant at 180 while the IIMs in Calcutta, Bangalore and Lucknow had increased their capacity to 200, institute director Bakul Dholakia said. 																								Thirty years ago, about 10,000 students used to apply for admission and 180 were taken in, said Dholakia, who took charge in October last year. Now, the number of applicants is over a lakh but the seats have not increased. This has meant that many bright students got left out, the IIM-A director said. 																								So we felt that since there is so much demand, it is obligatory on our part to increase the intake capacity to offer admission to all deserving candidates, he explained. 																								The present IIM campus is spread across 65 acres and includes 18 hostels and residences for 75-odd staff members. A new campus, adjoining the old one, is coming up with nine new hostels, classrooms, seminar rooms, an international management centre, a sports complex and a hostel for married students, which can by used by those enrolled for the five-year fellowship programme, an equivalent of Ph.D. 																								Dholakia said one new venture was to set up an incubation centre  a laboratory for entrepreneurs. Since many IIM graduates have become entrepreneurs, we thought we must encourage entrepreneurship. The institute should be able to help the innovator to make his technical innovation a commercial product.																								The incubation centre, likely to tie up with technical institutes like IITs, will provide research and marketing facilities and help in the commercial launch of the product after modifying it to meet market requirements.

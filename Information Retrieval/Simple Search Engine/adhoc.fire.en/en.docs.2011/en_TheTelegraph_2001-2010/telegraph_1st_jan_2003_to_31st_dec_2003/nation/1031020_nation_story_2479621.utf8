		 Monday, October 20, 2003 				 BJP pins poll hope on Sonia theme
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 19: The BJP hopes the spotlight on Sonia Gandhis foreign antecedents will put the Congress chief and her party on the backfoot in the Assembly elections.																								BJP sources believe Sonias challenge to those who questioned her patriotism, at last weeks rally in Jaipur, was a defensive response and could become the central theme of her poll campaign in Rajasthan, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.																								The ruling party believes the foreigner controversy serves two immediate purposes. First, it turns the public attention on Sonia and not her chief ministers. So while, on one hand, the Congress claims its campaign will be a positive one to seek a renewed mandate for its four chief ministers, it looks like it will be Sonia who will put herself on centrestage, a BJP leader said. Their inference is that a Sonia-centric theme will not help the Congress in the polls.																								Second, the BJP believes the issue betrays the Congress sense of helplessness as the foreigner charge has not been raked up by us so much as the Congress present and prospective allies.																								So, how can the Congress claim to be the NDAs alternative when, barring Laloo Prasad Yadav, it does not have a single ally? a source asked.																								The Congress campaign is expected to dwell as much on its governments achievements as on the Centres failures.																								But the BJP maintains that speaking on our governments supposed corruption, inflation, unemployment and Hindutva will not detract from the major and real failures of the (Congress) Digvijay, Ajit Jogi, Ashok Gehlot and Sheila Dixit governments.

		 Friday, April 18, 2003 				 Sinha hits out
																								New Delhi, April 17: Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha today took a potshot at Britain for its high-handedness in arresting Senthil Kumar, CEO of the Dutch subsidiary of i-Flex, an Indian software firm, in London earlier this month.																								At the launch of the Indo-British Parliamentary Forum here, Sinha said: We send them (skilled workers) abroad to work to help those countries, not necessarily to spend their time in jail. I hope there will be no problem with Indian skilled people working in countries like the UK.																								Senthil was arrested on a complaint filed by the Dutch government.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Dec. 28: The Jayalalithaa regimes law banning forcible religious conversions in Tamil Nadu has caught Sri Lankas fancy.																								The government of the neighbouring island nation is now scrutinising the state law as Colombo, too, proposes to ban religious conversions.																								The law, enacted last year, proscribes religious conversions through allurement or fraudulent means.																								Lankas Hindu religious affairs minister T. Maheswaran said in Chennai that a draft bill, modelled on the Tamil Nadu legislation, was ready to be introduced in his countrys parliament early next year.																								Maheswaran was here to attend a four-day international conference on the Mahabharata, which was inaugurated by the Kanchi Sankaracharya, Jayendra Saraswati.																								Unlike in India, in Sri Lanka, it is not only the Hindus, but also the Buddhists who have been affected by conversions to Christianity. So the Buddhist clergy is also in favour of banning conversions, Maheswaran said. At least 7,000 Hindu families in Lanka have been converted over the last few years. The Buddhists as well as the Christians there support the bill, the leader added. 																								According to Maheswaran, the law was being considered because the new evangelists were trying to woo the poor with attractive economic packages.																								Earlier, his government had welcomed Jayalalithaas proposal for joint patrolling of Palk Straits by the navies of both countries to curb the Sea Tigers.																								The minister added that Colombo had allotted Lankan Rs 20,000 lakh for restoration of about 4,000 temples in his country damaged in two decades of ethnic strife.

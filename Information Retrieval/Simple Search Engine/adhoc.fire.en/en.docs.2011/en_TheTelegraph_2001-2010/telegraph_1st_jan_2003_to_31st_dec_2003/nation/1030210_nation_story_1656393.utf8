The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, February 10, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																South Africa police on Dawood alert				 																																																	Pretoria (PTI): South African police have been put on full alert to look out for Indias most wanted criminal Dawood Ibrahim and some of his aides, who might enter the country during the World Cup.				 																																																	Police spokesperson Selby Bokaba said they had a list from Interpol and they would keep a careful check on all border posts, at Johannesburg international airport and other airports.				 																																																	We are monitoring all groups and individuals that we think can cause problems. Its not about cricket only. We are members of Interpol and if a country gives us a name of someone who is wanted, obviously when that person enters the country, he will be arrested, said Bokaba.				 																																																	Flights, especially from Dubai, where the underworld don has business interests, will be carefully monitored, he said.				 																																																	etter for Dubai prince: Indian ambassador to the United Arab Emirates K.C. Singh called on crown prince of Dubai and minister of defence General Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid al Maktoum and handed him a letter from external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha, official sources said today.				 																																																	The letter dwelt on bilateral relations between the two countries in addition to current regional and international developments, they said. 				 																Apollo to pay girl Rs 18 lakh				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ordered Indraprastha Apollo Hospital to pay Rs 18 lakh as compensation to a girl for infecting her with the Hepatitis C virus through the contaminated blood it used in transfusion.				 																																																	The way the hospital blood transfusion records are maintained does not inspire confidence in them. A young life has been seriously affected by this negligence, the commission said in a recent order.				 																																																	Finding that the Hepatitis C infection could have taken place only through the transfusion of platelets concentrates from one or more of the five donors whose blood Apollo used in this case, the commission said the super-speciality hospital did not display the necessary care and caution.				 																																																	The consumer court said that as Apollo  contrary to its claims of being a sophisticated medical centre with an updated blood bank  failed to produce records giving details of the donors even when they were in a position to do so, this commission must draw an inference against this institution.				 																																																	Noting that Shefali Bhargava (17) was a minor when she was infected by the virus, the commission, citing medical literature, said more than 50 per cent of the patients with Hepatitis C develop chronic liver disease that may progress rapidly, leading to cirrhosis of the liver and cancer in five to 15 years.				 																Tension after cremation row				 																																																	Meerut (PTI): Tension prevailed at Maliana in Transport Nagar here a day after police fired to control a clash that broke out between two groups of people over the cremation of a body.				 																																																	Around 16 people, including four policemen, were injured in the clash following the cremation at a ground where a statue of B.R. Ambedkar was set up recently. The district magistrate had called both the groups for talks.				 																																																	Family members of the woman whose body was cremated, however, alleged that the police had resorted to lathicharge on the people cremating her, leading to the clash with the police.				 																Vajpayee visit				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee visited his relative Urmila Mishra at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences. Mishra, in her late fifties, has been treated for diabetic problems. 				 																Boy rescued				 																																																	Ahmedabad (PTI): Five-year-old Raj Patel, kidnapped from outside his school on Friday, was rescued on Sunday and two persons were arrested. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of Rs 5 lakh from his family, police said.				 																Godhra hearing				 																																																	Vadodara (PTI): The two-man inquiry commission appointed to probe the Godhra carnage has postponed its two-day hearing of the victims of Panchmahals district, scheduled to be held in Godhra on Monday, police said. The new date will be announced later, they added.				 																Jeweller stabbed				 																																																	Rohtak (PTI): Three armed miscreants allegedly stabbed a jeweller here and made an unsuccessful attempt to snatch his bag containing about one kilogram of gold and some cash, police said. The victim was taken to a hospital while the assailants fled.				 																Inmate killed				 																																																	Ambala (PTI): An undertrial of Ambala central jail was allegedly killed by an inmate following a scuffle. An old rivalry is reported to be the cause as no immediate provocation was witnessed, authorities said.				 																																																	Nearly 125 wheelchairs made by prison inmates in Britain will be distributed among disabled children in Chennai in four phases, starting from Sunday. The other chairs will be distributed on February 10, 11 and 14.

		 Monday, February 03, 2003 				 J amp;K seeks officer back for vigilance
 DALIP SINGH																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Jammu and Kashmir government has sought the repatriation of R.V. Raju, its senior IPS officer, from a deputation to the Central Bureau of Investigation.																								Indications suggest that Raju may be asked to lead the state vigilance commission.																								Raju, of the 1975-batch Jammu and Kashmir cadre, was deputed to the CBI as a joint-director seven months ago. He has since been heading the bureaus special crime division.																								According to sources, the appointments committee led by the Central Vigilance Commissioner had on January 28 cleared Rajus name for return to his parent cadre.																								The Peoples Democratic Party-Congress coalition government, the sources said, is keen on appointing him the state vigilance departments chief commissioner.																								Raju has reportedly told the appointments committee that the two-tear bar for an officer to be eligible for another deputation should not be applied in his case, leaving open for him the option of returning to the CBI within that period. Raju gave his short stint in the CBI as the reason for asking for the exemption.																								His name will now be sent to the Cabinet committee on appointments for approval of his return to Jammu and Kashmir.																								Within police circles, Raju is considered an upright officer  one reason why he is a favourite for the vigilance post  state government sources said.																								Apart from Raju, J.C. Dabas, a 1977-batch IPS officer, is also scheduled to return to his parent cadre. Dabas is a joint-director in the CBI who is in charge of its economic offence wing.																								With Rajus and Dabas exit, three posts of joint-directors will fall vacant as there is no joint-director for the multi-disciplinary monitoring agency (MDMA), which is investigating former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhis assassination.																								Till now, the CBI has received no recommendations on candidates for these posts. The bureau has a total of 16 joint-directors.																								Though the MDMA is yet to complete the investigation into Rajiv Gandhis murder, its staff strength has been reduced because there is hardly any work. The monitoring agency, given a couple of extensions to complete its inquiry, will wind up in May. Most of its staff have already been diverted to other CBI units.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 31: The national oil companies have reduced the prices of petrol and diesel by 10 paise per litre. 																								Petrol will now cost Rs 31.81 per litre in Calcutta while diesel is priced at Rs 20.47 per litre. 																								The decision has been taken in view of the softening of the dollar vis-a-vis the rupee. Oil has become cheaper in rupee terms in the international market and the national oil companies have decided to pass on the benefit to the consumer in the fortnightly revision undertaken today.

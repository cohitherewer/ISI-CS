		 Friday, October 17, 2003 				 Assailants sketches released 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 16: Delhi police today released sketches of the two assailants of the European diplomat who was abducted from the venue of the film festival and raped. The sketches were drawn on the basis of her description of the tormentors. None of the assailants has been traced.																								The 35-year-old woman was forced into her car and was raped by one of the men while the other drove. They fled after reaching Safdarjung Enclave, barely five kilometres from Siri Fort. 																								The woman informed the police on Tuesday night itself but the FIR was registered only on Wednesday morning. No explanation was forthcoming on the delay in registering the complaint at Hauz Khas police station.																								The woman spent the night with a friend, too afraid to return to her diplomatic quarters. But yesterday she accompanied the police to the National Crime Records Bureau to describe the accused. 																								The security lapse is glaring. The police presence at the venue was no deterrent. Even her Toyota Qualis with a diplomatic licence plate did not attract the attention of PCR Vans  mobile patrols in Maruti Gypsies that Delhi police advertise as a security measure  on the roundabout route to Safdarjung Enclave. 																								In Siri Fort on Tuesday night itself, another woman, a film maker was assaulted also while getting into a car. She threw her car keys into a bush and the scuffle attracted the attention of another delegate to the festival who was also leaving. The would-be assailants fled.																								The European diplomat leaves Delhi in the full knowledge that women in the city are not as privileged as her to put distance between their tormentors and themselves. There is not a woman in the capital, not a family in the city-state headed by a lady chief minister that is not discussing the incident and empathising with her.

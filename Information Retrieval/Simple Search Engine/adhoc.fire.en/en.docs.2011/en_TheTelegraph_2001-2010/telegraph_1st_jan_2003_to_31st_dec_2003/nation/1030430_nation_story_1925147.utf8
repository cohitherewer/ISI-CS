		 Wednesday, April 30, 2003 				 Prithvi testfired
																								New Delhi, April 29 (Reuters): India tested today a nuclear-capable short-range missile able to hit targets in Pakistan.																								A defence ministry spokesman said the test of the 150-km range surface-to-surface Prithvi missile was routine. It has already been inducted into the army. This was a user trial. There is nothing big about it, he said. 																								Pakistan responded calmly to the test, saying it had been informed in advance. 																								This was simply a reconfirmation that missiles are now a reality in South Asia, a Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman said. 																								Last month, India also testfired a Prithvi missile. The move triggered a tit-for-tat reply by Pakistan, which tested its locally made surface-to-surface Abdali (Hatf-II) missile with a range of 180 km.

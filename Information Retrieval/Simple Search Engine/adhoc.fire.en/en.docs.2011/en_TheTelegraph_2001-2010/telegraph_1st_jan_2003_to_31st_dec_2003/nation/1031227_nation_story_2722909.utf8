 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Dec. 26: The BJPs indications of advancing the Lok Sabha polls have prompted the Congress to hasten the process of firming up pre-poll alliances.																								Keeping the possibility of advance polls (in mind), we have our own plans for electoral understanding with other secular parties. We would be able to firm up alliances as and when the elections are announced, party chief spokesperson S. Jaipal Reddy said this evening.																								Party circles interpreted Reddys announcement as an open invitation to potentially willing allies to shed their public reluctance and join hands with the Congress to avoid division of non-NDA votes.																								Such an invitation from our side is important to clear all misgivings our potential partners may have about our intentions, said a senior party leader, referring to the view that the Congress had shut its doors on alliances during the Assembly elections. 																								Party chief Sonia Gandhi is scheduled to address a rally in Mumbai tomorrow where she is expected to make a statement on pre-poll tie-ups. 																								The Congress spokesperson invoked the Shimla Sankalp  which stated that the party would lead the prospective secular alliance and that Sonia Gandhi would be its leader  to underline the primacy attached to pre-poll tie-ups.																								He, however, denied that the Pranab Mukherjee-led committee, which is looking into the causes of the Assembly poll debacle, had recommended pre-poll alliances. The committee is yet to even finalise its report, he asserted. A similar denial came from Mukherjee, too. 																								Reddy was non-committal on whether forging alliances would depend on the potential allies approval and Sonias leadership. Asked why he was silent on the leadership question, Reddy said the Shimla Sankalp remains unchanged.																								The states topping the Congress potential alliance list are the ones where it is organisationally weak, said sources. The party is eyeing a foothold in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Bengal. 																								In Bengal, the prospect of finding an ally is bleak. 																								However, in Tamil Nadu, the Congress did not waste much time in establishing contact with the DMK after its nominees quit the Vajpayee ministry last week and the Bahujan Samaj Party was more than keen to tie up with the party in Uttar Pradesh. 																								In Bihar, the party will stick to its alliance with Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal, while in Maharashtra, the Congress has shed reservations over extending its power-sharing arrangement with the Nationalist Congress Party into a pre-poll alliance.																								There are also indications that the Congress is taking its hunt for allies to states where it is the primary contestant.

		 Monday, February 17, 2003 				 Priest attacked in shrine strife
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Vadtal (Kheda), Feb. 16: The power struggle within the Swaminarayan sect got bloody today with about a thousand followers of Ajendra Prasad, an aspirant to the chief priests post, attacking Rakesh Prasad, the present head.																								Indefinite curfew has been imposed in and around the temple, 50 km from Ahmedabad. This temple is run by the old Swaminarayan sect. The other, called Akshardham  where a militant attack took place last year  in Gandhinagar is under the new sect. The management and even the followers of the two sects are distinct from each other.																								Jayant Parimal, the collector of Kheda district  under whose jurisdiction Vadtal falls  said police were looking for the miscreants. We will arrest Ajendras followers for rioting and breaking the curfew, Parimal said, adding that the administration had already flushed out most of the mischief-mongers from inside the huge temple and that the situation was under control.																								Around 5 pm, supporters of Ajendra Prasad, who was removed unceremoniously around 20 days ago, barged into the temple premises and began a two-hour loot and arson. While some temple property was damaged by the mob, Rakesh Prasad managed to flee.																								The police said Ajendra Prasad, who was getting his son married today on the temple premises, used the occasion to flaunt his muscle and encouraged his followers to ransack Rajendras office. Around 10,000 persons had come from all over the state to attend the wedding.																								A week ago, the district administration had imposed prohibitory orders, as it had information that one group would try to forcibly evict the other from the seat of power.																								The temple has been beset by a struggle for power that comes with huge amounts of money flowing in from various parts of the world. In 1995, one of the swamis was murdered by his rival and the case is still being fought in court.

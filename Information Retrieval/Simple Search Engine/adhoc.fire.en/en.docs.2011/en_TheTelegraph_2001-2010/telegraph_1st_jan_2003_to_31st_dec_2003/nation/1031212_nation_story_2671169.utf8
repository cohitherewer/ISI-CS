 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 11: Foreigners wanting to adopt an Indian child need not be subjected to Central Adoption Resource Agency guidelines under the Union welfare ministry if the childs biological parents are alive and voluntarily give it up for adoption.																								The Supreme Court on Monday, while handing down the ruling, passed a judgment allowing a childless Italian couple to adopt Alka, the daughter of taxi driver Sumer Singh. The couple had always travelled by Singhs taxi whenever they visited Alwar during the last 20 years. 																								The couple decided to adopt Alka, one of the drivers six daughters, when they learned that he had died in a road accident hours after dropping them at their hotel during their last visit there three years ago.																								With Alkas mother willing to give her up, the couple moved the Alwar district court in January 2001 to formalise the adoption, saying they were responsible citizens with their own business and a very good income.																								The couple added that they would give the girl utmost love and affection, good education and treat her as if she were their own child. However, the Alwar court said the guidelines prescribed for adoption of Indian children should be followed as the matter involved foreigners.																								Under the guidelines, the child must be sponsored by a social or child welfare agency recognised or licensed by the government in the adoptive parents country. The district judge had said that the guidelines would apply even if the childs biological parents were alive. Rajasthan High Court then upheld the district judges order.																								However, the Supreme Court struck down both rulings, saying the guidelines would not apply if one of the biological parents were alive and willing to give the child up for adoption. 																								The apex court said there is a judicially-directed scrutiny by a local government agency in Venice and added that a court there had passed a judgment in favour of adoption. This judgment can be accepted by this court under section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code, it said.																								A division bench of Justices Ruma Pal and P.Venkatarama Reddi said the adoption guidelines do not apply and a simple application under section 7 of the Guardians and Wards Act would fulfil the adoption formalities. None of the provisions (of the guidelines) impinge upon the rights and choice of an individual to give his or her child in adoption to named persons, who may be of foreign origin. 																								The court has asked the couple to give an undertaking to adopt Alka within two years and to produce the child, if this is required, till the proof of adoption was filed with the district court. The couple was also asked to deposit Rs 50,000 to cover the airfare for Alkas possible repatriation until legal adoption takes place.

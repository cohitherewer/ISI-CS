 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 8: The Central Industrial Security Force has taken up the task of protecting VVIPs, with its gun-toting commandos already guarding Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.																								The paramilitary force, that essentially provides security to government installations, is undergoing a change in profile.																								The force was entrusted with the latest responsibility on a recommendation by the Group of Ministers constituted after the Kargil conflict.																								We are raising three special security group battalions for VIP security, CISF director-general B.B. Mishra said at a press conference marking the forces 34th Raising Day.																								Each of these battalions will comprise a commando wing, a dog squad and a bomb detection squad. The National Security Guards, whose elite Black Cats are employed for personal security, is helping the CISF with its training.																								On when the CISF will replace the Black Cats, Mishra said it will happen eventually.

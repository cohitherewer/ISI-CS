		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Death for child sacrifice
																								New Delhi, Dec. 21 (PTI): The Supreme Court has upheld the death penalty awarded to a tribal for sacrificing a nine-year-old to appease a deity in Jharkhand.																								A bench of Justices Doraiswamy Raju and Arijit Passayat said: This is an illustrative and most exemplary case to be treated as rarest of rare cases in which death sentence is and should be the rule with no exception whatsoever.																								Suhsil Murmu had sacrificed Chirku Besra before the Goddess Kali on December 11, 1996 and dumped the head in a pond. Counsel for Murmu Anil Kumar Mittal had contended that though superstition was not expected and encouraged in modern society, an illiterate tribal brought up in an atmosphere surcharged with superstition should not be awarded the death penalty.																								Rejecting the plea, Justice Passayat, writing for the bench, said: Superstition cannot and does not provide justification for any killing, much less a planned and deliberate one. No amount of superstitious colour can wash away the sin and offence of an unprovoked killing, more so in the case of an innocent and defenceless child.																								The court said a bare look at the facts showed that Murmu did not possess basic humanness.

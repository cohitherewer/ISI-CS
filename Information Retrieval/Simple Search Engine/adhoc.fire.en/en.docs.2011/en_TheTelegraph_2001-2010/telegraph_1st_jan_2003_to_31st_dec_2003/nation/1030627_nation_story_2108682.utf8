 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 26: The CBI is investigating allegations that the chairman of Siticable in Amritsar exploited women and indulged in cheating, extortion and criminal intimidation.																								A high-level team, led by a deputy inspector-general, is camping in Amritsar to probe the wide-ranging allegations against Sarabjeet Singh Raju which form part of an FIR registered against him and four others by the CBI on June 3.																								The five accused are in CBI custody and have not moved bail pleas.																								The case came to prominence when the Cable TV Welfare Association approached the Punjab Human Rights Commission, alleging that Raju was threatening cable operators, interfering in their work and snapping cables.																								Raju is also accused of cheating income-tax authorities by fudging company accounts, showing that the company had fewer subscribers than it actually had, in order to make illegal profits. The Amritsar Siticable chairman was also allegedly using the cable earnings for investments in disputed properties.																								The CBI is examining statements by three Siticable women employees, who complained to the rights commission that Raju would send them to bureaucrats, judicial and police officers as call-girls in return for favours.																								The case was filed at Civil Lines police station in Amritsar, but was handed over to the CBI following a May 30 Punjab and Haryana High Court order.																								Hari Om Dhanoka, chairman of a Siticable franchisee, and three musclemen  Gagan Bedi, Sandeep Khanna and Praveen Chadha  are the others accused in the case. Raju is alleged to have hired the hitmen to threaten other cable operators.

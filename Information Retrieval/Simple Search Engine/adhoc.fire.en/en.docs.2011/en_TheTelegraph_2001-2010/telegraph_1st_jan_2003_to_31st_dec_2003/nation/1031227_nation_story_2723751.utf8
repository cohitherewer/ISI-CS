 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 26: As with gas, so with CAS. The court has stepped in to monitor the implementation of the set-top box regime much to the relief of the Union information and broadcasting ministry.																								Delhi High Court today turned down a plea by consumer rights groups to put on hold the rollout of the conditional access system (CAS) for cable television and set a next date of hearing on April 5.																								In the interim, the government and cable industry stake-holders will tell cable television viewers that they can see the fare on popular pay channels such as STAR Plus, ESPN-STAR Sports, Sony and others only by paying for set-top boxes.																								South Delhi is the CAS testing ground and its success or failure in Calcutta and Mumbai rests on how the elite in the capital take to set-top boxes. Viewers have the option of not subscribing to pay channels and paying not more than Rs 72 (plus taxes) per month for at least 30 free-to-air channels.																								The court order comes as a relief to the Centre. Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and his mandarins in the I amp;B ministry have been trying hard to justify the reasons for introducing a system that disrupts cable television viewing as it exists.																								Everytime the ministry has expected to go ahead with implementing the system, differences within industry or among politicians have thwarted its move. Only this week, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit said CAS smelt of a scam.																								In July, when the first date for the rollout of CAS was set, ministry officials were actually hoping that the several cases filed by consumers bodies in the courts would see the judiciary step in. It has, with todays order during a hearing on the Centres response to a plea by consumer groups.																								We are not restraining the respondent (Centre) as prayed for by the petitioner. However, we allow the Centre to go ahead with their scheme of CAS in Delhi to be reviewed after a period of three months, a vacation bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Pradeep Nandrajog said.																								Prima facie we feel that the CAS enables consumers to choose which channel they wish to view and would require to pay for the same.... We desire that in this period of three months, all the loopholes, difficulties faced by the consumers, effect of the implementation and problems, if any, arising out of the implementation can be assessed and remedial measures be taken in that regard.																								The court told the Centre to look into the issue of allowing advertisements on pay channels and examine if channels earning advertisement revenue cannot be asked to turn free-to-air. It also asked the government to consider fixing a time limit for advertisement slots in a 30-minute programme.																								I amp;B ministry officials draw a parallel between their experience with CAS and Delhis experience with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). CNG was made mandatory for public transport vehicles in the capital on a Supreme Court order.																								Delhi Transport Corporation buses, taxis and auto rickshaws were asked to switch to the alternative pollution-reducing fuel despite the fact that there was a shortage in its availability and there simply werent enough stations for the vehicles to get the fuel. The upshot was that for weeks, vehicles queued up in front of the CNG stations, throwing into disarray the capitals tenuous public transport system.																								But a year after CNG was made compulsory, all agree that Delhis environment has less vehicular pollution and the murmurs of protest have turned into nods of grudging approval. Similarly, I amp;B ministry officials expect, with CAS implemented, cable television viewers will actually be able to reduce their payouts to the cable operators and the broadcasters. Like gas, CAS, too, will not fizzle out, they say.

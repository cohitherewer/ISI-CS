		 Tuesday, April 15, 2003 				 BJP camp to spot talent
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 14: The BJP will hold a four-day camp in Gurgaon to train its core group of wholetimers to scout and identify talent, in the partys first step towards raising a 5,000-strong dedicated and selfless cadre who would work full-time in the poll year.																								The BJPs national executive in Indore on April 4 and 5 had decided to create an army of footsoldiers.																								At the camp that would be the first of its kind after the BJP came to power, 150 wholetimers who joined the BJP directly though originally from the RSS  would listen to expert views on ideology, discipline and dedication, communication and self-introspection.																								Sources said the interaction would be a useful way of connecting grassroots workers with the party top brass.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu are expected to attend. Advani, said sources, would make a statement on the last day, which would be followed by a question-answer session.

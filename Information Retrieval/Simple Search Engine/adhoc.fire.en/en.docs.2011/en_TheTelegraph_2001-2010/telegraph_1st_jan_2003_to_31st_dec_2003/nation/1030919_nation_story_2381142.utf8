																								Mumbai, Sept. 18: The Shiv Sena today honoured taxi driver Shiv Narain Pandey with the Veer Mumbaikar Award for leading police to the August 25 twin-blasts suspects with accurate descriptions. 																								He was not present on the occasion due to security reasons. The drivers son, Harikant, received the citation signed by Bal Thackeray and a cheque of Rs 5 lakh, which was handed over to him by Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray. 																								The awards debut is ironic as the Mee Mumbaikar campaign initially aimed at ousting north Indians from Mumbai. Pandey, like most taxi drivers in the city, is from Uttar Pradesh. 																								Police denied Pandey was under their protection, but said adequate security would be provided when necessary.

		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 RSS praise for Mulayam
																								Lucknow, Dec. 22 (PTI): The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today hailed Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav for promoting communal harmony and claimed he was inching closer to their Hindutva agenda. 																								Mulayam has done a commendable job in promoting communal harmony and bringing people of all castes and religion together, regional RSS chief Ishwar Chandra Gupta said here.																								Lauding the chief ministers stand on promoting Hindi and swadeshi, Gupta said: Mulayam is inching closer to our (RSS) Hindutva agenda and sooner or later he would openly support us.																								There is a positive change in the attitude and behaviour of Mulayam Singh, Gupta said but refused to elaborate further.																								The Sangh parivar had been critical of Mulayam Singh particularly after the police firing on kar sevaks at Ayodhya in 1990 during his previous regime.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, September 11, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Apex court firm on night cracker ban				 																																																	New Delhi: A month before the Dussehra and Diwali festivals, the Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to relax its ban on bursting of crackers at night, saying it would impinge upon the fundamental rights of the citizens, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																										A division bench of Justices R.C. Lahoti and Ashok Bhan directed the Centre to monitor and control noise pollution caused by crackers. The bench said cultural and religious consideration would not warrant a variation in the apex courts earlier order banning bursting of crackers between 10 pm and 6 am. The direction came on an appeal by the All India Federation of Fire Cracker Association, which sought relaxation of the apex courts ban at least during the festival season.				 																																																										The association, claiming to represent over 1,000 cracker manufacturing units, also sought relaxation in the apex courts orders fixing norms and guidelines for crackers on the ground that the existing orders pose serious threat to the Rs 500-crore industry as small units would face closure. Rejecting the arguments, the bench said these considerations cannot come in the way of the enforcement of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution for the citizens and people of India. 				 																																																										However, it said that parties aggrieved by the order of the apex court and seeking relaxation of the deadline set by it could make a representation to the concerned state government. If the state government considered the grievance genuine, it could invite the attention of the Union government to the suggestions made, the apex court said.				 																Video conference in Saha case 				 																																																	New Delhi: The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has permitted cross-examination of Kunal Saha, a US-based Bengali doctor, through video conferencing in a case of medical negligence. 				 																																																										The decision was based on a Supreme Court judgment that allowed cross-examination and recording of evidence through video conferencing.				 																																																										This is the first time in the country, after the apex court ruling, that a judicial body has permitted the same.				 																																																										Sahas cross-examination is to take place on November 5, 6 and 7 and he could also get American experts during these three days to record evidence through video conferencing.				 																																																										Sahas wife Anuradha, who was also a doctor based in the US, died due to medical negligence at a Calcutta medical centre four years back. 				 																																																										Saha has claimed a compensation of Rs 77.77 crore, the highest in the history of Indian medical jurisprudence. His cross-examination, however, continued to be put off despite his presence before the commission.				 																IA manager in scam net				 																																																	New Delhi: A senior manager of Indian Airlines has been booked by the CBI for accumulating Rs 1 crore through illegal means while he was posted in Kuwait.				 																																																										After registering an FIR against Rohit Sehgal, the CBI conducted raids at his residence in Delhi. One of his associates house was also searched. Some documents pertaining to Sehgals bank accounts and other financial deals, apart from Rs 50,000 in cash, were recovered during the search operation.				 																Children rescued				 																																																	Darbhanga (PTI): Eighteen child labourers allegedly being taken to Mumbai were rescued by railway police on Tuesday night at Darbhanga railway station in Bihar, sources said. Five persons were arrested and they told the police that the boys were being taken to Mumbai to work in an embroidery factory.				 																Salman case				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): Nearly a year after Salman Khan rammed his vehicle into a bakery in Bandra, killing one person and injuring four, the trial is slated to begin on September 26 with a sessions court transferring the case to a magistrate in keeping with a high court order. The actor appeared before principal sessions judge A.J. Dholakia on Wednesday.				 																Air-India trial				 																																																	Vancouver (PTI): An expert on Sikhism in his testimony at the Air-India trial has said terrorism in Punjab increased after Operation Bluestar in 1984. Dr Paul Wallace of the University of Missouri said the operation in the Golden Temple accelerated terrorism and led to the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.				 																Jail term for bribe 				 																																																	Salem (PTI): A former chief education officer was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three years in a bribery case. Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption sleuths had arrested the officer, Chakrapani, in 1992 for taking bribe from a teacher to grant a transfer request. 				 																Dowry defiance				 																																																	Coimbatore (PTI): A 21-year-old girl from Udumalpet called off her marriage when the adamant groom insisted on full settlement of dowry before tying the knot.

The presence of the birds in the desert town is surprising because they are generally found only in hilly and dense forest regions, about 4,000 feet above sea level.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 11: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy, L.K. Advani, will meet Mayavati on February 15 to try and resolve the differences that have cropped up between the BJP and the BSP in Uttar Pradesh after the arrest of Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyya and his father, Udai Pratap Singh. 																								Before the high-level meeting, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister will have a separate session with Advani, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu and several party state leaders, including Vinay Katiyar, Rajnath Singh, Kalraj Mishra, Lalji Tandon and Om Prakash Singh, some of whom have been critical of her moves. 																								Speaking after a function at the BJP headquarters to mark the death anniversary of Jan Sangh founder Deen Dayal Upadhayay, Naidu said they would discuss the entire gamut of BJP-BSP relations in Uttar Pradesh and find ways to contain the contradictions so that the ruling coalition can function smoothly. 																								The political situation in the state following Raja Bhaiyyas arrest and the spurt in dissidence would be the other issues on the agenda, Naidu added. 																								Mayavati had met the deputy Prime Minister last Sunday and complained that BJP leaders in the state were creating problems by constantly issuing statements against her government. 																								Earlier, addressing BJP ministers and workers at the function, Vajpayee said Hindutva was not a religion but a philosophy that embraced all, irrespective of caste and creed, and it was timeless. 																								The Prime Minister said humanity was one and no social section in any part of the country could be ignored. 																								The debate will go on as to whether we are following the right path to achieve our goal. We may have different views on issues but that doesnt mean that we have strayed as each has a different path to follow, Vajpayee said.																								The Prime Minister stressed on the need for introspection rather than worry and urged party workers to follow the holistic approach of political philosophy contained in Upadhayays theory of integral humanism.

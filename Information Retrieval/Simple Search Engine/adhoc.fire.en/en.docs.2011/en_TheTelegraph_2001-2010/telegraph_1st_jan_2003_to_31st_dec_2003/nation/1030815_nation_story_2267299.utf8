The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, August 15, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Teacher suspended for student assault Hyderabad: In yet another instance of  student-teacher violence in city schools, Anandita Ramvamsi  of the DAV school has been admitted to a hospital with a  broken arm, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Anandita, a Class VII student, was beaten up by her mathematics teacher, Subba Rao, on Wednesday for not completing her homework.				 																																																										The principal of the school, Sita Kiran, told a group of angry parents on Thursday that she had suspended the teacher. But the move failed to pacify Ananditas parents who demanded that Rao should be arrested on criminal charges.				 																																																										This was the second such incident in the corporate schools of Hyderabad. A primary-level students hearing was impaired when his ears were boxed and another almost became deranged when her head was dashed against the desk by a teacher in another school.				 																																																										Prof Subba Rao, the commissioner of higher secondary education, said such acts were recurring due to the social gap between the students and the teachers. Though working in corporate schools, most of the teachers are poorly paid and the opulence of the students and their arrogant behaviour were the major irritants. The Andhra Pradesh government is contemplating a legislation against violence in school rooms.				 																																																										Some of the city schools have also resorted to installation of close-circuit cameras in classrooms to study the behaviour of both teachers and students. 				 																Indira film in permission row Mumbai (PTI): Actor and Congress activist  Naseem Khan has filed a petition in a sessions court urging  for a directive to restrain producer Nitin Keni from making  Indira Gandhi, based on the life of the former Prime  Minister.				 																																																										Sessions judge S.J. Shah on Wednesday directed Keni to appear before him on August 16 in response to the petition. 				 																																																										The petitioner has claimed that the producer had not obtained permission from the Gandhi family to make the film on Indiras life. Such a film will also show her assassination, which may spark riots, contended Khan, who has worked in over 50 films as a character artiste.				 																																																										He said Manisha Koirala was playing the lead role in the film, but she would not be able to do justice to the role. 				 																																																										The petitioner said the film-maker should declare the script before making the film on Indira. He also objected to the posters of the film put up by the producer in his office and elsewhere. The Centre and the Maharashtra government have been made respondents.				 																Shatrughan double arrested New Delhi: Delhi police on Thursday arrested  Balbir Singh Rajput, who tried to pass off as Shatrughan  Sinha, on charges of impersonation, trespassing, giving  false statements and criminal conspiracy, reports our special  correspondent.				 																																																										The arrest follows days of interrogating Rajput after he entered Parliament on August 8 and managed to leave without being intercepted by security officials. In fact, guards and others stood at attention to welcome the minister and even wished him when he passed by.				 																Solanki trial New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday  stayed trial court proceedings against former foreign minister  Madhavsinh Solanki in the Bofors case. The trial court had  asked him to file a reply to a CBI plea seeking initiation  of criminal proceedings against the senior Congress leader  for allegedly attempting to scuttle the probe into the  Rs 64-crore pay-off case. 				 																Taj case before SC New Delhi: The CBI on Thursday submitted  its interim report to the Supreme Court in the Taj heritage  corridor project, reports our correspondent. Apart from  questioning Uttar Pradesh chief secretary D.S. Bagga, suspended  environment secretary R.K. Sharma, and other state officials,  the agency had grilled senior Union environment and forest  officials on their role in the project.				 																Scare on Best bus Mumbai(PTI): The passengers travelling  in a Best bus plying on route number 124 were asked to evacuate  it following a bomb scare at Hutatma Chowk in south Mumbai.  Police said its conductor noticed an unclaimed plastic bag  lying under a seat and suspecting it to be a bomb, alerted  the control room. The bag, however, produced some documents  and cards.				 																Father-son goof-up Mumbai(PTI): A police constable has been  arrested for failing to produce an accused before a court  in a cheque bouncing case and instead putting his father  in the dock. Accused Aziz Pittawala on August 7 went to  the toilet after asking constable Anant Kadam but did not  return till the hearing started. A nervous Kadam put his  father in the dock.																		An institute to honour Havildar Namdevrao Jadhav, a Victoria Cross winner during World War II, will be inaugurated on Friday in a Maharashtra village. It will impart professional training to young people at Virgaon in Ahmednagar district.

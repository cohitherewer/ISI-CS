The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, April 14, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Strikes stall work in Valley 				 																																																	 Srinagar, April 13 (PTI): People in the Valley did not work for nearly 40 of the first 100 days of this year because of strikes called by militants. General strikes called by militants to protest issues ranging from the Iraq war to the Nadimarg massacre, forced people to stay indoors.				 																																																	From January 1 to April 10, there were 15 Sundays and 11 public holidays when offices, schools and business establishments remained closed.				 																																																	Of the 13 general strikes called, the issue of the US-led war on Iraq evoked the maximum of four strike calls. Life in the Valley came to a standstill. 				 																																																	The massacre of 24 Kashmiri Pundits at Nadimarg on March 24 also resulted in to two days of strike.				 																																																	Friday has always been a favourite day to call strikes and protests, as huge crowds are present at mosques for the afternoon prayer congregation.				 																SC strictures 				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has passed strictures against the Uttar Pradesh government for not implementing an order by a sub-divisional officer for allotting a 2.45-acre plot to a Scheduled Caste labourer under the Uttar Pradesh Land Reforms Law and instead challenging it at higher forums. It is surprising that the state of Uttar Pradesh had chosen to file an appeal against the order of the SDO, in tandem with the gaon sabha, an apex court bench said.				 																Baisakhi tour 				 																																																	 Hanslabad, Pakistan (PTI): Hundreds of Sikh devotees from across the world have congregated at Gurdwara Hanslabad on Baisakhi eve to celebrate the festival. Sikh devotees have come in from from India, the US, Australia, Germany, Russia, war-ravaged Afghanistan and Canada for a 10-day trip and are at present in Hanslabad, where a temple marks the birthplace of Guru Nanak.				 																Forest fire				 																																																	 Dehra Dun (PTI): Trees worth lakhs of rupees were destroyed in a forest fire even as an alert was sounded in vulnerable localities, officials said on Sunday. The fire broke out in Ramgarh range in Rajaji Park on Saturday evening apparently due to dry leaves. The flame was brought under control in the park but some areas in the Lachchiwala range of Doon forest division are still in the grip of fire.				 																Bird deaths 				 																																																	 Nashik (PTI): Shortage of water due to a drought-like situation at the onset of summer has claimed its most unlikely victims  15 peacocks. The peacocks died over the last four days in Hiswal Khurd village in drought-prone Nandgaon taluka, nature enthusiast Balasaheb Aher said. Nearly 200 peacocks inhabit areas around Hiswal Khurd, Landukadra, Navade, Baind villages and also the banks of Dwarka river.

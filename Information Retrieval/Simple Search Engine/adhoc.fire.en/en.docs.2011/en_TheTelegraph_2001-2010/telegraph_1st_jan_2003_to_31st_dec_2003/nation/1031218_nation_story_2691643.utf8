		 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Poll triple triumph gains spill to RS
 							 - NDA tally in Upper House to go up by 10 KAY BENEDICT Hema Malini (top),  Dara Singh 																								New Delhi, Dec. 17: The BJPs triumph in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh has not only helped the National Democratic Alliance salvage some pride.																								Thanks to the resounding victory, the coalition, which now has to depend on the Congress-led Opposition in the Rajya Sabha to get important bills passed, can attain majority after the biennial elections to the Upper House scheduled for March-April.																								The BJP is expected to get 10 more members from the three states  five from Madhya Pradesh, three from Rajasthan and two from Chhattisgarh, said party spokesperson V.K. Malhotra.																								Last year, the NDA  because of its lack of numbers in the Upper House  was forced to convene a joint session of Parliament to get the controversial anti-terror bill passed as the Opposition had refused to back it in the Rajya Sabha.																								After the five nominated members  Hema Malini, Dara Singh, K. Kasturirangan, Vidya Nivas Misra and Bimal Jalan  took oath last month, the gap between the NDA and the Opposition has been bridged considerably. The Opposition has only a slight edge, that too including the 10-member Samajwadi Party and the three-member Nationalist Congress Party.																								Of the 242 members (three vacancies are yet to be filled up) in the Rajya Sabha, the Congress has 65 and the BJP 45 as of this month. 																								The combined strength of the Congress and its allies  the Left parties 20, Samajwadi Party 10, Rashtriya Janata Dal eight, Nationalist Congress Party three and splinter groups six  works out to 112.																								There are 13 Independents, of which eight are expected to back the Opposition and among the 11 nominated members, it can bank on three, which takes its total number to 123.																								This would leave 119 for the BJP camp if the three Independents and eight nominated members who are not expected to back the Congress support the NDA. 																								With 10 more added after the biennial elections, its strength would increase to 129 at the cost of the Opposition, some of whose members are likely to retire.																								While the NDA is expected to have an edge over the Opposition after the Rajya Sabha elections, the role of five parties is crucial, which together accounts for 28 members. They are the Samajwadi, the NCP, the ADMK (nine members), the Bahujan Samaj Party (five), and the National Conference (one).																								Most of these, barring the BSP, are now offering issued-based support to both the NDA and the Opposition. 																								The ADMK had supported the anti-terror bill and is likely to back the government on crucial legislation like the uniform civil code, the cow slaughter ban and anti-conversion bill.																								Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi and Sharad Pawars NCP have scores to settle with the Congress. 																								The Samajwadi, which recently attacked both the CPM and the Congress after its chief was accused of trying to save BJP leaders in the Babri Masjid demolition case, said it would back the Opposition on issues.																								If the ADMK, the Samajwadi and the NCP decide to back the BJP-led camp, the NDAs tally will be far more than that of the Opposition.

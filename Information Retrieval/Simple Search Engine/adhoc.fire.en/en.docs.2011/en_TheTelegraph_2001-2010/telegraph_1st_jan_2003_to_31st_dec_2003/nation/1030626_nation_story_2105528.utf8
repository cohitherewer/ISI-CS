		 Thursday, June 26, 2003 				 Jaya to the rescue of jilted women
 															- CM for law to punish unfaithful				 	 Jayalalithaa																								Beware male chauvinist lovers, Big Sister is watching!																								If you are male and you are lovery and have been wooing a starry-eyed woman and promising her the moon and your self in marriage but have now decided to dump her, you are sunk. Jayalalithaa will not spare you.																								The Tamil Nadu chief minister has taken up the cudgels for the jilted women of her state, proposing that a law be speedily brought to prevent men from cheating innocent women on promise of marriage.																								At a meeting to review the functioning of the police administration, Jayalalithaa said a special law needed to be framed as fast as possible to provide justice to abandoned women who are courted with elaborate promises of marriage and then left high and dry.																								Of late, there have been several cases of suicide in Tamil Nadu of both married and single women trapped in unwieldy situations. Most of these women have been lured by unscrupulous men, promised marriage, made pregnant and then dumped.																								Of late, there have been lots of complaints about people enticing girls, making them pregnant and then ditching them. So, the government is thinking of ways to protect such women, said state home secretary Syed Munir Hoda.																								Jayalalithaas proposal  the latest in a series of pro-women measures she has taken, including making the eve-teasing law more stringent and allowing children to take their mothers initials  is part of a general drive to check the 23 per cent spurt in crime against women between 2001 and 2002.																								The idea, thrown up during a review of the performance of the 148 all-women police stations in the state, is still at a very nascent stage. Several complex issues, including the definition of jilting or what happens when a man disappears after dumping a woman, remain to be sorted out.																								Hoda said it was up to legal experts to work on the proposal and examine whether it was enough to include it in existing laws for protection of women or bring a separate legislation.

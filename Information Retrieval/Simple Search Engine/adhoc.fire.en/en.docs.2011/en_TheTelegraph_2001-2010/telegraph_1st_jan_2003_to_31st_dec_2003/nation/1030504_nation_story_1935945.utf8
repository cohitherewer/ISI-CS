																								Mumbai, May 3 (PTI): More than 150 Air-India pilots today signed an undertaking to resume flying duties by the 5 pm deadline set by the airline, following which the management announced additional services to the Gulf and restoration of the Chennai-Singapore flights.																								We (pilots) arrived at a consensus decision at a meeting to sign the undertaking under protest, said an Indian Pilots Guild spokesman, adding that some key office-bearers and pilots, who are out of station, are yet to comply with the directions of the management.																								Air-India public relations director Jitender Bhargava said: We have now undertakings from more than 185 pilots. An officer has also been appointed by the management to initiate inquiries against pilots who have been issued chargesheets for refusing to fly and abandoning flights at destinations.

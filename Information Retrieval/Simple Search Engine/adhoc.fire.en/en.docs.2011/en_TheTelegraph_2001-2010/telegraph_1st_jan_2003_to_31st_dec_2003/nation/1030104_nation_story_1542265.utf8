		 Saturday, January 04, 2003 				 Vajpayee keeps mum
																								Bangalore, Jan. 3: Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee today refused to react to the VHPs description of him as a power monger who had no real commitment to Hindutva but merely advocated pseudo-Hindutva, reports our special correspondent.																								Vajpayee was repeatedly asked by reporters, right from the moment he landed in Bangalore last night, to respond to VHP vice-president Acharya Giriraj Kishores comments against him and his perception of Hindutva yesterday. The Prime Minister had earlier said he would talk about it later, but did not meet the media for an interactive session today.																								He only said the BJP was preparing to consolidate the gains it made in Gujarat and exhorted party workers to aggressively counter the negative campaign of the Opposition.																								We have some more Assembly polls ahead in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and are preparing for them.

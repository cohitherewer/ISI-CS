		 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Vaiko breather for PM birthday
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Dec. 24: Even if he cant wish the Prime Minister Merry Christmas, MDMK leader Vaiko has made sure there will be no shocks for Vajpayee, whose birthday is tomorrow.																								At the end of an hours meeting with party leaders inside the Vellore jail  his home for the last 17 months after being charged under the anti-terror law  Vaiko today deferred a decision on his partys future in the central coalition to December 29.																								MDMK presidium chairman . Ganesan, Union ministers M. Kannappan and Ginjee Ramachandran and deputy general secretary Nazareth Durai, who were among those who met Vaiko, later said they have called for a larger representative body to meet on December 29 for a final decision.																								Sources, however, said the party has few options after the DMKs withdrawal from the National Democratic Alliance.																								They pointed out that Vaikos detention has been at the centre of the DMKs agitation against the Jayalalithaa governments alleged misuse of the anti-terror law. The MDMK leader was jailed under the law after he spoke in favour of the banned LTTE.																								The sources said the MDMK is in a fix because a few months ago, its general council had adopted a resolution that it would fully co-ordinate with the DMK in the fight against the despotic ADMK regime.																								With just four MPs in the Lok Sabha, any decision by the MDMK to go its elder brothers way will not affect the stability of the National Democratic Alliance government. 																								But, the sources emphasised, it would make a psychological difference to other NDA allies, notably the PMK led by S. Ramadoss, and other parties in Tamil Nadu waiting to join the central coalition. 																								The PMK has convened a meeting of its political affairs committee here tomorrow.																								Sources privy to todays talks also dismissed suggestions that Jayalalithaas threat to arrest Kannappan under the terror law for supporting the Tamil Tigers had made the MDMK postpone a decision. They said as the decision is crucial, it is only proper that a wider democratic forum discuss the issue.																								Further, the party leaders had just an hours time for a full-fledged discussion and that, too, with intelligence people snooping around, the sources added.																								In another development, the eight other accused in the Vaiko case today wrote to the Madras High Court Registry to list their appeals against the special courts earlier rejection of their bail plea for final disposal on December 30.																								The move came in the wake of the Supreme Court making it clear that after one year of detention under the anti-terror law, normal bail provisions would apply instead of the stringent provisions under Section 49(7).																								Vaiko, the prime accused, is the only person not to have applied for bail.																								Lawyers of the eight accused said as their clients personal liberty has been curtailed for more than 17 months, their plea for bail has to be heard urgently. 																								The chief justice could also constitute a special bench to hear their appeals in the first week of January, they suggested.

																								New Delhi, Feb. 14: A mock drill to test security arrangements in Parliament triggered panic today with commandos swinging into action to thwart any untoward situation, reports our special correspondent.																								The exercise was carried out to check the state of alertness of forces ahead of the budget session, which begins on Monday.																								The police control room received a call at 8.39 this morning, claiming that a blast had taken place inside the Parliament complex, sources said. It was followed by two more calls  one after about 40 minutes and the other at 9.27 am. Immediately after the first call came, Delhi police commandos took position and cordoned off the entire complex. 																								The bomb disposal squad was pressed into action.																								Delhi police officials said the mock exercise was done to avoid a repeat of December 13.																								They have been getting intelligence inputs of another major strike by militants, the officials added.

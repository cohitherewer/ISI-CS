		 Tuesday, June 24, 2003 				 Scandal stalls Assembly
 HARISH CHANDOLA																								Joshimath, June 23: Allegations levelled by Assamese girl Indira Deori, alias Jenni, against former minister of revenue and disaster management Harak Singh Rawat continue to rock the Uttaranchal Assembly.																								The House had to be adjourned today after members of all the Opposition parties left their seats and gathered in the well of the Assembly, shouting slogans demanding the resignation of the Congress government.																								The Opposition alleged that the .D. Tiwari regime was shielding Rawat, who resigned from his post on June 18 after the 22-year-old woman, an inmate of the state-run home for destitute women in Dehra Dun, alleged that he had fathered her child.																								In the din and disturbance, the state budget, postponed since March, could not be passed. Since allocations will end on June 30, Speaker Yashpal Arya hopes to get the House to pass all department budgets by tomorrow.																								The Opposition is demanding that the report of the committee that questioned Jenni on the paternity of the boy born to her early this month be tabled in the House. The Speaker has so far declined to do so. In the report, Jenni has reportedly  accused the minister of raping her after his supporters  brought her to him on the pretext of getting her a job.  This information was revealed by the leader of the Opposition,  Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, who yesterday led a delegation of  the Opposition to the Governor demanding the governments  resignation. Chief minister N.D. Tiwari, who  said on Saturday that he would ask for a CBI inquiry into  the case, did not attend the House today. The state government  has not yet filed a FIR of the case, so the question of  any Central investigating agency inquiring into it will  not arise.

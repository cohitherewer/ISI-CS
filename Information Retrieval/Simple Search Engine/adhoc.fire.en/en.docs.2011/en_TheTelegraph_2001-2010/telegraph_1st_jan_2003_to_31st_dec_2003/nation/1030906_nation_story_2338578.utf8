 SUVRO ROY																								Mumbai, Sept. 5: The Sahara India group will construct six modern townships in Bengal as part of its 202 Sahara City Homes projects across the country.																								The 202 townships, estimated to be worth Rs 83,000 crore, will be spread over 18,575 acres with nearly seven lakh housings, many of which will also be affordable to the middle and lower-middle class, Sahara managing worker and chairman of Sahara India Pariwar Subrata Roy said here yesterday.																								Even though Roy refused to divulge the locations targeted by the group, a senior official indicated that two locations the company is eyeing are areas adjacent to Rajarhat New Town and a place on the way to Diamond Harbour.																								Each of these townships will be on sprawling 16 to 17 acres on highways and main roads and not more than five to seven kilometres from the fringes of the city or district towns, said Roy, adding that the lands will be mainly purchased from farmers. He said the townships will be  modern in every sense of the term. No one has got it,  they have only thought about it.

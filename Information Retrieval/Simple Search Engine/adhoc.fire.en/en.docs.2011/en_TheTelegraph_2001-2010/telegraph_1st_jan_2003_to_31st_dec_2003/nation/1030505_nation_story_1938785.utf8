																								Bhubaneswar, May 4: A division bench of Orissa High Court served notices to the Centre and the state government over the disinvestment of National Aluminium Company, reports our special correspondent. 																								The notices were issued to the governments in response to a petition filed by former chief minister Giridhari Gomango. 																								In November last year, Gomango had filed a PIL challenging the decision of the disinvestment ministry to divest 59.15 per cent stake of the 87.15 per cent stake held by government. 																								In his petition, he had said the proposed disinvestment was illegal, arbitrary, malafide and unconstitutional.

		 Tuesday, November 04, 2003 				 HC turns down singer bail plea
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Daler Mehndi																								New Delhi, Nov. 3: Delhi High Court today dismissed an application by Daler Mehndi, wanted in a human trafficking case, seeking extension of the 10-day interim anticipatory bail.																								Justice S.K. Agarwal also forfeited a surety of Rs 5 lakh given by Mehndis lawyer when the singer was granted interim bail on October 23 for 10 days so that he could apply for regular bail in a Patiala court.																								The high court dismissed the petition after being informed by Punjab police that Mehndi had sought bail from a Patiala court, where the human trafficking case was being heard.																								Nothing survived in the petition since he has applied for regular bail in the court concerned, Justice Agarwal said.																								The court expressed displeasure on noticing that Mehndis lawyer had taken surety for the singer, which is unlawful. A personal bond of the same amount had also been furnished by Mehndi.																								Punjab police told the court that Mehndi, who is on the run, was not cooperating in the investigation. He had showed up only on two days  October 27 and 28  before Patiala police to execute a personal bond and surrender his passport.																								According to the Punjab police counsel, despite giving an undertaking, Mehndi did not join the investigation.																								However, the singers counsel submitted that he was avoiding the police as he feared a threat to his life. Punjab police replied that they would ensure protection to Mehndi provided he joins the probe.																								Mehndi had sought a two-month extension of the interim bail and that the investigation be handed over to the CBI.																								On October 31, the high court refused to pass any order without hearing what the Punjab police had to say. It issued notices to Punjab police and the Delhi government to file replies today.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 22: The CPM regards National Democratic Alliance partners as potential defectors who will ally with the Opposition once their disillusionment with the BJP boils over.																								They will quit the alliance once they realise how communal and anti-people the government is, senior CPM MP Somnath Chatterjee said. He hosted a meeting of Opposition leaders this morning to decide on better floor coordination in both Houses.																								The meeting was attended by MP and former Union minister of state for external affairs, Omar Abdullah, whose National Conference has quit the NDA.																								Rashtriya Lok Dal MP and former Union agriculture minister Ajit Singh (who quit the alliance two months ago) could not attend because he is out of Delhi, said Chatterjee.																								Another former Union minister, Lok Jan Shakti leader Ram Vilas Paswan has been inching towards the Opposition.																								Asked if the CPM would welcome the Trinamul Congress into the Opposition fold, Chatterjee said: First they have to call themselves an Opposition party.

		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Chop amp; change on Sonia table 
 K. SUBRAHMANYA 																								New Delhi, Dec. 11: The poll debacle may take its toll of the All India Congress Committee, though Sonia Gandhi had on Sunday assumed collective responsibility. 																								Indications are the Congress chief is intent on revamping the organisational set-up as early as possible so that a new team is in place to prepare the strategy for the general elections due next year. The exercise has assumed added urgency as the leadership reckons the parliamentary polls could be advanced to April. 																								Sonia is likely to fix individual accountability despite discouraging her colleagues from playing the blame game at Sundays working committee meeting by asserting all party members, including herself, were responsible. 																								This became evident from the constitution of a five-member committee to quickly submit detailed reports on the election outcome in each of the five states that went to polls. 																								The panel is led by Pranab Mukherjee and has Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Mani Shankar Aiyar, Prithviraj Chavan and Bijoy Handique as members. It will list the reasons for the partys defeat. 																								While announcing the panel on Sunday, Sonia had said its purpose would be to prepare the party strategy for future polls. That, however, is not the brief to the Mukherjee panel now. 																								It transpires she is serious about finding out why her colleagues made her believe that the Congress would win in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. 																								The Mukherjee panel report could have a bearing on Sonias agenda of organisational reshuffle. Sources said she was contemplating another working committee meeting early next week. 																								The scheduling of the meeting would depend on getting the Mukherjee report in advance as its discussion would be one of the items on the agenda, the sources added.																								On Sunday, senior leaders such as Arjun Singh, Madhavsinh Solanki, Natwar Singh and J.B. Patnaik were believed to have raised uncomfortable posers about the AICCs handling of the Assembly poll campaign. 																								Their indirect target was Ambika Soni, the general secretary in charge of AICCs media department and party affairs in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. 																								Sonia has decided to dispatch central observers to Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh for the election of Congress legislature party leaders.																								Vilasrao Deshmukh and Ahmed Patel will kick off the exercise by going to Raipur tomorrow to ascertain the views of the newly elected MLAs on their choice of legislature party leader. 																								Soni and P.M. Sayeed will follow on Saturday by heading to Bhopal. The next day, Soni and Motilal Vora will carry out a similar exercise in Jaipur.

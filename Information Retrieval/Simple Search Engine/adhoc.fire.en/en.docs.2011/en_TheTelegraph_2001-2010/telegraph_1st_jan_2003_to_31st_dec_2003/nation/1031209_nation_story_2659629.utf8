 K.C. PHILIP ( From  top)Laloo Prasad, Ojha 																								Patna, Dec. 8: Two days after director-general of police D.P. Ojha was sidelined, accusations and counter-accusations flew between political opponents in Bihar.																								The race for political gains started with Laloo Prasad Yadav charging the ousted officer with serving the interests of the Ranbir Sena, a private army of landlords.																								The ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal chief alleged he had irrefutable information that leaders of the Ranbir Sena and criminals having links with the NDA had paid frequent visits to the sacked DGP and a conspiracy to topple the duly elected government in Bihar was hatched in Ojhas office.																								Such allegations are baseless and (made) out of vendetta, Ojha said today. 																								Not to be left behind, state RJD secretary Ram Kripal Yadav alleged a plot by the NDA in collusion with D.P. Ojha to kill excise minister Shivanand Tiwari at the book fair yesterday.																								BJP ke goonde Ojha ke ishare par yeh sab kara rahe hain (The BJPs goons are doing all this at Ojhas instance), Yadav alleged. Police should inquire and expose the plot, he demanded.																								The NDA, led by convener Nand Kishore Yadav, lost no time in submitting a memorandum to the governor, demanding the dismissal of the government which it accused of protecting criminals and anti-national elements.																								The Opposition coalition has already wanted to know if the officers defiance of Laloo Prasads instruction not to take further action against Siwan MP M. Shahabuddin had precipitated matters.																								The RJD chief accused Ojha of being anti-minority community as he was dancing to the tune of the BJP and the RSS. Ojha had pinpointed Shahabuddin as he comes from the minority community, Laloo Prasad alleged.																								Deepankar Bhattacharya of the CPI (ML) wanted to know if Ojha was a Ranbir Sena man, then why did Laloo Prasad make him the DGP last February?																								The RJD chief today repented making Ojha the DGP, a man who he said had denigrated women by calling chief minister Rabri Devi dumb.																								Though Laloo Prasad failed to clarify where and when the remark was made, he said the government had taken it seriously and would take action against Ojha. The state womens commission today decided to issue a summons to Ojha seeking his personal appearance in the matter.																								The state has already issued him a showcause notice, charging him with violating the All India Services Conduct Rules by speaking against the government.																								Ojha was prompt with the reply. A government that runs in an unconstitutional manner has no moral authority to serve me a notice. I am not going to answer that. 																								He added he would approach the Supreme Court and speak up there. Ojha also warned he would be compelled to reveal many more things if the personal attack continued.																								The RJD burned NDA leaders effigies this morning at the busy Dak Bangla Chowk here and later took out a procession. The NDA took over the spot in the evening and burned effigies of Laloo Prasad and Rabri and raised slogans in favour of tomorrows 12-hour Bihar Bandh.

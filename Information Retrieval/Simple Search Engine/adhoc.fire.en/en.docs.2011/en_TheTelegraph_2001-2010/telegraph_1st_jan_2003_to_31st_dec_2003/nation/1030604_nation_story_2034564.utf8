 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 3: The ranks of the tainted seem to be swelling as the probe into the transfer-for-cash scandal progresses.																								The Central Bureau of Investigation today told a city court that recorded conversations of the accused in the case reveal that nearly a dozen revenue officers were utilising the services of A. Krishnamurthy, the alleged go-between, for getting choice postings. Of them, some have already been questioned.																								The bureau is also collecting information on the role of two Union finance ministry officials believed to be involved in the transfer racket.																								A CBI counsel told special judge V.K. Jain that arrested Indian Revenue Service officer Anurag Vardhan was acting as a conduit between other accused officers and the two main figures in the scam, Krishnamurthy and R. Perumalswamy.																								Both Krishnamurthy, a Chennai-based chartered accountant, and Perumalswamy, personal assistant of former junior finance minister Gingee Ramachandran, have been arrested. Ramachandran resigned after his PA was arrested for taking a bribe of Rs 4 lakh from Vardhan.																								Jain, who extended the CBI custody of Krishnamurthy and Vardhan till June 6, said the bureau needed to be given more time to interrogate the accused, verify recorded conversations and confront the accused with the tapes.																								Krishnamurthys lawyer, S. Arvind, had argued that there was no justification for seeking extension of his clients remand as he had already been interrogated for more than 200 hours.

		 Tuesday, November 04, 2003 				 Terror law talks fail
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Nov. 3: An apparent last-ditch effort by the NDA government at the Centre to get key Tamil Nadu ally DMK to revise its stand on the anti-terrorism legislation failed today.																								NDA convener George Fernandes obliquely conceded, after an hours discussions with M. Karunanidhi at the DMK presidents Gopalapuram residence this evening, that the fundamental differences between the NDA government and the Tamil ally on the law could not be resolved.																								The defence minister initially declined comment on the outcome of the talks, when asked about the contrasting positions of the DMK and the NDA on the anti-terror legislation. He, however, later said the differences persisted.																								There are issues that have to be resolved, Fernandes admitted. One has to reconcile them (the differences).																								The defence minister later told journalists that he had come to Chennai on the DMK chiefs request to discuss various political matters, including concerns over the anti-terror legislation and the detention of MDMK chief Vaiko under the law.

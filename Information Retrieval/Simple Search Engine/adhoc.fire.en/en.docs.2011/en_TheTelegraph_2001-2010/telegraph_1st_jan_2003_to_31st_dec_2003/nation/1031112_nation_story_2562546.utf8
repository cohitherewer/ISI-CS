		 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Jaya, Advani to share dais
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Nov. 11: Less than a week after ruling out an electoral pact with the BJP, Jayalalithaa will share a platform with L.K. Advani here on Thursday. This has fuelled speculation that the Tamil Nadu chief ministers pledge last Thursday to help form a non-Congress, non-BJP, non-Janata Dal government at the Centre was only a ruse to improve her bargaining position with the BJP.																								The deputy Prime Minister will be here to inaugurate the seventh national conference on e-governance, being organised by the Tamil Nadu government. Jayalalithaa will deliver the special address at the function.																								The conference is expected to help evolve a national action plan to implement e-governance in all states.																								The ADMK, still searching for a response to the national outcry against the crackdown on six senior journalists in Tamil Nadu, has sought to reap the benefits of Advani rubbing shoulders with Jayalalithaa. Its mouthpiece, Namathu MGR, has sought to highlight the significance of the conference.

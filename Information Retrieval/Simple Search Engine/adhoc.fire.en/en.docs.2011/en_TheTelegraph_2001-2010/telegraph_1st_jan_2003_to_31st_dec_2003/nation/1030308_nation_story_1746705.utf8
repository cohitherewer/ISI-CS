The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, March 08, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																BJP piles Bhojshala heat on Digvijay				 																																																	 new delhi: Stung by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singhs U-turn on his earlier decision to open the Bhojshala on Tuesdays for Hindus, the BJP accused him of raising such issues to divert peoples attention from problems affecting the state, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The party said it would send a team to Dhar to study the situation regarding Bhojshala. The chief minister, by raising issues like cow slaughter and Bhojshala, is only diverting peoples attention from problems like proper roads and other facilities that have not been provided by the state government, party spokesperson V.K. Malhotra said.				 																																																	The BJP leader said a parliamentary party team of three or four members would visit the spot to study the situation and submit a report to the party high command. The date and details of the composition of the delegation would be decided soon, he said.				 																																																	Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma criticised the decision. It is not a party issue. It is a government issue. Why should the BJP send a team, when it should, if needed, have been sent by the Centre? he asked.				 																																																	Malhotra said the Bhojshala and the mosque are separate and there should be no time restriction on offering prayers at the shrine. After all, why should it be restricted only to days like Shivratri or on the occasion of Saraswati Puja? he asked.				 																Salman plea to drop charge				 																																																	 mumbai (PTI): Salman Khan, booked in a hit-and-run case in which one person died and four were injured, has urged a sessions court to drop the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against him.				 																																																	In keeping with a judicial directive, Salman appeared before additional principal sessions judge A.J. Dholakia on Friday.				 																																																	Salmans lawyer Adik Shirodkar filed an application urging for dropping the charge under Section 304 Part Two of the IPC on the ground that the actor had no knowledge that his alleged rash and negligent driving would result in the death of a person and cause injuries to others.				 																																																	Shirodkar argued that the offence was not made out under Section 302 and that it was a case of rash and negligent driving that can be tried by a magistrate. He pleaded that the case be referred to a magistrate for trial. However, on January 21, a magistrate had referred Salmans case to the sessions court for trial.				 																																																	As prosecutor R.V. Kini sought time to file his reply, the court deferred the matter to March 19.				 																																																	Salman was arrested on September 28 after his vehicle rammed into a bakery at Bandra, killing one and injuring four. He was granted bail the same day. The actor was rearrested on the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Eventually, he secured bail on October 24.

Another sepoy noticed Singhs body hanging from the ceiling of the stairs on the ninth floor.

		 Thursday, August 07, 2003 				 Gujarat BJP to hold protests
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Aug. 6: A day after chief minister Narendra Modi wrote a letter to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam seeking his directive for compilation of state-wise data on communal violence in the country and acquittal of the accused in these cases, the Gujarat unit of the BJP has decided to stage dharnas in every district headquarters on August 8 against the National Human Rights Commission.																								Senior BJP leader and education minister Anandiben Patel said her party accepts the Best Bakery judgment and condemns the rights commissions unprecedented plea to the Supreme Court to shift major cases outside the state  something that never happened in the history of post-Independence India.																								The commissions move, she maintained, amounted to a no-confidence motion against Gujarats judicial system.																								This irresponsible and unfortunate step by the human rights body has boosted the morale of secularists who have been launching a systematic campaign against the state, hurting Gujarats pride.																								The minister slammed the commission, but at the same time did not rule out the possibility of the state government appealing in the high court against the Best Bakery judgment.

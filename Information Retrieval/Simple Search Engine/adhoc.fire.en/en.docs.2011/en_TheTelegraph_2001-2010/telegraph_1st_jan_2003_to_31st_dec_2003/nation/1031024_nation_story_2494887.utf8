		 Friday, October 24, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Private parties can move SC for justiceNew Delhi (PTI): In a judgment that could justify the intervention of the National Human Rights Commission in Gujarat riot cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that interested private parties can move the apex court in cases where they apprehend miscarriage of justice by acquittal of the accused.				 																																																										A bench of Justices Doraiswamy Raju and Arijit Passayat said although persons other than the state and the accused have no locus standi to file appeals in a criminal case, a petition moved by an interested private party apprehending miscarriage of justice could be entertained under Article 136 of the Constitution.				 																																																										We do not have the slightest doubt that we can entertain appeals against judgments of acquittal by the high court at the instance of interested private parties also, it said.				 																																																										The ruling comes in a murder case where the trial court had convicted four persons on various charges. However, Allahabad High Court had acquitted all the accused and dismissed the states appeal.				 																																																										Ramakant Rai, the victims father, had moved the apex court challenging the acquittal but the accused had questioned his locus standi to file an appeal.				 																																																										Justice Passayat, writing the judgment for the bench, said Article 136 neither conferred on anyone the right to invoke the jurisdiction of this court nor inhibited anyone from invoking the courts jurisdiction.

 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot is believed to have put the blame for the Congress stunning defeat in the recent Assembly polls on state government employees.																								Gehlot, who appeared yesterday before an apex party panel probing the causes of the poll reverses, is understood to have explained that the government employees were hostile to the Congress and wrecked its prospects.																								The Rajasthan government had crushed an employees strike two years ago, following which trade unions had given a call to vote out the Gehlot regime.																								Sources said Gehlot is virtually absolving himself of the responsibility for the defeat  though the central leadership had given him full authority to conduct the election campaign  by blaming the bureaucracy.																								The former chief ministers reasoning was sharply at variance with those of other prominent state leaders, including working committee member Natwar Singh, state unit chief Girija Vyas and former chief minister Shiv Charan Mathur, who yesterday appeared before the panel headed by Pranab Mukherjee.																								These leaders are understood to have attributed the defeat to faulty ticket distribution, the wrath of the Jat community, alienation of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Gehlots failure to provide collective leadership during the poll campaign.																								The Mukherjee panel also interacted with party leaders from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to ascertain their views on the defeat in the two states. The committee is also taking the views of the Congress leaders who were in charge of poll preparations in the three states.																								It is learnt to have circulated a detailed questionnaire to the leaders, including whether the party had failed to gauge the public mood, why pre-poll surveys went wrong, whether ticket distribution was faulty, whether the campaign machinery failed to deliver and whether there was paucity of funds.																								The panels report is crucial to Gehlots bid to retain the leadership of the Congress legislature party. The high command, which has been authorised to name the leader, is yet to take a decision.

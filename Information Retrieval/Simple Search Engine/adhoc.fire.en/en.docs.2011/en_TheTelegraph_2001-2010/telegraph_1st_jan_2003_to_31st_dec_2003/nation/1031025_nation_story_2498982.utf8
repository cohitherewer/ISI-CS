		 Saturday, October 25, 2003 				 Dawood hope
 New Delhi, Oct. 24 (PTI):  Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today expressed hope that  the US would take steps for handing over underworld don  Dawood Ibrahim to India.																								Washington had recently declared Dawood  based in Karachi and holding a Pakistani passport  a global terrorist.																								We hope that Washington will take steps in the right direction for handing over Dawood to India as the official website of the US treasury department has highlighted his role in destablising India, Advani said in his speech at the 42nd Raising Day celebrations of the Indo-Tibet Border Police.																								We had been raising the issue of the role of Dawood for (the) last so many years and the influence of Pakistan in shielding him. Any way, better late than never...Now we hope pressure will be exerted on the country shielding him in handing him over to India, he said.

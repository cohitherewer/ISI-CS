		 Thursday, December 04, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Badals to stay in jail till Friday				 																																																	Chandigarh: In another blow to the Shiromani Akali Dal, Ropar special judge S.K. Goyal has adjourned his order till Friday on the bail plea of party president Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir, a Rajya Sabha member, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										Badal and Sukhbir are lodged in separate cells in Patiala jail. Both were sent to judicial custody on Monday after they appeared in court in a Rs 78-crore disproportionate assets case filed by the state vigilance bureau on November 22.				 																																																										Their counsel H.S. Mattewal argued that while the defendants had full faith in the Ropar court, the case should be tried in Chandigarh as the allegations pertained to the period Badal was chief minister with his official residence in that city.				 																																																										Mattewal also said that for prosecuting Badal, the governors sanction was necessary as Badal drew the salary of a cabinet minister. 				 																																																										He said similar permission was needed for Sukhbir from the Rajya Sabha chairman. He also referred to a Supreme Court ruling that permission in such cases should be procured from competent authorities.				 																																																										The vigilance bureau has opposed Mattewals plea, saying investigations would suffer a setback as the Badals were threatening the officers probing the case. It has also said Badal was only a legislator and privileges of a cabinet minister had been extended to him because he was the leader of the Opposition.

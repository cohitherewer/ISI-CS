IIT will also help the one-year-old Biju Patnaik Institute of Technology to draw up its curriculum and lay down a credit-based semester system.																								By January, an MoU will be signed between us and the Orissa government to define the scope of IIT Kharagpurs involvement in the state, said Dubey.

Patnaik also inaugurated an information kiosk  developed internally by IIT Kharagpur  containing critical information on the health sector. 																								The system has multiple utilities and it can keep track of availability of doctors, medicines and blood in hospitals and health centres. We are helping the West Bengal government set up such kiosks in various parts of the state. The Orissa chief minister also wants to adopt this system for his state, Dubey added.

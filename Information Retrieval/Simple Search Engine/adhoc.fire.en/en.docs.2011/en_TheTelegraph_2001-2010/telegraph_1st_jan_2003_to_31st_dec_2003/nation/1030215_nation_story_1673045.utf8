		 Saturday, February 15, 2003 				 Muftis Valley gets new sheen
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, Feb. 14: At least one person has responded to Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds call to Bollywood to try out Kashmir again as a filmmakers haven. But then he is also trying out a subject that is new to mainstream Hindi cinema.																								Ashok Pandit, director-producer of Sheen, a film on the plight of Kashmiri Pundits, will shortly take his 75-member crew to the distant reaches of the Valley to shoot his film. This follows a meeting between Sayeed and the film fraternity in the city.																								I felt that the chief minister was confident about the security. But I also wanted to go because my film is about Kashmiris and I am from Kashmir, says Pandit.																								The film is a love story set in 1990, marked by the exodus of Pundits from the Valley. Pandit says his film addresses a subject that has been untouched by any mainstream filmmaker in the country  the plight of the 7.5 lakh-strong Kashmiri Hindus who had to flee their land following militant attacks.																								Maybe because the subject does not enjoy the support of all political lobbies, no one has made a film on it, says Pandit.																								He says he wants to address a number of issues with his film. He took care to see that his love story did not happen between a boy and a girl belonging to two different religions, because that would be the first lie.																								Kashmiri Pundits would not marry Muslims. So why should I show such a situation? That would show I am not sure of myself. By repeating such cliches, we dont help mitigate communal feelings, rather point out more the divides, he says.																								He says his film, with song-and-dance sequences, and featuring newcomers Tarun Arora and Sheen in the lead roles, with Raj Babbar and Kiran Juneja, will be a mainstream film, but an honest attempt to deal with people whose plight has been forgotten amid political compulsions.																								My hero is a victim. He is not a terrorist. And terrorists are not heroes. I want to distance myself from the tradition of glorifying terrorism in films like Mission Kashmir, says Pandit.																								How can you call a terrorist a brave man? And films like this justify terrorism by showing that maybe a personal tragedy led to the mindset. But how can you ever justify terrorism?

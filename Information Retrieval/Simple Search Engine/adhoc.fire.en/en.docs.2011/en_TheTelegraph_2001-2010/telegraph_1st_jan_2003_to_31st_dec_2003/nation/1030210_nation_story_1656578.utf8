		 Monday, February 10, 2003 				 Uma for locks off shrine
																								Dhar, Feb. 9 (PTI): Senior BJP leader Uma Bharti today demanded opening of the locks of Bhojshala and termed the 1997 decision to close it as wrong.																								She said the disciplined turnout of devotees at the monument on Basant Panchami indicated that the decision to lock it up was wrong.																								If the state government writes to the Centre about the prevailing law and order situation, the Centre would open the locks, she added.																								Tension has been simmering of late around the disputed 11th century monument which is a common place of worship for both Hindus and Muslims.

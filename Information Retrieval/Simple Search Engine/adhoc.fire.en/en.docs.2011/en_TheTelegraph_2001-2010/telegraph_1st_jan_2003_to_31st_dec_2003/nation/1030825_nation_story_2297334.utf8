		 Monday, August 25, 2003 				 Temple pitch
																								Chandigarh, Aug. 24: Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Praveen Togadia today asked supporters not to wait any longer and gear up for a mass movement for construction of a Ram temple at Ayodhya as patience was running thin, reports our correspondent. 																								We must not wait for any signal from the government or the court. We will begin our movement once the sants spearheading the temple campaign give us the nod, he told a gathering of nearly 1,000 VHP and Bajrang Dal activists here today. The sants will meet on September 14 and 15 at Ayodhya. 																								Togadia, however, denied that a deadline had been set for the temple.

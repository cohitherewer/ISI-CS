 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Oct. 16: Embroiled in controversies and confronted by an ever-increasing set of detractors, Ajit Jogi can at least draw comfort that the high command will not rock his boat in the run-up to the December 1 Assembly elections.																								There could have been few doubts that the Chhattisgarh chief minister would be allowed to continue in office, going by the partys stout defence of Jogi after the CBI chargesheeted him on October 7. 																								He was chargesheeted for fraudulently using a forged document to sully the reputation of an Intelligence Bureau special director, the organisation itself and the Centre.																								Today, Sonia Gandhi made it amply clear that Jogi had the high commands backing. 																								Informed party sources said the Congress chief had got in-house legal experts and senior leaders to vet the CBI chargesheet to reassure herself that she was not backing the wrong horse on election-eve. Among those asked to scrutinise the document was Pranab Mukherjee.																								All agreed that there was nothing incriminating in the chargesheet that could land the chief minister into legal trouble. Sources said Jogi had also convinced  the leadership that he would not run into any trouble in  the other court case, relating to his having acquired an  allegedly forged scheduled tribe status certificate.

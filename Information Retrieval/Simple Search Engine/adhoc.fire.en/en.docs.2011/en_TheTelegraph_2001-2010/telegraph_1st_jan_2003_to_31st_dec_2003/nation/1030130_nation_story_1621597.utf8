		 Thursday, January 30, 2003 				 Skull haul
																								Siliguri, Jan. 29: Police have arrested a man carrying a bag with 100 human skulls in front of New Jalpaiguri station.																								The police said the arrest of Sangey Lama, 30, has shed light on the thriving business in human skulls and bones in the region.																								Human skulls and bones like the femur and humerus are in great demand in the remote hill pockets of Sikkim and Bhutan for rituals, an officer said.																								The police had seized a similar consignment of skulls in 2001 but no one was arrested then.																								What is confounding is the source of such a large number of skulls. The skulls seized on both the occasions have only the cranium left. Skulls from exhumed bodies cannot usually be recovered in their full form, the officer said.

		 Monday, March 03, 2003 				 Dawoods moles in khadi amp; khaki
 DALIP SINGH 																								New Delhi, March 2: Dawood Ibrahims moles among police and politicians in Mumbai are more damaging than his links with the ISI, interrogation of Ejaz Pathan and Iqbal Hussain Kaskar  two underworld operatives deported from Dubai earlier this month  has shown. 																								Pathan, being grilled by the CBI for his alleged involvement in the 1993 Bombay blasts, is said to have named a few senior police officers and some politicians in Mumbai with a deep-rooted nexus with Dawood and his gang, popularly known as D-Company. 																								Iqbal, Dawoods brother, is being questioned by Mumbai police as he is wanted in six criminal cases. 																								Sources said D-Company is not only milking its moles within the police force for information and to bump off rivals in encounters, but sympathisers were tipping them about possible actions against them. 																								Some officers are said to be in regular touch with the top brass of Dawoods gang, like Chhota Shakeel. 																								A senior government officer said some Mumbai police officers even stage arrests of Dawoods henchmen to show that action is being taken against them. 																								The entire plot is hatched at the behest of the underworld operatives. He gave an example: a businessman gets extortion threats from D-Company. The Dawood gang lets loose its sharp-shooters to execute the plan. But the force is tipped off and they end up in a police net. 																								The police crow to the press about nabbing Dawoods extortionists. In this game, the gangsters despatched to do the job have no inkling of the plan hatched in connivance with the police, the sources said. The police, according to the deal, ensure that the arrested criminals are released on bail. 																								The Centre has compiled a secret report on the underworld-police-politician nexus. The situation is depicted as alarming in Mumbai. The report says Shakeel has developed an extensive network in some jails  Arthur Road and Thane of Mumbai, in Nashik, Kolhapur, Pune, Yervada  of Maharashtra, where most of his men are lodged. 																								Through his police contacts, cellular phones, weapons, money and any other thing needed by the henchmen in jail are being provided. The underworld is believed to be using jails as centres for recruitment. 																								The trend is not recent. A few years ago, the superintendent of a jail in Uttar Pradesh was suspended for doling out favours to Babloo Srivastava, a one-time associate of Dawood. Babloo was using mobiles to carry out extortion and kidnappings. 																								The government report has compiled figures on arrest of criminals, their affiliation to gangs and those killed in encounters in 2001. It backs its allegation of police-underworld nexus through this data, which indicates the bias towards D-Company. 																								The encounter/elimination chart for the year 2001... with regard to the activities of local police in Maharashtra in countering underworld activities show their biased attitude towards a particular group, namely Dawood Ibrahim and his D-Company, by eliminating members of the rival group of Chhota Rajan, the report states. 																								The data shows that 127 members of D-Company were arrested and 20 eliminated. Despite the fact that Dawoods gang wields the most influence in Maharashtra, 136 henchmen of the lesser gang of Chhota Rajan were arrested and 44 bumped off. 																								The figures clearly indicate that Mumbai police in the recent past have eliminated a large number of criminals owing allegiance to the Chhota Rajan group as compared to gangsters of the Chhota Shakeel group on the tip-off given by D-Company (members) based in Mumbai, the report said.

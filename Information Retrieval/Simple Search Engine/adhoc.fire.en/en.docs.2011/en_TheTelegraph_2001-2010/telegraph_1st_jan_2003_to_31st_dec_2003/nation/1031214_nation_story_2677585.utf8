		 Sunday, December 14, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Missing girl sparks killer python hunt				 																																																	Lucknow: Forest officials and locals are on the lookout for a python that allegedly devoured a 17-year-old girl of Garha village in Unnao district on Thursday, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										The alleged culprit and his victim remain untraced despite a frantic search. Instead, angry villagers set upon a 10-feet long python and beat it to death. However, the reptile appears to have been innocent for no signs of the girl, Guddi, could be found inside it.				 																																																										The killed python did not have the body bulge. To swallow a teenager girl, it would have taken six hours to complete the process and traces of the victim would have remained inside as it takes 15 to 20 days before the body dissolves, Uttar Pradesh chief conservator of forests, K. Prasad, said.				 																																																										Villagers say Guddi and her 12-year-old sister, Rajo Devi, went to collect firewood outside their village, about 55 km from here on Thursday evening. Some time later, Rajo ran back screaming and told her father Rampal Singh that a huge python had emerged from a burrow, dragged Guddi away and swallowed her. Rampal rushed to the spot, found the Guddis slippers and scarf near the burrow and raised an alarm.				 																																																										Villagers dug a three-meter deep pit near the burrow with the help of police and forest officials, found a python and beat it to death. Some python eggs were found inside the burrow.

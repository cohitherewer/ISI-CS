		 Thursday, January 02, 2003 				 Quit pressure on Raje
																								Jaipur, Jan. 1 (PTI): Cracks in the BJP resurfaced today with treasurer and in charge of party affairs in Rajasthan Ram Das Agarwal suggesting that state party chief Vasundhra Raje resign from the NDA ministry to uphold the one-man-one-post norm.																								Pad to chorna parega.... Yeh to party ki vyavastha hai... Aaj karo ya kal... kab tak chalega aise (she has to give up the post today or tomorrow as this is the arrangement in the party. How long will this go on)? Agarwal asked. 																								If Raje does not agree to quit, he said, the party high command would take up the issue.																								He said since the party tasted victory in three assembly bye- elections in rajasthan, one should take responsibility and work whole heartedly for the organisation from the grass root level. The victory in the bypolls proved that the party very much desired raje, union minister of state for small scale industries, to be in the state now, he said. 																								Queried if he getting along with rajes style of working and whether he is holding political discussion with her, agarwal said we are for the party and not for an individual. He said incidents of communal violence in the state had risen compared to last year and law and order in rajasthan was worsening under congress government which also failed to tackle the drought.

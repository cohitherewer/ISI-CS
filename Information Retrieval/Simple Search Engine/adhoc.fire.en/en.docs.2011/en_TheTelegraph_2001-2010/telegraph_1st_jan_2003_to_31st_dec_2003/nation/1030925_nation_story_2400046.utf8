		 Thursday, September 25, 2003 				 Bush UN omission disappoints deputy PM
																								Kochi, Sept. 24 (PTI): L.K. Advani today expressed disappointment over the failure of US President George W. Bush to mention India as a victim of terror in his speech at the UN general assembly.																								The deputy Prime Minister said the admission by a Pakistani minister about the presence of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in Karachi only confirmed what has been denied by Islamabad for so long.																								Indian people have expressed disappointment over the US failure to take note of terrorism being faced by India, Advani told reporters accompanying him to Kochi to attend the 50th birthday celebrations of spiritual leader Mata Amritanandamayi.																								Advani was replying to a question on Bush mentioning Bali, Casablanca, Riyadh, Jakarta and Jerusalem as places that were victims of terrorism but making no reference to India.																								While violence for the purpose of vendetta or to settle political scores has been known to the world for a long time, the growth of terrorism as a weapon to achieve political objectives is a recent phenomenon, he said.																								The deputy Prime Minister said while the world had become acutely aware of terrorist organisations like the al Qaida and the Taliban, particularly after the September 11 attacks in the US, there is still lack of realisation that state-sponsored terrorism is worse than terrorist organisations.																								I wish the world became acutely aware of the fact that for India, ISI, which is a limb of the state of Pakistan, is more dangerous than al Qaida or Taliban, Advani said.																								Asked about Dawoods presence in Pakistan and whether India would take it up with the Interpol, Advani avoided a direct reply but said CBI chief P.C. Sharma was leaving today to attend an Interpol conference.

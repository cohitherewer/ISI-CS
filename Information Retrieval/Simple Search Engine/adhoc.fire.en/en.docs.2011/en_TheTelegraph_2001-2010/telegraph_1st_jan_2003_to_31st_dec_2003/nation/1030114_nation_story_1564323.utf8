		 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Calcutta fugitive held in Germany
 DALIP SINGH																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: Police have finally caught up with an executive who left Calcutta after allegedly duping a bank of Rs 10.84 crore.																								Amarendra Nath Ghosh, former chief executive officer of Mafcon International Ltd, was recently arrested in Germany four years after he left India. The Central Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the case, is trying to seek Ghoshs extradition.																								CBI sources said they had been keeping tabs on Ghoshs movements abroad. He was earlier spotted in Thailand and Dubai. 																								From there he went to Germany, where he landed in the police net. The sources said CBI would urge the German authorities for Ghoshs early extradition.																								Investigators have accused Ghosh and some others of cheating Allahabad Banks branch in Calcuttas Southern Avenue of Rs 10.84 crore in 1994-95.																								According to the bureau, the method Ghosh had adopted was similar to those often used in such cases.																								Ghosh submitted forged documents to bank officials for the release of bankers cheques, alleged the sources.																								S.R. Ramamani, who was then a manager in Allahabad Bank and is a co-accused, had allegedly issued 29 bankers cheques to Ghosh.																								Of the 29, some were issued in the names of V.J. Patel and Yashwant Singh Patel.																								Ghosh then deposited the cheques in accounts opened in Punjab National Bank (PNB) under fictitious names. The PNB branch manager, too, allegedly helped Ghosh alter bank records.																								The money in PNB was then transferred to accounts owned by Mafcon. As director, Ghosh had reserved for himself all powers to sign important documents.																								The CBI, after starting an inquiry into the case in 1996, filed a chargesheet in a special court in November 1998 against Ghosh and the other accused.																								The accused were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for cheating, criminal conspiracy and falsification of accounts, as well as the Prevention of Corruption Act.																								The trial, however, was pending because Ghosh, who was allegedly the brain behind the financial fraud, left India.																								 The court had declared him a proclaimed offender and issued a non-bailable arrest warrant last year after he failed to respond to a summons.

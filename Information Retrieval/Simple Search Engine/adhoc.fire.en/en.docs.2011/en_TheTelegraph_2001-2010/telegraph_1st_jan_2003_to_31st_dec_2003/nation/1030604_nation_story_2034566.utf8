 YOGESH VAJPEYI 				 	 Mulayam Singh: In spotlight																								Lucknow, June 3: A Garhwali-Kumaoni feature film based on the Uttarakhand agitation has raised the hackles of the Samajwadi Party, which has threatened to disrupt screenings on the plea that the movie shows Mulayam Singh Yadav in a bad light. 																								Teri Sau, released in its Garhwali avatar in Dehradun on Friday, revolves around a critical phase of the decade-long movement for statehood  several people were killed in police firing and women raped when they were proceeding towards Delhi in Muzzafarnagar on October 2, 1994. Mulayam was the Uttar Pradesh chief minister at the time. 																								But Uttaranchal parties have reacted sharply to the Samajwadi threats, with a delegation of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) meeting director-general of police P.D. Raturi to seek police intervention. Raturi is reported to have assured the delegation that no unlawful activity would be tolerated. 																								Despite strong opposition from the Samajwadi, the Congress state government also exempted Teri Sau, the first ever feature film on the Uttarakhand agitation, from entertainment tax. 																								The two hour, 40 minute long film  the costliest Garhwali movie at Rs 65 lakh  has received an overwhelming response in Dehradun and Rishikesh where it was released in the first phase.																								Samajwadi general secretary Satnarain Sacchan said the censor board should not have passed such a film, which could create ill will between sections of the society. 																								Anuj Joshi, producer-director of the film, retorted that the film has been passed by the censor board. 																								The Kumoani-Hindi edition of the film will be released at Haldwani on June 20. 																								Sanjay Singh, Dehradun district president of the Samajwadi, has threatened to disrupt the film if it showed anything derogatory about Mulayam. But BJYM general secretary Ravinder Jugran said his party will oppose any move to disrupt screening of Teri Sau. 																								Giving a clean chit to the film, Jugran said it depicts the trauma of the hill people fighting for their separate state.																								Ranjit Singh Verma, former legislator and chairman of the Sangharsh Samiti for Uttarakhand, said threats by the Samajwadi leaders should be dealt with firmly by the administration.

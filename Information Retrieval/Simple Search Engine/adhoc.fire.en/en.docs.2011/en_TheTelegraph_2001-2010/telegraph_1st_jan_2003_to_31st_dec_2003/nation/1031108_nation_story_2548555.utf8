		 Saturday, November 08, 2003 				 Jogi sticks to seat, has his way on nominees
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 7: Chief minister Ajit Jogi will seek re-election to the Chhattisgarh Assembly from the Marwahi constituency that he won two years ago in a byelection.																								The Congress central leadership, which set at rest the speculation over Jogis constituency for the bitter poll battle with the BJP and the Nationalist Congress Party headed by estranged party leader V.C. Shukla, also announced today the nominees for 72 other seats in the state.																								Congress spokesperson Jaipal Reddy indicated that the chief minister will not shy away from facing a common candidate of the BJP and the NCP and declared that Jogi would contest from only one constituency.																								The list of candidates bears Jogis imprint throughout. Congress treasurer Motilal Vora and two-time chief minister of undivided Madhya Pradesh S.C. Shukla had to be content with less than half-a-dozen seats for their supporters, which included tickets for their sons.																								Amitesh Shukla, a minister in the Jogi ministry, would seek re-election from his fathers Rajim constituency. 																								Arun Vora, who lost the Assembly poll in 1998, has got another opportunity to win from Durg  the seat his father used to win.																								Sources said leaders from the truncated Madhya Pradesh like chief minister Digvijay Singh and Arjun Singh have got token representations for their supporters.																								Only four sitting MLAs, including minister Vidhan Mishra, have failed to make it to the list. The fate of 13 sitting legislators is yet to be known as the nominations for 17 seats were withheld.																								The pending seats, sources said, would be finalised by central screening committee chief Pranab Kumar Mukherjee after consultation with party chief Sonia Gandhi.																								Jogi, whose presence may not be required for clearing the remaining seats, left for Raipur this morning.																								A week ago, the central election committee had cleared the nominees for 62 of the 90 seats and authorised Sonia to finalise the candidates for the remaining 28 seats in consultation with Mukherjee and Jogi. Mukherjee, after a meeting with Jogi in the morning, had met Sonia late last evening to clinch the Chhattisgarh list.

		 Friday, October 03, 2003 				 Radar edge over Pakistan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 2: Israeli-made aerostat radars, expected to be inducted by the Indian Air Force in six months, will provide strategic advantage over Pakistan, Air Commodore S.K. Jaiswal said.																								The radars would be positioned at Halwara air base in Ludhiana, Punjab, which is one of the forward bases of the air force on the Pakistan border.																								Air Commodore Jaiswal, who is the commanding officer of the Halwara base, said aerostat radars are like balloons that can float at a height of 10,000 to 15,000 feet above ground level and can intercept signals from as far as 200 km. 																								This can reach around 100 km inside Pakistani territory. 																								Pakistan does not have a radar to match, Air Commodore Jaiswal claimed yesterday after an air power display at Sidhwan Khas range near the Halwara station.

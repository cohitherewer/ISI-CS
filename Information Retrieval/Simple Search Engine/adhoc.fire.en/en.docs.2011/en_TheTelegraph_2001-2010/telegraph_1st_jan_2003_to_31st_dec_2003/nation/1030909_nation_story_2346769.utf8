The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, September 09, 2003 				 Treachery salvo
																								Calcutta, Sept. 8: Hours after Mamata Banerjees re-induction in the Union cabinet, senior Congress leaders, including Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, came down heavily on her for compromising with the communal forces.																								The much-hyped march to Writers Buildings today, originally lined up to protest against the Left Fronts misrule in Bengal, virtually turned out to be Mamata-bashing right from the beginning.																								Criticism of the Front took a back seat as state Congress leaders spoke at length, at a moderate rally on Rani Rashmoni Road, on how Mamata had committed an act of treachery after joining forces with the Congress to fight the Assembly elections here following her parting ways with the NDA over the Tehelka scandal.

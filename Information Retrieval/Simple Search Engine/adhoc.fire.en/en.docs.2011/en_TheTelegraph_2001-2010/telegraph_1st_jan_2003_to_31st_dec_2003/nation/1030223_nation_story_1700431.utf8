		 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 Stones greet Farooq and son
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, Feb. 22: The saffron-rich Pampore town today greeted its patron and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar, the party president, with stones when they arrived in the town to kick-start the National Conference bye-election campaign.																								Police had a difficult time escorting the former chief minister out of the venue as angry residents, including supporters of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, attacked Farooqs cavalcade. The former chief minister was accompanied by over a hundred party supporters.																								As Farooq came out of his heavily-escorted car to address his supporters in the main market in Awantipore, angry PDP supporters, shouting anti-Farooq slogans, stormed the area and started pelting stones.																								Farooq had to cut short his speech and return to Srinagar. Earlier, he strongly criticised state chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, saying: Mufti sahib has failed to fulfil his poll promises, including scrapping the anti-terror legislation and disbanding the Special Operations Group.																								He also blasted Sayeed for the ongoing demolition drive launched in the capital and in Pampore, which goes to polls on February 26.

		 Friday, August 29, 2003 				 DDT in colas high: Govt 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: The levels of DDT in soft-drink samples analysed by the government lab are up to 12 times European limits, revealed its report made public today.																								The lab also detected the pesticide chloropyrifos seven times higher than European Union limits in one sample, but said its results cannot be pitted against the findings of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).																								The government had sent 12 brands of soft-drinks from manufacturing plants in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Mathura and Ghaziabad to the Central Food and Technological Research Institute, Mysore, for analysis.																								This followed the publication of the CSE report that soft-drinks were contaminated with pesticides.																								The research institute has said in its report that as the samples it had analysed did not belong to the batches from which CSE had picked its samples, the results are not comparable.																								The institute said total pesticides exceeded European limits in 75 per cent of the samples and the total residue ranged between 1.16 and 5.2 times the European limit.																								The pesticide lindane was detected in all the samples, but 33 per cent exceeded the European limit. DDT was detected in seven out of 12 soft-drink samples  eight times the limit in three of the brands and 12 times the limit in one brand.																								Chloropyrifos exceeded the limit in nine out of the 12 samples, but the research institute did not detect malathion in any of the samples.																								The CSE had claimed that it had detected malathion in 97 per cent of the samples it had tested. In its report released earlier this month, the CSE had said pesticide levels in the soft-drink samples that it had analysed ranged from 11 to 70 times the European limit.																								Today, the CSE sought to explain the discrepancy between its results and those of the research institute on the grounds that the samples were taken at different times.																								CSE said samples after the onset of the monsoon might have used raw water with higher levels of pesticide dilution than was available during March and April when it picked its samples.

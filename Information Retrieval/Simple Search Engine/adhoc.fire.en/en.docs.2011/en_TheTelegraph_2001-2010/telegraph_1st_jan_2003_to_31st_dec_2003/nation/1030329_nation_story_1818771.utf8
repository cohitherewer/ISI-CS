 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, March 28: A German student in Lucknow, who was allegedly molested by a policeman on a bus, has claimed that senior officials were trying to protect the culprit. 																								Pamella Provost, a student of the Ayurvedic college here, said she had informed police within hours of the incident on March 20 but a molestation case was registered only after two days, on March 22. Till now, they have not been able to arrest the man, she sobbed. 																								Uttar Pradesh additional director-general of police (law and order) said he came to know of the incident only from newspersons. The local police are trying to identify the man. Three suspects were paraded before the girl but she did not identity any of them, he added.																								According to the victim, who has been staying in Lucknow since 1996 and speaks chaste Hindi, the policeman forcibly sat beside her on a seat reserved for women. 																								When I objected, he threatened and molested me. I asked other passengers travelling in the bus to help me but they behaved as if they were deaf and dumb, said Pamella, who is still in trauma.																								The student went to the nearest police station as soon as the bus stopped, but she claimed that no one took her complaint seriously. 																								They sent two policemen to give a half-hearted chase, who said they had found no policemen answering the description on the bus. She is in deep shock and she has not been able to sleep for the past week. It has disturbed her preparations for the practical examinations due next week, her teacher Shashi Bala Kale said.																								Kale described Pamella as a sincere student who had mastered Hindi and was now learning Sanskrit to read the texts on Ayurveda in original. 																								We wrote to senior police officials about the case immediately after we came to know of it, demanding quick action against the lecherous policeman, said Bhagwan Singh, principal of the Ayurveda College. 																								Singh added that Pamella was a student of the second semester and all the teachers spoke highly of her.																								The station house officer of Chow police station, where the case has been registered, J. Ram, said the police had launched a statewide hunt for the culprit. 																								We showed her three persons bearing the name of Satya Prakash in Lucknow police, but she said that none of them was involved. We are now checking on policemen posted in neighbouring districts also, Ram added.

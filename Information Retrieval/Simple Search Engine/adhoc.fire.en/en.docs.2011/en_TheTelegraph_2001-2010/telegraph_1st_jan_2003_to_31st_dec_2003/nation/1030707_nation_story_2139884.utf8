		 Monday, July 07, 2003 				 NRI robbed
																								New Delhi, July 6: A Singapore-based NRI was robbed of foreign currency and jewellery worth Rs 90,000 while he was staying at Inter-Continental Hotel on Thursday, reports our special correspondent.																								V.K. Jain and his wife, staying in room number 1708, had gone to another hotel to attend a party hosted by the timber association on Wednesday night. 																								When they returned to their room around 1 pm, the couple found its suitcase open and $1000 and Singapore $5,000 and jewellery missing. 																								The hotel authorities were initially reluctant to admit that the incident had happened.																								However, confirming the theft, deputy commissioner of police Manoj Lal said a case has been lodged at Connaught Place police station on a complaint filed by Jain. 																								No one has been arrested so far, but the police have picked up three employees of the five-star hotel for questioning, police said.																								Rajesh Goel, who had helped Jain lodge an FIR, said when the hotel authorities got to know about the theft, their reaction was very surprising. They kept on saying that the management was taking this issue very seriously. But they did nothing for more than 24 hours.																								He said Jain finally called up the police control room to register the case. 																								Jains suitcase bore a 5-inch slit on one side and a hole near the central lock, Goel added.																								He alleged that hotel insiders were involved in the theft, saying it was unlikely anybody else would be able to open the door.																								If they can behave like this with their regular customer  Jain would stay in this hotel every time he came to Delhi  what will happen to others? Goel wondered.																								Goel said the least the hotel could have done was assist Jain in getting the case resolved.

		 Thursday, June 26, 2003 				 Akhara bid to be let in
																								Ayodhya, June 25 (PTI): The Nirmohi Akhara, a litigant in the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suits, today said it was not against the Kanchi Sankaracharyas efforts at resolving the dispute but asserted that no solution is possible without involving the two main plaintiffs.																								We are not against the Kanchi Sankaracharyas efforts for a negotiated settlement of the matter, but the two main plaintiffs, the Nirmohi Akhara and the Sunni Central Waqf Board, must also be taken into confidence and included in the parleys, the akharas mahant, Bhaskar Das, said.																								Das proposed a meeting of the Sankaracharyas representative, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, the Sunni board and itself to find an amicable solution to the Ayodhya tangle. Any lopsided solution imposed from outside on us would not bear fruits, he added.																								The akhara has offered five bighas of land in the towns Vidhya Kund locality to Muslim parties for construction of a mosque. The area is approximately 3 km from the site of the makeshift temple.																								Das dismissed the claim of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and said the outfit has no locus standi in the temple case and that its pleas in Allahabad High Court to be made a party had been rejected.																								He said the Nirmohi Akhara was the sole representative of the Hindu community in the title suits and will not back out from the court case nor forgo its claim on the site of the makeshift temple.																								The mahant said though he would abide by the court verdict in the temple case, he was not against a negotiated settlement. We are all for peace and harmony in Ayodhya, he added.

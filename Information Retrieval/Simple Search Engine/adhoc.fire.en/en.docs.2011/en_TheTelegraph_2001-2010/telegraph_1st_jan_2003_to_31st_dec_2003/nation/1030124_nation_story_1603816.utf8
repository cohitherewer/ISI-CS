		 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 VHP closes temple court route
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: With just a month to go before the dharma sansad (religious parliament) of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad unveils its next move on the Ram temple, the Centre is trying to avert a likely crisis but without tangible results.																								According to official sources, the last thing the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government wants is a VHP-sponsored crisis when Parliament will be in session to pass the general budget. The dharma sansad is scheduled for February 21, 22 and 23 in Delhi.																								The Supreme Courts last directive, ordering the Centre to maintain status quo ante not only at the site deemed as disputed in Ayodhyas temple-mosque complex but also in undisputed areas, has tied the governments hands completely.																								The order, passed on the eve of the shiladaan announced by the VHP in March 2002, conveyed that no activity  including a symbolic placing of a brick  would be allowed. 																								Official sources said the only viable way out now is asking the VHP or one of its offshoots to file a revision petition in the apex court, seeking clarification whether its March order is operative even today or if it was valid only till the shiladaan.																								According to sources, the Centre, depending on what the court says, can explore the possibility of handing over a part of the undisputed land to the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, a VHP-created trust.																								Well placed VHP sources said they have refused to oblige the Centre and told its emissary they would have nothing to do with courts any more.																								Shatrughan Singh, the bureaucrat who heads the specially constituted Ayodhya cell  part of the Prime Ministers Office  recently met three senior VHP functionaries.																								According to official sources, he asked VHP joint general-secretaries Onkar Bhave and Champat Rai and vice-president S.C. Dixit whether the VHP would consider filing a revision petition. They refused and reportedly said the Centre was free to knock at the courts door if it chose to.																								Moving the court will shackle us completely, a VHP source said. It will put a halt to our agitation, that gained a lot of momentum last year, because of the Centres stand. Besides, our stand has always been that the peoples court is supreme. So where is the question of going to any other court?																								Asked to indicate what announcement could be expected at the dharma sansad and its likely impact on the Centre, VHP sources said: We will abide by whatever decision our sadhus and mahatmas take, however harsh it may be for the Centre. If it means embarking on temple construction immediately, we will implement the order.																								Asked if the sansad would put off such a decision till the 2004 Lok Sabha polls drew closer, they said: That is just what the BJP would like us to do because it would suit them in the polls.																								We will not fall into that trap again because (then) we will be open to the charge of politicising the temple issue. This is an allegation VHP leader Ashok Singhal recently levelled against deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani.																								The RSS has hinted it may not mediate with the VHP before the dharma sansad. 																								RSS spokesman M.G. Vaidya said: We will await the decision and the resolutions of the sansad. Whatever proposal comes up will be discussed at our general council meeting. The RSS meeting is scheduled for March 7, 8, and 9 in Nagpur.																								According to the VHP, the March court order violated an earlier ruling given by a larger Supreme Court bench.																								The larger bench had said the Centre should conduct a proper survey of the 42 acres or so that form the Ayodhya complex and earmark land required for the construction of a temple or a mosque  depending on the final verdict  and an access pathway and hand the rest to the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas.																								VHP sources alleged they were not even compensated for the land in the Nyas possession after the Centre acquired it.																								The ball is the Centres court to undo the damage that was done to us, said VHP sources.

		 Tuesday, October 28, 2003 				 Advani pushes US for Dawood
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dawood Ibrahim																								Nellore, Oct. 27: L.K. Advani today said the US should force Pakistan to hand over Dawood Ibrahim to India if it really believed he was a global terrorist.																								Referring to the US declaration made a little over a week ago, the deputy Prime Minister said India wanted to see the US words translated into action. This was possible only if the superpower pushed for the extradition of the don and his associates to India.																								Coming down on Pakistan for continuing to sponsor cross-border terror, Advani said India would not resume dialogue at the highest level until it stopped doing so. But last weeks peace initiatives would ensure there was greater people-to-people contact, he said.																								The ball was now in Pakistans court, Advani said. If it wanted friendship with India, we will not lag behind. 																								But if Pakistan wanted to prolong the current standoff, India would handle matters differently, he said.

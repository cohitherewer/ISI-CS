A Telegraph file picture																								Dehra Dun, Dec. 28 (PTI): The historical Old Tehri is inching towards a watery grave, with the controversial dam that owes it name to the town nearing completion.																								The town, which turned 188 today, celebrated its last birthday before the countdown for its submergence begins with the closing of two tunnels through which water was being diverted.																								Once the tunnels, called T-1 and T-2, are closed, the water level will begin to rise and the town will be submerged. 																								The final phase of filling has to be started in early February. The land of around 100,000 residents will be submerged then, a top official of the Tehri Hydro Development Corporation said.																								Work on the dam, already in its final stage, got a boost from the Supreme Court ruling that said the government had no option but to remove roadblocks. 																								The project, being executed by the corporation, is located a few metres from the confluence of the Bhagirathi and the Bhilangana in Uttaranchal.																								Initially, dry riverbeds were required for the construction of the dam and water was diverted about 2 km downstream through two other tunnels. As the work reached its final stage, these tunnels were closed.																								The course of the Bhagirathi was altered by diverting it through T-1 and T-2, located upstream of the confluence. As a consequence, a near-stagnant lake now besieges Tehri. 																								Only 100 families are left awaiting a final settlement. 																								Established by Sudershan Shah on December 28, 1815, after royal astrologers gave the go ahead, Tehri would have remained a small settlement but for the efforts of the Pawar dynasty, which ruled Garhwal.																								Tehri remained the capital of Sudershan Shah, Bhawani Shah, Pratap Shah, Kirti Shah and Narender Shah. Because of the interest taken by the rulers it became the second town in British India to have electricity supply. It is ironical that this town is facing submergence for electricity generation, said Captain Shorter Singh Pawar, a member of the former ruling family.

																								Hyderabad, May 4 (Reuters): The government has released from quarantine 97 foreigners isolated in Secunderabad after two Australians among them were suspected to be suffering from SARS.																								Doctors certified 74 foreigners, mostly Australians at a youth hostel, and 23 more at a guest house nearby, as not suffering from the disease, K. Venu, chief SARS coordinator for Andhra Pradesh, said.																								The foreigners included tourists, Christian missionaries and singers who had been in the city for more than a week, officials said. They are now free to move around since there is no need to keep them in isolation, Venu said. The state government had posted policemen to ensure the foreigners stayed confined after being quarantined on Saturday.																								Venu said the two Australians suffering from fever, sore throat and cough were referred to a hospital for tests. They travelled from Australia to Mumbai via Thailand and reached Secundrabad by train on April 26 but reported SARS-like symptoms only on Friday, he said.																								Both the patients are now recovering. There is no respiratory distress in both of them. Their chest X-ray shows that their lungs are clear, he added.

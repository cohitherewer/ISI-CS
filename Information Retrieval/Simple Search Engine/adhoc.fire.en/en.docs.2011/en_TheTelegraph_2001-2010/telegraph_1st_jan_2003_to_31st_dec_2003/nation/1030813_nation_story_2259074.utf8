		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Guinness sued by slighted adventurer
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER		 Saloo Chowdhury	Calcutta, Aug. 12: City-based adventurer Saloo Chowdhury yesterday filed a Rs 166 crore suit against the Guinness Book of World Records for allegedly failing to acknowledge his achievement and organise a world competition in his honour as promised to him in 1998.																								Saloos wife, Neena, who was his navigator when he set a record by circumnavigating the world, is the co-petitioner in the suit, filed in Calcutta High Court.																								The suit was filed after Guinness Book of World Records Limited failed to hold a round-the-world millennium challenge in 2000 which had been agreed upon to settle a legal dispute between Chowdhury and the company in 1998.																								The petitioner said the dispute dates back to his first world record in 1989 when he achieved the feat in 69 days. The feat was recognised in a certificate handed out by the Guinness Book. But the incident was not given proper mention in the book, Chowdhury alleged.																								When the Chowdhurys record was broken by a British armyman in 1990, the duo made a second attempt and regained the world record the next year by circumnavigating the world in 39 days, 20 hours and 15 minutes, passing though six continents. This record has not been given proper recognition in the Guinness Book of World Records, he said.																								Chowdhury filed a suit against the Guinness Book in 1993 demanding Rs 36 crore in damages. On the basis of the petition, the high court passed an interim order restraining Guinness Book of World Records Limited from publishing, printing and distributing its book of records without including Chowdhurys feat.																								After the court order, the management of the book approached Chowdhury and promised they would hold a millennium challenge in 2000 covering 40.075 km and also institute a Chowdhury Trophy for the winner. Chowdhury withdrew the petition after getting this assurance.																								But in March 2001, the company informed Chowdhury that for good reasons it was not in a position to fund the event.																								Chowdhury said he could not participate in any international event because of the millennium challenge that had been promised to him. This cancellation of event has resulted in enormous loss of face, goodwill and reputation, he alleged.

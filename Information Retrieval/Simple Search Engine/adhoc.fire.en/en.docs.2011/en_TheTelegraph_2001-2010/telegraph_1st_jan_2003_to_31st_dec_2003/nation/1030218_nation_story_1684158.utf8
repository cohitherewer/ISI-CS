		 Tuesday, February 18, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Population norm for corporations 				 																																																	 NEW DELHI (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that once the population of an urban area crossed the three-lakh mark the state government could replace the existing municipal council with a municipal corporation.				 																																																	Clearing all hurdles for constituting a municipal corporation at Jalgaon in Maharashtra, a bench of Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice Brijesh Kumar set aside a Bombay High Court order that had quashed the government decision.				 																																																	A decision of constituting a municipal corporation so as to replace a municipal council is dependant on the figure of population of the urban area. The only requirement is of the population crossing the benchmark of three lakh, Justice Lahoti, writing for the bench, said.				 																																																	The Jalgaon Municipal Council had passed a resolution opposing the decision of the Maharashtra government to put in place a municipal corporation and had moved the high court successfully against the decision.				 																																																	pholding the process undertaken so far by the state government in constituting the corporation, the apex court bench said: The government may now take a final decision and issue final notification depending on the formation of the opinion. 				 																Court scanner on winter deaths				 																																																	 New Delhi: The Supreme Court issued notices to all state governments in north India asking them to state what action they had taken to provide night shelters to the poor during this winter, which witnessed a cold wave that swept across the country and claimed over 700 lives, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	A division bench of Justices S. Rajendra Babu and G.P. Mathur issued notices to the Centre and 12 northern states to provide details of the number of deaths in each district over the last five years and the steps taken to prevent the cold wave deaths every year. The notices were sent following a public interest litigation by advocate E.R. Kumar, who contended that the poor died every winter because of the failure of the governments to provide shelter and relief.				 																																																	Delhi chief minister Shiela Dikshit had already announced that night shelters were being created for those who did not have a roof over their head.				 																																																	The apex court issued these notices to the governments of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh, besides the Union government. The petitioner sought a direction from the court to the Centre and the states to take immediate steps to provide shelter, food and warm clothes to the homeless.

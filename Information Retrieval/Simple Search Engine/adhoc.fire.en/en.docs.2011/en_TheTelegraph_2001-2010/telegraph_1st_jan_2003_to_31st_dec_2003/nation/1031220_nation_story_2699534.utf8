		 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Finance nod to defence fund
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Union finance ministry has accepted in principle a request to set up a revolving defence modernisation fund from 2004-05, in line with the recommendation of a parliamentary standing committee.																								The defence ministry has been asking for such a corpus as unspent amounts from the capital outlay of the defence budget were being returned to the national exchequer for successive years.																								In 2000, for example, the defence ministrys expenditure was Rs 10,000 crore less than the funds allocated and in 2002-03 it was Rs 9,000 crore less.																								The defence budget for the current year is about 2.4 per cent of the gross domestic product  a figure that those in favour of greater allocation say is too meagre and those against say is too much when funds are wanting in sectors such as education and social welfare.																								Defence secretary Ajay Prasad has told the parliamentary standing committee that the finance ministry has in principle agreed to create a defence modernisation fund which would have a certain corpus and would be available over a three-year period. The secretary was quoted in the 21st report of the standing committee.																								The setting up of such a fund would involve providing for allocations outside the consolidated fund.																								Defence ministry sources said a paper was being prepared on how the fund should be operated. It will be submitted to the finance ministry.																								In its report tabled in Parliament, the standing committee has advised the defence ministry to frame rules for the fund with the concurrence of the comptroller and auditor general.

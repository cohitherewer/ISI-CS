		 Sunday, July 27, 2003 				 Myers to visit Delhi
																								New Delhi, July 26: The chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Richard B. Myers, is expected to visit New Delhi on Monday with a request that India reconsider its decision on sending troops to Iraq, reports our special correspondent.																								General Myers is also visiting Iraq during his current trip. 																								India has turned down an earlier request from the US and said it wanted an explicit UN mandate. Indias stand mirrors that of a few other countries but that has not deterred the US from renewing its request. It has also requested France, which had opposed the war in Iraq, to consider sending troops.																								Myers is slated to hold discussions with National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra, the chairman of the chiefs of staff committee and navy chief Admiral Madhvendra Singh, the chief of army staff General .C. Vij and defence secretary Ajay Prasad.																								The secretary-level Indian US Defence Policy Group, which governs military-to-military ties between the two countries, is scheduled to meet next month. Washington is understood to have requested bringing forward the dates of the meeting to early August and has offered to host it.																								The Indian military establishment is keen on interacting more closely with the US central command whose area of responsibility covers West Asia and Pakistan. India falls in the US Pacific command.

		 Friday, February 28, 2003 				 Digvijay to sue RSS 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bhopal, Feb. 27: The Sangh-Digvijay Singh war of attrition hit a new low with the Madhya Pradesh chief minister announcing his decision to sue RSS spokesman Shriram Madhav for allegedly spreading misinformation about his father.																								Digvijay told The Telegraph: There is a limit that should be observed in public life. The RSS is opting for falsehood to defame me. My lawyers would send a notice to Shri Madhav within a week.																								Digvijay rejected Madhavs claim that his father represented the Hindu Mahasabha as an MLA.																								 My father was in the Congress till 1947. He quit the Congress responding to Mahatma Gandhis call to abandon the organisation. He then remained an Independent.																								Yesterday, Madhav had reportedly said that Digvijay and his father were followers of V.D. Savarkar.																								Digvijay said Madhav had lied in saying he (Digvijay) was a municipal corporator in Bhopal. I won as an Independent corporator in Raghaogarh, he said.

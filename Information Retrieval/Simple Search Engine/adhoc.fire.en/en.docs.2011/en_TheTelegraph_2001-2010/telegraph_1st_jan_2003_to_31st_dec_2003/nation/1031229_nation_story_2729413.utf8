		 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Daler remand
																								Patiala, Dec. 28: (PTI): A local court today extended the police remand of Punjabi pop singer Daler Mehndi till December 30 in the illegal human trafficking case. 																								Senior civil judge P.S. Dhanoa accepted the plea of Patiala police for the extension of Dalers remand on the ground that the Bhangra singer had to be taken to Mumbai for further investigation.																								Daler was arrested in delhi last week in connection with the case registered against him and four others in october on the complaint of one bakshish singh, who alleged that he was not taken abroad even though he had paid rs 13 lakh out of the rs 15 lakh demanded for the purpose by the accused.																								Police sources said that some more documents pertaining to dalers visits abroad and members of his troupe are to be recovered from his mumbai office. Daler mehndi could not be taken to mumbai due to bad weather after the extension of his police remand earlier in the week. 																								He was taken to delhi from where patiala police recovered some documents, including two passports of the singer, lists of artists and assistants forming part of his troupe and statement of bank accounts.																								 The documents recovered from delhi were being examined to verify the claims of the singer that he was not involved in illegal human trafficking as he had a fixed troupe of 12 members, all of whom had always returned.

		 Thursday, February 13, 2003 				 Togadia tour before high court
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Feb. 12: Karnataka High Court has to decide on the quarrel between the Congress government and the Sangh parivar over Praveen Togadias proposed tour of the state.																								While the government intends to stop the VHP leader from entering Karnataka, the Sangh parivar has approached the court against a ban.																								The high court, in an interim order yesterday, ruled that the government cannot ban the VHP leaders entry but kept the decision pending on whether Togadia makes rabble-rousing speeches during the tour. The courts decision is expected tomorrow.																								If the court decides that the VHP leader cannot make a speech, Togadia would face an unprecedented situation where he would be a mute spectator in functions that have been convened essentially to parade this new icon of the Hindutva forces.																								According to the parivars plans, Togadias tour is to start tomorrow evening with a Hindu Samavesha rally in the south Karnataka district of Mangalore. He is scheduled to attend a series of VHP meetings in Mangalore and Hubli on February 14 and 15. These meetings are to be followed by a public rally at Belgaum on Sunday.																								Belgaum district authorities have already banned Togadias entry into the district through an order issued yesterday. It was this order that the VHP challenged in the high court.

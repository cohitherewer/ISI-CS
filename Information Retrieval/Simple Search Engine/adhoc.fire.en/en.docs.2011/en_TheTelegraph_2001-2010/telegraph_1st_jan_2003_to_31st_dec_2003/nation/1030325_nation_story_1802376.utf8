		 Tuesday, March 25, 2003 				 Jet hikes fares
																								New Delhi, March 24: Jet Airways today announced a 15 per cent hike in fares from Wednesday, close on the heels of a hike last week by state-run major Indian Airlines, reports our correspondent.																								This revision of fares has been necessitated due to a 44 per cent hike in the price of aviation turbine fuel as also steep rise in other costs, said a Jet Airways press release issued here. In addition, there will be a proportional revision in Indian rupee fares such as promotional, return excursion, point-to-point and the everyone can fly scheme (a discounted fare scheme).																								The tickets issued or reissued before March 25 on existing fares would be valid only if the journey starts on or before March 31. A passenger who has commenced journey can complete it at pre-revised rates within the tickets validity period.																								For tickets reissued on/after March 26 for changes in travel date, route or class of travel, the passenger would have to pay the difference in fares.																								Tickets for everyone can fly scheme issued on/after March 26 for travel on/after April 10 would be on the revised fare.

		 Sunday, March 16, 2003 				 Notice to top cop on rape
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, March 15: Orissa High Court today served notice on the deputy inspector-general of police, asking him to explain why Bhubaneswar police did not record the FIR of a rape victim on the night of March 7.																								That night, a medical student from the Kaligali area of Calcutta was allegedly raped at Bhubaneswar railway station by two youths. Though the victim immediately went to the railway police to lodge a complaint, she was asked to wait till the next morning.																								A two-member bench of acting Chief Justice Radhakrushna Patra and Justice Choudhury Pratap Keshari Mishra took note of the matter following a letter written by an advocate. The court asked the DIG to submit his explanation by March 24.																								Sources said the woman had come with her mother to Bhubaneswar to meet her cousins. 																								On their return journey, while waiting on platform No. 4 to board the Sambalpur-bound Tapaswini Express, they found that their suitcases had been stolen. The two youths, who volunteered to help them get back their stolen luggage, lured the victim to a secluded place on the platform and raped her.																								Though the woman immediately went to the railway police, no action was taken to arrest the culprits.

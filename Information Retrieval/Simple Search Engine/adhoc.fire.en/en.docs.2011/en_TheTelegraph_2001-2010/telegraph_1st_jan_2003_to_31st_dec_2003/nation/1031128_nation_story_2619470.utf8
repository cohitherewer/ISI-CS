 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 				 	 Uma Bharti cuddles a baby while campaigning at Kamalpur in Madhya Pradesh. (PTI)																								Bada Malhara (Chhatarpur), Nov. 27: Barely a dot on the Madhya Pradesh map, this town had a knack of drawing attention for the wrong reasons  mostly for fake encounters staged by eager-beaver cops. The victims were landless Dalits or backward castes, too powerless to raise their voice against the establishment. 																								Today, Bada Malhara is in the news for the right reason: BJP chief ministerial candidate Uma Bharti is contesting from here. And if pre-poll opinion is a barometer, she would have a cakewalk despite a challenge from the CPIs Kapoorchand Guwara, a former MLA known for exposing trigger-happy policemen. 																								A sample of the slogans that have brightened this grim place partially explain why the sadhvi is a runaway hit  Kshetra ka gaurav, desh ki shaan, Uma Bharti, kamal nishan (pride of the region, pride of the country, that is Uma Bharti, her symbol is the lotus) or Bundelkhand ki beti, Umaji ka hai paigam, jitni bijli, utna daam (Bundelkhands daughter Uma has a message, pay per power unit consumed, not more). 																								There is no reference to Bhartis Hindutva moorings or her role in the Ayodhya movement. 																								The effort is to project her as a harbinger of development and progress in response to the popular sentiment against 10 years of Digvijay Singhs rule. 																								As in the rest of Madhya Pradesh, poor power supply is the principal issue in Bundelkhand, spanning the districts of Sagar, Damoh, Panna, Chhatarpur and Tikamgarh in the centre and Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri and Guna in the north-west bordering Uttar Pradesh. 																								Pehelwan Singh Yadav, a farmer of Rajpura village on Bada Malharas periphery, spoke of how the four acres he owned was rendered useless because there was no electricity to run the irrigation pump. 																								We get just enough water to drink and clean ourselves. For our land to be productive, we need at least eight hours of uninterrupted electricity. Now we dont even get it for an hour. The four-month period between November and February is critical because that is the sowing season. We are doomed next year because of the power shortage, he said. 																								If anti-Digvijay sentiments form one aspect of the peoples mood, the other is palpable pride in the fact that Bharti hails from Bundelkhand, is an OBC candidate and a woman. All three are firsts. Although Bundelkhand accounts for 24 seats, it has never given a chief minister or even a deputy CM. The representatives in Digvijays cabinet are weak. Uma will also be MPs first OBC chief minister, stressed Bhagchand Jain, the BJPs Chhatarpur block general secretary and her constituency manager. 																								So Shree behan Uma Bharti  Bada Malharas sobriquet for the sadhvi  has the assured support of not just her Lodhi caste, but the Yadavs, Kachis and Dhimars, whose votes were otherwise divided. It has nothing to do with biradriwaad (casteism) but reflects a desire for change, said Ram Swaroop of Kanera village. 																								But Babulal Kabadi, an associate of the CPIs Guwara, argued that the OBC factor was a major determinant in this feudal region, where erstwhile rajas and jagirdars still called the shots. We are not saying anything against Uma in our campaign for this reason, he admitted. 																								Even the record of her brother, Swami Prasad Lodhi  who represented Bada Malhara for the last five years, quarrelled with his sister, nearly joined the Congress and was lured back by the BJP with a ticket from Pichoor  is brushed aside by the voters, as is Bhartis maverick temperament. 																								Suppose in a family there are two members, one becomes a collector and the other a peon, how can you compare them? asked Jain, responding to allegations of non-performance against Lodhi. 																								As for Bhartis propensity to quit ministership and leave for Kedarnath and Badrinath, farmer Yadavs rationale was: If the gods summon her, is she not supposed to answer them? May be this way she will work miracles for us.

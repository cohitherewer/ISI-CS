		 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 British riot case notice to Gujarat
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Gujarat government and the Centre on a petition alleging colourable investigation into the death of three British nationals, purportedly during last years post-Godhra communal riots.																								This is the first time allegations that foreign nationals were killed in the riots have been made in the Supreme Court, which has taken cognisance of the charge.																								A three-judge bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia directed the Gujarat government and the Centre to file their responses within two weeks.																								The petitioner, Imran Mohammed Salim Dawood, a resident of west Yorkshire in the United Kingdom, said he and his relatives were cornered by a mob on February 28, 2002, a day after the Godhra carnage. Four of them, including three British nationals, were killed, he alleged.																								Imrans counsel said the British high commission had repeatedly written to local police about the incident, only to have them reply that investigations were on to trace the culprits.																								The bench expressed its displeasure and asked the state government to file a fresh status report as the one filed today was not satisfactory and did not provide details about the murders.																								The apex court told the government to provide a status report on the number of accused in all the riot cases, those on bail and in custody, and progress of the trials.																								Appearing for the government, additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi said several cases had been referred by petitioners and court-appointed amicus curiae Harish Salve in which the high court had granted bail to accused. Despite this, the government was being blamed, he added.																								In its status report, the government provided details of the riot cases and said more than 24,000 accused had been arrested for significant offences, with more than 2,090 chargesheets filed.																								Rohtagi said the Godhra carnage case need not be stayed as nobody had suggested that something was amiss. The court asked for Salves comments on the matter.																								The additional solicitor-general detailed the teams the state government had set up to monitor the prosecution of those accused in riot cases and added that witnesses in all major cases had been provided protection.																								The government said the investigating officer in the Best Bakery case had contacted Teesta Setalvad, who had petitioned the Supreme Court, since some witnesses, including star witness Zahira Sheikh, were living with her. He had done so as he wished to record witness statements about threats made to them.																								But Setalvad said the witnesses did not wish to make further statements to the police and would approach the Supreme Court if they had something to say.																								The status report filed by J.R. Rajput, deputy secretary of the home department, opposed transferring trials to courts in neighbouring states.

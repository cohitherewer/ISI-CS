		 Saturday, September 20, 2003 				 Raids on ministers houses
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Sept. 19: A special investigation team of Maharashtra police, probing the multi-crore-rupee fake stamp-paper scam, searched the houses of former minister C. Krishna Yadav for the second day here today.																								The team, headed by Pune deputy commissioner of police P.R. Choudhary, also looked at the bank lockers of Yadav, who is in police custody in Pune following his September 6 arrest for alleged involvement in the scam.																								Yadav, who represents the Himayatnagar constituency, is a Telugu Desam MLA. The legislator was arrested after the police found an audio-tape purportedly containing a conversation between Yadav and Abdul Kareem Telgi, the rackets kingpin.																								They (the Pune team) are conducting searches in connection with the fake stamp-paper case. However, they have not informed us about any documents being found in the raids, Andhra director-general of police S.R. Sukumara said.																								The raids began last night at Yadavs residence at the MLA quarters at Hyderguda and another house at Lal Darwaza in the old city as well as shopping complexes. Computer hard disks were allegedly seized. They reveal that Telgi had been operating in 72 towns and have also thrown up the names of several prominent political leaders, bureaucrats and businessmen.																								The MLAs brother, Mahender, and other family members were questioned about his financial dealings.																								Elsewhere, city police commissioner M.V. Krishna Rao has transferred three police officers who were in charge of investigations at the Begum Bazar police station when Telgi was arrested here.

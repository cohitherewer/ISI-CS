		 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Playwright Tendulkar in BJP gunsight
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Dec. 12: The ruling BJP has decided to step up protests against noted Marathi writer Vijay Tendulkar for his alleged remarks against chief minister Narendra Modi.																								The partys legal cell has been asked to explore the possibility of legal action to teach the playwright a lesson for his remarks against Modi. The government has also directed senior officials of the home department to consider legal options against the playwright of Sakharam Binder and Ghasiram Kotwal fame.																								Tendulkar allegedly told a gathering in the Konkan region four days ago that he would shoot the Gujarat chief minister if given a pistol. Irked by the remarks, the Gujarat unit of the BJP yesterday held demonstrations and burnt his effigies in the state.																								Anandiben Patel, a confidante of Modi, led party workers in a demonstration against Tendulkar, branding him anti-Gujarati, thus putting him in the same league as Medha Patkar, Arundhati Roy and Nafisa Ali who are accused of maligning Gujarat and preventing its march towards progress and peace.																								Government spokesman I.K. Jadeja said Tendulkars statement is highly condemnable. It seems some people who want to disturb peace and social harmony in Gujarat have launched a campaign against the state and its people, he said.

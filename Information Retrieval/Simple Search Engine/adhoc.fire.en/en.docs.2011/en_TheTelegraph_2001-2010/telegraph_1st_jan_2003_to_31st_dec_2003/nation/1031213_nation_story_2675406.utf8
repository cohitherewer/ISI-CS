		 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Jaswant on call to calm Congress
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Dec. 12: Jaswant Singh, the leader of the Rajya Sabha and finance minister, has been pressed into service to mollify the Opposition which is exercised over the anti-Sonia Gandhi remarks made by information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad yesterday during a discussion on the cash-on-camera scandal involving the BJPs Dilip Singh Judeo.																								The Opposition forced an adjournment of the House yesterday and walked out today, demanding that Prasad apologise and withdraw his statements.																								In the context of the controversy over former chief minister Ajit Jogi allegedly offering bribes to split the BJP after elections, Prasad had said Jogi would not have been dumped unless he had shown the courage to use the name of Sonia Gandhi.																								Union law minister Arun Jaitley had released an audio tape purportedly containing Jogis conversation plotting the split. On the tape, Jogi responds to a question about Sonia but does not mention her name himself. 																								Given the acrimony, it is not certain whether Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will make his customary reply after the discussions conclude. A decision on Vajpayees reply will depend on the outcome of a meeting the chairperson of the House, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, has convened on Monday in which Singh and the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Manmohan Singh, will be present.																								BJP sources said it was decided at a meeting of its floor strategists this morning that if the Congress agreed, Jaswant Singh could intervene and make a conciliatory statement. The discussion is not over, many speakers are left. Let the rumpus be over on Monday and then we will know whether the Prime Minister or Jaswant Singh will reply, said the BJPs chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, S.S. Ahluwalia.																								However, the decision was not unanimous. The sources said the overall sentiment at the BJP meeting was that the treasury benches should not yield to the Congress but continue to embarrass it by harping on Sonias alleged role in the Jogi scandal. 																								Congress has inflicted a wound on itself. What would have been a simple five-line speech from Prasad has been blown up, a source said.																								What wrong did he utter? Kapil Sibal (Congress), who spoke just before the minister, attacked our leaders  Vajpayee, Advani and Arun Jaitley. He asked if the CBI director had made Advani and Jaitley an accused. According to Sibal, if entrapment was an offence, then an FIR has to be registered against Advani and Jaitley (in the Jogi case). How can we tolerate such an attack? the source asked.																								The BJPs young Turks have rallied behind Prasad, echoing his statement that the Congress would not have suspended Jogi had he not used Sonias name. 																								The BJP believes the Congress is trying to protect Sonia for fear she would be named as a co-conspirator. If the tape is authenticated, she may be investigated in the conspiracy case the CBI is looking into, said Ahluwalia.																								However, the sources also indicated that the top BJP leadership is reluctant to allow the battle to be taken so far.																								This morning, when the House assembled, the Congress walked out in protest against the chair not responding to its demand to expunge Prasads baseless remarks. Manmohan Singh said: Most obnoxious remarks have been made against our top leadership in connection with the so-called Jogi affair and this was followed by sloganeering against the partys leadership.																								He added that such behaviour went against the decorum of the House.																								It was Singhs intervention that prompted the BJPs floor leaders to seek an early resolution to the impasse.

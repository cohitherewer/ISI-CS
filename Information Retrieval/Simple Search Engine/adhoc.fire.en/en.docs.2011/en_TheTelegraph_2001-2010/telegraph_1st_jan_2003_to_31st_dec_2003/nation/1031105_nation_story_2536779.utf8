		 Wednesday, November 05, 2003 				 Wipe-out vow in Hindi belt
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Nov. 4: Stung by a double-barrelled Congress offensive, the BJP today threatened to expose Digvijay Singh and Ajit Jogi and promised to wipe out Congress governments from all four states in the Hindi belt in the Assembly elections. 																								In a blistering counter-attack on its rival for demanding derecognition of the BJP as a national party for allegedly trying to make political capital out of a rape victim, the BJP said it was a challenge to the honour of its workers and it would give a befitting reply. 																								The party is desperately digging for scams, rapes and corruption cases in Congress-ruled states, especially Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, to discredit governments run by Digvijay and Jogi, respectively. 																								The tirade is milder against Sheila Dikshit, chief minister of Delhi, and Ashok Gehlot, of Rajasthan, in proportion to their campaigns against the BJP. 																								Digvijay had challenged the honour and dignity of millions of BJP supporters and workers by demanding derecognition of the BJP, said party general secretary and spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, while Prakash Jawedkar, another general secretary, blasted Jogi for calling Atal Bihari Vajpayee anti-Dalit. 																								Jawedkar said Jogis charge that the Prime Minister had unleashed the CBI on him, BSP chief Mayavati and earlier Laloo Prasad Yadav as they were Dalits is absurd and crazy. 																								In all these cases, the Supreme Court had directed the bureau to proceed against the accused and the Prime Ministers Office had nothing to do with them, he said. 																								Claiming that Jogi had written to Vajpayee for a CBI probe, he said now when the CBI finds that they are forged documents, he is taking shelter in caste. It is the worst crime, you cannot hide behind caste. 																								They are targeting the Prime Minister because they think they can take political advantage, which they will not get, Jawedkar added. 																								Naqvi said his party has accepted the challenge from the Congress and in the coming Assembly elections, it will give a befitting reply by wiping out the party from all the states.

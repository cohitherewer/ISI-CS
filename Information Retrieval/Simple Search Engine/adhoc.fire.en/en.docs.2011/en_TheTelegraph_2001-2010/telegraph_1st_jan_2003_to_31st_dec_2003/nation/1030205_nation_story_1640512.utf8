		 Wednesday, February 05, 2003 				 Bharti sermon finds few buyers
 															- Campaigner tells cadre to skip films, shopping RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Uma Bharti receives a mace in Bhopal at the end of the yatra. (PTI)																								Bhopal, Feb. 4: She wants them to kick gossip sessions, abandon shopping and stop watching films till November, but the crowds are not coming.																								Uma Bharti, the BJPs star campaigner for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls, had reasons to be disappointed when a modest crowd greeted her in her parliamentary constituency today. Barely 2,500 people, including passers-by, turned up to hear her slogans and mantras at the busy TT Nagar in the heart of the capital city. It hurt  more because she had just chucked a ministerial berth to shape up the party for the polls.																								The event marked the conclusion of the 23-day state-wide parivartan yatra organised by the BJPs youth wing. Do not waste time in shopping around or gossiping or watching films, she told the gathering. Utilise the time in building the party and spreading the BJPs message.																								The cream of the Madhya Pradesh BJP  including state unit chief Kailash Joshi  was present when she pronounced her mantra for the polls.																								Bharti underlined the need for going all out. She divided her six-point mantra into two parts. The first three mantras are for me, she said, promising to abide by her vows of nirvikar (selflessness), nishkam (sense of purpose) and nirbhaya (fearlessness). I will not stoop low. I will have just one goal  love for the nation and I will not fear for my life.																								For BJP workers, the message was to practise tyag, tapasya and balidaan (sacrifice, perseverance and the spirit to surrender).																								Bharti sought to offer a hand of friendship to Muslims. We are all Bharatiyas, so why should Muslims feel alienated, she said, claiming that the BJP would never make Hindutva a poll issue. It is a matter of belief and how we live in the country. How can a way of life be made a poll issue?																								Bharti also asked the BJPs youth wing workers to avoid confrontation as Digvijay was keen to engineer riots. Do not fall in his trap, she warned.

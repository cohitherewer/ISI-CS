The offenders had been served notices and challans for keeping cattle at their official bungalows, council sources said.				 																																																	Over 28 challans have been issued to VIPs, including four army generals, four Supreme Court judges and five MPs, the sources said.

The council allows residents to keep two cows/buffaloes at their official bungalows. But residents need to submit an application to the health department, which investigates if there is adequate space and ventilation and ensures that the cattle shed is situated at a proper distance from the residence. 				 																																																	The council then issues a permit for Rs 8 per cow.				 																																																	Earlier this month, the council had sent notices, saying no cattle would be allowed in official bungalows without the necessary permission.				 																																																	Following public complaints, the council recovered nine horses from the bungalow of Vasundhara Raje and eight cows from senior Congress leader Arjun Singhs house.

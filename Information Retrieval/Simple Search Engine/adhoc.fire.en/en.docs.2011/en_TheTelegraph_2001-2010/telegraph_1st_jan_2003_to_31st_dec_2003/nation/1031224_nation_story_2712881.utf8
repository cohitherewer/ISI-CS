 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 23: Reliance and Tata mobile telephony subscribers will soon have new cellphone numbers beginning with 9  just like cellular subscribers.																								The proposal, made by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), is for limited mobile operators that have migrated to the Unified Access Service Licence (UASL) regime. Like cellular phones, they will have 10-digit numbers instead of the present eight.																								Trai has sent its proposal to the Union communications ministry. The department of telecommunications will examine the suggestion and might clear it before the end of the week.																								The telecom regulator has said all unified access licensees should be directed to implement the change within 15 days of the date on which its recommendations are accepted. 																								Reliance mobile numbers are prefixed with 33 and Tata numbers with 56. 																								Shyam Telecom in Rajasthan and HFCL in Punjab  the two other players whose subscribers will get new numbers  carry a 51 prefix.																								Existing mobile service providers and customers using the global system for mobile communications technology will face no change in numbers.

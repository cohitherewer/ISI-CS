																								New Delhi, Sept. 19: The Congress today welcomed the Rae Bareli court order to frame charges against Murli Manohar Joshi and six others, saying it vindicated its stand on the issue, reports our special correspondent. 																								But the party reserved its comments on the dropping of charges against L.K. Advani until it studied the order and found out why the charges had been dropped.																								Our information is very sketchy. We have directed the Uttar Pradesh Congress to get a copy of the order so that we can study it and comment, party spokesman Anand Sharma said.																								Anand, however, did not seem sure whether there was no case at all to chargesheet Advani, particularly since the court has found the basis to chargesheet Joshi and six others in the same case. The CBI, which is the prosecuting agency in the case, and the Uttar Pradesh government should, therefore, study the order carefully and take appropriate action, he said.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 9: Close on the heels of the Bhojshala victory in Bhopal, comes another triumph for the saffron lobby in Mumbai.																								After much grumbling by the ruling Congress-NCP coalition and more rabble-rousing by the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, Veer Savarkar loyalists today succeeded in installing his portrait in the Central Hall of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly.																								In a face-saver of sorts, Speaker Arun Gujarathi said Subhas Chandra Boses portrait will also be put up in the Assembly.																								The Maharashtra victory, as a BJP MLA termed it, comes a day after the Bhojshala monument in Madhya Pradesh was thrown open to Hindu worshippers, who have been allowed to perform puja every Tuesday.																								The Maharashtra government seems to be at a loss on how to counter the BJP-Sena offensive. Some Congress MLAs were conspicuously silent on the Savarkar issue. Even chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde did not put up much of a fight.																								Earlier, when the BJP-Sena members shouted in favour of installing Savarkars portrait, Shinde had said he did not have anything personal against the leader. Some of Veer Savarkars thoughts are worthy of being talked about even now, the chief minister had said.																								There was loud thumping of desks in the Assembly when the Speaker made the announcement and said the decision to instal the portraits of Savarkar and Bose had been made by a committee comprising him and the chairman of the upper House, N.S. Pharande. 																								While Opposition leaders Narayan Rane and Nitin Gadkari had kept up the demand for Savarkars portrait, the demand for Boses portrait was made by ruling party leaders J.C. Chandurkar, Ranjana Kul, Kirti Gandhi and Dayanand Mhaske.

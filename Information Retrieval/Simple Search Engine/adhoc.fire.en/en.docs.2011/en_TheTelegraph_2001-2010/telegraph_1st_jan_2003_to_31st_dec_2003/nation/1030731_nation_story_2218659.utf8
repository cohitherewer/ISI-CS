		 Thursday, July 31, 2003 				 Minorities press for anti-hate law
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 30: Acting to stop sustained hate campaigns by Sangh outfits like the Bajrang Dal and the VHP, the National Commission for Minorities has assured Muslim leaders it will take up their demand for enacting an anti-hate law with the Centre.																								During a recent meeting with the commission, Muslim leaders pointed to the sustained hate campaign by some fundamentalists and sought the panels help in framing an anti-hate law.																								The delegation, which included Khursheed Alam Khan and Congress Rajya Sabha MP K.M. Khan, also demanded that Urdu be taught as the mother tongue in areas where Muslims make up over 15 per cent of the population.																								The leaders alerted the panel to the political process where minorities are being eliminated or marginalised for important political posts.																								It was agreed at the meeting that minorities should be well represented in the police in order to make them feel secure. 																								The panel assured them that their demands would be taken up with the Centre and state governments.																								Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi had assured commission chairman Tarlochan Singh in June that his government would set up a madarsa board for modernisation of the minority-run institutions. 																								He had also agreed to regularly interact with Muslims to allay fears that they were being isolated. 																								The panel chairman also urged Modi to file cases against policemen conducting intrusive surveys on Christians.

		 Monday, July 07, 2003 				 Congress takes aim
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								Shimla, July 6: The Vajpayee government came under attack within hours of the Muslim law boards rejection of the Kanchi Sankaracharyas Ayodhya formula as the Congress accused it of trying to derive political mileage by involving religious leaders in the dispute.																								Senior leader Pranab Mukherjee made it clear that the development did not surprise him.																								Mukherjee, who arrived here with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other top leaders for a three-day brainstorming session, however, reserved comment when a reporter asked him if his party saw a ploy behind the aborted government-backed compromise effort. Only time will tell, he said.																								But he added that a lot of apportioning of blame at each other would continue, presumably to revive the Ayodhya issue in the run-up to the Assembly elections later this year and the Lok Sabha polls next year.																								The Congress leader, who described Atal Bihari Vajpayees move to involve the Kanchi seer as extraordinary, slammed the Prime Minister for not doing adequate homework before undertaking such an exercise.

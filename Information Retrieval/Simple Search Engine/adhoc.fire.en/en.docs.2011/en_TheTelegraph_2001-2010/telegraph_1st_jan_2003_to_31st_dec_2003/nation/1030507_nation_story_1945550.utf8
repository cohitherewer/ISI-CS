		 Wednesday, May 07, 2003 				 Katiyar set on yatra
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 6: Without any backing from the BJP central leadership, Uttar Pradesh unit chief Vinay Katiyar is ready to launch his Sanskriti Yatra in a bid to revive the pre-1991 atmosphere of the Ram temple movement.																								The yatra, Katiyar said, will start on May 24 from Gadmukhteshwar in western Uttar Pradesh and end a month later, probably in Varanasi.																								BJP sources said Katiyars endeavour was a purely individual effort without the approval of central or state party leaders.																								Katiyar refused to say what issues he would raise during the yatra. The issues would relate to cultural nationalism, so you can draw your own inference, he said.																								According to sources, the yatra could culminate at Vindhyavasini temple in Mirzapur instead of Varanasi if the Prime Minister and his deputy felt Katiyar should go easy on the Sanghs Hindutva agenda. Varanasi is on the Vishwa Hindu Parishads target list after Ayodhya and Mathura.

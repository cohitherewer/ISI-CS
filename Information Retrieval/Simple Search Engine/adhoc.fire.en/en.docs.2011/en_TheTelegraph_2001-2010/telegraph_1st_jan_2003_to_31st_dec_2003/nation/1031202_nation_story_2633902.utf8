 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 1: The Rajya Sabha will celebrate its 200th session when the House of elders conducts business from tomorrow.																								The occasion will be marked with the release of a postage stamp, a video film, web-casting of the House proceedings and launch of five books. The secretariat has decided to honour six of its present and former members who have attended more than 100 proceedings of the House.																								Of them, only three are surviving and the lone sitting MP is Pranab Mukherjee from the Congress. Relatives of the deceased members and their party representatives would be invited to receive the honours.																								Till now, only the audio of the House proceedings was available on the Rajya Sabha website, but people can watch its entire business on the Internet after the inauguration on December 11.																								The Rajya Sabha had its first sitting 40 days after it came into existence on April 3, 1952. The idea to commemorate its 200th session was mooted by Mukherjee in August.

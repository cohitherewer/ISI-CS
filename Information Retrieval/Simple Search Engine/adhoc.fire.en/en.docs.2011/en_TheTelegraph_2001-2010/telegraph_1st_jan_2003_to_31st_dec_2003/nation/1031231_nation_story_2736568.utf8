 K. SUBRAHMANYA 		 Mukherjee: Hunting for  villains New Delhi, Dec. 30: The  BJP did not win the Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan  and Chhattisgarh; the Congress defeated itself  this is  the verdict of the Pranab Mukherjee committee which inquired  into the Congress poll debacle. 																								The Mukherjee panel, which submitted its report to party chief Sonia Gandhi this afternoon, has in one broad sweep virtually put the responsibility for the reverses on the three chief ministers and concerned AICC functionaries, albeit without naming anyone. 																								But while doing so, it has also come out with a reassuring conclusion that the results need not cause despair in the party rank and file because the BJP had not really gained in proportion to the Congress losses. 																								Analysing the results state-wise, the panel has pointed out that while the Congress share of votes declined significantly (in Chhattisgarh), the BJP vote share also declined. Actually, the party has lost because of the presence of NCP and BSP candidates in the fray. 																								In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, though the Congress share of votes declined substantially, only a third of it went to the BJP while the rest went to the BSP, Samajwadi Party and the Gondwana Ganatantra Parishad. 																								While half of the votes that Congress lost in Rajasthan went to the BJP, the other half was taken away by the BSP and other smaller parties. The panel observed that pre-poll alliances could have made a difference to the poll outcome. 																								In all these states, the party made the mistake of allowing a chief minister-centric campaign. In Chhattisgarh, for instance, the panel said the personality and leadership style of the chief minister snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. It also blamed the AICC functionaries of disregarding the periodic assessments and feedback provided by sources like the central observers. 																								If the feedback was taken seriously, corrective actions could have been taken in time. It also blamed the central functionaries of poor poll management and also running a poor poll campaign which lacked professionalism. 																								However, the committee has expressed serious concern over the alarming decline in the partys support base among the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes. It has recommended to Sonia that a committee should be set up to look into the matter with a view to address the problem.

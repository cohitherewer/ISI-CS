		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Bhutan plans militant mop-up operation
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Indian soldiers near the Bhutan border while Operation All Clear was in progress. (AFP file picture)																								Guwahati, Dec. 29: After driving out Indian militants from all known hideouts in its territory, Bhutan is planning a mopping-up exercise smaller in scale than Operation All Clear to wipe out the last vestiges of militancy there.																								A senior official in Thimphu said the operation, to be launched in a day or two, was meant to trace the militants who were trying to melt into the immigrant pockets of the Himalayan kingdom. 																								They (the militants) grow like weeds. Even a small tuber left behind can turn into a dense growth. We will have to ensure that our land is cleaned properly, the official said.																								The Indian army shares Bhutans anxiety over small groups of militants staying put in the Himalayan kingdom to fight another day. 																								A source said the fleeing militants of the Ulfa, the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) and the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation were probably trying to find their way into the Nepali settlements and those of other communities in central Bhutan to avoid capture.																								The Royal Bhutan Army has overrun all camps set up by the three militant groups, but the royal government has been tightlipped over the number of casualties in the offensive. The offensive began on December 15.																								The Bhutanese official said the royal government was hopeful of completing the flushout soon. Winter has set in fully and the militants will surely find it very difficult to survive out there without roofs over their heads. Thimphu experienced the seasons first snowfall yesterday, he said. 																								The official said Bhutan might formally request Delhi to maintain the minimum level of alertness along the international border to prevent militants from sneaking into its territory again. 																								The possibility of the militants returning will always remain. We will maintain constant vigil on the border to ensure that we do not face the same problem in future. 																								As the operation in Bhutan entered the last lap, another militant top gun laid down arms in Assam. . Orkhi, arms and ammunition secretary of the NDFB unit that was based at Kalikhola in Bhutan, surrendered to the police in Kokrajhar last night.																								The Ulfa lost a key man when sergeant major Bijoy Baruah, who was injured in Bhutan, died at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. He had been captured after sneaking into Assam.																								Mangaldoi police arrested another Ulfa hitman, Prasenjit Chaliha, when he tried to enter Assam from across the border.																								In Guwahati, security was beefed up after a bomb was found in the heart of the city. Though there was no indication that the bomb had been planted by Ulfa or NDFB militants, a police official said: We are taking no chances.

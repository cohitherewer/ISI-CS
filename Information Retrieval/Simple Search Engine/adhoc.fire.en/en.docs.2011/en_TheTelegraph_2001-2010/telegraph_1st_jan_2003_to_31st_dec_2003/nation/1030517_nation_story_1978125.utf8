		 Saturday, May 17, 2003 				 Dossier, what dossier, asks Jogi
 DALIP SINGH				 	 Jogi: Selective amnesia?																								New Delhi, May 16: Ajit Jogi seems to be a forgetful man. Or he has a penchant for making allegations he does not believe in.																								After accusing the Intelligence Bureau (IB) of preparing a false dossier to show he has assets disproportionate to his known sources of income, the Chhattisgarh chief minister is now asking what the fracas is all about.																								Acting on Jogis complaint, the CBI registered a case last month and sought an appointment from the chief minister.																								For more than a fortnight, there was silence. Then a reply came, asking: whats this case the CBI is talking about?																								The agency wrote back to him, giving details of the allegations he himself had levelled, on the basis of which a first information report was filed.																								A case was registered on April 2 against unknown persons after the chief minister wrote to the Prime Minister, alleging that the IB was being misused by the Centre to harass political opponents. He had also attached a list of his assets allegedly compiled by the IBs special directorate.																								CBI officials said Jogi might be playing for time, but now that a criminal case has been registered he has to offer himself for questioning.																								Jogi was not available for comment.																								The chief minister may not be ready to converse with the CBI, but he has been talking on the issue to the media. In Bilaspur late last month, Jogi justified his action on what he called exposing the IBs alleged espionage.																								He said: My information about Operation Black Sea, which the IB has launched against the political opponents of the BJP, is based on specific details given by my sources in the Union government.																								In the FIR against unknown persons, the agency has alleged cheating and forgery of document with intent to harm reputation under several sections of the Indian Penal Code. 																								According to the CBI, the document contains allegations that Jogi and his wife Renu had acquired immovable property and hold bank accounts in Switzerland. The couple is also accused of possessing National Savings Certificates and Kisan Vikas Patras worth over Rs 1.67 crore.																								The document alleged that Renu signed a memorandum of understanding with a Malaysian company, which has a branch in Bangalore as well. She has acquired 50 per cent share in the company, it said.																								The CBI has written a letter to the IB also. CBI officials said: In an inquiry at the government level, it has been found that there is no special directorate in the IB and the document in question was forged.

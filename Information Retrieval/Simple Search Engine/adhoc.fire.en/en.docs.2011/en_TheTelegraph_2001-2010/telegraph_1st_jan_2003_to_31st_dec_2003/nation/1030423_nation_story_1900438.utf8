		 Wednesday, April 23, 2003 				 Sholay freak mishap
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, April 22: Sidhartha Bhalla lived the role of Sholays Gabbar Singh in the privacy of his bedroom and died playing it.																								When the 16-year-old strode up and down the room to cheers from his young audience, he couldnt help but twirl his fathers revolver on his finger to re-enact Amjad Khans famous role.																								Ab tera kya hoga, Kaliya (What will be your fate, Kaliya)? he said and put the revolver to his own head and pulled the trigger. The bang and the slump to the bed were realistic. His friends shouted: Well done.																								Sidhartha, the son of an affluent city businessman, died last evening in his Mahanagar home before he could be rushed to the hospital. His mother, aunts and their friends were in an adjacent room when the Class X student died playacting. Father Ajay Bhalla was away from home.																								We were chatting when we heard the sound of the gunshot and the shrieks of the children, a family member said. When we rushed to the bedroom where the children were playing, we saw him lying in a pool of blood. 																								Sidhartha was warned against toying with it on Sunday. His parents put it away in the wardrobe. Apparently, the first round was empty. But the rest were full of cartridges, police said.

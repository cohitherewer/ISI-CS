		 Thursday, April 03, 2003 				 Togadia wags Babri-rerun finger
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Togadia and VHP president Ashok Singhal at the rally. (AFP)																								New Delhi, April 2: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad today warned of another December 6 if Parliament does not enact a law in the coming monsoon session to hand over the undisputed Ayodhya site for construction of a Ram temple.																								The tough-talk came as the outfit ended its weeklong satyagraha, called to mount pressure on the BJP-led government to hand over the land.																								VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia said the Supreme Courts rejection of the Centres plea to allow religious activity on the undisputed land had left it with only two options: the Parliament route or anarchist  a repeat of December 6. We can do both, he said. We want the temple at the disputed site.																								It was we who demolished the Babri mosque. It was we who came on to the roads in Gujarat. But during this satyagraha, not a stone was thrown and the event remained peaceful though there was such a huge gathering of activists. We have shown that we can fight as well as be peaceful, Togadia said, adding that other Hindu organisations, including the RSS, had actively participated in the satyagraha. At least 12 MPs were among the 1.75 lakh who took part in the agitation.																								The VHP leader said his outfit wants the government to bring in a legislation in the monsoon session of Parliament (next July) to hand over the land for temple construction and expects all political parties to support it. If that does not happen, there may not be a budget session (in 2004), he added. In other words, the government might fall on this issue before elections are due in October next year.																								If the BJP does not clarify its stand in two-three months, it will realise the consequences. An alternative will be created.																								Togadia claimed that the Congress could split on this issue as several of its MPs were supporting the temple cause. A lot of churning is taking place in the Congress, he said and asked party chief Sonia Gandhi to support the temple movement before the Assembly elections in Rajasthan, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh. If it is not done, she should forget success in these polls.																								Not only the Congress but all parties would split on the issue if they dont support us, he added. We will create such a situation that the Delhi route (meaning power at the Centre) is only through Ayodhya.																								The VHP leader claimed the outfit had succeeded in saffronising the north Indian states, including Congress-ruled Madhya Pradesh. So, if the Ayodhya land was not handed over to the Ramjanmabhoomi Trust, the Gujarat pattern will be repeated in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi, which are going to polls later this year. He took pot shots at Sonia and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh. Because of our pressure some people started drinking cow urine and somebody from Italy started talking about Hindutva.																								He said the second phase will be announced when the Ramjanmabhoomi panel meets on April 29 and 30 in Ayodhya. 																								At least 30 lakh youths will be brought out on the roads and every village will be turned into Ayodhya, he declared.

																								Kuala Lumpur, July 7 (AFP): Malaysian police have detained 17 Indian women at a hotel on suspicion of prostitution, a report said today. 																								Ten men, including seven Indians, were also detained during the three-hour anti-vice swoop late last night, Kuala Lumpur deputy crime investigation department chief, Syed Ismail Syed Azizan, was quoted as saying by the Bernama news agency. 																								The women, between 25 and 38, and the seven men were detained for violating their social visit passes while the three locals were detained for abetting them, he said. 																								Prostitution is illegal in Malaysia. 																								The government recently launched a nationwide crackdown on prostitution and gambling after an intensive drive against pirated and pornographic VCDs was hailed as a success. 																								The local prostitution industry mainly employs foreign women, who are usually from China and are tricked into joining the trade by unscrupulous agents luring them with promises of lucrative jobs.

		 Thursday, July 03, 2003 				 VHP readies for next round
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 2: A solution to the Ayodhya temple tangle may or may not be in the offing. But the VHP, which is opposed to any deal on Kashi and Mathura shrines, is getting ready for its agitation on the remaining Hindutva issues like the uniform civil code, cow slaughter and the increasing Muslim population in the country.																								The VHP is organising sankalp sutras (pledge-taking programme) between July 10 and October 2 in two lakh villages. Two crore people will be contacted, VHP sources said. Each of them in turn will contact five persons, taking the number to 10 crore, who will take the pledge to work for the causes.																								Senior leader Acharya Giriraj Kishore yesterday said the VHP working committee meeting in Raipur on June 28 and 29 has decided to mobilise people on various issues affecting the Hindu community.																								The committee has demanded implementation of the uniform civil code and expressed concern over the increasing population of Muslims and declining population of Hindus in the country. 																								A resolution adopted at the meeting expressed fears that India would undergo alarming demographic changes in the next 50 years if the trend is not corrected. The resolution said that between 1951 and 1991, Hindu population declined from 84.98 to 82 per cent whereas Muslim population increased from 9.91 to 12.12 per cent, registering a 3-per cent decline in Hindu population and a similar increase in the minority population. 																								Kishore said: We appeal to the government to immediately implement the uniform civil code and take steps to control population.																								The VHP leader also criticised the demand for reservation for backward caste Muslims. Quota on religious basis cannot be given under the Indian Constitution, he said. 																								Sources said quota for backward caste Muslims is one of the demands of Muslim bodies engaged in finding a solution to the Ayodhya tangle. Of the 13 per cent Muslims, roughly 9.5 per cent belong to the backward caste. The Sangh parivar is opposed to the idea, they said.

		 Thursday, August 07, 2003 				 Khalistan ideologue renews pledge
 GAJINDER SINGH				 	 Jagjit Singh Chauhan																								Chandigarh, Aug. 6: Khalistan ideologue Jagjit Singh Chauhan today said the Constitution was the biggest fraud on the biggest number of people and vowed that his Khalsa Raj Party would work towards the achievement of Khalistan.																								Chauhan returned to India on June 27, 2001, after more than 21 years in the UK from where he allegedly motivated Sikh youths to participate in the Khalistan movement in the eighties and nineties. He now runs a free dispensary-cum-hospital in his village, Tanda, and has trained young girls in basic medical practices.																								I still favour the formation of Khalistan but through peaceful means by contesting elections. I will not allow violence to achieve that end. I have always been against violence. What happened in Punjab was the handiwork of (former chief minister) Parkash Singh Badal, (Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee chief) Gurcharan Singh Tohra, police and intelligence agencies, he said, adding that the country was going to the dogs.																								Stating that there was a resolution of India being a union of autonomous states when the Constitution was being framed, Chauhan found it strange that it was not being mentioned by anyone. Where is it? he asked. We are collecting documents and will release them shortly. 																								We are talking of war and security when the need is for peace in the world. There will come a time when there will be no India or Pakistan. Borders will collapse, barriers will break. There will be one big united states of south Asia, he added.																								Chauhan said his party had served a legal notice on the Union home ministry and the Punjab government for conducting elections to the general house of the SGPC, which have been due since 2001.																								The notice states that if the Centre and the state government did not initiate process for holding the elections within a month, he would move Punjab and Haryana High Court to seek redress.																								Under the All-India Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925, the Union home ministry is required to get the election conducted every five years by the Gurdwara Election Commission. The panel, incidentally, has already initiated the election process by preparing fresh electoral rolls. 																								Tohra has no legal right to continue in office. What is happening at the SGPC is illegal. I demand that an administrator be appointed to run the SGPC till the elections are completed, Chauhan said.																								He alleged unimaginable corruption in the SGPC. There is no internal audit done by the authorities. There is corruption in counting the daily offerings and... in purchases. There is no one to check what is happening.

		 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Security fears over Atal visit
 SEEMA GUHA New Delhi, Dec. 25: A second  assassination attempt in 11 days on Pervez Musharraf at  almost the same spot in Rawalpindi has set alarm bells ringing  here over the safety of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Prime  Minister is scheduled to visit Pakistan for next months  Saarc summit, but questions are being raised if it is wise  for him to travel to Islamabad.																								If the security establishment has its way, Vajpayees visit would be scrapped. But for now, security officials will have to be content with a high-level review of the Prime Ministers decision to attend the Saarc summit.																								Reacting to todays assassination attempt on the Pakistani President, a senior official said: It is a major lapse on the part of Musharrafs security staff. It is inconceivable that two attempts should come in such quick succession. If Pakistan is having problems protecting its own President, how can we rely on them to ensure that our Prime Minister is safe?																								Preparations for Vajpayees security are already under way. A security team has already made one recce to Islamabad to take a closer look at the routes the Prime Ministers cavalcade will take. Two bullet-proof BMWs will be sent from here for Vajpayees use; jammers will also be sent. Pakistan has also been asked to keep some jammers on stand-by.																								Islamabad has been cooperating with Delhi to ensure the Prime Minister gets maximum security. Foolproof drills are being worked out, keeping in mind the threat perception for Vajpayee. The al-Qaida, the Taliban, terrorist groups operating like the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammad or even a fundamentalist Pakistani faction could pose a threat to the Prime Minister.																								Todays assassination attempt has rattled Delhi, even though it taken a number of security measures for Vajpayees trip. After all, we have to rely on Pakistan to provide the outer security ring for the Prime Minister. They will also have to sanitise the route the Prime Ministers cavalcade will take as well as the hotel he would stay in, an official said.																								Officials say they can do little to increase Vajpayees security further. He already has the maximum security we can provide, so stepping up security is not the answer, a senior official said.																								He and his colleagues would like the Prime Minister to cancel his trip instead.

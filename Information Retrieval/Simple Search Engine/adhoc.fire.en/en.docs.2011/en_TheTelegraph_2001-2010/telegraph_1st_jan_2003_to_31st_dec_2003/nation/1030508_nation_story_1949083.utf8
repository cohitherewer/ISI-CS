 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 7: BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu is courting trouble, the Congress claims. He has flouted norms by convening a meeting of senior officials of the rural development ministry to get an update on the ministrys various welfare and development schemes. 																								Disclosing this in the Lok Sabha today, senior Congress member Margaret Alva charged the BJP chief with violation of all norms. Naidu, she said, had earlier headed the rural development ministry, now with urban development minister Ananth Kumar as an additional charge. 																								Raising the issue during zero hour, she said Naidu had even issued a notice to these officers ranging from directors to the secretary for a meeting at his residence. When it was pointed out that such a notice was not proper, Naidu withdrew the notice but went ahead with the meeting, Alva said. Some officers who had attended the meeting had told her about this, Alva added.

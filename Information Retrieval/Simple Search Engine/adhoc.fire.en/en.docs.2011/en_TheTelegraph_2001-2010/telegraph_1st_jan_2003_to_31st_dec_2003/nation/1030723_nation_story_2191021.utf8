		 Wednesday, July 23, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Medieval village ruins unearthed				 																																																	Jaipur: Ruins of an early medieval period village have been discovered during drought relief work at Ghantiala village, 60 km from Jodhpur, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Ghantiala, according to historians and archaeologists, was a well-developed commercial centre between the 6th and 9th centuries AD. It was an important transit point connecting commercial routes linking Multan and Dhatta with Agra on one side and Delhi with Gujarat on the other. An earthquake or some other natural calamity may have resulted in the citys disappearance. According to State Archaeology and Museum Directorate sources, the area was declared protected since the 1970s when the early signs of the ruins were first sighted. 				 																																																										However, agricultural activity continued in and around the site despite the archaeological treasure underneath.				 																																																										Inscriptions and carved stones were found scattered all over the area during the early archaeological diggings around an old canopy in a field in Ghantiala. 				 																																																										Though a museum directorate post exists in the area, manned by a chowkidar, his presence is notional as he is seldom seen, say residents. 				 																																																										Early this month, labourers engaged in drought relief work dug up the medieval architectural ruins. The administration on receiving the information took over the digging. 				 																																																										The excavation has yielded ruins of a temple, a house, earthen pots and carved red stones. A small idol of Lord Ganesha was also found.

The court directed Singh to file his reply by September 29.				 																																																										Earlier, Abida, responding to the courts direction, had filed an affidavit stating the means of her income. She had claimed she was staying alone in Dubai after separating from Dossa and her only means of sustenance was the revenue from an electronic shop in the United Arab Emirates, owned by one of her sons.

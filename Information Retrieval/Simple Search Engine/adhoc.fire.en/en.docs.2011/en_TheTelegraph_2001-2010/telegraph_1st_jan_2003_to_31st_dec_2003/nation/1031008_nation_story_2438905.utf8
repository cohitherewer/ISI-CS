		 Wednesday, October 08, 2003 				 Army claims big rebel hits
				 	 Border Security Force jawans patrol a street in Srinagar on Tuesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Oct. 7 (PTI): The army says it has been able to score big hits against terrorists by changing its deployment patterns and using highly-sophisticated surveillance systems. Pakistan has re-opened all 85 terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, the army adds.																								It said there had been a spurt in infiltration attempts across the Line of Control in the last month. The 211 militants killed in September is the highest in a single month since the outbreak of militancy 14 years ago. Of them, 77 had been killed while trying to cross the LoC, said Major General Deepak Summenwar, additional director-general, public information. Pakistan had brought many militants to 120 launch pads on the border, he added.																								Summenwar said 80 per cent of the terrorists operating in Jammu and Kashmir were Pakistani nationals.																								He said there were plans to raise seven new territorial army battalions from within the state to keep up pressure on militants. The proposal is awaiting clearance from the cabinet committee on security.																								Summenwar said it was proposed to raise one Home and Hearth battalion each in Kupwara, Baramulla and south-central Kashmir in the Kashmir division. One battalion each would be raised from Rajouri, Kishatwar, Basholi and Bari Brahmna region in Jammu.																								The major general briefed newsmen on the recently-launched Operation Baraub to flush out a big group of Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad infiltrators from Gurez valley, near the LoC in north Kashmir. He presented the documents and identity cards which had been recovered from the 19 terrorists killed during the operation in order to prove Pakistans continued involvement in cross-border terrorism.																								Right from the movement of their ingress into the Indian territory, the terrorists were kept under surveillance. Nineteen of them were killed in three major encounters, Summenwar said, adding that mopping-up operations were continuing in the area.																								Defence attaches from over 15 countries, who were taken to Gurez for an on-the-spot study recently, were also briefed on the operation. Some of them said it was becoming increasingly evident that Pakistan was involved in cross-border terrorism.																								The documents include instructions on blazing routes through snow, how to make improvised explosive devices and the use of high-grade explosives like RDX and PETN.																								Army officials said the new breed of terrorists being pushed across the border by Pakistan were highly motivated and trained in the use of explosives, sniper rifles, communication equipment, high-calibre weapons and could carry out suicide missions.																								They said the Pakistani army had recently carried out a re-structuring of terrorist communications to improve quality of transmissions and security of communications, so as to prevent others from intercepting conversations. The officials said some communication control systems had been re-sited and increasingly, terrorists were now carrying satellite and cellular phones.

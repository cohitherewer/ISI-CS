		 Friday, April 18, 2003 				 Govindacharya snaps BJP ties
																								Jabalpur, April 17 (PTI): BJP ideologue K.N. Govindacharya today virtually severed ties with the party after attacking the government on its handling of the Iraq issue and its economic reforms policies.																								I will not take active part in any party. I will not join the BJP (renew membership) because I have no personal ambition. I will not take primary membership of the party, said Govindacharya, who took sabbatical from the BJP following strains in his relationship with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee over four years ago. 																								Govindacharya had withdrawn from active party politics saying he wanted to devote more time to study the globalisation process and its impact on India.																								Criticising the Vajpayee governments stand on Iraqs invasion by the US, he told reporters that by taking a lukewarm attitude the Indian government has completely exposed itself in the eyes of the peace-loving nations of the world.																								Govindacharya said the Prime Minister should have taken the lead in foiling the nefarious aims of US President George W. Bush in attacking Iraq bypassing the constitution and aims of the UN. 																								Govindacharya, while answering a query, denied ever having referred to the Prime Minister as the mukhota of the BJP, and termed as incorrect that he was forced to seek voluntary retirement due to the controversy. 																								He criticised the Centres economic policies and accused the government of blindly following globalisation, which had ruined agricultural and industrial sectors of the country.																								Govindacharya said disinvestment was a nice concept, but it should be implemented with national interest in view.																								Referring to the forthcoming Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Govindacharya said he had ample faith in the electorate and whatever their ultimate choice he would salute their verdict.

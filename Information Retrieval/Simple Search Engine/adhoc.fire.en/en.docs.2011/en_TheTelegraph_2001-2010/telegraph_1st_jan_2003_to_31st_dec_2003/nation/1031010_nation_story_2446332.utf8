The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, October 10, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																13 climbers die in Garhwal in a month Joshimath: Calcutta is not the only town  to have lost mountaineers attempting to scale the Garhwal  Himalayas. Thirteen mountaineers have died in the second  half of September, all in snowstorms and avalanches on their  way back after scaling Garhwal summits, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										The body of Prakash Singh of the Kumaon regiment was brought to Dharchula by helicopter on Wednesday from the Panchachuli Two peak. Four other members of his expedition were injured while trying to climb the mountain.				 																																																										Two youths belonging to the Arret Mountaineering Foundation in Barasat, on Calcuttas northern fringes, went missing on September 17 soon after scaling the 22,140-feet Kedardome with the rest of their 12-member mountaineering team.				 																																																										The bodies of Arijit Banerjee and Tusharendu Kabir have not been found, but it is unlikely that they could have survived in the sub-zero temperatures for 22 days without adequate rations.				 																																																										Seven members of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and two of their porters died in a snowstorm on September 20 on the 6,904-metre Panchachuli One peak. 				 																																																										Ten days later, a member of the joint expedition of the Kumaon and Naga regiments, died on the lower Panchachuli Two peak. Sepoy Prakash Singh died in a fall when the rope he was tied to broke.				 																																																										Two expeditions in the area  by the Gorkha Rifles on the Kailash Parbat and the Garhwal Scouts on the Mukut Parbat  made it back safely after scaling peaks in September.

Shyam S. Prabodhini died on Thursday while practising in a canal near his house with hands and legs tied with iron chains ahead of another stunt. 				 																																																										Shyam was in the news recently for swimming across Kochis Vembanad lake with his hands and legs tied with ropes as a tribute to Mata Amritanandamayi during her 50th birthday celebrations. The swimmer had also made it to the Limca Book of World Records.				 																																																										On Thursday, after swimming a short distance, Shyams head popped up above the water for a few seconds before going down again. When he failed to surface after quite some time, worried onlookers called in fire-fighters. Despite a two-hour search, they failed to locate him. A local later chanced upon Shyams body.				 																																																										He first attracted notice when he swam with his hands bound across the Sasthamkotta lake and dived into lakes at Neendakara, Vypeen and Kochi from a height of 27 feet.				 																																																										After his recent stunt at Vembanad lake, Shyam had said he dreamed of swimming across the English Channel with his hands and legs tied.

However, she was discharged after a successful surgery.

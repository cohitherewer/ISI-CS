		 Tuesday, July 01, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Wimpy notice to Punjab CM				 																																																	 New Delhi: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, his home secretary and five vigilance bureau officers have been issued court notices following a petition by a leading restaurant chain that its employees were arrested in an illegal and clandestine manner, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Five employees of Wimpy International Ltd were arrested on June 13 by the Punjab vigilance bureau in a corruption case involving former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.				 																																																										A Delhi High Court vacation bench also issued notices to the Delhi government, deputy commissioner of Delhi police (south) and the assistant commissioner of police (Greater Kailash), asking them to explain how the employees were taken to Punjab without the local police being informed.				 																																																										Justices Mukul Mudgal and R.S. Sodhi asked the respondents to reply by July 4 after turning down the Punjab government counsel Ajay Bansals plea that the government be given two weeks to respond.				 																																																										Counsel for the petitioners, Rajiv Nayar and Siddharth Luthra, said the restaurant employees were taken to Punjab clandestinely. They were rounded up in connection with a case lodged at Mohali police station against the former personal assistant to Badal. The bureau alleged that Wimpy chairman and managing director K.S. Sidhu, who figures in a list of the 200 richest Asians in Britain, had helped the Badal family convert their black money into white.				 																																																										The counsel said their clients were being harassed since Amarinder wanted to settle political scores with Badal and his son Sukhbir, who had filed a defamation case against him.				 																Leopards kill woman, 5-year-old Joshimath: A woman and a five-year-old  girl fell prey to leopards in two places, 40 km apart, in  the Garhwal region on Sunday morning, reports our correspondent.

A search party from the village later found her body, portions of which had been devoured by the animal, some 400 m from her house. In her village, she is the fifth victim of leopard attacks in four years.				 																																																										The other incident took place in Bhattkot village near Devaprayag, on the way to the Badrinath shrine. A leopard seized Ritu from the courtyard of her house where the five-year-old was sleeping with her mother. A search was launched and the girls severed head and hands were recovered from a ravine half-a-km away from her home.				 																																																										On Saturday, a leopard that had been captured and was being transported to the district headquarters in Gopeshwar in a cage, killed itself by banging its head and paws against the iron bars. Sources said the sight of the crowd that had gathered to watch it could have infuriated the animal.

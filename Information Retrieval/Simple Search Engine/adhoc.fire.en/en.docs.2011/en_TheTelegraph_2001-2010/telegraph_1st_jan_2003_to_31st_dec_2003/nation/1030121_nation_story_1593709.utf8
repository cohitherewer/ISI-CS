The route of the parade, which starts from Vijay Chowk, down the historic Rajpath and culminates at the Red Fort after criss-crossing many areas of the city, was for the first time in 50 years curtailed last year when the threat perception heightened following the terror attack on Parliament on December 13, 2001.

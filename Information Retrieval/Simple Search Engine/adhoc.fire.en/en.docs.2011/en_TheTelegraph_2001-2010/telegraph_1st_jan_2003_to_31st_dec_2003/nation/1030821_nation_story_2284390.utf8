		 Thursday, August 21, 2003 				 Kashmir connects as Muftis mobile beeps
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Vajpayee takes Muftis  call in New Delhi. (AFP)  Mufti calls Vajpayee  from Srinagar. (Reuters)																								New Delhi, Aug. 20: Kashmir was connected to the rest of the countrys mobile network this morning with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mufti Mohammad Sayeed inaugurating the new system by speaking to each other on the chief ministers mobile.																								Mufti thanked the Prime Minister for his gift to the people of the state and termed it a good first step.																								That both the army and the home ministry finally gave the green signal for mobile phones to operate in Kashmir is a testimony to the governments growing confidence that the situation has improved a lot in the state.																								Earlier demands for the extension of mobile connections to Kashmir was turned down by the military, which believed it could help militants to easily get in touch with their accomplices outside the country. In fact, the Centre had for sometime disconnected all STD lines in Kashmir for the same reason. However, since free and fair elections brought the new Mufti coalition to power, the mood in the state has visibly changed.																								The Centre and the state are working hand in hand to turn peoples minds away from violence and militancy to everyday bread and butter problems. In an effort to boost tourism, once the mainstay of Kashmirs economy, efforts are on to hold conferences and meetings in Kashmir. 																								The Congress chief ministers meeting was held in Srinagar recently. Members of a parliamentary consultative committee also held their meeting in the state. And now, at Muftis request, the inter-state council will meet in Srinagar on August 27 and 28.																								The Prime Minister will deliver the opening address, while deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani will preside over the two-day deliberations of all chief ministers of the country. It will be Vajpayees second trip to the Valley this year. 																								During his previous visit, he had broken the ice with Pakistan by once again extending a hand of friendship to Islamabad. But this time, the Prime Ministers visit is expected to be more routine. 																								The frequent visits by Vajpayee and his senior colleagues is again an indication that the situation has improved and the state security apparatus is willing to host a huge conference with not just Vajpayee and Advani but also chief ministers of all the states gathered together.																								The council meets regularly to work at building a truly federal structure in the country with special attention to devolving power to the states. The Srinagar session is likely to consider the clauses relating to emergency provisions as well as deployment of Union armed forces in a state without permission  in certain specific cases  of the state government. None of the chief ministers is likely to agree to this.																								The states argue that deployment should not take place without their concurrence. This, in effect, means that before sending in the armed forces, the Centre needs the approval of state governments, something the Union government is not willing to do.

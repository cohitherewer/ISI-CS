		 Thursday, August 21, 2003 				 Congress counts gains of loss
 							 - Vajpayee emerges NDA best bet; Opposition takes consolation in having unnerved PM K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Sonia Gandhi with Sushma Swaraj at a function in Parliament to commemorate the 59th birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Aug. 20: The drama and the din are over and all the combatants have trooped out. But a day after the 27th no-confidence motion in the countrys parliamentary history fell through, one question lingers: what prompted Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to move it?																								It is not because the motion was defeated by a huge margin. No-trust motions have been defeated by bigger margins. None of the previous 26 motions resulted in the fall of the government on the floor of the Lok Sabha, though, in 1979, the Morarji Desai-led Janata Party government had bowed out of office rather than face Opposition leader Y.B. Chavans notice of no-trust.																								Congress leaders today insisted that the logic behind Sonias move was no different from the earlier ones. It did not intend to topple the government. Left to it, the Congress might even have not sought a House division, knowing well that the Opposition did not have the numbers, they said.																								Party leaders are inclined to believe that the debate succeeded in unnerving Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh produced a letter purportedly written by a Sangh parivar leader during the Emergency days of 1975-77. The letter was allegedly written by the head of a socio-cultural organisation close to the BJP, requesting Indira Gandhi to release him from jail.																								We have proved a point to those who never get tired of making personal attacks on Sonia: that Vajpayee is also vulnerable to personal attacks, said a senior leader.																								Apparently, the letter reached the RJD leader from the Congress quarters in the context of a challenge thrown to Sonia by Chandra Shekhar on Monday. The former Prime Minister had challenged Sonia to produce evidence to back her assertion that she was in possession of letters written by BJP leaders to Indira Gandhi for their release from jail.																								The Congress listed four other gains. First, the debate, it claimed, has helped project Sonia as the unquestioned leader of the Opposition. The credibility of the leader of the Opposition has gone up, said a party leader.																								Second, they said the Congress has successfully expanded the agenda of attack on the government beyond (defence minister) George Fernandes, whom they had boycotted since his reinduction into the cabinet after the Tehelka scandal erupted. There has hardly been any convincing reply from the government on the various charges Sonia levelled while moving the motion, a leader asserted.																								Third, party leaders said the National Democratic Alliance government stood completely exposed after the debate. Vajpayees evasive reply was proof of the Oppositions success, they claimed.																								Last, they said the Congress found a way out of the standoff in Parliament. It was our way of breaking the deadlock and we succeeded with dignity, said a party leader.																								The Congress, however, underplayed the lack of Opposition unity. The Left parties and the RJD had walked out when Fernandes stood up to speak. But the Congress and others on the Opposition benches remained. How can we walk out on our motion? said a party leader.																								The Congress reasoning is that there cannot be a regimentalised unity among the Opposition parties. 																								It was not possible even within a party, Congress leaders claimed.

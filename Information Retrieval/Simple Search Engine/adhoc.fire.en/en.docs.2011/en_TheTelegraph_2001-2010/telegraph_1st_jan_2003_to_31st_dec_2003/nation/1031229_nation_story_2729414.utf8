 DALIP SINGH																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: The CBI has written to police in Uttar Pradesh and Assam to verify a purported claim of Indira Deori that she had smuggled five AK-47 rifles out of an air force station in Bareilly last year.																								Deori, alias Jenni, had hit the headlines in June after she accused then Uttaranchal minister Harak Singh Rawat of raping her and fathering her child.																								She is said to have told the sleuths that she sold the Kalashnikovs to Bodo militants in Assam. A CBI team had recently visited that state to probe her alleged links with the rebels following her disclosure that she was trained to handle arms and ammunition. 																								The bureau has written to the directors-general of police of both states to verify the Assam natives claims.																								Of the two Bodo outfits in Assam, the Bodo Liberation Tigers gave up arms following an agreement with the Centre last February. The National Democratic Front of Boroland continues to wage a war in pursuit of statehood for the tribe.																								Jenni had also claimed that the AK-47s were smuggled out with the help of a member of the minority community. The sleuths have taken her claims with a pinch of salt and even subjected her to a lie-detector test recently in Delhi after concluding that she was frequently changing her disclosures.																								Sources said it was now up to both police departments to inquire and find the truth.																								While in the capital, where the bureau had shifted her to facilitate further investigations, Jenni would be taken to a farmhouse where she claimed Rawat had taken her. 																								She had also said the former minister took her to a hotel in Bareilly.																								Earlier, Rawat had undergone a DNA test to find if he was the father of Jennis baby son, which turned out negative. He had quit the Uttaranchal cabinet after the allegations surfaced.																								The DNA reports, however, have weakened the case the CBI had filed against Rawat on the basis of Jennis statement that he established physical relations with her against her wishes. 																								The former minister, who filed a case of defamation and conspiracy against Jenni, had alleged that some politicians and bureaucrats had conspired to implicate him and tarnish his image.																								Jenni will be taken back to Dehra Dun, where she stays at a Nari Niketan, once the investigations are over.

 ANAND SOONDAS Mumbai, Aug. 12: Divers  scoured the depths for more survivors of yesterdays helicopter  crash, but hopes are receding with every passing minute.																								A day after the Russian-made MI-172 plunged into the Arabian Sea, 60 km from the shores of Mumbai, only two persons  one with exceptional courage and the other with extraordinary luck  have emerged alive from a watery grave. 																								Exhausted and traumatised after their fight for life in the deep seas, S. Mandloi and A.J. Mhatre are shaken by the force of events that spared them while changing their lives forever.																								For Mhatre, an executive engineer with ONGC, what happened in the choppy seas at 12.18 pm yesterday did not merely reaffirm his faith in the divine; it also reminded him of the precarious nature of his job. Twenty-four of those who boarded the aircraft with him are still missing beneath the angry monsoon-whipped waves. While three were fished out dead, rescue workers from the navy, the Coast Guard and the ONGC say they do not have much hope of finding more survivors.																								If Mandloi, a storekeeper with ONGC, was just fortunate to be with Mhatre, for the engineer, it took extreme guts to save himself and his colleague.																								I was in the rear seat when the helicopter spun out of control, Mhatre recalled. By the time I had tightened the life jacket around me, the chopper was diving face first into the sea at great speed. But just as the helicopter crashed, I pushed Mandloi out and followed him into the sea. There was very little time to even see what happened to the rest.																								Besides the four crew members, there were 25 ONGC employees on board when the choppers engine spluttered barely three minutes after take-off from the Sagar Kiran oil rig. A detailed report is yet to come in, but after talking to some rescue workers and ONGC personnel involved with deep-sea operations, some kind of a picture emerges.																								This is what may have happened: seconds after the helicopter took off, it developed a snag. About 100 metres from the oil rig, the snag reappeared, constricting the rotor blades and halting them at around 400 metres above sea level. The MI-172 lost height at amazing speed and crashed into the sea. Its second engine did not find time to start and the helicopters floats did not operate, sinking it within seconds.																								I helped Mandloi keep afloat as he cant swim, Mhatre said. We saw the helicopter float for a few seconds before it sank. We tried to help one of the pilots, but it was too late.																								Mhatre and Mandloi kept afloat for an agonising one-and-a-half-hours before a Coast Guard vessel rescued them.																								Although Mhatre would not say it, a family member said the ONGC officer gave his life jacket to Mandloi seeing that he was having trouble keeping afloat. It was also sheer luck that both had their seat belts unfastened. Others possibly could not unlock their seat belts because the plunging aircraft gave them no time.																								At about 5 pm, the survivors were reunited with their family and friends at the Juhu air base.																								Both were rushed to the ONGC hospital in Panvel: shocked and sad, but thankful.

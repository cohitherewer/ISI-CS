		 Tuesday, October 14, 2003 				 Party poll push for Vasundhara and Uma
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Raje Bharti New Delhi, Oct. 13: The BJP leadership is veering round to the idea of its three chief ministerial candidates  Vasundhara Raje, Uma Bharti and Madan Lal Khurana  contesting the Assembly elections with the others.																								A decision to this effect is likely to be taken by the central election committee when it meets here in the first week of November.																								It has been decided that all three will contest right away instead of waiting to see if the party wins the polls and then seek election within the mandated six months. However, the decision can only be announced after the central election committees ratification, a highly-placed source said.																								It was thought fairly safe to ask the three to file their nominations, said BJP sources, with the party on a roll in Madhya Pradesh, having an edge in Rajasthan and slowly but surely gaining ground in Delhi  which was at the bottom of the heap till recently.																								A section of the BJP had initially been sceptical of the decision, saying Vasundhara, Bharti and Khurana  all Lok Sabha members  ought not to jump into the fray with the rest but be available for campaigning and contest at a later date, if necessary.																								Bharti and Khurana shot down the proposal, saying  through their supporters  that unless they contested the Assembly polls, their claim to the top slot in the states would not be taken seriously.																								Sources said the proposal  attributed to BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan  was meant to help Vasundhara who reportedly is yet to be fully accepted by the Rajasthan BJP.																								While Bharti and Khurana have, by and large, managed to paper over the factional differences in the partys units in Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, Vasundhara is believed to be facing resistance from the old guard comprising Ramdas Aggarwal, Lalit Chaturvedi and Ghanshyam Tiwari.																								Her mentor and the Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat who was instrumental in pushing her candidacy  is learnt to have backed off a little after assessing the state units reaction.

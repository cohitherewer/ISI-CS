		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Cabinet secy to head staff at strike meet
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The government has decided to hold a meeting of officers and employees led by the cabinet secretary to review service conditions, close on the heels of speculation that the Centre may refer the Supreme Court ruling outlawing strikes to a larger bench.																								An internal circular of the Centre said the joint consultative machinery, as it is called in government parlance, led by the cabinet secretary, will meet on September 6.																								The main agenda, of course, is the right to strike, whether fundamental or statutory; if not fundamental, then whether it is statutory as labour laws provide for it, a government source said.																								According to the circular, the meeting would be chaired by the cabinet secretary and approximately 15 secretaries of different ministries would be representing the official side, including member staff, Railway Board. In addition, there would be about 60 representatives of the staff side.																								A central official said: These 60 representatives of the staff side would comprise various employees associations, unions and central government employees federations.																								The recent ruling of a two-judge bench of the apex court  that government employees had no fundamental/constitutional, legal/statutory, moral/equitable/justifiable right to strike  had come as a severe jolt to the employees as their statutory right, too, had been taken away, the official said.																								The 60 representatives of employees are expected to vent their grievances against the ruling as well as those relating to the Sixth Pay Commission and other service conditions.																								According to the circular, around 110 people are expected to participate.																								This will be the first high-level administrative meeting after the apex courts ruling on strikes, passed in the case of the sacking of Tamil Nadu government employees.																								As a result, Union government circles are attaching much importance to the scheduled meeting, especially as the move follows speculation that the Centre may refer the ruling to a larger apex court bench  perhaps a five-judge full Constitution bench.																								The countrys top law officer, attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee, had said it was beyond comprehension that the courts dicta was (that) there is no moral or equitable justification to go on strike.																								Among the other major concerns of the meeting would be the merging of 50 per cent dearness allowance with basic pay, downsizing of the central workforce and shrinking job opportunities in various government departments.																								The meeting would also take stock of disinvestment in public sector units, sources said. 																								A few employee associations and federations have, for instance, challenged disinvestment in the oil sector and a few other PSUs in the Supreme Court.																								The assessment arrived at in the meeting would be conveyed to the PMO and other departments concerned.

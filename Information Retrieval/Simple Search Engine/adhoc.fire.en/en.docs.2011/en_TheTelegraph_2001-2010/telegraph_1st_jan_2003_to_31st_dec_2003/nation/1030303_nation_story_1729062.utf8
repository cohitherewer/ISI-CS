 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, March 2: The Sattankulam Assembly bypoll result and Vaikos continued detention under the anti-terror law appear to have forced a change in the MDMKs political strategy.																								A fifth-class pass L. Neelamegavarnam of the ADMK trounced lawyer A. Mahendran of the Congress at Sattankulam, a Congress bastion for three decades.																								The party decided to shed its adversarial politics against the mother party, the DMK, at yesterdays first general council meeting since Vaikos arrest in July.																								The MDMK thought it politically prudent to forge closer fraternal ties with the party of M. Karunanidhi, whose brotherly gestures and affection it wants to reciprocate.																								The MDMK and the DMK are NDA partners at the Centre and both are without their top leaders, Vaiko and Murasoli Maran  though for different reasons. Vaiko has been languishing in Vellore central prison for openly supporting the banned LTTE, and Maran is critically ill.																								A huge cut-out resembling the Vellore prisons facade with Vaiko behind bars adorned the venue of the general council meeting here, presided over by MDMK presidium chairman L. Ganesan.																								The cut-out was aimed at boosting the cadres morale and the meeting tried to give them a sense of direction by redefining the MDMKs short-term approach in a DMK-centric fashion.

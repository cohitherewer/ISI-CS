 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 4: Arrested Hurriyat Conference activist Anjum Zamarud Habib today retracted her earlier statement that she had received Rs 3.07 lakh from the Pakistan High Commission.																								Habib, a member of the Muslim Khwateen-e-Markaz, the womens wing of the separatist conglomerate, was picked up by a Delhi police team on February 6 as she came out of the high commission in Chanakyapuri. During search, police had recovered the money from her possession.																								Habib, who was produced before special judge S.N. Dhingra for extension of her judicial remand, said she had made that statement under police pressure. I was pressurised to depose so since they were taking me on 10 days remand, she said.																								She also accused the Delhi police of forcing her to make false entries in the diary seized from her possession. After her arrest, she had been charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.																								When Dhingra asked why she admitted to having received the nazrana (gift) from the high commission before the court on February 7, the Hurriyat activist said she had never used the word nazrana in court.																								In her statement before the court, Habib had admitted the money was given by the high commission for Hurriyat chairman Abdul Gani Bhat. But she did not name then charge daffaires Jalil Abbas Jilani as the one who had given the cash. The Delhi police had named Jilani in the first information report after which he was given marching orders.																								Dhingra assured Habib he would look into the matter at the right time when she prayed the court not to believe the allegations levelled by the police.																								The Delhi police have constituted a special team to probe the Pakistan missions involvement in funding Kashmiri militants.

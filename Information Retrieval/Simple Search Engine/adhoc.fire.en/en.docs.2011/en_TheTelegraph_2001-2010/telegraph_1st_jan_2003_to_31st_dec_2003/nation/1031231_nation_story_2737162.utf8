The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Correction
																								The report headlined South support shrinks to sole mate in Tuesdays edition erroneously mentioned that the Telugu Desam Party accounts for 130 Lok Sabha seats. The figure denotes the total number of Lok Sabha seats in southern India. We apologise for the mistake.

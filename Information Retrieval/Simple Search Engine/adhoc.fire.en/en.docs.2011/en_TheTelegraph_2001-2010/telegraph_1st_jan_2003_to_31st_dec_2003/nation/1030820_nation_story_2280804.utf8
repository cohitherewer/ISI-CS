																								New Delhi, Aug. 19: Delhi police claimed to have busted a spurious drug racket following the arrest of one person, says our special correspondent. Twelve gunny bags containing more than 1,000 kg of fake medicines valued at over Rs 35 lakh were seized. 																								The crime branch of Delhi police rounded up Mahesh Kumar Goswami, 32, yesterday from Nizammudin station. He came from Agra to sell the consignment, crime branch officials said.																								Acting on a tip-off, a decoy approached Goswami as he alighted from the Agra-Delhi inter-city train and when the deal was finalised, he was arrested. The medicines recovered  in forms of tablets, capsules and injections included Zanocil, Odoxil, Nimulid, Disprin, Aplax, Nitravit, Magadol, Oflomac, Roscillin and Althracin.

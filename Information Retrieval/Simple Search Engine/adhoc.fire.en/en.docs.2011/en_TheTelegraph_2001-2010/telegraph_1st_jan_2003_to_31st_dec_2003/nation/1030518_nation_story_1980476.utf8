		 Sunday, May 18, 2003 				 Scope for cricket talks 
 IDREES BAKHTIAR																								Islamabad, May 17: Pakistani and Indian cricket bosses may have another round of talks in a meeting in London on June 14 on resuming bilateral competitions. 																								Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Lt Gen. Tauqeer Zia and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya are expected to be among the four chiefs of Test-playing cricket boards to attend the annual general meeting of the Asian Cricket Council in the British capital. 																								Ali Asghar, the chief of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, and his Sri Lankan counterpart are the other two cricket leaders to attend the day-long meeting. 																								Asghar will chair the meeting in his capacity as the current head of the Asian Cricket Council, which elects its three top office-bearers from a particular Asian Test-playing country every two years on rotation. 																								The Pakistani and Indian cricket chiefs, who also met informally at another Asian Cricket Council meeting in Sharjah earlier this month, will discuss the issue of Indo-Pak cricket relations from multi-dimensional angles during the London tryst, sources said. 																								The options in their bid to break the stalemate in Indo-Pak cricket relations include moving the Asia Cup tournament to a neutral venue, holding a token one-day series between the two teams at the start of the 2003-04 season or India going ahead with its proposed tour of Pakistan next year.																								The Asian Cricket Council meeting itself will have a number of points on its agenda, including budget proposals, review of the development plan undertaken during 2002-03, approval of the development plan for this season and composition of the development committee.

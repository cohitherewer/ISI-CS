 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Dec. 5: The Bihar government has recommended a CBI probe into the murder of Satyander Dubey, an IIT alumnus and anti-corruption crusader who was shot dead a few days before he was scheduled to monitor a part of the Prime Ministers Golden Quadrilateral highway project.																								The killing of the 31-year-old Dubey, a civil engineer from IIT Kanpur, on November 27 had fuelled charges that a contract gang operating in the Jharkhand-Bihar belt was responsible. The Centre said it would not object to a CBI probe.																								Dubey was the project manager of the National Highways Authority of Indias (NHAI) Gaya segment when he was gunned down. He was supposed to take charge as the deputy general manger-cum-project director of the Golden Quadrilateral projects Koderma unit in Jharkhand within a few days.																								His brother Dhananjay did not name anybody in the FIR but blamed the contract mafia and corrupt people in the NHAI for the murder. During an earlier stint at the Koderma unit, Dubey had initiated action against several contractors and engineers. Dhananjay said his brother once made a contractor rebuild a stretch of 6 km.																								Last year, Dubey wrote directly to the Prime Minister, complaining about the mess in the department. 																								National Highways Development project (Golden Quadrilateral and North-South, East-West Corridors)  a dream project of unparalleled importance to the nation but in reality a great loot of public money because of very poor implementation at every stage, he wrote.																								Despite a plea for confidentiality, the PMO passed on the letter, along with a separate sheet containing his identity, to the road transport ministry, from where the contents reached the NHAI, according to a letter Dubey wrote later. 																								This disclosure has exposed me to undesirable pressures and threats, he said in the letter to the NHAI.

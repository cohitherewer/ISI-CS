		 Wednesday, December 10, 2003 				 Gangraped mother returns to dead baby
 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Dec. 9: An ailing two-year-old boy died soon after his mother was gangraped on her way to a chemist to buy medicines for him.																								The 25-year-old was raped on Sunday night at Sultanpur in Danapur, about 10 km from here, as her husband, a goldsmith, lay drunk at home unable to move.																								The woman lodged a complaint with Danapur police station yesterday, saying she was raped by five drunk men, delaying her return home and resulting in her sons death early yesterday.																								The rape victim had rushed out to fetch medicines when her son, suffering from a brain tumour, began vomiting blood around 10 pm on Sunday. She had barely stepped out when the five men intercepted her and took her to a dilapidated, abandoned house where they allegedly gangraped her for nearly five hours.																								I was too terrified to utter a word. They threatened me with a pistol. I feel scared even now. They killed my child, too, said the victim, sobbing at the Danapur government hospital where she underwent a check-up nearly 40 hours after the incident.																								Abandoned by the men at about 3 am yesterday, the woman returned home, unaware that her son had died. I could not help, I was drunk and couldnt walk, so she went to get the medicine, I did not even know when the child died, her husband said defensively at the hospital.																								He rushed to the nearest police outpost yesterday, but seeing the in-charge at puja, I came back without meeting him. His version was confirmed by Lalan Kumar Singh, the outpost in-charge, even though a local television channel had earlier reported that the husband had been sent back from the outpost after being told Singh was not there and hence, no case could be filed.																								Superintendent .. Bhaskar said the policemen who had refused to register the complaint would be punished.																								But Singh insisted: In fact his (the husbands) area does not fall under me, but even then if he had told me a word I would have taken some action.																								Back home, the victim and her husband prepared to cremate their son. By evening, news of the incident spread across town over cable television.																								Soon, the police swung into action. Bhaskar and Danapur district superintendent of police Muhammad Hasnain intervened and an FIR was registered at Danapur police station, 20 hours after the incident.																								The police have already arrested two accused, Rinku, alias Kanva, and Manish Kumar, alias Mantu, who have confessed to the crime. Station-in-charge Pramod Kumar said efforts were on to arrest the others. He said all five accused were locals and the victim could identify all of them.																								Residents of crime-prone Sultanpur are an angry lot. All the crime here is because of the tea stall and hut on the road that has become an adda for the anti-social elements here. Even some outsiders are sheltered there, complained Kanchan Devi. Her anger was directed at the police who, she said, did nothing to free the area of criminals. The police never bother about us, they never listen to our complaints, Kanchan added.																								Many of us have often faced these goonda elements, and cases of snatching, gunfire and hurling of bombs are nothing new here since (the last) two-three years, said Ramji. Most locals believe the police know about the goings-on.																								The police today demolished the hut and tea stall belonging to Jagat Rai, whose son Raju langra is one of the accused in the case.																								The victims husband said he and his wife were being offered a good amount of money for withdrawing the case but added: I want to fight the case and give justice to my wife. But Kumar says he is unaware of this, adding that the accused were too poor to try and buy off their victim.

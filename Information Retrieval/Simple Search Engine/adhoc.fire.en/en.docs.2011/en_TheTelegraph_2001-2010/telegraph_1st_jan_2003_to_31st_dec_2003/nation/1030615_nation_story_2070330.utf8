  MONOBINA GUPTA New Delhi, June 14: Policymakers and educationists are apprehensive of opening up Indias secondary education sector to the international market.We believe Indian school boards of examination may suffer the same fate as public sector undertakings once they are forced to face international competition, P.C Vyas, the chairperson of the board of secondary education in Rajasthan, told a two-day seminar organised by the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration. By September, India, as required by the World Trade Organisation agreement, will have to indicate the areas it is willing to open up in the services sector and to what extent.Policymakers say the Centre is still not flexible enough to meet the challenges that this shift in the education sector could pose.

Reluctant to reveal much, officials said the Centre was exploring its options before putting together a final blueprint at the international forum.The institute said policymakers must work towards a future relationship between national and international boards and identify the possibilities for the operation of Indian boards abroad. Some foreign boards are functioning in India.At the seminar, most participants pointed to the gulf that separates the syllabus followed by Indian boards and that of their international counterparts.Eighty per cent of secondary education at present is in the public sector under the state school boards.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 6: Business welcomed the Supreme Courts ruling that no political party or organisation can claim the right to bring industry and commerce to a halt.																								S. Sen, the deputy director-general (international relations) of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said: It is a very good judgment. In todays competitive environment, nobody should be permitted to adopt steps that can affect industrial production.																								The Supreme Court ruling came as part of the verdict which declared strikes by government employees illegal.																								Atul Chandra, the managing director of ONGC Videsh, said: All employees of the government are well-paid. They should take their jobs more seriously and perform efficiently for the overall benefit of the country.																								Kishu Tekchandani, the chairman and managing director of Cement Corporation of India, said: I completely agree with the judgment as strikes can be detrimental to the economy. At the same time, a proper mechanism should be created whereby employees can ventilate their grievances.

 Munir at the Ambedkar bus terminal  in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI) 																								Aug. 12 (Agencies): Munir Ahmed, the 13-year-old Pakistani boy, who spent more than a month in captivity in India for straying across the border, returned to his country after his release in a goodwill gesture. 																								The pace with which things worked my way appears incredible and amazing, said an emotional Munir, who crossed over to Pakistan by the Delhi-Lahore dosti bus. After boarding the bus, he started singing a popular Bollywood song, Pardesi, pardesi, jana nahi..., and waved to the small crowd that bid him goodbye.																								I love your India. Everybody here is nice and behaved well with me. No one used any harsh language or hit me.... I plan to come back to India again  but next time with a valid passport, Munir said. 																								As journalists surrounded him on his arrival at Lahore, the embarrassed youngster started weeping. Officials took him away and said he would stay in their custody until he is joined by his family.

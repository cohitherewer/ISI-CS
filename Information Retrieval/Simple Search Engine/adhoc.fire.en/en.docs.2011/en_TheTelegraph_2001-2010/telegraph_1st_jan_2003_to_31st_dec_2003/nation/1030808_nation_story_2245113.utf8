		 Friday, August 08, 2003 				 Digvijay firm on Dhar fine
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bhopal, Aug. 7: His rivals have called him Aurangzeb and accused him of imposing jazia (religious tax) on Hindus, but chief minister Digvijay Singh is set on fining 161 residents of Dhar district who had attacked members of a particular community during the Bhojshala dispute.																								The BJP today stalled the Madhya Pradesh Assembly in protest against the chief ministers decision to recover Rs 68 lakh from the accused, but Digvijay remained unperturbed. 																								Let them call me a Mughal emperor, a feudal. Let them side with the guilty, he said. I will not let anyone go unpunished.

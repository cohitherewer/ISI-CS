		 Saturday, March 01, 2003 				 Petrol, diesel prices hiked
																								New Delhi, Feb 28: National oil companies today raised the price of petrol and diesel by up to Rs 1.50 per litre. Diesel will be dearer by Rs 1.37 at Rs 22.60 per litre in Calcutta, and petrol by Rs 1.40 per litre at Rs 33.61. While a 50 paise increase in the price has been attributed to the cess imposed in the budget, the rest of the hike is due to the sharp increase in international prices.

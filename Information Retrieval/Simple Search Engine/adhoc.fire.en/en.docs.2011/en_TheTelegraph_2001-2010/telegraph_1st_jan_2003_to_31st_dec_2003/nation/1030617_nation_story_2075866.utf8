The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, June 17, 2003 				 Court for early end to serial case
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Karisma Kapoor in a still from Karishma. (PTI)																								Calcutta, June 16: Justice M. H. S. Ansari indicated today that Calcutta High Court would like to complete the hearing of the copyright infringement case between Barbara Taylor Bradford and Sahara Manoranjan as early as possible. 																								However, with the companys chairman and managing worker, Subrata Roy, ruling out the possibility of an out-of-court settlement with Bradford, the stage is set for a protracted legal battle in Calcutta and then in Delhi, according to sources in Saharas legal cell.																								The case came up for hearing in the high court today. Appearing for Sahara, Siddhartha Shankar Ray contested the Manhattan-based authors accusation of breach of copyright against the fledgling television channel. 																								According to Bradford, Sahara Manoranjans multi-crore television serial Karishma: The Miracles of Destiny is based on her best-seller novel A Woman of Substance. There is only one commonality between the stories. Both are based on old ladies fighting against odds, argued Ray. 																								Alleging that Pammi Somal, the film magazine journalist who interviewed the serials producer Akashdeep, was acting at Taylors behest, Ray cast doubts on the correctness of the tape containing the interview. Akashdeep apparently admitted to basing the serial on Bradfords novel.																								There is no doubt that the case will go back to the Supreme Court. After the trial court ruling, which is expected on Tuesday or Wednesday, the case will surely go to the appeals court and then finally to the Supreme Court, observed a legal expert. 																								Lawyers representing Bradford denied having been served any summons from a Mumbai court, where the serials story-writer Sachin Bhowmick filed a criminal defamation suit on Friday against Bradford and Somal. We havent received any such summons, so we cant comment on it, said a spokesperson for Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm representing Bradford.

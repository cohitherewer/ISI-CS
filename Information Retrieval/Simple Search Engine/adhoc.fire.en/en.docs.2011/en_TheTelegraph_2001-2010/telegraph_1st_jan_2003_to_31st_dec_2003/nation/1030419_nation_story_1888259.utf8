		 Saturday, April 19, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Orissa reels under transport strike Bhubaneswar: Private bus operators in  Orissa continued with their strike for the third consecutive  day on Friday despite the state governments announcement  to hike bus fares from two paise to four paise per km, reports  our correspondent.				 																																																	The bus owners have demanded a minimum hike of 5 paise per km and threatened to continue with the strike for an indefinite period if their demand was not met.				 																																																	In the view of state governments latest threat to impose the Essential Services Maintenance Act, private bus owners have hardened their stand and reiterated that they would not bow down to any pressure.				 																																																	Under no circumstances, the government could force us to run the buses on road. They could only arrest some bus owners, Debashis Nayak, convener of the Orissa Private Bus Owners Association, said.				 																																																	A state government delegation led by transport minister Arabinda Dhali is slated to talk with bus operators on Friday night to end the impasse.				 																																																	The Orissa transport department had announced a hike in fares by two paise per km for ordinary buses on Thursday.				 																																																	However, the bus owners association rejected the decision, terming it unsatisfactory. The state government has already formed a committee under the chairmanship of the Orissa State Road Transport Corporation chairman to decide on any further hike in passenger fares.

Before Laloo Prasad could address the meeting, rival factions of the Gaya district unit of the RJD clashed with lathis, in which the chief of Kukri gram panchayat, Chandrika Yadav, and his uncle were injured.				 																																																	At this, a visibly upset Laloo Prasad picked up a lathi himself and threatened to use it to control the clashing workers.

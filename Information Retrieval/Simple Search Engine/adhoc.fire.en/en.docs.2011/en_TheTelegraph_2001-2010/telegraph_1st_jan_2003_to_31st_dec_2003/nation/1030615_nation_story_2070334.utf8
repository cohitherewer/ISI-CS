Helipads for parched people Jaipur: Ashok Gehlots Rajasthan is parched for the fourth year running but its Congress chief minister proposes to use drought relief funds to build a network of helipads in the state, reports our special correspondent.Rajasthan High Court yesterday questioned the wisdom of Gehlots move after reports were splashed in a local daily.Prima facie such expenditure from the drought relief funds does not appear to be more than providing a facility to political leaders, the court said.Taking suo motu cognisance of the reports as writ petition, Justice S.K. Keshote issued show cause notices to the chief secretary, additional chief secretary (finance) and relief secretary.About Rs 60,000 would be needed to pay the wages of labourers employed on each helipad. The cost of construction materials would be additional. As of now, the government proposes to complete the network by June 30 before the onset of the monsoon.The helipads would be constructed at the panchayat samiti level. Jaipur district alone would have 54 helipads.Directing that the matter be enlisted before June 19, the court observed that the government felt the need for helipads when the state was reeling under drought for the fourth consecutive year and people, especially in rural areas, were facing paucity of water and food.The court conceded that the project would provide jobs to people in rural areas but saw no future or present benefit of them for the villagers.It said the government needed to spend the funds on such works where even small spending would result in permanent constructions like roads, wells, ponds or buildings. These would provide long-term benefits both to the villagers and the state government. The court advised that the government envisage projects that would ensure two square meals to the people.Jalandhar peace plan after clashJalandhar (PTI): As curfew continued in Talhan village, which witnessed caste clashes over the control of a gurdwara, the warring Dalit and Jat Sikhs have hammered out a peace plan to resolve differences.More than 100 Dalit devotees had holed themselves up in the gurdwara on Friday.

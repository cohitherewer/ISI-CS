		 Saturday, November 29, 2003 				 Naidu attack rerun fear
																								Hyderabad, Nov. 28: Andhra Pradesh police have tightened Chandrababu Naidus security after indications that there could be another Tirupati-type attack on him, reports our special correspondent.																								An attempt was made on the chief ministers life on October 1 by the Peoples War Group.																								The list of visitors is being subjected to prior clearance by the police. The inner-ring of the security cordon has also been beefed up at Naidus residence and the secretariat, as well as for district tours, in view of campaigning for the impending elections. 																								The police suspect Naidu may be attacked when he campaigns in the Naxalite-dominated Telengana and Rayalaseema districts. 																								The revolutionary cadres are disappointed that chief minister Chandrababu (Naidu) did not die in Alipiri (near Tirupati). We will have to make another attempt soon, says the circular  allegedly written by a PWG leader  found on the body of a Naxalite killed in an encounter.

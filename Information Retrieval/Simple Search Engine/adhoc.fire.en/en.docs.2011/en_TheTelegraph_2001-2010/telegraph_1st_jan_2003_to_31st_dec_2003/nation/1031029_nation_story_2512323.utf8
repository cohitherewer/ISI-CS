The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, October 29, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Terror law leash put in place				 																																																	New Delhi: Following up on the cabinet decision to ensure that the Prevention of Terrorism Act is not misused by states, the Centre promulgated an ordinance to give statutory powers to review committees for redress of complaints by individuals booked under the anti-terror law, reports our special correspondent. 				 																																																										President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam signed the order on Monday night to confer more powers on the central and state review committees and to make the central panels decisions binding on the states, too. A bill to replace the ordinance will be moved in the winter session of Parliament, scheduled from December 2. 				 																																																										Ironically, the ruling party allies, who helped pass the law in a rare joint session of Parliament in the face of strong opposition from the Congress and other non-NDA parties, have been at the receiving end of the controversial act. 				 																																																										MDMK chief Vaiko has been in jail in Tamil Nadu for over a year for allegedly speaking in support of the banned LTTE. His party colleague and Union minister, M. Kannappan, is also spending days in fear of arrest on a similar charge. 				 																Tandoor case  New Delhi (PTI): Eight years after former  Youth Congress leader Sushil Sharma allegedly murdered his  wife Naina Sahni and burnt the body in the tandoor of a  restaurant here, the trial court will pronounce its judgment  on Wednesday. The prosecution has submitted 62 judgments  in support of its case, while the defence cited 32 rulings,  additional sessions judge G.P. Thareja said.				 																Green syllabus New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has  issued contempt notices to the chief secretaries of Tamil  Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana for disobeying its orders  asking them to respond to a petition seeking inclusion of  environment as a subject in school and college syllabi. 				 																Pak boats 				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): Two Pakistani fishing boats, al Shaina and al Kabootar, were seized along with 11 crewmen by coastguard vessels about 60 km west of Dwarka port in Gujarat on Monday night for fishing in the Indian maritime zone. A coastguard spokesman said the Pakistani fishing vessels were intercepted by its boat Tarabohan and later escorted to Okha port for investigation.				 																Dara support Bhubaneswar: Dara Singh, the death-row  convict in the Graham Staines murder case, found an unlikely  supporter on Tuesday in Bidhubhusan Praharaj, an MLA from  Choudwar in Cuttack district, says our correspondent. As  legislators were discussing the impending cyclone in during  zero hour, Praharaj demanded that Dara be allowed to go  to his village in Uttar Pradesh and perform the shradh  of his father who passed away on October 1.

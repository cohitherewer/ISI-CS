 MUKHTAR AHMAD 																								Srinagar, June 17: Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today came to the defence of the police force, under attack after some of its officers nexus with militants was exposed.																								Mufti brushed aside the fears of legislature members, who said the discovery of the nexus could have far-reaching consequences.																								The chief minister said he reposed immense trust in the Jammu and Kashmir police. One bad fish should not be allowed to malign the entire organisation. I trust the integrity of J amp;K police, and hope they will unearth other similar nexus too.																								Praising the state polices role under the command of director-general of police Gopal Sharma, he said: Being the sons of the soil, they have a vital role in facing the situation.																								Things have started looking up ever since Sharma took charge of the organisation.																								Mufti cited the role of the police in the turnaround in militancy-infested Punjab to drive home his point. Local police always have an edge in such volatile situations, he said.																								The chief minister pointed out an instance of the polices courage in averting a bank robbery by disguised militants. Similarly, the unfolding of the murder mystery of (former law minister) Mushtaq (Ahmad) Lone by nabbing a pointman during a suicide attack also goes to the credit of the police, he said.																								Mufti emphasised the risk the police run in providing security to protected persons (which) is a gigantic task, in which 6,000 personnel are engaged presently. This is imperative for infusing a sense of security among the people.																								Saying democracy is the battle of ideas, he urged militants to appreciate the futility of the gun as it is no answer to problems.

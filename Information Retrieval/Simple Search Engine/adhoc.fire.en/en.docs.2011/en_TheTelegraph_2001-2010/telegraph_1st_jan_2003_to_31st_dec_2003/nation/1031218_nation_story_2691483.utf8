 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 17: There are no differences between the Prime Minister and his deputy over the current peace efforts with Pakistan, sources said today.																								It is a bogey raised by certain people, who cannot see beyond differences in the top political leadership of this country, an aide of L.K. Advani asserted. 																								The speculations increase when an India-Pakistan engagement is on, he said. These sections cannot rise above the stereotypes they have created  Vajpayee is the liberal peace-loving statesman, while Advani is the hardline deputy bent on sabotaging the Prime Ministers moves. The reality is very different.																								Rumour mills have been abuzz since A.B. Vajpayee spoke about a common currency in South Asia and hopes of peace in the region. Advani, according to some people, was furious that Vajpayee had not mentioned Pakistans sponsoring of cross-border terror in Kashmir and had hinted that he was opposed to the Prime Ministers efforts to engage with Pakistan.																								But aides of both Vajpayee and Advani agree that the fortunes of the BJP are inextricably linked to the Big Two. They have both struggled together to build the BJP into what it is today. Both of them have laid the foundations for the partys success and will not jeopardise the BJPs interests to settle personal scores, a close aide of Vajpayee said.

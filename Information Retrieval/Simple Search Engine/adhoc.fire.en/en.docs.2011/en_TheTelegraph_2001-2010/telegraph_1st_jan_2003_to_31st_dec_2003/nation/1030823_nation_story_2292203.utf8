		 Saturday, August 23, 2003 				 LS loses 35 hours, regains 28
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 22: Both Houses of Parliament adjourned sine die today on a sour note after the month-long monsoon session that witnessed pandemonium over several controversies, including the Central Vigilance Commission report on defence deals leading to a no-confidence motion against the Vajpayee government.																								Being Friday and the last day of the session, less than a hundred members were present. As soon as Speaker Manohar Joshi adjourned the House, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and leader of Opposition Sonia Gandhi walked out without exchanging pleasantries.																								The Rajya Sabha also ended on a bitter note with the Opposition refusing to attend proceedings, protesting the presence of defence minister George Fernandes in the House. Chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and several other members expressed anguish over the Opposition boycott on the CVC issue as the House adjourned sine die.																								Joshi told the members that the Lok Sabha had a total of 21 sittings, spread over 113 hours, but lost 35 hours and 36 minutes because of adjournments as a result of members raising slogans and rushing to the well.																								However, he said the House substantially made up for the lost time by sitting late for 28 hours and six minutes, including twice beyond midnight. In effect, the total time lost was little over seven hours.																								Joshi said he felt there should be more discipline and only then the peoples regard for MPs would increase.

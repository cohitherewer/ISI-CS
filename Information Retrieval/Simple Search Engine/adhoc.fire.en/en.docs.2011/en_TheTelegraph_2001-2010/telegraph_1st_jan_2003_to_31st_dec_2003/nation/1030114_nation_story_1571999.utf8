		 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Romania visit to boost Europe ties
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: Romanian foreign minister Dan Geoana will touch down in the capital tomorrow for a three-day official visit to India as the two countries look to strengthen ties and explore issues of mutual interest.																								Geoana will meet his Indian counterpart Yashwant Sinha on January 15 and hold delegation-level talks on bilateral, regional and international issues. 																								The talks would also give the two sides an opportunity to do the groundwork for the proposed visit by Romanias Prime Minister Adrian Nastase later this year. Romania has been invited to join Nato next year, while in 2007 it will join the European Union.																								India sees Romania  and many of the new entrants in the EU  as key players who will in the future shape Europes policy. As Delhi is trying to ensure that the EU emerges as the largest trading partner and foreign investor in India, it wants to develop ties with all members of the EU.																								During the military dictatorship in Romania, its affinity was with Pakistan. 																								Now, with the end of the military regime, Delhi sees new opportunity to build ties with Bucharest.																								Although trade between the two countries has shown a 30 per cent increase in the past few months, the current figure does not justify the potential. So stress will be laid on developing economic ties, particularly to deepen Cupertino in the field of oil and gas and steel.																								Some Indian firms are already working in Romania, which also has the potential of being a good market for Indian pharmaceutical goods and equipment.

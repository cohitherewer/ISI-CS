																								New Delhi, May 19 (PTI): Defence minister George Fernandes continues to receive unusual one-line fax messages at his official residence but security agencies are still clueless about the origin of the documents and the mastermind behind them.																								Sources said a probe has been launched to locate the sender of these messages, one of which read colour of terror is red.																								Such faxes come almost twice every week, security agencies revealed, and the senders identity is still a mystery. Sources said the person sending the messages did not leave any trace and was probably using a computer to generate the faxes.																								On May 5, Fernandes had received a rude shock when a person called on his telephone at home and showered him with expletives. The call was traced to Wazirpur Industrial Area in Delhi and the caller detained.

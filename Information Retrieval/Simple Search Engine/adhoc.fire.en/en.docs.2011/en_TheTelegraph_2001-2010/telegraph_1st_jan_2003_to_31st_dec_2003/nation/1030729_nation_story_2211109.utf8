		 Tuesday, July 29, 2003 				 Brajesh seeks spice for PM speech
 S.P.S. PANNU				 	 Brajesh Mishra																								New Delhi, July 28: Brajesh Mishra, the principal secretary and national security adviser to the Prime Minister, has shot off letters to secretaries in Union ministries asking them to provide inputs to spice up Atal Bihari Vajpayees Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort.																								Mishras letter asks the secretaries to provide facts and figures that Vajpayee will be able to use to buttress the governments claims in seven priority areas  poverty alleviation, employment generation, removal of development imbalances, improvement in quality of life, government-citizen interface, strengthening national security and enhancing Indias image abroad.																								The letter sets a 15-day deadline to provide the material. 																								Going by the tenor of Mishras letter, Vajpayees speech can be expected to drive home the point that the NDA government is one that cares for the impoverished masses of the country and has done its bit to remove poverty and generate employment.																								The real-time inputs sought from the ministries are expected to buttress the Vajpayee governments claim of having provided good governance at a time when the countdown to the Assembly polls in four states has begun and the Lok Sabha elections are round the corner. It is clear that the government does not want to over-emphasise the Ayodhya plank and would also like to project its economic achievements.																								Mishra has further asked for inputs on how each ministry has improved the quality of life of the average Indian in the field that it is governing and how a better government-citizen interface has been brought about.																								He has also asked the ministries to provide information on achievements in removing regional and social imbalances. The PMO apparently wants to project that good governance under the present regime has also created a more egalitarian society.																								Given Mishras IFS background and his present role as national security adviser, the list includes both national security and the enhancement of Indias image abroad. The government clearly wants to project the improved ties with the US and its ability to hold its own in insisting on a UN mandate for sending troops to Iraq as having resulted in an improved global image.																								The Prime Ministers visit to China and the restoration of the Lahore bus service  without relaxing vigil on the border  are other aspects that Vajpayee may dwell on to show that national interest has been taken care of through a deft handling of foreign policy.																								Each ministry is expected to compile a 10-point performance report covering the previous year with regard to these seven priorities and an action plan of major initiatives to be taken in the coming year.

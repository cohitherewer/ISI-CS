A team from the womens commission had visited Bihar after a complaint by Mishras mother Sachita Devi that her daughter, who has a 10-month-old son, was allegedly abducted by Sultan Mian in the first week of November and was later forced to marry him.				 																																																	Mishra, who was produced by the Bihar police before the panel, said her marriage with Sultan was consensual, the womens panel chairperson Purnima Advani said. Mishra also said she loved Sultan Mian and wanted to stay with him, the commission said.				 																																																	However, Advani said Mishra looked very scared and was carrying her son from her first affair with one Pappu Pandey.				 																																																	The deposition came within days of Sultans arrest on May 3 in Siwan district.				 																																																	After the deposition, the womens panel wrote to the Bihar director-general of police asking him to let Mishra go.				 																																																	She was detained by the Bihar police to be produced before the panel after it had asked the state police to do so. 				 																																																	The commission, which had investigated the matter in December, had severely indicted the state police for not arresting Sultan Mian and had demanded a CBI inquiry.

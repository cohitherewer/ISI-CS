		 Sunday, July 27, 2003 				 Naidu hints at early elections
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, July 26: Developments in Delhi indicate that Lok Sabha elections were likely to be advanced, Andhra Pradesh chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu today told the 500-member general body of the Telugu Desam at the party headquarters here.																								Naidu explained that conclaves between the RSS and BJP, deliberations among NDA partners and moves by the Prime Ministers Office indicated that elections to the Lok Sabha were not far behind. Assembly elections due in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala will also be tagged along with the Parliament polls, the Desam chief said at the quarterly in-camera meeting of the general body.																								The Andhra chief minister urged party members not to be complacent and pointed to the spadework by the Congress and the padayatra of its leader Y.S.Rajasekhar Reddy.																								The Naidu government has budgeted Rs 3,250 crore for providing benefits to the poor, the chief minister said. They will be categorised differently so that the middlemen have no role, he said.																								But he expressed dismay over the performance of party legislators. I am disappointed that almost 40 per cent of them had not fared well.

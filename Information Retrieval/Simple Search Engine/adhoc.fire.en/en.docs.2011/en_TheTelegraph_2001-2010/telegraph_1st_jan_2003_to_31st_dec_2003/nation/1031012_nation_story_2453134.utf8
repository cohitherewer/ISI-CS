The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, October 12, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Rabris resign rebuke to ministers				 																																																	Patna (PTI): Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi today created a flutter when she offered to resign but the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, Laloo Prasad Yadav, dismissed the offer.				 																																																										The RJD chiefs comment that if Rabri has offered to resign, I will not divorce her provoked a mild rebuke from the chief minister who pointed out that government, party and family were worlds apart. 				 																																																										Where does the issue of divorce come? The work of government, party and family are different and it should not be mixed up, she told him.				 																																																										I am not satisfied with the performance of our ministers... If you do not improve your performance, I will not like to continue in the chief ministers post, Rabri told the concluding session of the two-day RJD national council meeting here. 				 																																																										A few ministers lack the will power to work for the welfare of the people. They just want to ride in the ministerial cars and enjoy other facilities.				 																																																										We got power after a prolonged struggle. I feel sorry when I hear allegations that the state government is not doing anything on the development front, the chief minister said. I will prefer to quit if you do not improve your performance and speed up development work.				 																																																										Husband Laloo Prasad, however, rejected Rabris offer to resign and asserted she would continue to hold the post. 				 																																																										Sometimes she gets fed up with the work pressure and tells me she will relinquish her post, he said.				 																																																										Later talking to reporters, Rabri clarified that she was not going to quit. 				 																Tonsure tribute to Jaya Chennai: Members of the ADMKs womens  wing showed their loyalty to Jayalalithaa with 108 of them  tonsuring their heads at the Venkateshwara temple in neighbouring  Andhra Pradesh for the good health and welfare of their  partys leader.				 																																																										The women from Namakkal district offered prasad from the temple in Tirumala to the ADMK chief on Friday evening at her Poes Garden residence here before gathering for a group photograph with her.				 																																																										Jayalalithaa, who has been helping women form self-groups in rural areas to make them economically independent, found this unusual as traditionally men shave off their heads while praying for their leaders well being.				 																																																										However, political circles say Jayalalithaa needs Gods grace in the days to come, as the Supreme Courts verdict in the appeal against her acquittal by Madras High Court in the Tansi land deal cases is still awaited. The chief minister is also facing another bad monsoon.

Bengali film fest Lucknow: A week-long Bengali film festival,  titled Bengali Film Utsav, was inaugurated here by actor  Prosenjit Chatterjee, reports our correspondent.

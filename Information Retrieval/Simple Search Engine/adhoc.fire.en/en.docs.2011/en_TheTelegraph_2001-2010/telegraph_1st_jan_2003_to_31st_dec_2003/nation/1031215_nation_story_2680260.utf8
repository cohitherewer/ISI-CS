		 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Naidu ridicules Cong unity call
 M.R. VENKATESH Venkaiah Naidu 																								Chennai, Dec. 14: The BJP today poked fun at Sonia Gandhis unity call to secular parties, dubbing it a cry in the wilderness and accused her of running away from the development debate.																								Soniaji is trying to divert peoples attention by once again harping on the non-existent divide between the communal BJP and the secular parties and this was made clear by her choice of the Aligarh Muslim University as the place from where to make this (unity) call, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu said at a news conference here today. 																								The BJP, Naidu said, is utterly amused at the Congress presidents plea to the secular parties yesterday. There was nothing new in it and the Congress is repeating itself like a gramophone record that has got stuck, the BJP chief said. 																								The Congress had made the same call at the Srinagar conclave in May, said Naidu, even as he pointed out the partys failure to unite the non-NDA parties in its defence of secularism. The main hurdle to Opposition unity has been the refusal of non-Congress parties to accept Sonia as their leader, Naidu added. 																								He hit out at the Congress president for having chosen to run away from the debate on developmental issues, which had brought rich dividends for the BJP in the elections. 																								Development was the main issue in the recent Assembly elections, in which the Congress suffered a debacle, he said. Development will also be the main issue in the parliamentary elections next year, he added. 																								Naidu asserted that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would lead the NDA in the general elections. He has the ability to provide stability, said Naidu. 																								The BJP will appeal to Muslims to see through the self-serving policy of the Congress. The other constituents of the Congress traditional mass base have deserted the party because of its failure to fulfil basic development aspirations, said Naidu, citing as examples the tribal belts of Chhattis- garh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where the Congress was rejected. 																								The BJP is unstoppable now, the party chief said, and backed it to bag 300 seats in the next Lok Sabha elections. 																								Naidu wished Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa best of luck for her claims to try and form a third front without the Congress or the BJP. 																								Upbeat he may be at the prospects of the NDA in the general elections, but Naidu admitted that relations among NDA constituents in the state are neither ideal nor healthy. 																								Naidu did not feel the DMKs agitation tomorrow against the Centre on the anti-terrorism legislation would widen its rift with the BJP. We are with the DMK and the BJP would like to carry all the NDA constituents along with it, he said.

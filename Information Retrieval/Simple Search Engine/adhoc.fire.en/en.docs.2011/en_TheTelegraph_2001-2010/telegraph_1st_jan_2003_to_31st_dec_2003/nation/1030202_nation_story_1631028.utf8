Police rounded up five people in connection with the communal disturbance that took place around 2 pm. The situation was immediately brought under control as senior police officers rushed to the spot.				 																																																	Police said trouble erupted after two Muslim youths started an altercation with a barber over payment. When the youths refused to pay for their hair cut, the barber rushed to his locality, alleging that the two had attacked him.				 																																																	According to the police, an enraged crowd from the barbers neighbourhood then took to the street, brandishing swords and pelting stones, and set at least six kiosks on fire. Of the three persons injured, one sustained a sword injury, they said.				 																																																	The situation was brought under control within 20 minutes. Jamalpurs vegetable and flower market, which had closed after the incident, resumed after lathi-wielding police dispersed the mob without having to use teargas shells.				 																Indian attacked in clean-up bid				 																																																	 Medford, Oregon (AP): Three national guardsmen allegedly beat up minorities, including an Indian, in a mission to clean up the community, and one of the suspects killed himself at the scene of the most recent attack, police said.				 																																																	The two other men were arrested at a motel where they allegedly beat the Indian owner, whom they had mistaken for an Arab. The owner suffered cuts and bruises.				 																																																	Guardsman Chad Ritchie, 21, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after running from the motel early on Thursday, police lieutenant Mike Moran said. 				 																																																	Andrew Lee Patterson, 23, and Aaron St James, 25, were waiting in a car when police arrived, Moran said. They were charged with assault. This is a bias-related crime, Moran said. Patterson drove and he knew Ritchie would assault the owner because of his ethnic origin.				 																																																	In an earlier attack, a homeless white man was beaten with a club and called a disgrace to his race. Police believe Patterson and Ritchie had attacked homeless people in the past. Moran said Patterson described the forays to investigators as missions intended to clean up the community.

St James is not a suspect in the earlier attacks as he was abroad at the time, investigators said.				 																40 PWG rebels surrender				 																																																	 Guntur (PTI): About 40 Naxalites belonging to the Nagulate and Chandravanka squads of the PWG surrendered before superintendent of police A.

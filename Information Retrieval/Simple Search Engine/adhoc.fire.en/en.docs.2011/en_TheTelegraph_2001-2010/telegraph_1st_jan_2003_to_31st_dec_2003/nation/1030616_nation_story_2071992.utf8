		 Monday, June 16, 2003 				 MCC blasts police station
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, June 15: Armed MCC activists have blasted a newly-constructed police station in Bihars Naxalite-infested Rohtas district.																								The incident, coming a week after the burning of six vehicles belonging to contractors in the same area, has made people, especially district officers, fearful.																								Police said more than 35 Maoist Communist Centre members besieged Tilauothu station, about 32 km from here, and blew up the building late last night by detonating dynamite. Five rooms of the police station were destroyed in the explosion, but there were no casualties.																								The MCC activists abducted three electricians working in the building. The electricians were later released.																								Electric wires, six used cartridges of a self-loading rifle and pamphlets of the organisation were later recovered during search operations in the area.																								Superintendent of police R.P. Yadav and six other senior officials have reached the spot. Yadav is camping in the area.																								During search operations and raids in adjoining areas, electric wires, six used cartridges of a self-loading rifle and MCC pamphlets were recovered. Efforts are on to nab the Naxalite activists.																								Police sources said the MCC had twice attacked Nauhatta police station in the same district. Its growing network is evident from the way it recently blasted the office and guest house of a forest range outfit at Rehla in the same district.																								Besides this, MCC cadre last week burnt six vehicles belonging to contractors hired to dig a canal in the area. The burning was intended to strike fear in the hearts of contractors for not paying levies to the Naxalite outfit.

The DMK leader, who was being treated for the last 10 months at the Methodist Hospital in Houston, had not reported any significant improvement after he was flown there by a special air ambulance on November 13 last year.				 																																																										Maran has been battling for his life since September 2002, when he was admitted to the Apollo Hospitals where he underwent an emergency valve replacement surgery. Maran had earlier undergone a replacement surgery at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi in July last year, but it allegedly turned out to be defective.				 																																																										However, the minister developed serious complications at Apollo last year with multiple organ failure. He was then put under dialysis. Subsequently, his family, after consultations with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had him shifted to the Methodist Hospital in the US. 				 																																																										A large contingent of DMK leaders, including deputy general secretary M.K. Stalin, Union ministers T.R. Baalu and A. Raja, thronged the airport to receive Maran, who was brought in a stretcher.				 																																																										DMK president M. Karunanidhi, who is also Marans uncle, told reporters that his condition was not bad now.				 																																																										Vajpayee is expected to call on Maran in hospital during his visit to Chennai on September 13, Baalu told reporters.

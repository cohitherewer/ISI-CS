 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, Dec. 30: India has delinked the deal for the Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier from the negotiations for three other major acquisitions from the Russian military hardware departmental store.																								Defence ministry sources said a dispute on the air defence system for the Gorshkov  that had held up the negotiations even after the navy chief announced earlier this month that the deal was through  would be left pending. 																								As the refit of the Gorshkov would take three years at least from the date it is contracted, the two sides would decide on either the Barak (Israeli) system or the Kashtan (Russian) or a third system later.																								The discussions being led by a deputy chief of naval staff are now focussed on signing an agreement during the proposed visit of Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov in January.																								The price of the aircraft carrier per se was likely to be about $685 million. 																								India wants a separate agreement for a squadron of the MiG-29K aircraft that the Russians were packaging along with the Gorshkov. 																								The MiG-29K squadron will be shore-based and put on the carrier for operations. The squadron of about 20 MiG-29K will be sold by the Russians for about $40 million per aircraft. 																								A second squadron of the MiG-29K will be contracted for a longer term after the navy takes charge of an ambitious indigenous air defence ship being built in the Cochin Shipyards.																								Together with the carrier, the deal would total about $1.6 billion. When the negotiations first began, the Russians said the Gorshkov was being offered to India for the price of its refit.																								The sources said the issue of an air defence system for the carrier would be left open-ended. The Russians told the Indian side that any system apart from the Kashtan would be incompatible with the Gorshkov. 																								But India was evaluating the Israeli system and a French one. The Barak is already in use in the Indian Navy. 																								Two other deals that India was negotiating were being kept on the backburner pending the negotiations for the carrier and the MiG-29K.

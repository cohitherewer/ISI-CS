 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Jan. 17: They belong to the elite group that cleared one of the toughest examinations in the country. 																								But IAS officers in Orissa are getting the jitters. The scorecard in this test they are going to be put through will matter more than ever.																								In an effort to make the administration more effective, the Orissa government will soon evaluate the performance of district collectors on a scale of 100. The parameters have been fixed in respect of selected core activities of different government departments.																								Since the collectors occupy a pivotal position in the district administration, their assessment will reflect the states development, a senior official said. 																								While programmes relating to women and child development have 18 marks, planning and coordination and revenue departments have been assigned nine marks each. 																								The administrative department will fix the annual target, along with the month-wise break-up.																								Collectors who secure 80 per cent marks would be put in the A class, while those securing 70, 60 and 50 per cent would be graded B, C and D, respectively.																								Anyone securing less than 50 per cent would be labelled a poor performer.

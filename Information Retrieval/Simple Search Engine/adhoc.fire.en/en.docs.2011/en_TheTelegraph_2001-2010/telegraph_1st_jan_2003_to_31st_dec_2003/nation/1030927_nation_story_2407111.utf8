		 Saturday, September 27, 2003 				 Amarmani agrees to truth trial
 							 - Doctors declare former  minister fit for test OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 26: Former Uttar Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathi, arrested last Sunday in connection with the Madhumita Shukla murder case, has agreed to a lie detector test provided he is medically fit.																								We will first see whether he is medically fit to undergo the test, his counsel Gaurav Mishra said.																								This evening, a group of doctors at Safdarjung hospital declared the Samajwadi Party legislator, who has been complaining of chest pains, fit to undergo a polygraph test, according to a PTI report.																								Sources in the Central Bureau of Investigation said a cardiologist was among the doctors who examined Tripathi. The doctors have given in writing that Tripathi is fit for the lie detector test, the sources added.																								The CBI had served a notice yesterday, asking Tripathi if he was willing to take the polygraph test. Tripathi had initially declined, but his lawyers are believed to have advised him to take the test.																								Although the CBI cannot force Tripathi to take the test, his refusal will go against him, as it would give the impression that he has something to hide.																								Tripathi was arrested after the CBI confirmed that the DNA fingerprint of his blood sample matched that extracted from the slain poets foetus. Madhumita was six months pregnant when she was killed.																								Tripathi will be in CBI custody till September 30, after which he will be produced before a Lucknow court.																								In another development, the murdered poets servant Deshraj was brought today to the CBI headquarters in Delhi. Sources said Tripathi was confronted with Deshraj.																								Last week, Deshraj, a minor, was taken to an Ahmedabad centre for a psychological test after investigators realised he was changing his statements frequently. The findings of the centre confirmed inconsistencies in his statements which could largely be due to fear psychosis.																								Deshrajs testimony is important to the CBI because he is the only one to have seen the persons who visited Madhumita on May 9, the day she was murdered at her Lucknow residence.																								Sources said Deshraj, in his first statement to the local police, did not mention that he heard gunfire, though he later admitted to CBI sleuths that he heard a shot. One of the two assailants had fired a shot from a country-made weapon, killing Madhumita on the spot.  Highway probe																								The Mulayam Singh Yadav government has ordered a judicial inquiry into the Rs 2,000-crore Taj Expressway project, meant to connect Agra and Noida, cleared by the Mayavati regime.																								Retired Allahabad High Court judge S.R. Mishra has been asked to inquire into allegations about award of contracts and allotment of land along the eight-lane express highway.

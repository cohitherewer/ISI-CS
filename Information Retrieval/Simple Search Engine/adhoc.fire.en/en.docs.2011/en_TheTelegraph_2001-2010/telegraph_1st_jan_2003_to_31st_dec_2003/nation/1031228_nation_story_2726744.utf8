		 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Jogi suspension costs Congress dear
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Sachin Tendulkar lookalike Shankar Pujari at Sonia Gandhis rally in Mumbai on Saturday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Dec. 27: The Congress may have suspended Ajit Jogi, but now it has to pay the price for the action.																								The partys central leadership will have to shell out a few lakhs to reimburse the expenses he had incurred in misusing state government aircraft on seven occasions, in keeping with an Election Commission directive three days ago.																								In the normal course, the Congress would have asked the leader concerned  the freshly unseated Chhattisgarh chief minister, in this instance  to reimburse the amount. 																								Earlier, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had reimbursed over a lakh to his government for using state aircraft for non-official purpose in the run-up to the recently concluded Assembly polls.																								But Jogi is a different matter. How can we ask Jogi to pay the money for the use of government helicopter for party campaigning when we have suspended him from the party? a leader asked.																								Even if Jogi is asked, he would be under no obligation to pay up because he could always say he used the aircraft for party work, the leader added. 																								Worse still, the amount sought includes the cost of using state helicopter for Congress chief Sonia Gandhis visit to Chennai in October.																								The responsibility for paying the dues to the Chhattisgarh government ultimately rests with the Congress headquarters, according to the poll panel directive. So it has 30 days from the date of the order to clear the bill.																								Beset with the complications, the party leadership has chosen not to refer the matter to Jogi. The AICC, immediately on receiving the directive, wrote to the new BJP government in Chhattisgarh, asking for a settlement bill on the specific instances of the use of state aircraft.																								As soon as we get the bill, the party will settle the account, the Congress leader said. The cheque will be issued by party treasurer Motilal Vora, Jogis fellow state leader whose antipathy towards the suspended leader is an open secret.

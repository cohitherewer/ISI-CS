		 Tuesday, June 03, 2003 				 Hutch matches cut
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 2: Joining the rate war sparked last week by Airtel, Hutch has slashed cell-to-cell STD rate to 50 paise per minute and the SMS charge to 60 paise per message.																								Like Airtels offer, the Hutch rate cuts come with riders. The cell-to-cell STD rate reduction will apply to the three post-paid packages -- Talk 599, Talk 999, and Talk 1699, the figures signifying the monthly rentals that subscribers have to fork out.																								Moreover, the 50 paise STD rate will only apply to the first 100 minutes; after that the calls will be charged at Rs 1.99 per minute. Customers will have to pay a monthly fee of Rs 50 for the cut-price STD service. The new rates will not apply to post-paid schemes with lower monthly rentals.																								The SMS charges have also been brought down in line with the Airtel tariff. On a monthly payment of Rs 49, post-paid customers can send 80 messages free. After the 80 free messages, each SMS will be charged at 60 paise each, a sharp reduction from the existing rate of Re 1. For pre-paid customers, the SMS rate remains 60 paise on a monthly payment of Rs 25.																								Sunil Sood, chief operating officer, Hutchison Telecom East Ltd, said: The new offer is a continuation of our commitment to redefine affordability and bridging distance by offering reduced rates for long distance calls.

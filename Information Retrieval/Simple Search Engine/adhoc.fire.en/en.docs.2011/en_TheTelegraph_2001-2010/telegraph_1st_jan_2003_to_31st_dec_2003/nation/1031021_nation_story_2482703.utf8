 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 20: Problems for the Delhi police have compounded following the Swiss diplomats silence in response to emails sent her to identify her rapist and his accomplice from photographs of 16 suspects.																								The diplomats abduction from the Siri Fort auditoriums parking lot and her subsequent rape on October 14 shook the capital. The 35-year-old woman was leaving for home in her car after watching a film when she was abducted. 																								Deputy commissioner of police (south) Vivek Gogia met the Swiss ambassador, Walter B. Gyger, today to tell him that the victim should be requested to reply to the emails. 																								The police official later said the diplomat has not been checking her emails because of personal reasons.																								The case has been a blot on the image of Delhi police as they have failed to check the rising incidents of rape in the city.																								The police have despatched two teams to follow up what they claim are important leads in the case. The police have also roped in the Special Cell and the Crime Branch.																								The DCP (crime) is expected to meet another woman, Akansha Joshi, who was also attacked on the same day in the same area. Efforts are on to ascertain whether the same persons were involved in both cases.																								The police have so far questioned more that 6,500 people who have features similar to the sketches of the rape accused. However, none of them seem to know English. The victim had said that the rapist spoke English. Woman raped twice																								A woman on her way home was gangraped twice in Bihars Jehanabad town.

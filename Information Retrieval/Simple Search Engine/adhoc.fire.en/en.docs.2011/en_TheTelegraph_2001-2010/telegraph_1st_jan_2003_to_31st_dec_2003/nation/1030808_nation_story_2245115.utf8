		 Friday, August 08, 2003 				 Shahabuddin denied bail
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Aug. 7: Bihar director-general of police D.P. Ojha got a shot in the arm today in his war against Mohammad Shahabuddin when the Rashtriya Janata Dal MPs bail application was rejected by a Siwan court.																								The rejection of anticipatory bail cleared the way for the Siwan MPs arrest. However, his advocates here hinted at an appeal against the order in an apparent bid to buy more time before Shahabuddin surrenders, saying Patna High Court would be moved in a day or two.																								Siwan district and sessions judge Abhijit Sinha today said he was not inclined to grant bail as Shahabuddin had not surrendered to the court, which had issued the arrest warrant two years ago.																								The judge, who traced the sequence of events leading to the arrest warrant in his two-page order, said he would separately hear the prayer for attachment of the MPs property filed by the police once the original records relating to this were presented before him. The police had earlier prayed for attachment of Shahabuddins properties as the MP was not surrendering.																								Advocates Isthdeo Tiwari and Abhay Kumar Singh, who appeared for Shahabuddin in court, pointed out during the argument that the allegations against their client were based on hearsay and there was no direct evidence to prove his complicity in the kidnapping of CPI-ML worker Munna Chaudhary in January 2001.																								The advocates claimed that the police had included the name of the MP in the FIR seven days after the kidnapping without any direct or indirect evidence against him. As such, this was an afterthought, they argued.																								After the court passed the verdict rejecting the MPs petition, about 50 of his supporters, who were waiting in front of the court premises, shouted slogans against Ojha who had ordered Shahabuddins arrest. DGP dur bhago (DGP run away), they shouted. Some of the supporters called the police chief an agent of the central government.

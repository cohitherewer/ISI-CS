 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee Chennai, Dec. 12: Local  CPM members had to part with Rs 1 lakh so that a rally to  be addressed by Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  could be held.																								The Centre of Indian Trade Unions had planned to end their 11th all-India conference, attended by Bengal labour minister Mohammed Amin, with a massive rally tomorrow. However, police did not give permission for a rally within the city limits, leaving the Citu with little choice but to take on lease for a day a brick kiln on the western outskirts of the city.																								The local Marxists had to pay Rs 1 lakh for the lease and to clean up the area so that the rally could be held.																								The denial of permission to hold a rally within the city limits is a throwback to the row over rallies in Bengal, where the government took on a judge over an order banning rallies in Calcuttss business district during peak hours on working days.																								For the last four to five months, the police in Chennai have been denying permission for rallies within the city limits and processions through important roads. Besides, the government had pulled down the Seerani Arangam on the Marina  where rallies used to be held  some months ago as part of a beach beautification drive. As such, there is hardly any place left in the city for holding large rallies.																								The Citu today declared that it was opposed to blanket permission for women working night shifts and said it will oppose any such sweeping change to the labour law, as proposed by the Centre.																								Night shifts for women could not be introduced recklessly without considering the other requirements of working women and could be extended only under certain conditions, it said.																								The government will have to take into account that employed women have to look after their children at home, and will also have to consider the question of security for women at the workplace, said Citu general secretary M.K. Pandhe. HC no to picketing																								Madras High Court today denied permission to the DMK to organise picketing programmes in front of central and state government offices in Tamil Nadu on December 15, demanding the repeal of the anti-terror legislation, says PTI.																								However, the court permitted the party to take out a peaceful procession. The court directed the police to identify the route of procession and inform the DMK by tonight.

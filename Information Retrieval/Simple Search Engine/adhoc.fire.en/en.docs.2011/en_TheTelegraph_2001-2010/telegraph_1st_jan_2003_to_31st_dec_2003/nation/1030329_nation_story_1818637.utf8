		 Saturday, March 29, 2003 				 Militants slash noses of informers
 BINOO JOSHI 																								Jammu, March 28: Militants yesterday slit the noses of six suspected informers in Jammu, in a warning to villagers not to help security forces. 																								Last night, militants stormed into Banihar village in Rajouri, which had an army post till last week, pulled out six persons they suspected of tipping off the soldiers and slashed their noses with knives. A young woman, identified as Fatima, was among the victims. 																								The first incident of its kind has stunned the area, which has been in the news in the past few weeks for stepped-up violence.																								About half-a-dozen militants first picked on Abdul Khaliq, whose house was close to where the army picket was located. They beat him up, asked him to stand upright, tied his hands and then sliced off his nose.																								As he cried out in pain, other villagers came running out of their homes. The militants caught some of them and slashed their noses. 																								The victims have been identified as Fatima, Nur Hussain, Nissar Hussain and his son Razak, Mir Waz and Nazir Hussain. 																								Policemen arrived at the spot only after village elders took the bleeding victims to the nearest outpost. 																								Director-general of police Ashok Kumar Suri said the terror tactics showed that militants are getting desperate after loss of local support. 																								Two months ago, militants had killed three girls, suspecting them of being police informers, in the same area. 																								Earlier, militants used to gun down people they suspected of helping security forces.

		 Wednesday, April 09, 2003 				 Rajasthan trident ban
																								Jaipur, April 8 (PTI): Apparently alarmed at the distribution of tridents by the VHP in the state, the Rajasthan government today put a ban on acquisition, possession and carrying of tridents except at religious places with immediate effect.																								A notification issued by the home department said: In view of the prevailing conditions ... it is in public interest that distribution, acquisition, possessing or carrying of a double and multi-bladed sharp and pointed weapon be regulated in Rajasthan.																								The VHP, however, said it would go ahead with its trishul diksha programme in the state.

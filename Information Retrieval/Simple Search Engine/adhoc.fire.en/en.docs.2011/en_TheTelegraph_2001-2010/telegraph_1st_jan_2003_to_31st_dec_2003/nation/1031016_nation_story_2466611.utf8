		 Thursday, October 16, 2003 				 Warrant blow to Daler 
 OUR BUREAU																								Oct. 15: A Patiala court today issued non-bailable warrants against Bhangra pop star Daler Mehndi, his wife and the wife of his brother in a case of alleged human trafficking.																								The court issued the warrants against Mehndi, his wife, Daljit Kaur, Balwinder Kaur, brother Shamsher Singh Sheras wife, and three others named in the FIR registered on October 6. A police officer said the warrants were secured as the accused had been evading arrest and not cooperating in the probe.																								A team of policemen from Patiala also raided a flat in the affluent Lokhandwala Complex in connection with the case.																								The flat belongs to a person called Rocky. The police seized a computer, VCDs and photo albums. They will see if these tally with the names and photographs of people Daler and Shamser allegedly have sent, or promised to send, over to the US.																								The Patiala team is led by police superintendent Bhupinder Singh who said they may be here for three to four days, depending on the progress of their work.																								The singer has been missing since the allegations broke out. It has been charged that Daler and Shamser took money from people who wanted to go to the US and took them with his team to perform abroad. These team members did not come back. 																								Daler has maintained that he is innocent and is not involved with his brothers activities.

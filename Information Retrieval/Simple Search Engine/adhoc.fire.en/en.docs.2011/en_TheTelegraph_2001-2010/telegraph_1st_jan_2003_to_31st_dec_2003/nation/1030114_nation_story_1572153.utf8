																								Ahmedabad, Jan. 13 (PTI): A girl from the minority community today told the commission probing the Godhra carnage and the subsequent riots that a saffron-clad youth had beaten up a Muslim man at the Godhra railway station on February 27.																								According to Sophia Khan, 18, from Vadodara, the youth who had got down on the platform also tried to drag her into the Sabarmati Express.																								She was deposing here before the commission of retired Justices K.G. Shah and G.T. Nanavati.																								The express, Khan said, arrived on platform number 1 where she, her sister and her mother were waiting for a local train to Vadodara. Several saffron-clad youth got off the train, chanting Jai Shri Ram.																								They were also chanting kill and chop Muslims, Sophia said. She noticed some ruckus on the platform and saw one of the youths beating up a Muslim man with a stick. Scared, Sophia said, she tried to take refuge near the booking clerks office. Two of them grabbed her hand, muffled her mouth and almost dragged her into the train when her mother shouted for help, she said.																								But the girl pleaded inability to identify the youth who had tried to drag her into the train.																								During the cross examination, Sophia said she had not lodged a separate police complaint yet and had no intention of doing so.																								The express driver, Rajendra Yadav, produced a logbook of his technical record and gave the commission some details.																								The commission has not yet fixed the dates of the next hearing.

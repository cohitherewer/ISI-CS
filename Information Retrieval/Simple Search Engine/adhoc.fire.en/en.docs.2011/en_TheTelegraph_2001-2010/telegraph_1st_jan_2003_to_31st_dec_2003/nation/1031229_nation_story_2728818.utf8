 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: The main witness in the Satyendra Dubey murder case has told the CBI that the government engineer was killed while resisting a robbery attempt.																								Rickshawpuller Pradeep Kumar, perhaps the only witness to the murder, said one of five robbers had first fired at Dubey; then another bullet was pumped in, killing the IIT Kanpur graduate.																								The allegations doing the rounds was that Dubey, who was a project manager with the National Highways Authority of India, was killed because he had pointed out corruption in the Barachatti segment of the Golden Quadrilateral project in his letters to the Prime Minister and the authority chairman.																								Kumar was brought to Delhi about three days ago to get his statement recorded. 																								Dubey had hired Kumar to get to his official residence after alighting from a train at Gaya station early on November 27. He was returning from Varanasi.																								His driver Brij Mohan was called up earlier to drive him home but the official vehicle had failed to start, sources said.																								Kumar told the sleuths that he had barely pulled his rickshaw 500 metres on the way to the Circuit House, when an armed person accosted him.																								Pointing a country revolver at Kumars head, the goon is said to have ordered Dubey to hand over whatever he was carrying. Dubey resisted. Four more goons then rushed out and threatened the engineer.																								When Dubey refused to yield, one of the five fired on him up close; the robbers pulled the trigger again, killing the engineer on the spot, Kumar said.																								They then fled with Dubeys briefcase, wallet containing some cash and wristwatch, Kumar added. 																								But the engineers cellphone had landed on the rickshaw after sliding out of his pocket in the scuffle.																								Kumar had retained the cell, which helped the CBI trace him, the sources said.																								The bureau had on December 14 registered a case against unknown persons under Section 120B of the Indian Penal Code for criminal conspiracy and Section 302 for murder, and various sections of the Arms Act. 																								The move had followed the Prime Minister and the Bihar governments decision to transfer the case to the CBI.																								Earlier, the Gaya police had registered a case on a complaint by Dubeys brother that said the engineer was gunned down as he had taken action against contractors in Koderma over corruption.																								A senior bureau official will visit Gaya again next week to supervise investigations. The initial probe, however, shows the incident could be a case of robbery and murder.

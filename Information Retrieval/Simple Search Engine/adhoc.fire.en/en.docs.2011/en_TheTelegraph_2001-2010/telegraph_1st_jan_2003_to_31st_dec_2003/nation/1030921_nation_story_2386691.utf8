		 Sunday, September 21, 2003 				 Mulayam joins Delhi race
 KAY BENEDICT				 	 Mulayam Singh																								New Delhi, Sept. 20: In a move that will hit ally Congress more than the BJP, the Samajwadi Party today entered the Delhi poll fray, nominating five candidates for the coming Assembly election. Most of the candidates hail from Congress strongholds and the Samajwadi may name more contestants later.																								The announcement was made today by party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav at rally in Nangloi, a nondescript west Delhi suburb dominated by Yadavs, Muslims and Dalits and boasting of a Congress MLA.																								The rally, organised by the Samajwadis Delhi unit general secretary Mahender Yadav to felicitate Mulayam on becoming the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, saw cheerleaders chant that the dharti putra (son of the soil) would defeat the Congress and the BJP and become Prime Minister soon.																								Mulayam, who needed some help from the Congress to become chief minister, was addressing his first rally here since assuming office. He slammed the Congress for doing nothing for the poor and oppressed and also criticised the BJP for trying to divide people along communal lines.																								Mulayam said the Congress did not any ideology left. The Congress has only Nehrus name, but the Samajwadi Party has its ideals and vichar. It is now difficult to say which is more corrupt, the Congress or the BJP, he added.																								The chief minister said whenever he assumed office in Lucknow, the BJP resurrected its Ayodhya temple agitation. The BJP does not have any principle, it has no agenda for the poor, students, farmers, traders and industrialists; its only agenda is to capture power by dividing society. You have seen what happened in Gujarat, he said detailing the events that led the Supreme Court to pull up the Narendra Modi government.																								Mulayam, who had last week ruled out the need for a third front, today said such a grouping had to be revived to provide an alternative to the BJP and the Congress. BJP and Congress alternate in forming the government at the Centre and most of the states. We need to provide a third alternative, he said. Advani acquittal																								Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh said in Calcutta today that the Uttar Pradesh government may move court to challenge the Rae Bareli court decision to drop charges against L.K. Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case. 																								We intend to consult our coalition partners in Uttar Pradesh to reach a consensus on the matter, Singh said.

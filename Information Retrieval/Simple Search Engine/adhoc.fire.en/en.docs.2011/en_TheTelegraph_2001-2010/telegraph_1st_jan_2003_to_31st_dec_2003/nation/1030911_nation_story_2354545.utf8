		 Thursday, September 11, 2003 				 Howrah schedule for two-day holiday
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 File picture of a heritage train leaving Howrah station																								Calcutta, Sept. 10: Eastern Railway authorities have worked out a plan to minimise problems of commuters when train services at Howrah station will be suspended from Friday night to Sunday morning.																								The suspension  which will start from the night of September 12 and go on till early morning on September 14  is being carried out to remodel the Route Relay Interlocking system at the yard.																								No trains will arrive or start from Howrah on September 13 and more than 30 per cent trains will either be redirected to Sealdah or short-terminated at other stations, including Liluah, Bally, Belur and Dankuni.																								Subhash Ranjan Thakur, the chief operations manager of Eastern Railway, said they had on purpose selected Friday and Saturday to set up the new system so that if the work cannot be completed within the stipulated period, they can make use of the next day as flow of passengers are comparatively less on Sundays.																								We have chosen a second Saturday because many private firms remain closed on the day and the rush of passengers is naturally lower on local trains. The state government has promised us full co-operation by providing additional buses to and from the stations the trains will be terminated at. The monthly and quarterly ticket-holders who avail trains from Howrah will be allowed to travel to their respective destinations on the same tickets for these two days, Thakur said.																								Commuters must also take notice of the fact that though the information of arrival and departure printed on the tickets for long-distance trains which have been issued to them is Howrah, the trains will originate and terminate at the stations specifically listed for these two days and will be available at the railway enquiry, he added.																								Fifteen Calcutta Tramways Corporation buses will ferry passengers to and from Bally to Howrah via Belur and Liluah and five more buses will travel between Belur and Howrah. The government has also arranged for 25 buses of the Calcutta Surface Transport Corporation, which will bring passengers from Santragachi to Calcutta.																								Trains rescheduled: Down Poorva Express (2304 Dn)  on September 12 and Poorva Express (2382 Dn) on September  13 will arrive at Sealdah station instead of Howrah. Poorva  Express (2303 Up) on September 13 and (2381 Up) on September  14 will originate from Sealdah instead of Howrah Three other Howrah-bound long-distance  trains, including Jodhpur Express (2308 Dn), Amritsar Mail  (3006 Dn) and Asansol-Howrah Agniveena Express (3036 Dn),  will arrive at Sealdah on September 13 instead of Howrah Jodhpur Express (2307 Up), Amritsar  Mail (3005 Up) and Asansol-Howrah Agniveena Express (3035  Up) will start from Sealdah on September 13 as per their  scheduled departure time, instead of Howrah																								All other long-distance mail/express trains of Eastern Railway will remain cancelled from Howrah on September 13.

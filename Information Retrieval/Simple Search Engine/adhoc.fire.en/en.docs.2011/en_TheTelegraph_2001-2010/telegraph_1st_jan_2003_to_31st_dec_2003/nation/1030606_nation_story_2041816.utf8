		 Friday, June 06, 2003 				 Malaysia order on workers
																								Kuala Lumpur, June 5 (PTI): Malaysian High Court has directed a counsel representing 52 Indian workers, suing their employer for breach of contract, to send the statement of a witness to the Indian government.																								Justice R.K. Nathan said the Indian authorities should be informed that India-based agents of foreign-worker recruitment companies here were misleading its people who came here for employment, The Star said today. The paper was reporting on a case filed last year against the employer, Chin Well Fasteners.																								Earlier, the judge lambasted witness Amarjeet Singh, (37), a foreign-worker recruitment consultant, for testifying that he had never recruited workers from India. I gave you a chance to read through your statement but now you are telling that you have never supplied workers from India when in your sworn statement, you admitted assisting the factory in supplying Indian workers since 1995. 																								Sampath Kumar Vellingiri and 51 others, mostly employed as general workers, are suing the factory for alleged breach of contract and failing to pay their minimum monthly wages of Ringitt 600 (around Rs 7,200) as agreed in their contract. 																								The workers said the factory forced them to work an extra five to seven hours each day, though the contract said they could not work for more than two hours after the eight-hour daily shift. They also claimed they were paid only Ringitt 350 (around Rs 4,200) a month in basic salary. 																								Chin Well Fasteners denied the workers were told they would be paid according to the contract.

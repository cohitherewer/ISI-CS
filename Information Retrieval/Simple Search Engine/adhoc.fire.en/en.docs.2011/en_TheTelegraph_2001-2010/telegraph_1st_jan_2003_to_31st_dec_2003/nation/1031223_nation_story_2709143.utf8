		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 House pension rush amp; pangs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 22: The bare seven minutes that it took today for the Lok Sabha to clear a pension plan for MPs raised concern among some members regarding the haste with which such changes are carried out.																								CPM parliamentary party leader Somnath Chatterjee expressed doubts whether amendments should be rushed through when the bill to alter the MPs salary, allowances and pension act was unanimously passed this morning. 																								The reason, he said, was the criticism outside that members of Parliament decide themselves about their salaries and allowances. Perhaps, it would be better to have a mechanism whereby the existing system could be avoided, he suggested. Speaker Manohar Joshi, who was in the chair, agreed with the CPM floor leader.																								Chatterjee, however, did not appear to be protesting over parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swarajs request to move the amendment bill and get it adopted at one go as many of the 95 members present today urged a quick passage.																								Sushma sought the Houses permission to introduce the amendment bill even as the Speaker was telling Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan to stand up and raise the issue of the Centres alleged intervention in the affairs of Aligarh Muslim University during zero hour.																								But with the House giving permission, the subject for its consideration changed and Sushma moved the bill. It was considered clause by clause within two minutes and adopted.																								From now, regardless of a members length of tenure in either House, he will be eligible for a monthly pension of Rs 3,000. The family pension would go up from Rs 1,000 a month to Rs 1,500.																								MPs who can avail 32 air tickets a year can give up to eight of these to their relatives and dependents to travel independently and even use private airlines, unlike earlier. Members from the Northeast can also claim mileage allowances to reach the airport nearest to their constituency. Unutilised phone calls of the free yearly quota of 150,000 can now be carried forward to the next year.

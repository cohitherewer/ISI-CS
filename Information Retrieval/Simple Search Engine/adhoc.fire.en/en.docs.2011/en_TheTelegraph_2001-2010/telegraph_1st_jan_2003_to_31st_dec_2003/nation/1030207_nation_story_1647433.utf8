		 Friday, February 07, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Cell operators give clean chit to BSNL				 																																																	n a letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the association said: Public sector operator BSNL was complying with the terms and conditions of WiLL(m) and the violations were being done by the private WiLL(m) operators.				 																																																	The association urged the regulator to act urgently and expeditiously directing the WiLL(m) players to immediately stop misinforming the consumers about scope of services like SMS and roaming facilities.				 																																																	The industry also asked Trai to share with it the details on the resources and mechanism that it intended to put in place to ensure that limited mobility stays limited and the interests of the consumers as also the cellular operators were adequately protected and safeguarded.

Poojary to head Karnataka Cong				 																																																	 new delhi: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has named former Union minister B. Janardhan Poojary, a prominent OBC leader, as president of the partys Karnataka unit, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The former AICC general secretary, a Rajya Sabha member from the state, had held the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee chiefs post for two years in the mid-1980s. He replaces Allum Veerabhadrappa, who had voluntarily quit the post more than six months ago, hoping to make a comeback to the Karnataka Cabinet.				 																																																	After Veerabhadrappa quit, chief minister S.M. Krishna had proposed the names of at least half-a-dozen junior ministerial colleagues for the post. All the names were turned down by Sonia because of her growing unhappiness over the governments handling of sensitive issues like the Cauvery water dispute with Tamil Nadu and the Nagappa abduction.				 																																																	Poojary, party sources say, is not Krishnas preferred choice to head the organisation in the state. Poojary has a reputation of being an aggressive leader, something that Krishna will not be comfortable with, they say.

While former vice-chairman Tarlochan Singh, who has the strong backing of a BJP ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal, has been elevated as chairman, the only other member retained is Lt Gen A.M.

 JOHN MARY		 Antony:BIll dilemma			Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 12: The average beef-eating Keralite had better be ready to alter his eating habits and perhaps his mindset, too, if a proposed central bill banning cow slaughter is passed.																								Nearly 80 per cent of Keralas population, comprising backward Ezhavas, Christians, Muslims and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, eat beef with relish. Beef-eating is not taboo even among the Nairs, though cooking or serving it at home is not encouraged.																								The Malayalee homestead dairy culture had led to the killing of calves for their meat. But that has changed now as Kerala depends on neighbouring states for the supply of beef and other meat. This is because cattle-rearing has become unviable after the steady depletion of paddy fields, which provide fodder and grazing grounds for cattle.																								According to a Swiss Agency for development and cooperation study, 1.1 million animals are brought into Kerala for slaughter each year.																								In Kerala, beef is the cheapest red meat. This accounts for its enduring popularity in the state. A kg of beef costs Rs 50 compared with Rs 140 for mutton at the main Palayam market here. Christians can hardly think of a Sunday meal without beef.																								The proposed ban on cow slaughter has been slammed by K. Kuriskose, general secretary of the Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association, which represents 25,000 hotels, restaurants and teashops as well as 460 bars. Kuriskose said the move was an affront to the culinary tastes of a whole state. Keralites prefer the meat of the cow to that of the buffalo.																								Even in Kerala, chicken consumption is on the rise. But going by the truckloads of cattle arriving in the state, it will be a while before chicken becomes the favoured meat.																								The VHPs state unit, which recently launched a campaign against cow slaughter in Kerala, is happy at the turn of events. Some months ago, VHP activists performed aarti at the southern checkpost of Kaleekavila for cows being brought into the state from Tamil Nadu. They were given fodder and water and sent back across the border.																								But once the activists left the scene, the cattle were brought back by the contractors and herded to slaughterhouses.																								Gopal Krishna Pillai, principal secretary to chief minister A.K. Antony, said he did not think the bill would be passed, considering that some parties were not in favour of it. He felt banning cow slaughter in Kerala was not practical.																								Even if the bill falls through, it could prove embarrassing for Antony. The BJP and the VHP are sure to whip up a pre-poll campaign that will make the chief minister wonder if he should respect the sentiments of beef-eating Keralites or submit to the BJPs demands. 																								His recent refusal to ban the trishul diksha in the state won him praise from VHP international general secretary Praveen Togadia. But it earned him criticism from the Opposition and even the Muslim League, the second biggest partner in the ruling United Front.																								The chief minister responded by saying the CPM-led Opposition had no reason to criticise him because CPM-ruled Bengal did not ban trishul distribution.																								It is quite likely that Antony will look to Bengal before deciding to ban cow slaughter or not. Besides Bengal and Kerala, only six other states have not banned cow slaughter.

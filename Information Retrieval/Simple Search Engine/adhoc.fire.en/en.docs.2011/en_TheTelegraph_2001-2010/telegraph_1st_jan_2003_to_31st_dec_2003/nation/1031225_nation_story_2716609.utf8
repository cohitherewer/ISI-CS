 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Dec. 24: Factionalism has come to the fore at almost all levels of the Congress hierarchy after the defeat in Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls.																								The latest to blame Digvijay Singh is AICC general secretary Kamal Nath, who till recently prided himself as the former chief ministers bada bhai.																								Nath, fighting a battle for survival in the AICC secretariat, has claimed he had come to know that the Congress was facing defeat in the state a fortnight before the verdict day, December 4. His remarks infuriated Digvijay loyalists who are wondering why the general secretary kept mum. According to them, Nath was given a free hand in selecting candidates for the Mahakaushal region where the party has been routed. In his parliamentary seat Chindwara, Naths men lost all eight Assembly seats. 																								The general secretary has also been accused of vetoing recommendations of observer Prithviraj Chauhan, a member of the party panel looking into the factors responsible for the defeat.																								State Congress committee members loyal to Digvijay said that, apart from ticket distribution, Nath had a say in almost all spheres of governance, appointments and policy decisions. There were at least half a dozen ministers loyal to him in the cabinet and Naths recommendations were seldom overlooked. 																								A section of the party also blames Nath for the power crisis in the state. The group claims that the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board chief was shielded by the senior Congress leader till October when Digvijay replaced him with chief secretary A.V. Singh. Nath has denied his proximity with the former chief.																								Political observers say the big fight between bada and chhota bhai signals the end of a long era of strategic alliance. Nath and Digvijay had worked out a tacit understanding to keep leaders like Arjun Singh and the Shukla brothers at bay. There was a perfect understanding. As Digvijay consolidated himself in the state, Nath moved up at the national level, said a former state minister close to both. He said post December 4, the two sides were bracing for a no-holds-barred one-upmanship as the truce has fallen through. 																								Moreover, at the national level, Digvijay is emerging as a challenger to Nath after party chief Sonia Gandhi hinted at a reshuffle in the AICC secretariat. For the record, Digvijay has announced he would not hold any post for the next 10 years. Those familiar with the Congress functioning, however, say the offer is subject to Sonias approval. If Digvijay is offered a party job, he would have little option but to abide by the high commands order.																								Facing the heat, Nath is making a case for the younger generation (the troika of Nath, Ambika Soni and Mukul Wasnik). But old timers debunk the claim, pointing to the recent polls where almost all the youngsters Ashok Gehlot, Digvijay Singh and Ajit Jogi  were at the helm. 																								At the organisational level, younger leaders like Girija Vyas, R.K. Malviya and Ramanuj Yadav were heading the Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh units. In the AICC, Soni was general secretary in charge of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan while Vilasrao Deshmukh was looking after Chhattisgarh.

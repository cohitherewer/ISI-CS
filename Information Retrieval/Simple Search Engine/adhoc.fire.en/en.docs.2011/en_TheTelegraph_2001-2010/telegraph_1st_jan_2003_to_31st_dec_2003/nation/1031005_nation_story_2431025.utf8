 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT		 AmarmaniNew Delhi, Oct. 4: Former Uttar Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathi has been dealt another blow in the Madhumita Shukla murder case, with the Central Forensic Science Laboratory report saying that he had lied while being interrogated by the CBI. 																								The forensic laboratorys report  on a polygraph test taken by Amarmani at the CBI headquarters  say he was lying on 11 of the 20 questions he had been asked.																								An expert from the laboratory was called from Lucknow to Delhi conduct the test on September 29. The CBI has handed over a copy of the report, which it received two days ago, to sleuths in Lucknow so that Amarmani can be confronted again.																								The report on the polygraph test comes close on the heels of a DNA report confirming that the former minister is the father of the foetus found in the dead poets body.																								Amarmani, whose CBI custody was extended till October 6 by a Lucknow court, had left the sleuths with a bitter taste in the mouth when he was lodged at the CBI headquarters. The former minister did not say much and also complained of a pain in the chest, despite medical reports showing that he was fit enough to be interrogated.																								The former minister now claims that he never met Madhumitas mother, Shanti Devi, whom he was confronted with in Lucknow two days ago. CBI sources said Amarmani, who recently joined the ruling Samajwadi Party, refused to acknowledge that he had met Shanti Devi earlier.																								Madhumita had, however, written in her personal diary that the two families knew each other well and Amarmani had often visited her at their Paper Mill Colony residence in Lucknow.																								Sources say Shanti Devi and Madhumita had met Tripathi while he was lodged in an Uttar Pradesh jail for his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of a man from Basti in the eastern part of the state. CBI officials iterate that Amarmani knows much more than he has revealed about the murder of Madhumita on May 9.

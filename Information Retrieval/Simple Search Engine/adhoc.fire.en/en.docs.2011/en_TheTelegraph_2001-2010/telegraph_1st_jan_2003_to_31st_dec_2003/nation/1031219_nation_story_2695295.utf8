		 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Rights panel caution to forces
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 18: The National Human Rights Commission chairman today cautioned that state terrorism could never be an option in fighting insurgents in a democracy, however great the provocation. 																								Human rights cannot be put on the backburner or swept under the carpet. There can be stringent laws to fight terrorism as well as stringent orders to ensure that human rights are not violated, Justice (retd) A.S. Anand said. 																								He was speaking at a debate organised by the Central Industrial Security Force on the need for special legislation to effectively combat terrorism in the country.																								Anand told reporters that he personally believed special anti-terror laws were necessary to deal with the situation. The Supreme Court judgment upholding the constitutional validity of the Prevention of Terrorism Act has put an end to the debate. Pota is necessary to combat terrorism, but I very much hope that human rights will also be respected.																								Representatives from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force, BSF, CRPF, National Security Guard, Railway Protection Force and the Special Services Bureau participated.

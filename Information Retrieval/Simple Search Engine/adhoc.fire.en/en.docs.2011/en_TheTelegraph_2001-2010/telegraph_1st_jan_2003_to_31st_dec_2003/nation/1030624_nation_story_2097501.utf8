		 Tuesday, June 24, 2003 				 Orissa check on Naxalites
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, June 23: Anti-Naxalite operations in the southern Orissa districts jointly carried out by the state and Central forces in the past week seem to have put a check on the spiralling violence.																								In the past few days, several guerrillas have either been arrested or have surrendered before police. A senior police official said the Orissa State Armed Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) have effectively controlled the menace in Raygada and Malkangiri districts.																								During these intense combing operations, several Naxalite hideouts were destroyed, huge caches of arms and ammunition seized and nearly 160 activists arrested.																								Raygada police superintendent R.K. Sharma said that in the past week, raids were conducted at Siriguda, Balipanga and Rangam villages and the adjoining jungles of the Gudari block.Two guns, two gun barrels, bundles of telephone and electric wire cables, pamphlets, posters and explosive materials were seized.																								Raids in the Gudari area led to the arrest of five Naxalites last week. Following their arrest, four more Naxalites are reported to have surrendered before the Raygada police. 																								The surrendered Naxalites are Rushia Sabar, Majhi Kadraka, Amin Kdraka, and Dudo Kadraka. They promised to help the administration in controlling the Naxalite movement. Seven activists of the People Guerrilla Army surrendered before the police last week.																								Intensive anti-Naxalitecombing operations are also on in Gajapati district. 																								The anti-Naxalite operations in the state is still heavily dependent on the CRPF, who were deployed in the four southern districts following the attacks on the Kalimela and Motu police stations in Malkangiri by the PWG activists last year.																								While the state police still not ready for tackling the Naxalite menace, a missive from the Centre to withdraw the CRPF by June 30 has worried the government.																								The Centres decision has come in the wake of deployment of the newly raised India Reserve Battalion of the state police at Malakangiri. However, police officials said the presence of CRPF is necessary because the IRB jawans are yet to adapt to the difficult terrain of the Naxalite-infested areas.

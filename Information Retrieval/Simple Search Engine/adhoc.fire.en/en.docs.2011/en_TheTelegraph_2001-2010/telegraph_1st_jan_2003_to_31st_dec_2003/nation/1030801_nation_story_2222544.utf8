 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA Mumbai, July 31: The blast  in the Jogeshwari chawl early this morning has left the  neighbourhood in a stupor, with many there realising for  the first time that Dilnawaz Mustafa Khan stored explosives  in his house.																								Arun Patil, head of Movie Action Dummy Effect Association, said: Khan used to work on shows and events and was a member of our association. Storing explosives in his house was an illegal act, as he had no licence to keep them there. But these were material for fireworks and not substances used for bombs, Patil said.																								Patil, who made a statement to police about Khan, said a huge amount of explosives has been found, perhaps to be used over a period of days, and perhaps 10 per cent of it exploded. The impact was tremendous due to compression because it exploded inside a small room.																								The biggest sufferer was Khan himself. The blast killed him and four of his family members. Only one of his children lives.																								Khans neighbours still dont know what to say about the blast. About 10 adjacent houses were ripped apart.																								Although Khan was living here for more than two years, not many knew him well. Woh film line mein kaam karte the aur gulal aur chamki supply karte the, said Salim Patel, who lived next door and works as a driver for Balaji Telefilms. He said he didnt know that Khan dealt in explosives.																								Suresh Parwal, another neighbour, said he knew that Khan worked in the film line but didnt know he dealt with explosives.																								It is a trauma for the survivors. Seven of the injured have been admitted to KEM Hospital, three to Cooper and one to Ruby. Sixteen have been released after preliminary treatment.																								Young Vikrant, a student of Class V, admitted at Cooper, looks bewildered with a bandage around his head. He says that two of his neighbours young daughters are dead. But he has not been told that his younger sister is also dead. His brother has been admitted to KEM Hospital where his parents have rushed off to look after him.																								Arun Jaiswal, who is in his twenties and sells perfume, was sleeping in the verandah when the blast took place. He was injured in the ankle and a hand. He can hardly speak.																								 Sri Prasad Yadav, in his thirties, has fractured a leg.

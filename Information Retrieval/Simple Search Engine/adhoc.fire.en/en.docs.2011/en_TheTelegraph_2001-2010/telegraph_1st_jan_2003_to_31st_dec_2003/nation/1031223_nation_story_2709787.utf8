 K.C. PHILIP				 	 Lalita																								Sitamarhi, Dec. 22: Beyond Lalitas face that graced a Unicef report lies the story of the numerous faceless didis who helped the Dalit teenager become the Karate Girl.																								Shanti Devi of Rohtas is one such, says Shubraja, the Rohtas district coordinator of Mahila Samakhya, the organisation that worked the Lalita wonder.																								Shanti, an instructor at a village womens empowerment centre, and her team had taken on the might of an upper-caste landlord who thrashed her for installing a door in her house that faced his field.																								The stories of women like Shanti Devi are exemplary for us, says Shubraja as we focus on community action and do not prop up individuals like Lalita.																								Shanti is not the only example of courage under fire. About 1,000 others like her had blocked the Grand Trunk Road in Sasaram when a resident, Parvati, was killed by her husband and forced his arrest.																								When a woman of Muzaffarpur was murdered and buried, women members of the empowerment centres dug out the body and demonstrated till a case was filed.																								These are just a few examples of womens collective action that helps them develop a positive self-image and attain self-confidence, says Sabeena, a Notre Dame nun who is the Bihar coordinator of the Samakhya.																								The Samakhya is the womens education and empowerment wing of the Bihar Education Project, which functions under the Union human resource development ministry and is funded by the World Bank and the Unicef.																								Launched in 1991, the project, committed to universal primary education, was aimed at revitalising government education in Bihar.																								But an essential ingredient for success is the active participation of the community. In a bid to achieve this, the Samakhya  meaning interaction between equals  was started as a project component in 1992 in four state districts.																								Today, the Mahila Samakhya  which can be interpreted as education for womens equality  is spread across 2,122 villages in 34 blocks of seven districts.																								For the Samakhya, Lalita is a gift of its decade of service to women that it would like to replicate with other Lalitas. The outfits most potent weapon to achieve this is the Mahila Samooh (womens groups) that aims to ensure empowerment through critical education.																								The Samooh is more than a physical gathering of women. It is a space for nurturing their hopes, aspirations and experiences  a place for discovering their inner strength and actualising their dreams, says a Samakhya report.																								Womens individual and collective empowerment becomes a reality in these groups of 20-30 women and they start recognising their strength and use it to fight injustices, says Sabeena.																								They took the first steps towards this end when 2,000 women stood for the 2001 panchayat polls. As many as 541 were elected as panchayat ward, samiti and district council members and block pramukh. 																								Till that year, over 6,000 girls were provided basic literacy classes and then introduced to formal schooling. The number of matriculates among them, however, has been rather poor, considering the target groups are the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and those below poverty line.																								Yet, over 51,000 women of the 1,890 Samoohs are a force to reckon with in rural Bihar. 																								With a view to consolidating these groups into a single, independent and registered unit once the Samakhya pulls out, the outfit is running numerous education and economic self-reliance programmes.																								The Jagjagi centres attend to adolescent girls, the Kishori Manch and the Mahila Shikshan Kendra to both adolescents and women and the Bal Jagjagi to pre-school children.																								We dream of a day when our Samooh members become capable enough to manage the programme themselves to facilitate our gradual phase-out policy, says Sabeena.

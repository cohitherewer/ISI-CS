		 Sunday, December 07, 2003 				 Fresh notices to Judeo, aide
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 6: Fresh notices have been issued to Natwar Rataria, additional private secretary to former minister of state for environment Dilip Singh Judeo, to appear before the Central Bureau of Investigation for questioning in the cash-on-camera scandal, said CBI director U.S. Mishra.																								The person who had booked the hotel room where Judeo and Rataria were allegedly filmed accepting bribe, as well as the hotel staff, have been questioned, according to the 1986-batch IPS officer of the Orissa cadre who took over as director today from P.C. Sharma.																								Rohit Chaudhary, from whose cellphone calls were made to the room, was also grilled. Rahul, who posed as the representative of an Australian firm and was seen on the tape offering cash to Judeo for mining rights, was using Chaudharys mobile, according to sources.																								Mishra said notices have also been served on to Judeo, but did not clarify the date on which he and Rataria have been asked to appear before the investigators.																								When asked whether the CBI would question Amit Jogi, son of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, Mishra said: First let us examine them, then we would think about others.																								Mishra, who has been awarded the Presidents Police Medal and Police Medal for Distinguished Services, emphasised that he would focus on preventive surveillance on officers of doubtful integrity, as well as on extradition of fugitives, mainly economic offenders, and to create an awareness that corruption is a crime in a society.																								Society must stigmatise corruption in the society, stressed the CBI chief.																								On the controversial provision of single directive, which makes it mandatory to seek government permission before registering a case against officers of the rank of joint secretary or above, being re-introduced through the Central Vigilance Commission Bill, he said: CVC is an act (brought) by the government. We have to follow it.																								Earlier, outgoing director Sharma said he tried to give a new thrust to the agency. I have succeeded to a certain degree but the work has to go on.																								Sharma said during his tenure as director investigators had solved the murder cases of former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya and Madhumita Shukla, apart from managing deportations and extradition of several criminals.																								The outgoing director said he was glad that a Portugal court has ordered the extradition of underworld don Abu Salems girl friend Monica Bedi. He was confident that the Portugal court will give similar orders in Salems case as well.

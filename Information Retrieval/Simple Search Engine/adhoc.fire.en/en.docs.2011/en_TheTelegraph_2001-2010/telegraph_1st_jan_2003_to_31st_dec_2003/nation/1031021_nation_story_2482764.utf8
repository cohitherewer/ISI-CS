		 Tuesday, October 21, 2003 				 Digvijay counters misled PM
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bhopal, Oct. 20: Digvijay Singh has responded to Atal Bihari Vajpayees attack on his government by saying the Prime Minister had been misled by the BJPs false propaganda.																								Vajpayee had kicked off the BJPs election campaign in the state yesterday by asking people to vote on development. He attacked the Digvijay government for poor roads, shortage of power and a low human development index, saying: There should be complete focus on development-related issues																								The chief minister today came up with a point-by-point rebuttal of the Prime Ministers statement. He said: I am both disappointed and hurt by your (Vajpayees) criticism. You have been praising my governments performance both inside and outside Parliament. You have been perhaps misled by false propaganda unleashed by state BJP leaders. Digvijay objected to Vajpayees call to vote the BJP into power in the December elections as it would help the state co-ordinate better with the Centre. I have been always saying that  I have received full cooperation and affection from your  government. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha on March 13, 2001,  you had showered lavish praise on my government, saying  my initiative on power reforms was commendable, Digvijay  reminded the Prime Minister. He said many Union ministries  and central agencies had applauded his governments work.

																								Patna, Sept. 2: The controversy over Prakash Jhas Gangaajal seems to be coming to an end with the petitions that were filed in the high court against the film being withdrawn today, reports our special correspondent.																								Jha is expected to arrive here tomorrow for a special screening of the film for Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and his chief minister wife, Rabri Devi. Laloo Prasad seems to have mellowed after the directors call to him from Mumbai.																								An RJD activist, Dev Jyoti, had earlier filed a petition seeking immediate ban on the screening of the film for allegedly tarnishing the image of Rabri Devis legislator brother Sadhu Yadav. The main villain of the film, based on the Bhagalpur blindings, is also named Sadhu Yadav.

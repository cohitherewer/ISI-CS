		 Thursday, August 07, 2003 				 HC clears way for Laloo trip
 OUR BUREAU																								Aug. 6: Jharkhand High Court has ordered the release of Laloo Prasad Yadavs passport so that the former Bihar chief minister, accused in several fodder scam cases, can attend a media conference in Islamabad. The court, however, directed him to surrender his passport before it after his return.																								Justice Vikramaditya Prasad did not find any reason to disallow the RJD chiefs request for permission to go to Pakistan to attend the conference from August 9 to 12 as part of a delegation that includes 25 parliamentarians and journalists. The conference aims to promote good relations between the estranged neighbours.																								The order comes a day after the RJD chief sought the Supreme Courts indulgence to release his passport, deposited with a trial court as a condition for bail.																								Laloo Prasads counsel argued that most of the court orders do not create any hurdle for the RJD chief, an accused in seven animal husbandry scam cases in Jharkhand and Bihar, to attend the conference. The counsel promised to return the passport as soon as the former chief minister returned.																								The CBI counsel opposed the plea, saying it was possible that the petitioner would run away if he is allowed to leave India. The matter is before the apex  court, which will hear Laloo Prasads petition tomorrow.  A bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha  and Arun Kumar has directed listing of the matter tomorrow.

 Cong in Ramazan plea to push back polls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Youth Congress president Randeep Singh Surjewala speaks on Monday at a three-day training camp for the Assembly elections in Bhopal. (PTI) New Delhi, July 14: If the Congress has its way, the Assembly elections  scheduled for November in five states  might be pushed back to December.Indications are the party might approach the Election Commission with a representation to hold the polls in early December.Since the month of Ramazan begins on October 29, it will be inconvenient for Muslims to participate in the polling process should elections be held in November end, a senior Delhi Congress leader said.We might approach the Election Commission with a request to postpone the elections by a week or 10 days and hold it after the Ramazan month and in early December, he said.Sources in the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee said the Sheila Dikshit government was contemplating how it could get the polls deferred till after Ramazan.

Obviously, we want to fully mobilise our supporters and see that they cast their votes on polling day, a source said.Citing instances, sources expressed confidence that the Election Commission might consider adjusting the dates to ensure polling is not held too close to Ramazan.Freedom sermonThe Congress launched a veiled attack on the BJP in Delhi, asking partymen to draw inspiration from the freedom struggle and free the nation from the clutches of the communal forces trying to divide the nation.Great leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru constructed modern temples (dams) to take the nation ahead.

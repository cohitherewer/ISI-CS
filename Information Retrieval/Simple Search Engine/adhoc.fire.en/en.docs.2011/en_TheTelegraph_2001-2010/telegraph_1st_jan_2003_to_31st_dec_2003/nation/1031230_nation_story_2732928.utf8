		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Israel, Delhi join hands on space
																								Jerusalem, Dec. 29 (PTI): Israeli and Indian space science teams will meet in Delhi in January to prepare a timetable for the launch of an Israeli ultraviolet research telescope aboard Indias GSLV Gsat-4 satellite by September 2005. 																								The development follows last weeks signing of a MoU between the Israel Space Agency and the Indian Space Research Organisation.																								The Israel agency has allocated $4 million for the projects new interface programmes. These will adapt the Tel Aviv University Ultra-Violet Experiments three 20-cm-wide UV telescopes to the GSLV, which will hurl Gsat-4 into space from the Antariksh Bhavan space station.																								Israeli and Indian science and industry teams will fly between Delhi and Tel Aviv to complete the technical adaptations by June 2005, when the 32-kg telescope is scheduled to arrive in India for final tests.																								To date, Israel has invested $14 million in developing its UV telescope to probe the secrets of the universe. Its Israeli manufacturers, Electro Optics Ltd (Elop), claim it is superior to previous-generation X-ray telescopes developed by Israel, Denmark, Italy, the US and France. 																								Isas director Aby Har even said the project was a good example of co-operation between the government and the scientists.																								Collaboration between the Israeli and Indian space agencies began at Israels invitation three years ago after Russia had to cancel a similar astro-physical exploration programme to research on star formations, the history of galaxies and the physics of black holes.																								Data analysed from the telescope will be shared by Israeli and Indian space scientists and make an important contribution to Indian preparations for the later launch of its own galaxy exploration satellite Astrosat carrying an ultraviolet imaging telescope.

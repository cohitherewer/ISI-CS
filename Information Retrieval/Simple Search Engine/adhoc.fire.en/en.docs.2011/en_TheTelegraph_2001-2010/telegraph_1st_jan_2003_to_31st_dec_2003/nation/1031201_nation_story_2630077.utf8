		 Monday, December 01, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Showcause to BJP for flouting code				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Election Commission has issued a showcause to the BJP, asking it to explain within three days why action should not be taken against the party for allegedly distributing pamphlets in tourism ministry bags on Saturday night in the Gole Market constituency.				 																																																										Poonam Azad, the wife of BJP MP Kirti Azad, is pitted against Congress chief minister Sheila Dikshit in Gole Market.				 																																																										The commissions decision followed complaints by the Congress that the BJP was distributing material belonging to the central government and pamphlets containing appeals by tourism minister Jagmohan and Azad seeking votes for Poonam in violation of the model code of conduct. 				 																																																										If the BJP fails to respond to the showcause notice within the time stipulated, the poll panel said, it will be presumed that the party has nothing to say in the matter and the Election Commission will take appropriate action or decision without further reference to the party.				 																																																										The commission said that on inquiry into the complaint, it had found that tourism ministry material was distributed in the constituency.				 																HC notice on passport seizure New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has  ruled that the Debt Recovery Tribunal cannot confiscate  a persons passport and restrain him or her from travelling  abroad.				 																																																										The tribunal has no authority whatsoever to either impound the passport of the petitioner or put any restriction on the travel of the petitioner, Justice R.S. Sodhi said while setting aside an order of the tribunal against one A.S. Mittal.				 																																																										The tribunal had in May 1999 asked Mittal  who was facing debt recovery proceedings at that time  not to leave India without its prior permission as it feared he might siphon off funds and flee the country.				 																																																										Mittal challenged the order on the ground that there was no law empowering the tribunal to curtail the liberties granted under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution and it had no power or authority to detain the petitioner or put any restriction on his travel.				 																																																										The tribunal had claimed that under Section 19(6) of the Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, it had such powers and, further, Section 22 of the act gave wider powers to it than those conferred on courts under the Civil Procedure Code.				 																																																										The court held that the tribunals power under Section 19(6) of the act was limited to making interim orders by way of stay or injunction against the defendants to debar him or her from transferring, disposing of or dealing with any property without the prior permission of the tribunal.

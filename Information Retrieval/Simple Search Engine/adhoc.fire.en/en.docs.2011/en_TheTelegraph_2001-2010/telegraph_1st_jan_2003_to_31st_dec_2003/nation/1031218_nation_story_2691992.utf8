 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sonia																								New Delhi, Dec. 17: Samata Party member Prabhunath Singh invited the Oppositions wrath in the Lok Sabha today as he rose in defence of his party leader George Fernandes.																								The Samata member sought to move a breach of privilege motion against Congress president Sonia Gandhi, CPM leader Somnath Chatterjee and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh for allegedly denying the defence minister his right to speak in the House. 																								As Singh began reading out his notice during zero hour, CPM and RJD leaders rose to their feet and trooped to the well of the House.																								The Opposition protest was as much provoked by Singhs attempt to move the privilege notice as it was because of his past attempts to single out Sonia for attack. 																								The Opposition  mostly Congress leaders  tried to shout down the Samata leader.																								Singh said Fernandes, as a member of the House and duly appointed minister, had every right to speak in the House. By staging walkouts every time the defence minister stood up to speak, the Opposition parties were committing a breach of privilege, he added. 																								However, much of the Samata leaders allegations were drowned in the din. 																								Speaker Manohar Joshi tried to restore some order in the House, but in vain. The Opposition leaders showed no signs of relenting even after the Speaker said the notice was under his consideration. 																								The Opposition parties demanded that Singh take back his charges. Joshi then adjourned the House for an early lunch, half-an-hour before the usual conclusion of proceedings during zero hour. 																								When the House reassembled in the afternoon, Congress chief whip in the House Priya Ranjan Das Munshi raised a procedural objection to Singhs action. 																								As per rules of procedure, Das Munshi said, the members against whom the privilege motion is intended to be moved in the House, should be given an advance notice. Since Singh had not fulfilled the requirement, he could not read out his notice, the Congress leader said. 																								Deputy Speaker P.M. Sayeed, who was in the chair, upheld the contention and Singhs remarks were expunged from the House record.																								The Opposition has been boycotting Fernandes in Parliament since Tehelka exposed corruption in defence deals.																								An end to the impasse is not in sight with a couple of recent initiatives by the Speaker ending unsuccessfully.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Jan. 27: Train services on the Howrah-Patna main section were today disrupted for several hours after a coach of the Kiul-Baidyanath Dham Express derailed near Simutala station in Jamui district this morning, railway sources said.																								There were no major casualties. Some passengers, who had minor injuries, were treated and discharged by railway doctors at Simutala, sources said. 																								Passengers trapped in some coaches were rescued and a relief van was sent from Asansol to the spot. 																								Trains running between Delhi and Howrah were stalled for several hours at a number of unscheduled stations along the main section.																								The accident took place around 8 am after four wheels of the coach developed cracks and jumped tracks on the stretch between Simutala and Ghorparan stations. 																								The train was heading for Baidyanath Dham from Kiul. 																								According to railway officials, a bigger disaster was avoided as the train was running at a reasonably low speed because of fog.

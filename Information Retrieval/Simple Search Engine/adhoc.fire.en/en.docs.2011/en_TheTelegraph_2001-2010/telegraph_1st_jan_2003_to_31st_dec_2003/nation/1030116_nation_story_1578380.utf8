Asking a foreigner his or her skin colour is a clear violation of individual rights, Judge Sota Tanaka told Saitama district court, north of Tokyo, awarding Srirama Chandra B. Murthy damages totalling 500,000 yen ($4,240).				 																																																	Murthy, who works for a software firm, had demanded the real estate company, its employee and Saitama Prefecture pay a total of 1.2 million yen for the distress he suffered. The judge rejected the argument that the prefecture should also be held liable as it is obliged to supervise the agency.				 																																																	urthy phoned the agency, Nikken Juhan, in April 2001 to locate an apartment in Toda city in Saitama Prefecture. According to the Tokyo Shimbun  which reported the ruling handed down on Tuesday  the employee who received the call asked him: What is your skin colour? Is it the normal colour?				 																																																	When Murthy asked what colour was normal, she replied like Japanese, prompting an infuriated Murthy to hang up. Saitama court officials confirmed the amount of the award, but declined to give other details of the ruling.				 																SC order on lip salve for troops				 																																																	 New Delhi (pti): Rejecting the claim that the Lip Salve cream used exclusively by military personnel in high altitude and in extremely cold regions to prevent lips from chapping was a medicament, the Supreme Court has held that it is a product and hence liable to excise duty.				 																																																	Dismissing an appeal by Alpine Products against a decision of the Customs, Excise amp; Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, a bench of Justices m.b. shah and d.m. dharmadhikari ruled that the product Lip Salve is essentially a preparation for protection of lips and skin and is not a medicament.				 																																																	onfirming the earlier decision of the tribunal that the company should pay excise duty on the product Lip Salve, the bench said: We find ourselves in agreement with the majority opinion of the tribunal that the product is a kind of barrier cream or protective cream against skin irritants.				 																																																	The company had claimed that the cream was a medicine to treat sore, inflamed, roughened and cracked lips and that it was manufactured in accordance with the defence services specifications.				 																																																	It had also emphasised that Lip Salve was supplied exclusively to the defence department for personnel posted in high altitude areas and should be classified as a medicament and not merely a skin care preparation.

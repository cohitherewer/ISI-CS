 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 																								Hyderabad, Feb. 1: Chandrababu Naidu has become the countrys first chief minister to receive a warning letter from LTTE boss V. Prabhakaran condemning his governments anti-people policies and the hostile attitude towards Tamils in the border areas of Chittoor and Nellore.																								The hand-written letter in Tamil, signed Prabhakaran with the address South India division, Tamil Nadu, was sent to the Andhra Pradesh chief ministers office. The Tirupati-Tirumala Devasthanams (TTD) joint executive officer, Balasubramanyam, also received a similar communication.																								Prabhakaran, who mentions his designation as LTTE chief, warned that violation of human rights of poor Tamils in the border towns of Nagari, Puttur, Tirupati, Chittoor, Tada, Sulurpet and Gudur would have serious consequences.																								The Chandrababu Naidu government has undertaken a massive programme to uproot the poor from the homes in the name of road widening and cleaning of the city slums in most of the places, the letter with the tiger emblem said.																								The Tamil Tiger chief charged the TTD administration with corruption. He said Balasubramanyam had amassed wealth worth over Rs 50 crore in Chennai and other places and added that he had the complete list of the officers assets and properties as well as his investments in Singapore and Malaysia.																								According to information from Tirupati, Balasubramanyam received a letter criticising his attempts to remove poor Tamils from the Tirumala hillock.																								The government had shifted all the residents of the temple town to Tirupati barring some temple staff and security personnel. Besides pilgrims, no one is allowed to stay in Tirumala for security reasons as per a new legislation.																								This is not the first time that Prabhakaran has written to the Andhra government and Naidu. Early last year, an LTTE leader had urged the government to start a dialogue with the extremist group to resolve issues related to land and contain violence in rural areas.																								The efforts for a dialogue, however, did not fructify but instead boomeranged later with the PWG and the police clashing with each other.																								Following the warning, Naidus security, which is already of the Z-plus category, has been further beefed up. He always used a helicopter to visit the districts. His copter is also equipped with power jammers to block remote sensing equipments and even medium level missiles.																								Naidus office in the secretariat and as well as his residence are already covered by electric jamming equipment. Even his motorcade comprises an Ambassador equipped with high frequency jammer . Naidus security personnel are also shifted frequently to prevent any threat from within. The entire wing on the fourth floor of the secretariats C block is out of bounds for visitors excepting those who have prior appointment.																								Even scribes ( excepting for a selected few) are distanced by the securitymen.																								Naidus security which was earlier slated to be handed over to the CRPF however is now handled by the special task force of the state government carved out for VVIP security in the state. With the ISI and the naxal threat the government provides special security to nearl;y 38 VVIPs and nearly 210 others with a workforce of 550 trained elite force.

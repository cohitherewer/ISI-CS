		 Thursday, December 04, 2003 				 Pak stuck on UN role
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 3: India has come up with more proposals to normalise relations with Pakistan, but it has not stopped Islamabad from getting ready to move a resolution seeking UN forces to monitor the situation along the Line of Control.																								As part of its 12 confidence-building proposals, Delhi had on October 22 suggested setting up communication links between the Indian Coast Guard and Pakistans Maritime Security Agency (MSA) and flag meetings at sea before and after the fishing season.																								Today, Delhi proposed that the director or deputy director of operations at the Indian Coast Guard headquarters establish communication through inter-state-dialling with their counterparts at the MSA with effect from New Years Day.																								A statement issued by the foreign ministry here said the proposed communication link would cover matters related to humanitarian aspects concerning fishermen of both countries who often stray into each others waters and face harassment. The link, the statement added, could also be used to tackles issues arising out of the operational situation faced by the two sides.																								In Islamabad, foreign office spokesman Masood Khan said Pakistan was considering its response to the proposal.																								In another development, Pakistan International Airlines today said it would fly jumbo aircraft to Indian destinations after an expected revival of air links between the two countries in January.																								However, the continuing ceasefire and stress on confidence-building measures have not stopped Pakistan from seeking the intervention of the international community to monitor its peace with India.																								The resolution, which has already been voted in the first committee, will now be taken up at the United Nations General Assembly plenary on December 8.																								If it is passed, it will give Pakistan yet another opportunity to put forward its argument that UN forces should be deployed along the LoC to monitor whether attempts were being made by either India or Pakistan to violate the ceasefire agreement.

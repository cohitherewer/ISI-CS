		 Thursday, October 16, 2003 				 Case against Cadbury
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 15: The state Food and Drugs Administration has started the process to prosecute Cadbury India Limited even as the chocolate major stepped up its damage control operation.																								Even as more reports of Dairy Milk bars sold in a state not fit for consumption came in from different parts of Maharashtra, FDA commissioner Uttam Khobargade said his department would file a criminal case against the company within 20 days.																								Over the past two weeks, the FDA has received reports of the presence of worms in several chocolate bars made by the company. Khobargade said the company has caused damage to the society, but added that the fault was not in the manufacturing process. The fault lies in the packaging, he said.																								The commissioner also said that the Cadbury Phalton unit in Pune could resume production as soon as it complied with the regulatory procedures of the FDA.																								Khobargade denied alleging that there was political pressure on him to act in favour of the chocolate company and said he was not aware of any move to transfer him from the department as a fallout of the high-profile case.

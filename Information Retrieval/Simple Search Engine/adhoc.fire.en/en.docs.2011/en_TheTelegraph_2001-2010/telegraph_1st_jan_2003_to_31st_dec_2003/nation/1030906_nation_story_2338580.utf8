 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Dugapur, Sept. 5: The dawn-to-dusk bandh called by the Trinamul Congress to protest yesterdays police firing which claimed three lives passed off peacefully today.																								Police had opened fire when an agitated mob attacked them after three persons were run over by a speeding truck on National Highway 2.																								The injured, Humayan Seikh (25) and Mir Hossain Khan (27), are battling for life at the subdivisional hospital.																								The deputy inspector-general of police, headquarters, Narayan Ghosh, said that a magisterial inquiry would be conducted into the incident. Since yesterday, 46 people have been arrested in connection with the rioting.																								The bandh today was peaceful, with shops and educational institutions, including schools and colleges, remaining closed.																								Transport, however, was not affected. GT Road was open. Even offices and factories in the area remained open, the police official added.																								Train services remained more or less normal as it was kept out of the bandhs purview.																								Local Trinamul leaders alleged that the firing could have been averted had the police party turned up on time and exercised restraint in dispersing the agitated mob.																								The Congress and the SUCI backed the bandh, saying the people were justified in observing it.																								Both Trinamul and CPM workers blamed each other for the failure of todays bandh. While Biswanath Pandial, councillor of the civic body and secretary of the Burdwan Trinamul Yuva Congress alleged that CPM cadre had compelled shop owners to open their shops, CPM leaders denied the allegation.

A team of Trinamul leaders, headed  by the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Pankaj  Banerjee, will visit the area tomorrow.

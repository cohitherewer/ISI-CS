		 Tuesday, May 20, 2003 				 Another plea against temple dig
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 19: Naved Yar Khan moved the Supreme Court again today with a special leave petition challenging Allahabad High Courts excavation order in Ayodhya.																								Khan had unsuccessfully moved the apex court earlier, challenging the courts directive to the Archaeological Survey of India to excavate the disputed site and determine whether a Ram temple pre-existed the demolished Babri Masjid.																								The apex court registry, where the petition was submitted, is yet to fix a date for sending the same for hearing.																								Dismissing Khans earlier writ seeking a stay on the order, the Supreme Court on March 31 had said that no writ could be made against a high court order and that only a special leave petition could be allowed. 																								It also negated Khans argument that as a Muslim, his fundamental rights were infringed upon with the high courts excavation order.																								The apex court observed that there was no issue of fundamental rights involved in the order.																								This time, Khan has alleged that the excavation order amounted to violation of the Supreme Courts 1994 order, directing status quo at the disputed site.																								The high court had on March 5 ordered the ASI to begin excavation, which is still going on. 																								The report is supposed to be filed before the high court within three months.

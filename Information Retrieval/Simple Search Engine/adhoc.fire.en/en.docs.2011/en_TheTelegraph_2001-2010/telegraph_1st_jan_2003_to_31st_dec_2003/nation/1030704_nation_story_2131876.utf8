		 Friday, July 04, 2003 				 Paswan threat on troop despatch
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 3: Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan today threatened a privilege motion in the monsoon session against any move to send Indian troops to Iraq, saying it was a violation of the resolution adopted by Parliament condemning the US attack. 																								The former Union minister told reporters that according to media reports, the government seems to have made up its mind to send troops. It is a clear violation of (the) Parliament resolution and if troops are sent, I will move a privilege motion.																								Referring to the Best Bakery case in Vadodara, he accused the Gujarat government of ensuring the acquittal of those involved in the post-Godhra rioting that killed 14 people in the city on March 1 last year. 																								(The) Gujarat government is hand-in-glove with the criminals involved in the gruesome incident in Baroda, he alleged. 																								Paswan said the Lok Janshakti Party would launch a Dalit chetna cycle march on Friday from Talhan, in Punjab, to Parliament to protest against the injustice being done to Dalits. 																								He also raised his voice against the treatment meted out to shehnai maestro Ustad Bismillah Khan. The Prime Minister should personally look into the welfare of the ailing Khan, who is the pride of India, he said. 																								As railway minister, he had sanctioned free passes to Khan, but the facility was withdrawn by his successor in the ministry. This was an insult to the genius, he said. 																								Paswan said Khans grandson had sought a gas agency, but the government did not oblige. His party will question the apathy in Parliament if Khans problems are not addressed, he added.

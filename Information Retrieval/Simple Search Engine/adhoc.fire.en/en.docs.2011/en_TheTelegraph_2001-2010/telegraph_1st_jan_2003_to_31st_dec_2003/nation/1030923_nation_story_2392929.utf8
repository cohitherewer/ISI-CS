		 Tuesday, September 23, 2003 				 Mulayam plays MLA godfather
 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, Sept. 22: All these months he bided his time. Now that it has come, Mulayam Singh Yadav cant wait to get even.																								The Uttar Pradesh chief minister wants to settle scores with Mayavatis field officers for slapping the anti-terror law on Independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh  alias Raja Bhaiyya  his family and their supporters and is not willing to wait for the judiciary to act.																								On August 19, the day he was sworn in, the Samajwadi Party chief had ordered withdrawal of the anti-terror charge against the MLA and his father, Raja Uday Pratap Singh, the erstwhile taluqdar of Bhadri.																								The state governments application for withdrawal of the charge is yet to be accepted by the designated anti-terror court in Kanpur and a writ challenging it is pending in the Supreme Court. But, instead of waiting for their verdict, the Mulayam Singh regime has started a CID inquiry into alleged irregularities and atrocities committed by the Pratapgarh administration against the MLA and his family during Mayavatis rule.																								Among those who will be probed are then district magistrate Mohammed Mustafa and district police chief A.S. Ganesh.																								Official sources said a six-member team from the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department, led by additional superintendent of police Dalbir Singh Yadav, met district magistrate R.S. Verma to collect relevant documents. The team would also probe the confiscation of Raja Bhaiyyas ancestral property and acquisition of the Benti Lake, owned by the legislator.																								Sources close to Mulayam Singh indicated that the chief minister will not be satisfied making scapegoats of district-level functionaries. They say the government wants to establish that the anti-terror law was invoked on direct orders from Mayavati.																								The new chief ministers secretariat has already found a discrepancy in dates  on which the anti-terror notification was issued and from which the law was invoked by the district magistrate.																								Now that the Supreme Court has issued notice to the state government after admitting a petition against the revocation of the anti-terror law against Raja Bhaiyya and his supporters, the government intends convincing the court that the order invoking the law was not only illegal but amounted to malicious prosecution, a senior official said.																								The government has appointed a three-member committee of senior bureaucrats to review all anti-terror cases and those filed under the Gangster Act, the National Security Act and the Goonda Act by Mayavati against her political adversaries. 																								But, sources said, Mulayam Singh wants to make an example of those involved in putting Independent MLAs Raja Bhaiyya and Dhananjay Singh behind bars.

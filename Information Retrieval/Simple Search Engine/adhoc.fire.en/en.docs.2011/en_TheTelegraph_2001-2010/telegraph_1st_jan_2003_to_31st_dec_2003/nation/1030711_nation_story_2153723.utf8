		 Friday, July 11, 2003 				 Law only solution, Sangh tells seer
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, July 10: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has told the Kanchi Sankaracharya that with his efforts to find a negotiated settlement on Ayodhya having failed, legislation appears to be the only way out.																								After a two-day RSS-BJP coordination meeting in Chennai, Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav said they had told the seer that we (RSS) are satisfied with the wholehearted efforts he undertook this time. But it was unfortunate that the All India Muslim Personal Law Boards response was negative.																								The ruling BJP might not have the numbers in Parliament to enact a law on Ayodhya but after a point all parties might come round to a legislative solution, Madhav said over phone from Bangalore, having left the meeting early.																								The spokesperson said the Sanghs discussions with BJP leaders here since yesterday focused basically on organisational issues.																								Chennai was a convenient venue as the Sangh leaders were on their way back from their recent national executive meeting at Kanyakumari, the spokesperson said. 																								But he confirmed having met Swami Jayendra Saraswati at Kancheepuram on Tuesday. The purpose was to explain the Sangh resolution on Ayodhya adopted at Kanyakumari.																								The BJP leaders who attended the coordination committee meeting included M. Venkaiah Naidu and Pramod Mahajan.																								Hailing the Sankaracharyas formula for offering a beautiful opportunity to start a dialogue, Madhav indicated that the Sangh agreed with the broad thrust of the Kanchi seers proposals. 																								However, he said it did not agree with the idea of the disputed land being gifted to the Hindus. At the same time, the RSS did not want to debunk the seers proposals. 																								The board should have seen the formula as the basis of a dialogue, Madhav said. By spurning it, they were creating problems for themselves.

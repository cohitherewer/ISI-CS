Cheating clean chit for Govinda Indore (PTI): A district court has discharged  Bollywood actor Govinda from a cheating case filed against  him, a firm called Ad Labs and another person by a local  financier.				 																																																										Additional district judge Manohar Mamtani discharged the actor from the case on August 30, Govindas advocate Dipesh Joshi said on Monday.

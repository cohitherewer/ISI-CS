 M.R. VENKATESH  Madurai, Dec. 17: Thirteen  years ago, 42 students of Madurai Law College got into a  row over a students strike and were chargesheeted for assaulting  a policeman. As the case dragged on, the students did not  appear in court, leading to arrest warrants being issued  against them in 1995. 																								The warrants were buried under the sands of time while the young lawyers went on to serve the same judicial system  some with distinction  that they had compromised. 																								Now, the legal fraternity in the state is in a tizzy as the dark past has been dug out  a jinxed 13 years later  and local newspapers have splashed the names of the 42 offenders. 																								Though the judicial circles have engaged in a nasty bout of I Spy, nobody is willing to take names. According to sources, 10 of the 42 are practising advocates in Madurai itself. Six others have gone on to become magistrates while another four are serving as additional public prosecutors in different courts in Tamil Nadu. 																								In November 1990, the 42 law students had entered into an argument with two youths who were putting up posters critical of a students strike earlier, well-informed sources said. A police constable, Rajendran, passing by on his two-wheeler, stopped to enquire what was going on. 																								The situation soon turned ugly as the students, forming themselves into an unlawful assembly, allegedly assaulted the constable and the other two. Rajendrans two-wheeler was also damaged. The three were forced into the law college campus, illegally confined and beaten up until police rescued them. 																								The charges against them range from unlawful assembly and damage to property to kidnapping and assaulting a public official. 																								All the accused were arrested, but later released on bail. Chargesheets were served on them in 1991 and the case began in a local magistrate court here. It moved in spurts between adjournments for three years after which none of the accused turned up in court, the sources said. Apparently, by then they had graduated from college. 																								Arrest warrants were issued against them in 1995 and have been pending as they have not cared to appear in court. As lawyers, though, they ought to know the law and its procedures, the sources said. 																								The unseemly development of professional lawyers and judicial officers facing criminal charges has engaged the attention of the highest levels of the state judiciary and administration. 																								Officials are being pulled up for such unheard of delay in executing arrest warrants, even eight years after they were issued. The police had written to the Madurai Bar Association about their dilemma, but had not received any help, the sources said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 23: The Centre has asked cable operators to make distribution of set-top boxes easier by offering them on attractive terms and making them available on rent, and has cautioned against forced sale.																								Set-top boxes, which decode pay channel signals beamed by broadcasters through cable operators, are needed to view the channels under the conditional access system (CAS).																								In an office memorandum to representatives of multi- system operators today, the information and broadcasting ministry said some MSOs and cable operators are not providing consumers with adequate choice in the matter of acquisition of set-top boxes. It is hereby reiterated that every consumer must be given a choice of either purchasing a set-top box outright or acquiring it through rental scheme which would entitle him to a refund should he not wish to use the set-top box for any reason. Absence of such a choice would adversely affect the implementation of CAS.																								Ministry officials who met cable operators representatives said refunds for set-top boxes should be made as per the demand of cable subscribers. Operators have been telling viewers that boxes would be accepted back only if there is a transfer of residence. 																								Cable operators and MSOs have threatened to switch of signals of pay channels from January 1 unless CAS was implemented.																								Prasad, who had a meeting with Delhi chief minister Shiela Dikshit on its implementation also said broadcasters, operators and MSOs were being urged to settle differences on pricing. We would expect all stakeholders to settle any corporate rivalry.... Failure to address these issues adequately would certainly jeopardise the implementation of CAS. 																								Dikshit said the Delhi government would set up a consumer court dedicated to settling cable television-related disputes. 																								Prasad, whose ministry had been forced to shelve the implementation of CAS after mandating it in Chennai, Mumbai, Calcutta and Delhi, has now set out to make a test case of CAS in south Delhi. This has been the demand of Bal Thackeray from Mumbai and even the state governments in Bengal and Tamil Nadu (though CAS has had a partial rollout in Chennai) which went slow on the set-top box regime because it had been put off in Delhi.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Siddhant with his uncle after he returned home. (PTI)																								Patna, Aug. 12: Siddhant Parmar, the eight-year-old schoolboy snatched by motorcycle-borne men more than a fortnight ago, walked back home this afternoon, safe but depressed. 																								Dishevelled and wearing a torn checked shirt, Siddhant, nephew of sugarcane minister Raghavendra Prasad Singh, looked withdrawn and confused as he embraced his parents, setting off a wave of emotions in his family. He stood at the entrance of the family house with a vacant look difficult to recognise, said one of his relatives. 																								As his parents sobbed holding him in a tight embrace, the boy also broke into tears. I dont want to go to school anymore, kept repeating the once-sprightly boy, a student of Class II in a public school in the city. 																								On the morning of July 24, he was kidnapped while waiting for his school bus on Baily Road. Three motorcycle-borne men pushed his grandfather K.P. Singh to the ground and sped off with him. He remained in the clutches of his abductors since as Bihar politics went into a spin over the spate of abductions. 																								I am relieved he has come back home, said Siddhants uncle. The police would do the rest of the job by arresting the persons involved in this case, added Raghavendra Prasad. 																								It is not clear how the boy reached home and whether his family paid any ransom. Some in his neighbourhood said he was dropped near his house by a scooterist, while others said a rickshaw brought him home. Siddhant said he was blindfolded by some men and brought to Baily Road. From there he took a rickshaw home. 																								As news spread, police arrived. The boy told them that he was held in an urban area, indicating that he could have been kept in Patna itself. Though the family was tightlipped, word was going around that a hefty ransom had been paid.																								Inspector-general of police A.C. Verma said his officers were closing in on the gang. We were about to recover the boy and we were putting pressure on them. The gang might have decided to release the boy due to the police pressure, he said.

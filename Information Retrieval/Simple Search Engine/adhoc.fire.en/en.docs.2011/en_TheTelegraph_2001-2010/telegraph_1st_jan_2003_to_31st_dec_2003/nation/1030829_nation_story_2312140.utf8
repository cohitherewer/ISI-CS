		 Friday, August 29, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Storm brings back cyclone memory Paradip(PTI): At least 24 fishermen were  missing in the Bay of Bengal after a high-velocity storm  lashed the Orissa coast causing a vessel to crash against  a jetty at the port here on Wednesday night, official sources  said.				 																																																										Four boats had gone into the sea for fishing, said the tehsildar of Kujang, Nrushingha Charan Swain. Six fishermen managed to reach the coast on Thursday, he said.				 																																																										The gale speed was 180 kmph and it was accompanied by heavy rains through the night on Wednesday, bringing back memories of the devastating super cyclone in 1999, sources said.				 																																																										Weather office sources in Bhubaneswar said the depression formed over the northwest bay off Bengal and north Orissa crossed the coast near Chandbali on Thursday morning and had weakened into a low pressure area.				 																																																										Official reports said six other mini fishing trawlers had hit the coast near Barunei, about six km from here on the other side of the Mahanadi river, while four large trawlers capsized inside the harbour.				 																																																										The port city experienced 12 cm of rainfall on Thursday and the storm brought life to a standstill.				 																																																										Port sources said MV Mursidabad, which had berthed to carry iron ore to China, snapped the rope that tied it to the jetty and crashed against a crane on an adjacent jetty. While the crane was damaged, it tore a gaping hole in the ships cabin.				 																																																										Two other ships also broke their ropes, but were not damaged as they were properly anchored.				 																Bofors argues against trial New Delhi (PTI): Swedish arms manufacturer  AB Bofors that supplied 155 mm Howitzer guns to India claimed  before Delhi High Court on Thursday that it cannot be prosecuted  for criminal conspiracy and cheating as a body corporate  does not have a mind of its own.				 																																																										To commit the offences of criminal conspiracy and cheating, you have to have a mind of your own. A body corporate is only a juristic person which does not have a mind, Bofors counsel Alok Sengupta told Justice J.D. Kapoor. How can a company be prosecuted for conspiracy? he asked.				 																																																										Bofors has challenged the November 2002 order of special judge Prem Kumar framing charges against it in the Rs 64-crore Bofors pay-off case. Sengupta submitted that the company could not be held liable for the acts of Martin Ardbo, the then chief executive of the company.				 																																																										In its chargesheet filed in October 1999, the CBI accused Bofors of engaging middlemen to secure the Rs 1,437-crore deal for the supply of 400 Howitzer guns in violation of the terms and conditions of the contract signed in March 1986.

Dagas counsel contended that the home secretary had not complied with the 2002 order that directed him to release the Swatantra Sainik Samman pension to the petitioner with effect from January 28, 2002, with a 12 per cent interest.

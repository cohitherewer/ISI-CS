		 Tuesday, July 29, 2003 				 Bottle stab at wife over abortion
 DEBABRATA MOHANTY Bhubaneswar, July 28: The  son of a former Orissa legislator is said to have stabbed  his wife on Saturday and left her for dead on the railway  tracks near Bhubaneswar station.																								Residents found Runu Jena, 25, of Nimina village in Ganjam district, in a pool of blood at the Lingaraj passenger halt on Sunday, several hours after she had been dumped there.																								Runu is now fighting for life at the Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. Doctors said incessant bleeding had made her condition critical.																								Her husband (Rama Pradhan) had almost killed her when he stabbed her with a broken beer bottle, said S.A. Karim, officer-in-charge, Government Railway Police, who is investigating the case. Its a sheer miracle she escaped.																								Karim, who recorded Runus statement, said her husband brought her to Bhubaneswar on Saturday to abort her six-month-old foetus.																								The couple, who had a love marriage, had apparently fought many times over the abortion as Rama did not want a child. 																								On Saturday, Rama and Runu visited several local temples, including the famous Lingaraj temple, before heading for a nursing home. When Rama persuaded Runu to undergo abortion, she refused. Later that night, Rama took his wife to the Lingaraj railway halt after he had a bottle of beer.																								There, he is said to have stabbed Runu in the neck and stomach with the broken beer bottle. Then he threw her on the railway tracks thinking her to be dead, police sources said.																								Runu, her oesophagus ruptured, managed to roll off the tracks when she regained her senses. When the residents called Airfield police, they refused to step in, saying the incident was not within their jurisdiction.																								Namrata Chaddha, a member of the state womens commission, intervened and got Runu admitted to the Capital Hospital here. 																								After doctors there allegedly refused to treat the critical case, she was shifted to the Cuttack hospital. A case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) has been lodged against Runus husband. Railway police officials said the accused would be caught within a month.																								We have got in touch with Ganjam police and will soon send his (Ramas) pictures to Surat police as most of the fugitives from Ganjam land up in Surat, Karim said.

		 Saturday, November 29, 2003 				 Naxalites appeal to Ulfa
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Nov. 28: The Maoist Communist Centre and the Peoples War have appealed to the United Liberation Front of Asom to stop killing migrant Biharis and identify the real enemy.																								The Centres anti-national mindset and the policy of repression of nationalist movements is the real cause for the present attack, asserted a press release jointly issued by the two organisations. The Bihari migrants in Assam are victims of the ruling class and the present attack on them is strengthening the hands of the oppressor.																								The two banned groups said they had been supporting the cause of self-rule for people of Assam as the Ulfa had not taken a communal stand. But the Ulfa now has to be careful not to divide the proletariat by succumbing to the politics of regionalism, they said.																								The MCC and Peoples War held the Shiv Sena and supporters of MP Pappu Yadav responsible for the violence in Bihar against people from Assam.																								The real problem is unemployment, which is a result of the imperialist, feudal and bureaucratic present regime, said the release. Private economy and the open market are anti-people, it added.																								The Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) has echoed these sentiments, saying the BJP and the Congress have played up the regional interests at the cost of the people of Bihar and Assam.

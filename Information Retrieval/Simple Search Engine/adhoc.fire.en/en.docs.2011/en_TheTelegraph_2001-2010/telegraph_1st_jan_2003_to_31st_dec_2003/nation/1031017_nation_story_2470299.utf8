		 Friday, October 17, 2003 				 13-yr-old raped 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Ahmedabad, Oct. 16: Even  as Delhi grappled with two outrageous rape incidents within  a week, another shocking violation of a girl was reported  from Gujarats cultural capital, Vadodara. 																								Taking advantage of a 13-year-old students distress, the boys who offered help raped her. The five accused have been arrested. 																								Around 6 yesterday evening, the girl, a Class VII student of Bright School, went to upmarket Karelibaug to buy medicines for her ailing father. 																								When she did not get the prescribed medicines in two chemist shops, two boys, Mustaq and Javed, offered to get the drugs from Fatehganj, 6 km away from her residence. Sitting in one of the chemist shops, they had clearly noticed her desperation. 																								In Fatehganj, the boys took the girl to Javeds home, where Malar Patel and Devang Mehta, two of their friends, joined them. Later, they went to Devangs friend Clintons vacant flat in Subhapura. Barring Clinton, the four allegedly raped the girl. 																								More than an hour past midnight, as Mustaq was dumping the girl near the fuel station in Fatehganj, anxious family members of the girl, who were scouring the city, spotted them. Pointing to Mustaq, who was trying to escape, she told them what had happened. They grabbed the boy, who was arrested by a police team that arrived soon. After interrogation, the four others were also held.

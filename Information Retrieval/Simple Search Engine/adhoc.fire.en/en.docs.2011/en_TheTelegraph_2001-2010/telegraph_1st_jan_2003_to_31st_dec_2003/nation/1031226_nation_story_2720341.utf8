 YOGESH VAJPEYI Lucknow, Dec. 25: The likely  return of the prodigal son that started with one birthday  may end with another, Kalyan Singhs 70th on January 5.																								While Kalyan and his former party, the BJP, sought to play down the political significance of his meeting with Atal Bihari Vajpayee here yesterday, neither camps denied the possibility of his return to the BJP.																								Sources said if all went well, the process that started with Vajpayees 79th birthday-eve celebrations yesterday would be completed on January 5. Kalyan has called a meeting of his Rashtriya Kranti Party the day before to discuss the current Uttar Pradesh situation and the partys future.																								Kalyan today did a balancing act by saying his party continued to support the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led coalition but his relationship with the BJP had improved. Jo aam teen saal pehle kachcha tha, woh ab pak kar meetha ho gaya hai (The raw mango of three years ago has now ripened and become sweet).																								Though his stance indicated he was not averse to embracing his former party, he appeared to have reservations about the reaction of senior state BJP leaders who had played a key role in hounding him out in 1999. Such a process takes time to complete, he said, referring to the likely return.																								One of his perceived BJP opponents, Rajnath Singh, however, welcomed Kalyans presence at the party. It sent soothing internal signals to our mind, he said. A senior state BJP leader hinted that a plum party post would be assured for Kalyan.																								Before leaving yesterdays tea party for the airport, Vajpayee had said: Accha Kalyan, phir milenge (Okay Kalyan, we will meet again). His prompt reply was suggestive: Aap jab kahenge, hazir ho jaoonga (I will come whenever you call).																								Kalyan, who was expelled from the BJP in 1999, said his annoyance with Vajpayee was over. I had pointed only one finger against him in the past, but yesterday I offered him sweets with five fingers, he said.																								His ally, chief minister Mulayam Singh, was so angry yesterday after hearing the news on reaching the Lucknow airport that he deputed cabinet colleague Reoti Raman Singh to see the Prime Minister off.																								He drove straight to Kalyans Mall Avenue home to seek a clarification and was unavailable to the media today. None of his party leaders was willing to comment, beyond saying: The Samajwadi Party is strong enough to contest the Lok Sabha polls on its own.

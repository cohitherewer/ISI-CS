		 Wednesday, November 19, 2003 				 Judeo to join Modi in star line-up Atal amp; deputy root for minister
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA AND AGENCIES				 	 Vajpayee in New Delhi. (AFP file picture) Bikaner/Raipur, Nov. 18:  Refusing to cower in the glare of the cash-on-disc scandal,  the BJP Big Two went on the front foot today with the Prime  Minister going after Congress Ajit Jogi and his deputy  lending his lung power to Dilip Singh Judeo. 																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee sought to deflect the heat on Judeo  the BJP minister quit after being caught on camera allegedly accepting a bribe  by saying the Chhattisgarh chief minister should similarly step down as he was embroiled in a forgery case. Else, there was just no way Sonia Gandhi could push for Judeos prosecution.																								Coming down strongly on the Congress double standards at an election rally in Bikaner, Vajpayee said there could not be two sets of rules for the same type of offence. If Judeo had gone, then Jogi  alleged to have forged documents to counter the Intelligence Bureaus charges against him  would have to go, too, he said.																								Jo niyam Judeo par laagu ho, woh Chhattisgarh ke mukhya mantri par laagu kyon nahin ho (Why should the rules which apply to Judeo not hold good for Jogi)? Vajpayee asked.																								At a rally in Raipur around the same time, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani propped up the fallen minister, declaring he would be the BJPs star campaigner. Giving the scandal a new twist, he said the CBI should not only probe the charges against Judeo, it should also check out if the whole thing was a sting operation.																								I hope the CBI will not only probe whether Judeo is guilty or not but would also investigate how this operation happened whether this was a sting operation or a simple fact, he said. 																								In Bikaner, Vajpayee continued his tirade against Jogi. There is a chargesheet against Jogi. He should not only resign but the case against him should go on. Why should the policy be different in Jogis case? This is a question I ask Sonia Gandhi.																								He said Jogi should take a lesson from Judeo. In the wake of allegations, Judeo has resigned saying he would not resume office till proved innocent, he said. But there were no signs the chief minister would do any such thing.																								Advani, too, culled out more positives from the disc dirt. He said far from Judeos resignation proving a minus for the BJP, it was sure to win voter sympathy. The way he has reacted, he will gain peoples sympathy and support.																								Explaining why the BJP wanted Judeo as its star campaigner, Advani said the partys response to such allegations had always been straightforward. He, himself, had campaigned when he was in the eye of the hawala storm. We do not want to hide anything in public life. Be it hawala scandal or anything else. Pitch for TV debate 																								At a rally in Raipur, Advani tonight suggested a debate on television between Vajpayee and Sonia instead of the BJP and the Congress holding separate public meetings in the run-up to elections.

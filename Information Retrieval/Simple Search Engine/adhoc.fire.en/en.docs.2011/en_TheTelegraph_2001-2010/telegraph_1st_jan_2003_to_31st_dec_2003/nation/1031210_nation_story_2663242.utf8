The order was given by a bench of Justices S.. Variava and H.K. Sema while partly allowing the appeal of various hawkers associations. However, the bench directed that the hawkers would be permitted to carry on their business only on the streets to be notified by the municipal authority.				 																																																										The bench also stipulated that hawking activities would not be carried out within 150 metres of railway stations and market places. It also imposed the condition that no hawking would be allowed within 100 metres of educational institutions and religious places.				 																																																										In their appeal before the apex court, the associations had sought hawking rights on 480 streets saying the high court order had severely curtailed the fundamental right to carry on business guaranteed under Article 19(G) of the Constitution.				 																																																										This order would benefit over 36,000 hawkers, petitioners counsel Sushil Kumar Jain said. 				 																Court reserves syllabus ruling New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday  reserved its verdict on introducing environmental studies  as a compulsory subject in all schools, colleges and universities,  reports our legal correspondent. 				 																																																										A division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and B.P. Singh, which reserved its judgment, also took on record an apology filed by the chief secretary of Tamil Nadu who was earlier issued court notices for not filing a compliance report in the matter.

When the Tamil Nadu case was taken up, it was found that the state had not filed a reply. 				 																																																										The state said on Tuesday that it had taken measures and introduced the subject from class one onwards till the university level and all professional colleges under the state too had environment studies as a subject.

 Amar Singh alleges death plot
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Amar Singh New Delhi, April 14: Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh today alleged a political conspiracy between the NDA government at the Centre and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati to finish off his party.Singh said the Samajwadi will intensify its agitation against the state government and expose the Centre-state connivance. Singh said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani were behind the conspiracy. This is happening at the instance of the Prime Minister and the deputy Prime Minister and Mayavati is being used as a mohra (pawn), the Samajwadi leader alleged. The conspiracy has been hatched during the recent meetings Mayavati has had with Vajpayee and Advani here, he alleged.Going hammer and tongs at Mayavati, Singh said the Bahujan Samaj Partys pardafash rally in Lucknow today did not expose anything. Singh said neither he nor Samajwadi leader Mulayam Singh Yadav was scared of Mayavatis threats and they would face her politically, adding that he was waiting for the Ghaziabad police to knock at his doors and raid any time. The Samajwadi leader alleged that Mayavati has asked some criminals released from an Aligarh jail to kill him, Mulayam Singh Yadavs son Akhilesh Singh and Shivpal Singh, the partys Uttar Pradesh general secretary. I have given the list of those criminals to the government. I have written to deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, he said. Singh said the party will launch a cycle rally on April 19 at the block and district levels in the state to politically counter her. The cycle yatra will conclude with a huge rally at Lucknow on May 12, he said.The Samajwadi general secretary regretted the Congress refusal to co-operate in dislodging the BSP-BJP government, but said he would again talk to it to broaden the agitation against the Mayavati government. Singh also came down on the BJP top brass and the Centre for propping up the Mayavati government. He alleged that she was acting at the behest of Vajpayee and Advani. Without the Centres blessings it (filing cases against Samajwadi leaders) is not possible, he said.Singh lambasted the BSP chief for unleashing a reign of terror on Samajwadi members and thanked her for the publicity she gave the party. The entire rally was devoted to abusing me and Mulayam Singh Yadav. She has become our propaganda secretary. I am grateful to her. The Samajwadi leader challenged her to disprove the veracity of the videotapes, in which she allegedly told party legislators to contribute a portion of their constituency development fund to the party. He said he would quit politics if it was proved that the tape was doctored, as alleged by the BSP leader. Let her show evidence that I doctored the tapes, he said and sought a CBI probe into the matter.Singh said Tarun Tejpals Tehelka exposed former BJP president Bangaru Laxman and defence scams, following which Laxman was forced to quit the post and George Fernandes also had to quit as defence minister. What is good for Peter (Bangaru and Fernandes) is good for Paul (Mayavati), he said.  Copyright

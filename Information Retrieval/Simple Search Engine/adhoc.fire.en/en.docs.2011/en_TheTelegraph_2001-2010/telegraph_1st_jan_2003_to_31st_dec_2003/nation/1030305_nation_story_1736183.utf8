		 Wednesday, March 05, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Cricketer Krishna raises VHP hackles				 																																																	 Jaipur (PTI): Cricket fever might have gripped the country but it seems the VHP has been left untouched by the euphoria. The saffron outfit objected to a tableau depicting Krishna playing cricket with his friends on display at a temple here.				 																																																	Peoples faith should not be made an object of entertainment, VHPs media in-charge Mahaveer Pareek said referring to the tableau which was displayed at Govind Deojis temple on Sunday after Indias win against Pakistan in the World Cup.				 																																																	While the devotees enjoyed the painting of Krishna, part of the tableau put up daily to celebrate the month of Phalgun, the VHP and the Bajrang Dal leaders were not amused.				 																																																	It made God an object of joke, state convener of the Bajrang Dal Mahendra Meena said.				 																																																	Describing the tableau as a western idea, vice-president of Devalaya Samrankshan Samiti, Purushottam Bharti, said they should be put up only in accordance with the shashtras. 				 																																																	Secretary of Dadu Sant Samaj Hanuman Swami and mahant of Ratnamala Ashram Jagdish Sharma also objected to the tableau and warned against making a tamasha of God.				 																																																	The tableaux are changed everyday and the painting was replaced on Monday with one showing Krishna overpowering Kalia nag. 				 																Classes stalled in abuse protest				 																																																	 Chennai: Over 40,000 college students across the state boycotted classes on Tuesday, demanding an independent probe in the alleged sexual abuse of four students of Palani Andavar College for Women at Palani in Dindigul district, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The college authorities allegedly forced the final-year undergraduates to go with some of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council committee members who were at Palani in October for an appraisal of the college.

The Students Federation of India has taken up the fight for the girl victims and the Tamil Nadu CPM has expressed its solidarity with the agitating students.				 																																																	The council committee had visited the college on October 16 and 17, as also a few other institutions in the state, to review academic programmes.				 																Hounded Sikh to sue NY cops				 																																																	 New York (PTI): An Indian-American Amric Singh Rathour plans to file a lawsuit against the New York police department for allegedly discriminating against him for wearing a beard and a turban which are required by the Sikh religion.				 																																																	Rathour, who had qualified for the job of traffic enforcement agent with the department, was dismissed two months after he became an officer because his supervisors did not want him to wear a beard and a turban.				 																																																	The police department had no comment on the case and said it would react only after receiving the law suit and the grounds on which it is filed.				 																																																	Rathours attorney Ravinder Bhalla said he plans to file the suit in a district court in Manhattan against police department commissioner Ray Kelly and the city for violation of his civil rights. Earlier, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had filed his complaint.

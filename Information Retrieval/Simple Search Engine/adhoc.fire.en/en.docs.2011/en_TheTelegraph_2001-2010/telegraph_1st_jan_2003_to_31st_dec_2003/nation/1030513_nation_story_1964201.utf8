Indian trapped in SARS hospital Beijing (PTI): An Indian, who was admitted to a hospital here after showing SARS-like symptoms, is stuck in the isolation ward though doctors have diagnosed that he has not contracted the disease.The patient, who was admitted to the hospital on April 23 with high fever, one of the symptoms, had arrived last month from India after spending some time in Hong Kong.After treating him as a suspected case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, doctors at Peking Union Medical College diagnosed that he was suffering from typhoid fever, a rare bacterial infection not found in China.However, since he was admitted to the medical college, a SARS-designated hospital for foreigners, he cannot be shifted to a regular hospital. Though I dont have SARS, I am stuck in the isolation ward which is designated for SARS patients, the Indian, who did not want to be identified, said over phone.Since my family in India would be horrified to know that I am stuck in a SARS-designated hospital, I dont want to be named, the man said.Xinhua news agency on Sunday night had said the Indian patient would be transferred to another hospital soon. However, a doctor at the medical college denied that the Indian would be transferred to another hospital in Beijing. The (Indian) patient is recovering now. He could be discharged in eight days, the doctor said. The Indian also said the doctors had told him that there is no move to transfer him to another hospital as it was risky.Fine for frivolous petitionNew Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has dismissed a frivolous petition filed by a lawyer and fined him Rs 50,000 for wasting its time.A division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice A.K. Sikri refused to reduce the amount. If you are aggrieved, the bench told advocate S.S. Tiwari, you can go to a higher forum.Tiwari had sought a stay on proceedings for recovery of loans given by the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency to Sheetal Fuel Pvt. Ltd and BS Fuel Pvt. Ltd. Tiwari alleged that a fraud had been committed by the agencys officials in collusion with the two companies.The agency, a wing of the Union ministry of non-conventional energy sources, had given about Rs 52.57 lakh to Sheetal Limited for running certain projects. The debt recovery tribunal passed a decree in favour of the agency after the companies defaulted in repaying the loan.The companies defaulted again when a one-time settlement was reached to refund the money.It is very clear that the intention of the petitioner is to stall the proceedings and see that the recovery is not made. Therefore, the PIL is not a genuine one, the bench observed.Woman dies on Kochi flightKochi (PTI): A 72-year-old woman, travelling by a Jet Airways flight from Chennai, died of cardiac arrest soon after the flight took off on Monday.

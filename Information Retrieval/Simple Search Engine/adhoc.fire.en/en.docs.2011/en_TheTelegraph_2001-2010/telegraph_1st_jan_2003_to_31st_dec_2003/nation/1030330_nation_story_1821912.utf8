 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bhopal, March 29: Two French tourists in Bandhavgarh National Park had a miraculous escape today, after being attacked by a tiger, because of the presence of mind of Raj, a hotelier-turned-wildlife enthusiast.																								Six vehicles were moving in a convoy in the park when the tiger suddenly attacked the French nationals, according to principal chief conservator of forests A.P. Trivedi. Raj, who was alerted by the sounds of the birds and monkeys, rushed to the spot and distracted the tiger by attacking it with a bamboo stick. Local villagers then joined in and forced the tiger away.																								Raj and the French tourists  Haden Court, 60, and Pizpaud, 52  were admitted to a hospital in Umaria with cuts and bruises. Raj was given 17 stitches and later discharged. The tourists were also discharged after a few hours with stitches.																								Wildlife experts said it is unusual for a tiger in a national park to attack visitors and the animal would be kept under watch.

		 Thursday, October 16, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Court reserves Jaya verdict New Delhi: The Supreme Court has reserved  judgment on a batch of petitions seeking to transfer trial  against Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa outside the  state in a disproportionate assets case, reports our legal  correspondent.				 																																																										A division bench of Justices S.. Variava and H.K. Sema reserved the verdict after completion of arguments on behalf of DMK general secretary and leader of Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly K. Anbazhagan, Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy and also for Jayalalithaa and the other accused in the case.				 																																																										The DMK leader has alleged that continuing the trial in the state would result in gross miscarriage of justice. As many as 64 witnesses had turned hostile in the case, he added.				 																																																										About witnesses turning hostile and the lack of efficiency of prosecutors, additional solicitor-general Altaf Ahmed told the court that public prosecutors could be changed if the apex court expressed doubts about their efficiency.				 																																																										Witnesses in Jayalalithaas trial had changed their stand and contradicted statements recorded before the trial judge. The Supreme Court expressed concern over witnesses resiling from their statements and that too made before the trial judge.				 																																																										The accusation is that Jayalalithaa, her friend . Sasikala, Jayalalithaas hitherto-disowned adopted son V.. Sudhakaran, Sasikalas niece Ilavarasi and her nephew T.T.V. Dhinakaran, now an MP, have accumulated wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income. A special court has been established in Chennai to try these offences.				 																No correction in date of birth Allahabad (PTI): Allahabad High Court  has ruled that the date of birth of an employee cannot be  corrected once it is entered in the service book on voluntary  disclosure by the employee concerned.				 																																																										Justice R.M. Mishra passed the order on Tuesday on a writ petition filed by a retired state government employee, Surendra Kumar Tiwari, a resident of Azamgarh district.				 																																																										Tiwari had moved court challenging an order of the Azamgarh additional district magistrate rejecting his plea for correcting his date of birth in his service book.				 																																																										Dismissing the petition, the court said the date of birth of an employee, once entered in the service book, cannot be corrected later as the employee himself had made a disclosure of his date of birth, which shall be taken as correct.				 																Fare subsidy for Haj pilgrims New Delhi (PTI): The Centre has fixed  a subsidised air fare of Rs 12,000 per person for the Haj  pilgrims.				 																																																										The Haj Committee of India has said in a release that the pilgrims could deposit the fare in form of bank draft drawn in favour of Haj Committee India, Mumbai, along with an affidavit that they are not income-tax payees and have not performed Haj through the committee earlier and availed the subsidy. The last date for the submission is November 15.				 																Dara plea rejected				 																																																	Bhubaneswar: Orissa High Court on Wednesday rejected an application from Dara Singh, the death-row convict in Graham Staines case, seeking parole to perform his fathers last rites, reports our correspondent. Daras father, Mihilal, died in a road mishap on October 1.				 																Mirwaiz reprieve New Delhi (PTI): Ten months after suspending  former Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooqs passport  for alleged anti-India activities, the Centre on Wednesday  released his travel documents for 10 days to facilitate  his attendance at an international conference on Islamic  laws in South Africa. The Mirwaiz recently sent a copy of  the invitation along with an application for releasing the  documents to the Centre. 				 																TV in remote areas New Delhi (PTI): The Centre has cleared  a Rs 500-crore project for television coverage in remote  areas. The expansion will be carried out using the cheaper  Ku-band, instead of the usual C-band. The 20 Doordarshan  and 10 private channels, which are available on the free-to-air  mode, will be telecast through this project. A person needs  a set-top box and a dish antennae costing Rs 6,000 to view  the 30 channels, an official spokesperson said.				 																Dawood aide bail Mumbai (PTI): A special court has modified  the bail conditions of a municipal engineer, Narendra Rajbhar,  arrested for allegedly helping Dawood Ibrahims crime syndicate  to develop shopping plazas here. The conditions were modified  as the accused could not arrange for sureties and continued  to languish in prison despite obtaining bail.																		To gauge the alertness of its employees, the Southern Railways conducted a mock drill of a derailment near Palur station in Kancheepuram on Wednesday. The secrecy of the drill was well-maintained and only a handful of people were aware of it.

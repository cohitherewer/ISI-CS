		 Friday, March 14, 2003 				 Gujarat blames it on Pak
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, March 13: Gujarat home minister Amit Shah today said the Godhra train carnage and the terrorist attack on Akshardham temple were sponsored by Pakistan and claimed that police had unearthed a deep-rooted Pak conspiracy to foment communal disturbances in the state. 																								Replying to a debate on his departments budgetary demand, Shah said both incidents were results of Pak-sponsored conspiracy. The government had evidence to prove it and would soon reveal the facts to inform the public, he added. 																								The home minister said Pakistan sponsored the post-Godhra riots, too, and the strike on Akshardham to fan communal disharmony and described the neighbours attempts as covert terrorism, which included pushing in fake currency notes, drugs and arms and ammunition. 																								Shah said the government had asked the Anti-Terrorist Squad and CID to directly deal with fake currency notes and narcotics smuggling because they are an extension of terrorism. 																								Stating that Gujarat is a litmus test for its proxy war against India, the home minister claimed that several religious organisations in Gujarat were fanning communal tension, but did not take names. 																								He, however, claimed that Maulana Hussain Umarji, who allegedly masterminded the train carnage, is connected to the Tablique-e-Jamat, an outfit with a dubious record. 																								Explaining his governments efforts to check cross-border and covert terrorism, Shah told the House that the state had urged Delhi to deploy the army and Central forces along the 512-km border with Pakistan and the states 1,600-km coastline. 																								He said chief minister Narendra Modi had suggested at a meeting on internal security that a committee, comprising members from the RAW, BSF and the armed forces and backed by local police and marine defence groups, be set up to fight cross-border terrorism in Gujarat.																								Shah said the state government will raise a Chetak Command Force on the lines of the National Security Guards for VIP security. 																								Claiming a sharp decline in the politician-police nexus in the state since the BJP came to power, the home minister showered praise on Modi, who, he said, was a man of rare intelligence who has single-handedly challenged terrorism in the world.

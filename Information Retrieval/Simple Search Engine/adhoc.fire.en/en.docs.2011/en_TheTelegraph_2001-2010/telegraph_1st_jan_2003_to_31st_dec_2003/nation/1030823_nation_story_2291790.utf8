The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, August 23, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																DNA tests in Jenni rape case				 																																																	New Delhi: The CBI has decided to get blood samples of Harak Singh Rawat, the former Uttaranchal minister who had to resign after an Assamese woman accused him of fathering her child, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										The bureau will also collect samples from the woman, Indira Deori, alias Jenni, and her baby son.				 																																																										Sources said the CBI would collect the samples soon  reportedly in Dehra Dun in the presence of a magistrate  to conduct a DNA test to identify the childs father.				 																																																										On the basis of Jennis statement, the CBI had registered a case against Rawat on the charge of establishing physical relations with her against her wishes. She had also claimed that Rawat was her babys father.				 																																																										Sleuths on Thursday interrogated Rawat at the bureaus Delhi headquarters, after an earlier session in his Dehra Dun home on August 6. 				 																																																										Rawat, confronted with the allegations Jenni had made in her statement to the CBI, denied the rape charge.				 																																																										Legal experts said the bureau would find it difficult to prove the charge even if the DNA test confirmed Rawat as the childs father. At best, the CBI might prove the two were physically involved, but that would not confirm rape, they said.				 																																																										Another weak link is said to be the inordinate delay that Jenni made in making the allegations.				 																																																										The bureaus case appeared to hinge on Jennis statement, which, according to a Supreme Court ruling, is enough to nail the accused in a rape case, a criminal lawyer said.				 																																																										On Thursday, Rawat was grilled on the fresh developments in the case. 				 																																																										An Uttaranchal government inquiry had found that Saroj, a woman cook at the state-run destitute womens home where the unwed mother is lodged, had pressed Jenni to withdraw the case.				 																																																										Saroj, who has now been removed from the home, had reportedly offered Jenni Rs 12 lakh as compensatory money. The bureau plans to question Saroj once it receives a copy of the states report.				 																																																										Rawat had to quit the Congress government on June 18 following strident Opposition protests after Jenni told an Assembly committee that he had fathered her child. Chief minister .D. Tiwari had then ordered a CBI inquiry.				 																																																										Rawats wife, who claims her husband is innocent, has sought the intervention of the President and the National Commission for Women. 				 																																																										Rawat himself has filed a defamation case against Jenni.

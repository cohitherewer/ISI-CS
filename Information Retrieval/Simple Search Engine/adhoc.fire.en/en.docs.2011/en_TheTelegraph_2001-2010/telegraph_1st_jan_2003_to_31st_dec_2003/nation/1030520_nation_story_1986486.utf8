 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, May 19: There is no trace of neurosurgeon Ramesh Chandra over 36 hours after his abduction in the city.																								Police, however, have managed to rescue jeweller Sanjay Dayal, who was kidnapped the same day, half a kilometre from his home in the citys Kadamkuan locality, exposing once again the politician-criminal nexus.																								Nine persons, including a fellow jeweller who allegedly conspired in Dayals abduction, have been arrested.																								The Joginder Singh gang, suspected of orchestrating Dayals abduction, is believed to have links with a former MLA from Barhi in Hazaribagh area. Ramesh Singh, one of the accused, today told reporters he was close to the former MLA.																								The police, however, are not sure if the nexus figures in the neurosurgeons abduction as well. 																								The doctor was abducted late on Saturday while driving to his Ashiana Nagar home from a dinner hosted by former state chief of Indian Medical Association Ajay Kumar.																								Though the kidnappers have reportedly demanded a Rs 3-crore ransom, the police refused comment. Senior superintendent of police Sunil Kumar said: We are on the job and the progress so far made on the case is satisfactory. We hope to recover the doctor soon.																								A delegation of the Indian Medical Association, which yesterday served a 48-hour ultimatum before going on mass strike, today met Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								The team told him about the circumstances leading to Chandras abduction and renewed their ultimatum to strike work from May 21. 																								Laloo Prasad is said to have assured Chandras early rescue.																								The Dayal abduction is not the first to hint at a politician-criminal nexus in Bihar.																								In the case of Dr Bharat Singh, who was recovered about a week after his abduction in Patna three months ago, the gang involved was traced to gangster Sultan Singh, considered close to an RJD minister.

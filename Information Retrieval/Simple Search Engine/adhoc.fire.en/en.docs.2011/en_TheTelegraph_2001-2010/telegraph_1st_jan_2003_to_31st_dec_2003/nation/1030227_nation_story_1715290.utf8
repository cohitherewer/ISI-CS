		 Thursday, February 27, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																5 of a family killed over land dispute				 																																																	 Patna: Five members of a family were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Arwal district of Bihar, about 60 km from here, over a land dispute, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The incident took place at Khadasin village in Arwal near Jehanabad and sparked protests against police. The victims include three women, one child and a 35-year-old man. 				 																																																	According to A.C. Verma, Patna inspector-general of police, around 12 armed miscreants raided the house of Ram Kewal Mahato and dragged him out. His cries woke up family members, who tried to resist the gang. The miscreants then opened fire, killing all of them. Mahatos mother, sister and sister-in-law were among the dead.				 																																																	We are investigating the exact dimensions of the land dispute, Verma said.				 																																																	Senior police officers of the district, including Sanjay Singh, the superintendent of police, and N.C. Dhondhyal, the deputy inspector-general, are camping in the area. Raids are on to arrest the culprits, police said.				 																SC notice on Delhi water supply				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Union government and attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee on the supply of adequate water to the capital from the Ravi-Beas water system in Punjab through the canals of Haryana.				 																																																	After Haryana expressed its inability to supply 125 cusecs of water to Delhi daily and raised the issue of jurisdiction of the court on sharing of water, a bench of Justices S. Rajendra Babu and A.R. Lakshmanan sought response from the Centre and the attorney-general in two weeks.				 																																																	Their response was sought on whether the apex court could direct a state to supply water to Delhi given that Article 262 of the Constitution specifically bars courts jurisdiction on water disputes.				 																																																	During the severe water crisis in the capital in May 2000, the apex court had directed Punjab to release 125 cusecs of water from the Ravi-Beas system and asked Haryana to allow its carriage system to carry the water to Delhi.				 																																																	The court also directed the Delhi Jal Board to submit an affidavit detailing the requirement of water for the city within two weeks. On the request of amicus curiae Rajeev Dhawan, it asked the Central Water Commission to inspect the condition of the carriage system.				 																																																	The Punjab government has stated that it had no difficulty releasing the water as per the interim order dated May 10, 2000, but was pained that it alone was bearing the burden and no other state was contributing from their share to supply the 125 cusecs of water as ordered by the apex court.				 																Stray animals plague MCD				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The Municipal Corporation of Delhi on Wednesday expressed helplessness before the high court in removing stray animals without police help.				 																																																	Catching stray cattle affects and clashes with the interest of people who were earlier making money out of this business and resentment from this section is going to be at every place, the corporation said in an affidavit. It pleaded with the court to direct police to help the squads. The court took strong exception to the shifting of responsibility by the authorities.

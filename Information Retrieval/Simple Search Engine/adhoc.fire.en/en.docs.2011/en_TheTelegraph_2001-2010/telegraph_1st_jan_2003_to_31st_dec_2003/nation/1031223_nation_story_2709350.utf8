		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Law to limit pesticide use
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Dec. 22: The  Union health ministry is working on a draft for an integrated  food law to prevent adulteration.																								We are considering the framework of such an act, health minister Sushma Swaraj said in the Rajya Sabha in response to questions on reducing pesticide residues in food items.																								Rajya Sabha members, cutting across party lines, pointed out that the existing regulatory mechanism is chaotic and needs to be streamlined. For example, only 71 out of 181 pesticides registered under a committee of the agriculture ministry have maximum residue limits (MRLs) prescribed. The rest have no specific limits.																								The government recently began specifying the limits for 50 more pesticides following an uproar over a study which revealed that 12 soft drink brands contain pesticides at least 30 times higher than international standards. We have already taken a decision not to register any new pesticides without specifying MRLs, Swaraj said.																								The minister informed the members of the House that the government would also amend the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. We have received a lot of recommendations on it, she said.																								Swaraj, however, made it clear that the maximum residue limit will be decided keeping in mind the Indian situation and the needs of its people. Asked whether the government would go with the norms laid down by international agencies, the health minister said: There is no single international norm. We have the World Health Organisation, the European Commission and others.																								She clarified that the government would fix maximum residue limits which are not inimical to the interests of the people.																								There is more than one ministry or agency involved in changing the laws for food regulation which go back to the 1950s. Apart from the health, food and agriculture ministries, there is also the Bureau of Indian Standards which is dealing with the subject.																								Asked by the Upper House members about the inadequacy of existing laws, Swaraj said: We have not been in power for 50 years. We came in 1999 and since then we are trying to reform the system.																								Following the revelations about pesticide residues in soft drinks, the Union health ministry had set up a joint parliamentary committee to probe the matter and fix maximum residue limits in soft drinks. The committee has already had several hearings.

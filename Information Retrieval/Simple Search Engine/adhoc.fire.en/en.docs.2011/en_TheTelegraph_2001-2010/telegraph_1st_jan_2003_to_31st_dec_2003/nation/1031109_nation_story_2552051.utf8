India, Nepal ink rail link pact				 																																																	Kathmandu (PTI): India and Nepal have signed an agreement to set up the first rail link between the two countries.				 																																																										An agreement to operate the multi-million dollar inland container depot (ICD) in Birgunj, bordering India, was signed here on Friday. 				 																																																										The agreement, inked by the Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shyam Sharan, and the Nepalese commerce secretary, Dinesh Chandra Pyakurel, will enable cargo trains to ply between the two countries, to and from Birgunj, sources in the Nepal commerce ministry said.				 																																																										According to Indian embassy sources, Delhi has constructed a 5.4-km railway line from Raxaul to Birgunj at a cost of Rs 170 million.

Nepals international trade as well as bilateral trade with India is expected to increase manifold after the ICD comes into operation, Pyakurel said.

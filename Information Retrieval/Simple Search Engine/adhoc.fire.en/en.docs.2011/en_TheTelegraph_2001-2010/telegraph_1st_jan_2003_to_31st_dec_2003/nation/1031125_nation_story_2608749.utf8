The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, November 25, 2003 				 B-schools and printer in CAT blame game
 															- One more held, touts rounded up OUR BUREAU																								Mumbai/New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Institute of Banking Personnel Services today hotly denied suggestions that the alleged leak of the common admission test question paper occurred at its end.																								If the (question) papers leaked, it was most certainly not from here, its director, D.P. Sarda, said. His institute prints the question paper for the test, known as CAT, for admission to the Indian institutes of management. The test was held yesterday only to be cancelled following the allegation of a leak.																								Bakul Dholakia, the director of IIM Ahmedabad, had said if there was a leak, it could have taken place only at the place of printing. He followed that up by claiming an internal inquiry had established the leak did not occur from the IIMs.																								It would appear to leave Sardas institute, sitting on a swank piece of real estate in the Mumbai suburb of Kandivili, as the only possible source of the leak. 																								As the CBI raided the pharmaceuticals company owned by Ranjit Singh, described by the agency as the mastermind of the leak, at Dahisar, also a Mumbai suburb, Sarda pointed the finger back at the IIMs.																								The question paper came as usual, it was printed as usual and it went there (Ahmedabad) as usual, he said.																								Jo bhi hua, yahan se nahi hua.																								Sarda said his institute had sent the printed question papers in two sealed trunks to Ahmedabad on November 13-14. As if throwing a challenge, he added that he was looking to the CBI to get to the bottom of the case.																								Raids today at Ranjit Singhs company, Radon Pharmaceuticals  said to have a turnover of Rs 70 crore  did not seem to have yielded any leads. But police arrested one person, Nitesh Kumar Singh, a third year engineering student, from Pune, adding to the five picked up yesterday.																								Yesterday, Ranjits brother Dr S.K. Azads house at Vasant Kunj in Delhi was raided without result. His two brothers and sister Sulochana are all doctors and the CBI was trying to ascertain whether his siblings got the MBBS degree through the racket he has been operating for some years.																								Ranjit, along with his other accomplices, Dr Ram Kumar Sinha, Dr Manoj Kumar and Hari Shanker Chaudhary, were today remanded in CBI custody for 10 days.																								The four were arrested on Saturday night from Shanti Palace hotel in the Mahipalpur area of southwest Delhi while they were allegedly giving the question paper along with the answers to four students.																								CBI director P.C. Sharma said the scandal has huge implications. I believe the scam is larger and the amount estimated (Rs 100 crore) so far may be too small.																								Delhi police have rounded up four touts  Rajesh Sushant, from Kanpur, and Bharat Bhushan, Mahendra and Arvind Kumar, all residents of Bihar.

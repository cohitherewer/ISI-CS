		 Monday, April 28, 2003 				 D-alert over serial blasts scare
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mangalore, April 27: Security and Intelligence agencies in Karnataka and Maharashtra have got into high-alert mode over the activities of the D-company.																								The agencies have received information that Dawood Ibrahim and his associates in Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence are planning a round of serial bomb blasts in many places in western India, especially Gujarat and Maharashtra.																								The information has led to a series of raids in many towns of Maharashtra and Karnataka, including Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Kundapura and Mangalore.																								According to sources, nearly 50 activists of several militant Islamic organisations have been rounded up for questioning in the past one week from the two states. Some of them belong to organisations like the Students Islamic Movement of India, an organisation whose ban by the Centre had generated controversy.																								The information, said the intelligence sources, had come from Anil Parab. A henchman of Dawood, Parab was recently deported from Dubai. Over 20 militant groups have been trained to engineer the blasts, he said. 																								Ibrar Ahmed, a key member of the gang, is suspected to be in charge of the training.																								He himself had apparently undergone training in arms and ammunition at a Hizb-ul Mujhahideen camp near Peshawar in 1993, sources said.																								The agencies, however, have no information on the dimensions of the planned blasts. According to government records, the D-company, along with the ISI, has engineered 15 blasts of varying intensities in western India in the last 10 years.																								Intelligence agencies flashed a red alert along the coastlines of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala in January following reports about the movements of a D-company ship carrying contraband arms and ammunition.																								The ship, Ayesha, was reportedly carrying weapons of mass destruction like rocket launchers and the ammunition could have included RDX. Sources in the agencies said the ship failed to dock following the intensive operations launched jointly by security agencies.																								But the latest alert shows that the D-company was not thwarted entirely by the earlier failure.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: Christian organisations have demanded action against Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief K.S. Sudarshan for his blasphemous remarks on the Bible at a function in Amritsar on January 29.																								The All India Christian Council and the Catholic Union alleged that the Sangh leaders denigrated Sikhs, Muslims and Christians during their speeches and have urged the Punjab government to prosecute them.																								Sudarshan, while addressing a 1947 Shaurya Samriti Samaroh to honour 495 Sangh activists for their role in saving Hindu lives during Partition from the clutches of Muslim goons, had said all Muslims living in India are Hindus and all Sikhs are Hindus. Sikhs, he added, were being segregated from Hindu society to make them easy prey to conversions.																								He was also quoted as having said that the Bible was relevant only in the times it was written.																								The Christian organisations said all civilised citizens denounce Sudarshans highly blasphemous words against the Holy Bible, revered by a third of mankind, and his denigration of the Sikhs and other minority groups.																								The Bible has survived despots and heretics in the centuries of its existence, they said. It has survived the most intensive exegesis, analysis and critique of all holy texts of all religions. It surely will survive fascist fuehrers such as Mr Sudarshan and those of his followers in the Bajrang Dal and the VHP who have sought to burn copies of it in Gujarat and other states.																								The RSS chief had also blamed Mahatma Gandhi for Partition and attacked the media for its anti-Hindu bias. Urging Hindus to organise themselves, he said the unnatural partition of the country must end.																								While Gandhi succeeded in creating and leading a peoples movement, he committed two mistakes  supporting (the) Khilafat movement and making Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru the first Prime Minister. The end result was that two enemies, Pakistan and Bangladesh, were created forever, he said.																								The RSS chief was greeted by activists of the Dal Khalsa and the Human Rights Democracy Forum carrying black flags, placards and banners. They criticised the Sangh for organising a function that could lead to pitting one minority community against another.																								Shiromani Akali Dal (A) chief Simranjit Singh Mann rubbished the claim that the Golden Temple was attacked by Muslims during Partition. He said it was a gross misinterpretation of history.																								Mann, a Lok Sabha MP, said RSS cadre did not save the Sikh shrine in 1947 and wondered why the RSS did not come forward to save the Golden Temple during Operation Bluestar.

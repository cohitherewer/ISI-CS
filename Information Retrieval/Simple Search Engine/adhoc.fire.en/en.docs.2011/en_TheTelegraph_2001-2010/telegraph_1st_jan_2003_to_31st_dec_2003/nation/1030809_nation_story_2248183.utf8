 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Aug. 8: The chief judicial magistrate of Siwan today ordered the attachment of properties belonging to RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin. 																								The Siwan MP did not surrender even after his anticipatory bail petition was rejected yesterday by the district and sessions court.																								The MP has been declared an absconder after he virtually went underground following an arrest order by the director-general of police, D.P. Ojha, in connection with the abduction and murder of Munna Chaudhary, a CPI-ML activist in Siwan in 2001.																								The state police had approached the chief judicial magistrate with original documents pleading that they be allowed to attach the RJD leaders properties. 																								The court has also directed the police to start administrative procedures to impound Shahabuddins passport.																								Ojha is learnt to have sent additional personnel, including a company of paramilitary forces, to attach the properties. The police fear their move may be resisted by the MPs supporters.																								The DGP has also ordered Shahabuddins arrest in connection with three other cases. One pertains to alleged abuse and assault on a government officer and another is regarding the murder of a CPI-ML worker, Chote Lal Chowdhary.

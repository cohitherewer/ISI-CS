		 Tuesday, November 18, 2003 				 Bipasha scours 9/11 for image makeover
 															- Jism pair back together in Mumkin				 	 John Abraham and Bipasha Basu at a news conference on Mumkin. (PTI)																								Bollywoods hot pair, the dusky and sensuous Bipasha Basu and the hunkish John Abraham, are set to sizzle together again on screen, but this time in a film set amid the tragedy of the September 11 attacks. 																								The real-life lovers set the screens on fire earlier this year in Jism, a bold and passionate crime thriller that became Bollywoods first big hit this year.																								Bipasha has since become one of the most sought-after stars  but with the upcoming romantic thriller, Mumkin, she is also looking to be seen as more than a sex symbol. 																								Mumkin is a triangular love story written in the backdrop of the twin terror attacks, with the third role played by newcomer Priyanshu Chatterji. 																								I am playing the role of a painter whose elder sister has died in the 9/11 attack in New York. After that she wants to know about terrorism and the guys who work in counter-terrorism operations, Bipasha said. 																								The Rs 6-crore production, scheduled for a May 2004 release, will be shot by debutant director Tanveer Khan and produced by Anil Sharma. 																								It is unfortunate that I have got the sex symbol image after Jism, Bipasha said. I am trying to fight and defy that image, but it is proving difficult so I am not bothering about what others are saying about me.																								I have done roles of an air hostess, a simple girl and a friend in my other films, but some people still want me to be associated as a sex symbol. I dont mind what they talk about me because I am getting all kinds of roles.																								In the latest thriller, model-turned-actor Abraham plays a counter-terrorism expert. 																								It is a very challenging role. In fact, this film is close to my heart because I had a friend who worked in counter-terrorism and died in a terrorist attack six months ago, said Abraham.																								When I heard the script for the first time, I thought that this story is about my friend. So I am grateful to be a part of this film. 																								Mumkin will be the couples third movie together, the other being Aitbar, which also stars Amitabh Bachchan and is directed by Vikram Bhatt.																								Bipasha also scored success last year when she starred in the suspense thriller Raaz, a major hit in a year of big-budget flops.					 AFP

				 	 Bradford																								Mumbai, June 20 (Reuters): A Mumbai judge has summoned best-selling author Barbara Taylor Bradford to appear in court in August in connection with a defamation case filed by a film writer, lawyers said today.																								Last month, New York-based Bradford obtained an injunction from Calcutta High Court barring Sahara Manoranjan from airing, until further notice, Karishma  The Miracles of Destiny, a mega serial which she claims has been plagiarised from her novel A Woman of Substance. In response to the injunction, the channel had pulled the soap off the air a day after the first episode was beamed. A copyright violation case is now being fought in Calcutta High Court between the author and Sahara.																								Writer Sachin Bhaumik, who penned the script for the serial, said in his complaint that Bradford had made defamatory allegations.																								Robert Bradford, the novelists husband, said today that she would defend the defamation case. This case has no basis. We dont even know this man (Bhaumik). We have not taken any individual action against him, he said over the phone from Geneva.

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: Geeta J. Mangtani doesnt want divorce. She doesnt want alimony. Instead, the schoolteacher from Gujarat is willing to maintain her husband to keep their family going. 																								Mangtanis husband is earning only Rs 1,400 from a private job in Mumbai while she makes between Rs 8,000 and 10,000 as a government schoolteacher in Gandhidham. Given the high cost of living in Mumbai, Mangtani has offered to maintain the family, including their nine-year-old son, and make the matrimonial home in Gujarat instead of going to the metropolis and living with her husband in poverty. 																								However, her husband wants her to give up her job and live with him at the matrimonial home, which is conventionally taken to be the place where the man lives. 																								In her petition, Mangtani has sought a direction from the Supreme Court to her husband to take up her offer as she is earning about five to seven times more than him. 																								A division bench of Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and Justice H.K. Sema admitted her petition, which will come up for hearing after eight weeks. 																								Geetas counsel A.H. Raichura argues that the word matrimonial home is not defined in the Hindu Marriage Act. 																								Therefore, it could be the place where the wife lives also, and especially when the wife is earning more and the husband doesnt have sufficient income to maintain the wife, she can refuse to go to the husbands house and such refusal could not be a ground for grant of divorce, Raichura said. 																								The trial court had agreed that Mangtani did not leave her husband without reasonable grounds and declined to grant divorce. However, on appeal, the high court reversed the order and granted divorce on the husbands petition. Mangtani has now approached the apex court by filing a special leave petition. 																								Mangtanis stand is that she cannot leave her son in the lurch and has to secure a good future for him. Since her husbands income is much less than hers, it is proper and reasonable to invite him to join her and make the matrimonial home in Gujarat.

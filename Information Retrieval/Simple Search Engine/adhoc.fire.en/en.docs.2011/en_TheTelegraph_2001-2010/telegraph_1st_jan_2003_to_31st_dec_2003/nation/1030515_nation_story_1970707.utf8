																								Chennai, May 14: DMK chief M. Karunanidhi has cited the Constitutions federal structure in a last-ditch effort to convince the Centre to rescind the Prevention of Terrorism Act, reports our special correspondent.																								At a meeting last night, he said the Prime Minister and the deputy Prime Ministers assurances in Parliament that the Act will not be misused by states for political vendetta have been flouted in Tamil Nadu.																								This was because the Act had fallen into the wrong hands and has become an instrument of political oppression at the hands of those seeking to wreck vengeance on us, he said.																								The meeting, attended by all Opposition parties barring the BJP, had been called to condemn the ADMK regimes repressive measures against the media. The latest to be jailed under the Act is R.R. Gopal, editor of the Tamil magazine Nakkeeran.

		 Thursday, July 17, 2003 				 35 killed in Kullu flash floods
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Shimla, July 16: Thirty-five people were killed and 50 injured in flash floods caused by a devastating cloudburst in Kullu district early this morning, official sources said.																								Most of the victims were labourers of Satyam Construction Company and Bholanath JP Ltd, involved in the Parvati hydel power project in Shillagarh village, 50 km from here, they said.																								Sixteen bodies have been recovered so far, they said, adding that two persons succumbed to injuries on way to hospital. Of the injured, 22 were admitted to a hospital in Kullu while some others were discharged after first-aid, the sources added.																								Chief minister Veerbhadra Singh had earlier said that more than 100 persons were feared dead. He had said over 250 migrant workers, mostly from Bihar and Nepal, were at the site when the cloudburst occurred between 3 am and 4 am. The cloudburst caused flash floods in the Pulia nullah, washing away people and destroying property.																								Director-general of police A.K. Puri later said the toll might not be as high as feared initially. Sources said the flash floods washed away several huts and swept away large chunks of lands along the bank.

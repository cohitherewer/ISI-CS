		 Friday, September 19, 2003 				 Child killed for tickets to movie
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Hyderabad, Sept. 18: The  craze to catch the latest film of their favourite star prompted  two 10-year-old boys here to kill their three-year-old neighbour  to rustle up some quick money.																								Twin brothers Ram and Lakshman of Saidabad, a middle-class colony in the old city, were said to have hatched a plot with their friend Chennayya on Monday. The twins apparently lured Devika to a vacant building for a game after her parents, watchman Mallesham and maid Radha, had left for work.																								Once at the building, they tried to snatch her silver anklets to sell them for tickets to the latest Chiranjeevi starrer. When she screamed for help, they strangled her.																								Devikas parents and the twins parents lodged a missing complaint with police.																								The boys, however, returned home late at night, after watching the film, and confessed to their father Veerayya. They were immediately packed off to the house of a relative. Two days later, when Devikas body was found, the twins mother withdrew the complaint. She said her sons had gone to a film and stayed back at a relatives.																								But when Saidabad police questioned Veerayya, he told them about his sons. The twins have been arrested and Chennayya is being questioned.

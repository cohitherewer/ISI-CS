 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 14: After having shot off a missive to STAR to explain its investments in its uplinking company last week, the Union information and broadcasting ministry today sent another letter saying the renewal of its uplinking licence was not open-ended.																								The ministry had sought clarifications from STAR but had given it a week-long extension to uplink for direct telecasts of its news channel. Todays letter to STAR said its uplinking permit was subject to an explanation from the company on its investments.																								It is understood that the ministry asked STAR to explain its stand following media reports that Kumaramangalam Birla, who was given a stake in its uplinking firm Media Content and Communication, had offloaded his shares.																								The ministry has also asked STAR to furnish details on its application for accreditation to the Press Information Bureau to its correspondents.

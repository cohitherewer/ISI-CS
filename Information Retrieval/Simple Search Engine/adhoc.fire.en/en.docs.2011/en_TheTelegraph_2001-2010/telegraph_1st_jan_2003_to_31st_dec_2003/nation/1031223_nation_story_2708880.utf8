		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Caution on forced sale of set-tops
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 22: Faced with mounting discontent over the forced selling of set-top boxes by some cable operators, the Union information and broadcasting minister today came out with an assurance.																								We have all options before us if consumer interest is jettisoned, he told Parliament. 																								There should be no forcible sale of set-top boxes...Our officers are monitoring everything very closely...The law makes it necessary for cable operators to offer boxes on rent and take care of their maintenance, the minister said.																								Since the Assembly poll results were declared in Delhi, select channels have been withdrawn in dozens of posh localities in the capitals south. When contacted, cable operators urge consumers to buy the boxes for resumption of service.																								Prasads assurance, however, failed to impress the Opposition led by the Congress.																								They walked out of the Rajya Sabha, saying the minister was not addressing questions on the conditional access system (CAS). It has been officially introduced only in Chennai, among the four metros.																								Delhi High Court today issued a notice to the Centre on a petition filed by a consumer body challenging the introduction of CAS.																								A vacation bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Pradeep Nandrajog asked government counsel Sanjay Jain to seek instructions from the Centre on the 20-odd questions raised by the body and file the reply by Friday.																								The public interest petition by the Consumer Coordination Council, a network of 50 consumer organisations and consumers online foundation forum, also challenged the amended Cable TV Network (regulation) Act, 2002.

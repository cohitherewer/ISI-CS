Santosh Hegde and Justice B.P. Singh said: In the absence of any explanation from the prosecution as to the injuries on the appellant, we are of the opinion that the prosecutions version of the incident becomes doubtful.				 																																																	The prosecution had told the trial court that the two accused along with two others stabbed the deceased. The prosecution has recovered only one weapon. Therefore, it is difficult to appreciate the prosecutions case that by one single weapon all these four accused persons would have stabbed the deceased, Justice Hegde, writing for the bench, said.				 																																																	The prosecution was not claiming that all the accused had come prepared to attack the deceased, he said, adding that it is their case that the fight started suddenly without pre-planning between the two ladies and the others joined in and somebody stabbed the deceased.				 																																																	etting aside the trial court order convicting the accused for murder, which was upheld by Andhra Pradesh High Court, the apex court said: Assuming this case of the prosecution to be true, in the absence of any material to show that there was any common intention, it will not be possible to attract Section 34. It then directed that the accused be released from jail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, July 07, 2003 				 Twin alerts on border
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Kanyakumari, July 6: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today warned the Centre against accepting the India-Pakistan Line of Control and the India-China Line of Actual Control as international borders.																								This would not be acceptable to the nation, the Sangh said in its resolution on International Scenario and Border Security, passed on the last day of its two-day national executive here.																								The organisation also warned the Centre against sending troops to Iraq without UN mandate. Sending Indian soldiers under the flag of a foreign country would be an insult to the nation, it said.																								The Sangh, however, welcomed the recent success of the A.B. Vajpayee government in its diplomatic initiatives with the two neighbours.																								Raising the track record of China and Pakistan while pursuing peace initiatives, the Sangh reminded the Centre of the Parliament resolutions on PoK and winning back our land from China.																								No compromise should be made on national integrity and sovereignty as this would not be acceptable to the nation, the RSS said. Forgetting lessons of history in relation to the two countries would be at the countrys peril, the organisation said.																								China had occupied our neighbour Tibet and then attacked us. Even today, it is not ready to accept our sovereignty over Sikkim and shows Arunachal Pradesh as part of China in its maps. It is expanding its diplomatic influence in Nepal and Myanmar, the resolution said.																								The Sangh put on record its satisfaction over Indias emergence on the diplomatic front as a nation rubbing shoulders with strong world powers. The countrys international stock has gone up in the last five years, the resolution said.																								The Sangh, however, regretted the political leaderships lack of sensitivity towards border security, which had shrunk the countrys borders after Independence.

 Board trashes seer plan
  YOGESH VAJPEYI New Delhi, July 9: In a formal communication to Kanchi Sankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has rejected his proposals, describing them as unjust.The letter, sent to the Sankaracharya yesterday, said the board rejected his proposals for resolving the Ayodhya dispute as they were not even worth considering.The letter, signed by board president Maulana Rabey Nadwi, said the Sankaracharyas July 1 letter did contain a veiled threat to the Muslim community to surrender the disputed site in Ayodhya and mentally prepare for giving up claims on Kashi and Mathura, board sources said.The communication added that the second proposal was not even worth considering as it was merely a repeat of the Sangh parivars demand on the temple issue and seemed totally unreasonable, the sources said. RSS-BJP meetA two-day meeting of RSS and BJP leaders began in Chennai today to discuss Ayodhya. BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, general secretaries Pramod Mahajan and Sanjay Joshi and RSS leaders Madan Das Devi and Mohan Bhagat attended the meeting.  Copyright

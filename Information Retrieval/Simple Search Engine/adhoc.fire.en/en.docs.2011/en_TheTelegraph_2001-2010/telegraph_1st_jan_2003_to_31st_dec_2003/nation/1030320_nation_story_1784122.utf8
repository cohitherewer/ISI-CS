																								New Delhi, March 19 (PTI): To curb cross-voting and use of money power in Rajya Sabha polls, the Union Cabinet last night decided to amend the Representation of People Act to provide for open voting instead of secret ballot for the upper House. 																								It also decided to allow a person from anywhere in the country to contest elections to the upper House, doing away with the current clause that a candidate has to be a resident of a particular state.																								A Bill, incorporating these provisions, will be introduced when the budget session resumes on April 7.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: The CBI has received a notification from the Bihar government, requesting it to probe the assault on Northeast-bound passengers of the Brahmaputra Mail which fanned the flames in Assam.																								Sources said the bureau received a request this week, saying the government wanted to transfer the case to the CBI. We will have to discuss whether we want to take up the case or not since the bureau is already burdened with many cases, said a source.																								The state police had registered six cases in the Jamalpur area after passengers on the Brahmaputra Mail were attacked by Bihari mobs on November 12. A Mizo woman was molested on the Guwahati-Dadar Express. The attacks followed allegations that candidates from Bihar who had gone to Assam for a railway recruitment test were assaulted. Truckers threat																								In Bihar, the state motor transport association has threatened to block all Assam-bound trucks from north Indian states if the Assam government and the Centre do not stop the violence on Biharis, says our correspondent in Patna. 																								The massacre is not just an attack on Biharis. The attack is on our national unity and integrity, said association president Sagirul Haq.																								Bihar has already stopped plying trucks to the Northeast. On an average, 4,000 trucks from north Indian states cross into Assam through Bihar daily through the only connecting road, National Highway 31.																								No Bihari driver would ever put his life in danger by venturing into Assam, Haq said.

		 Friday, February 21, 2003 				 Babri panel petitions SC on stay
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Babri Masjid Movement Coordination Committee joined the Ayodhya issue in the Supreme Court.																								The committees application to the apex court today prayed for dismissal of the Centres petition to get the courts March 2002 order on the undisputed 67.703 acres vacated.																								Chief Justice V.N. Khare directed that the application be tied with the Centres and taken up for hearing tomorrow.																								The committee said the Centre had failed to make any case for the vacation of the stay that prohibited religious activity of any kind even on the undisputed land around the spot of the disputed 2.77 acres, where Hindu groups claim the Ram temples sanctum sanctorum existed and the Babri mosque was built later.																								Nyas moves court																								Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas trustee Mahant Dharam Das has moved court seeking replacement of managing trustee of the nyas Ashok Singhal and its president Ram Chandra Das Paramhans and two other trustees alleging irregularities in its functioning.																								The Centres petition stated that the situation has changed since March 2002, so the apex courts order banning religious activity on the undisputed land should be vacated.																								The committee contended there was no change in the ground situation in the acquired land area.																								The committees application accused the Centre of acting under ideological and political pressure for meeting the unlawful demands of the Sangh parivar and the VHP and, therefore, seeking a recall of the order in question.																								It said the revival of a non-issue was a political exercise motivated by electoral considerations in view of the ensuing elections in four states.																								The committee described the Centres petition as malafideand constitute a misuse of the judicial process.

 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Dec. 13: Cable TV operators in the capital and Rawalpindi have stopped beaming STAR TV channels because of alleged over-charging by Karachi-based distributors of the network.																								Karachi and Lahore-based operators, however, have not endorsed the decision of the All Pakistan Cable Operators Welfare Associations northern chapter and stayed on air.																								The cable TV operators demand that the charges be revised by the network. We have decided not to show any of the four STAR channels  STAR World, STAR Movies, STAR Sports and V music channel until per subscriber charges are revised by the television network, said Ibne Hassan Kazmi, a cable operator.																								Pakistan Electronic Media and Regulatory Authority had recently authorised STAR Television to charge from cable operators Rs 2 per subscriber per sports channel and Re 1 for other channels. However, the operators complained that the channel has been over-charging in violation of the tariff fixed by the authority.																								STAR TV distributors had started charging Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 per cable operator, side-stepping the tariff fixed by the authority, alleged Kazmi. He added that they have informed the regulator of this violation.																								However, STAR TV distributor Mehmud Rizvi said this was not a violation. We had challenged the regulatory authoritys decision in Sindh High Court and obtained a stay from there, he said.																								Officials of the authority said they had to fix the tariff when the two sides failed to reach an understanding after a series of meetings over the last six months. But now the two sides must respect the decision because they had themselves approached the authority. The STAR TV network is supposed to adhere to the formula agreed to in a meeting with cable TV operators, a spokesman of the authority told The Telegraph.																								The closure of channels resulting from the spat between the operators and the distributors has drawn a lot of flak. There are more than 120,000 subscribers for cable television in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.																								Closure of cable television channels under one pretext or the other has become a routine. This had happened in August also when they went off air for over a week against banning of Indian channels and now they have complaints against STAR, said Shakeel Ahmad, who religiously watches STAR World.

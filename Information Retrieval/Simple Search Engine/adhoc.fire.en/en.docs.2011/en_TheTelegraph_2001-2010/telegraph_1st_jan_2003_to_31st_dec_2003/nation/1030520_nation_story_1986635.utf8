		 Tuesday, May 20, 2003 				 Fresh twist to Karishma battle
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Karisma in the serial																								May 19: The legal battle over the telecast of Karishma  The Miracles of Destiny on Sahara took another turn today.																								The vacation bench of the Supreme Court decided to hear on May 22 an application by Sahara TV pleading that the case be heard by Calcutta High Court.																								Justices . Santosh Hegde and Shivraj Patil said the bench would hear the merits of the application on that date. This was after the TV channel mentioned its application before them.																								Earlier, on May 14, the apex court had stayed the telecast of the serial as well as all proceedings in the high court on the petition of author Barbara Taylor Bradford. 																								The author said the serial was based on her novel A Woman of Substance and was an infringement of copyright.																								Sahara, in its application, said that on mature consideration and on legal advice, the channel felt it should have accepted one of the suggestions of the apex court to go before the single-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court, which on May 7 had restrained it from airing the serial.																								The channel had approached a division bench of the high court and obtained an order allowing it to telecast the serial. Bradford had moved the apex courts vacation bench against this order. 																								The apex court had, during hearings on this order, given an option to the channel to go before the single-judge bench of the high court again.																								In view of todays development, Sahara said it would like to exercise that option.

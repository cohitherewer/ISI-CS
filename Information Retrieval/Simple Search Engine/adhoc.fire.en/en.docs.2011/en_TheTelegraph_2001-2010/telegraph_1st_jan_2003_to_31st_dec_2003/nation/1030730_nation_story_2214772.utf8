		 Wednesday, July 30, 2003 				 Jaya backs code
																								Chennai, July 29: Barely a couple of days after the BJP goaded rivals on the need for a uniform civil code, Jayalalithaa today came out strongly in support of it and also backed a Ram temple in Ayodhya, reports our special correspondent. 																								Saying a uniform code was essential, the chief minister said the ADMK will definitely support a legislation in Parliament. She dismissed questions on whether a common code would affect the minorities. It alone will ensure real equality for all citizens, she said. 																								She also backed the construction of a Ram temple . The temple should be built. If you cannot build a temple for Lord Ram in India, where else can you? 																								But she avoided a direct reply when asked about the Vishwa Hindu Parishads demand for a legislation to facilitate temple construction. No such legislation has been brought forth now, she said. 																								Jayalalithaa also parried a query on whether she favoured a temple on the disputed site, saying she did not wish to go into the complex legal aspects of the issue. 																								The chief minister refused to be drawn into any comment on the recent strike by state employees, saying petitions were pending before the Supreme Court. 																								Jayalalithaa was speaking to reporters after a small function at the ADMK headquarters on Avvai Shanmugham Salai here, where nearly 250 college students joined the partys student wing. She also named as many as 34 babies of party functionaries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, October 20, 2003 				 Progress sends parishad to back seat
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Vajpayee and Uma Bharti (third from left) at the womens rally in Bhopal on Sunday. (PTI) 																								Bhopal, Oct. 19: Two days after the Vishwa Hindu Parishads Ayodhya show, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave an indication of how far his own mind was from the line followed by the militant wing of the Sangh parivar by telling the people of Madhya Pradesh to vote on development.																								Vajpayee kicked off the BJP campaign by addressing a modest all-women crowd. He said there was little sense in deifying women as Durga, Saraswati and Lakshmi if society could not take care of their health, education and food.																								Building on this argument, the Prime Minister spoke of his concern about incidents of rape, atrocities against women and the declining sex ratio.																								A nations destiny is shaped by paurush (courage) and parishram (hard work) than by merely stargazing or perpetuating superstition, he added.																								Vajpayee attacked the Digvijay Singh government for poor roads, shortage of power and a low human development index. There should be complete focus on development-related issues. Let there be no diversion, distraction and mix-up on this count. There are other issues too but development is the biggest, more crucial and core issue.																								He asked voters to weed out a regime that has recorded 128,000 rape cases during its 10-year rule.																								Vajpayees emphasis on development stands in contrast to efforts by Sangh outfits as well as the ruling Congress to highlight emotive issues. 																								In Madhya Pradesh, Bhojshala  where Hindus and Muslims have practised their religions peacefully for years  is being built up as another potential Ayodhya dispute.																								VHP leaders like Acharya Dharmendra and Praveen Togadia are regular visitors and the RSS is seeking to take over the BJPs political campaign.																								In the Congress camp, Digvijays political agenda is laced with soft Hindutva revolving around cow protection, cow-urine therapy and frequent visits and donations to places of worship.																								In his 35-minute speech, Vajpayee referred to Digvijays kunwara (bachelor) slur and asked voters not to get trapped in superstition. In the height of summer, Digvijay had attributed the lack of rain to the Prime Ministers bachelorhood, saying that the Gods were unhappy with kunwara rulers. Uma Bharti, the BJPs chief ministerial candidate, is not married, too.																								Vajpayee gently reminded the chief minister that President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was also a bachelor and said politicians should avoid perpetuating superstition. After Digvijays remark, there were good rains all over the country, the Prime Minister added.																								I have nothing against those who believe in nakshatras (movement of stars) but lets not forget that a nations destiny is shaped by paurush and parishram.																								Women heard Vajpayee attentively but some were disappointed on two counts. 																								The Prime Minister, they said, referred to rape and the plight of victims, narrating how the Siri Fort incident had brought disrepute to the nation, but did not announce any tough measures. Second, Vajpayee kept mum on the womens reservation bill pending before Parliament for years.																								Vajpayee appealed to voters to opt for Uma Bharti but the local organisers of the meeting might have to do some explaining to the central BJP leadership. 																								Considering the high billing of todays event, the turnout was hopelessly short of the crowd drawn by Sonia Gandhi at a similar all-women gathering at Indore.

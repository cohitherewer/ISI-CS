Deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma  also the state industry minister  is believed to have woken up to the corrupt practices of officers in the industry department after complaints of fake registrations began pouring in.																								Sources said six top officials in the department have been rampantly making fake registrations over the last few years and misappropriating the crores granted to the department as subsidy. 																								Department files show that the units exist and that they have been given subsidies and other incentives.																								After getting wind of the scam, Sharma ordered an inquiry, which zeroed in on the officials. 																								The officials are believed to have invented the names of entrepreneurs, filled up forms, allotted land and given subsidy.																								All this was done with the help of middlemen. The government is now in the process of identifying the people who have misappropriated money meant for development of industry in this state, government sources said.

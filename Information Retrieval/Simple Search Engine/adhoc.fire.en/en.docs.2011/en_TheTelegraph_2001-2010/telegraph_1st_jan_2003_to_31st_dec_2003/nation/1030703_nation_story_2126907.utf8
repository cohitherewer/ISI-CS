 ASI rapped
  Lucknow, July 2: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court hearing the Ayodhya suits pulled up the Archaeological Survey of India on Wednesday for laxity in completing excavations at the disputed site.After hearing the counsel for ASI and the Central Sunni Waqf Board, the three-judge bench reserved its order for tomorrow.The ASI was originally given one month from March 12 to complete the Ayodhya excavations. Subsequently, it got two extensions, which extended its time to three months. Seeking further extension, the ASI said work at Ayodhya would have to remain suspended from July to August due to rain. It asked for two months from October to complete the digging and another month to prepare its final report.  Copyright

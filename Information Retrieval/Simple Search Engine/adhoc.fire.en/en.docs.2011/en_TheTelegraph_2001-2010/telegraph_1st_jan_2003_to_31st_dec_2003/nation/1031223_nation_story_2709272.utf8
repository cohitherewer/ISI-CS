		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Bharti baiter faces portfolio penalty
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Dec. 22: A triumphant BJP in Madhya Pradesh is out to cut down to size those who stayed aloof from the recently concluded Assembly polls.																								The most prominent casualty, according to an overworking political grapevine in Bhopal, is likely to be Union sports minister Vikram Verma.																								His slot is said to have been marked for cabinet colleague Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamul Congress chief who has long been waiting for a portfolio.																								Vermas fault is said to be his obvious antipathy towards the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Uma Bharti. 																								The rationale for his exit revolves around the Shanta treatment  a reference to BJP leader Shanta Kumars ouster from the Union cabinet for his disobedience during the Himachal Pradesh polls. If Kumar could be shown the way out, why not Verma, the argument goes.																								Local party leaders loyal to Bharti claim BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu has sought Vermas explanation for his absence during the poll campaign in the state.																								A Rajya Sabha member, Verma was conspicuous by his absence in hometown Dhar and nearby areas of the states Malwa region, where his party demolished the traditional Congress citadel.																								According to one account, Naidu reportedly asked Verma to show his index finger that did not have the ink mark, implying the Union minister was so hostile towards Bharti that he did not bother to vote.																								Bharti is not the only clear winner in the fast-changing power equations in the state BJP, two weeks after the Assembly poll results. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is as much a force to reckon with, with its influence spreading over state politicians and the bureaucracy alike.																								It is an open secret in Bhopal that no appointment from the level of secretary to clerk can be made without getting the RSS approval. Senior IAS and IPS officers are openly lobbying with the outfits office-bearers to bag plum posts.																								Some key officers in the former Digvijay Singh regime are even flashing certificates of excellence they received as RSS volunteers while in school and college in a bid to hang on to their posts.																								While state BJP chief Kailash Joshi, who is a former chief minister, bides his time, a former state RSS chief, Kaptan Singh Solanki, is hogging the spotlight.																								Solanki, now the BJP organisational secretary, has the final say in all matters of administration and political affairs, including appointment of private secretaries and personal assistants to the new ministers. 																								His assistant Arun Kumar Bhadoria, a former Yuva Janata organisational secretary, has an equal say. 																								But the new ministers are getting restless as the RSS spends considerable time checking the antecedents and credentials of the prospective babus. I have to write the note sheet in long hand. I have not even got a steno-typist, one of them said, acknowledging his request for personal staff was on hold.

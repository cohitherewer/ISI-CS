		 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 On the run in Punjab, Daler held in Delhi
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Back in the court: Daler arrives at a Patiala police station in October for interrogation. (PTI)																								New Delhi/Chandigarh, Dec. 19: Bhangra pop star Daler Mehndi was today arrested by Delhi police minutes after he assured the Supreme Court that he would surrender before a Patiala court on January 8.																								Daler was arrested from a Vasant Vihar house in south Delhi on charges of avoiding Punjab police, which had booked him for his alleged involvement in a human trafficking case. 																								A team led by Patiala superintendent of police R.L. Monga, who is heading the special investigation team probing the allegations, rushed to the capital to take the singer into custody for questioning.																								Daler was picked up by Delhi polices special cell around 2 pm, minutes after his counsel had told the apex court that his client would surrender next month.																								The police said the Vasant Vihar house belongs to Dalers friend Shamsher Singh, who was not home at the time of arrest. His family members were, however, present.																								A senior police officer said Daler reached Shamshers house in his Santro car yesterday and planned to move out soon. They think he had been hiding in the capital for over a month.																								Daler was formally arrested after Delhi police examined the legal modalities in the case following his assurance to the apex court that he would surrender. The police said he would be produced before the chief metropolitan magistrate tomorrow.																								Asked if the singer would be handed over to Punjab police, they said their northern counterparts could move an application for this.																								Earlier, Daler moved an application before the Supreme Court, saying he would surrender on January 8.																								A bench of Justices Doraiswamy Raju and Arijit Passayat had directed Punjab police to provide Daler adequate protection when he surrendered before the appropriate court next month. As and when Mehndi surrenders before the trial court, the police would give him protection as indicated by Punjab and Haryana High Court, the bench had said.																								The court said it would not hear the singers bail application unless he made himself available for custodial interrogation. Following this, Dalers counsel Kapil Sibal gave an undertaking that his client would surrender next month.																								The Supreme Court then decided to hear his bail petition on January 16.																								During arguments, Sibal complained that Punjab police had allegedly organised a mob to attack the car of Dalers counsel and intimidate the singer when he appeared at a Patiala police station for questioning last October. The court responded by saying that the singer should approach the police if he needed protection at the time of surrender.																								Punjab and Haryana High Court had earlier directed the prosecution that Daler should be medically examined every week once he is arrested and said his counsel could meet him twice a day. 																								The non-bailable warrants issued against the singer were to lapse tomorrow.																								Daler and six others were booked by Patiala police following a complaint by Bakshish Singh of Belwara village in the same district. He alleged that the singer had taken Rs 13 lakh from him to take him abroad as a member of his troupe.

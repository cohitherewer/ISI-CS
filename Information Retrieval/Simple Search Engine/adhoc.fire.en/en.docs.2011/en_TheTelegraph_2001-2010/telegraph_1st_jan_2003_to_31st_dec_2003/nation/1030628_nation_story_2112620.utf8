		 Saturday, June 28, 2003 				 Cong seal on twin quota thrusts
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 27: The one thing that simultaneously binds and differentiates the Congress chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan is reservation.																								Aiming at the common goal of retaining power in the November Assembly polls, Madhya Pradeshs Digvijay Singh and Rajasthans Ashok Gehlot have struck on different approaches to reservation.																								Digvijay, who belongs to the upper caste and is up against the BJPs backward class challenger Uma Bharti, is wooing the Other Backward Classes (OBC).																								A couple of days ago, Digvijay decided to enhance reservation for OBCs to 27 per cent, up from the existing 14, citing the two-decade-old report of the Mahajan Commission the state had set up in the 1980s to recommend reservation for OBCs.																								OBC leader Gehlot, however, is wooing the upper castes after rival BJP tried to project chief ministerial nominee Vasundhara Raje as a Jat leader among the influential community.																								The Gehlot government decided to provide 14 per cent reservation to the economically weak among the upper castes.																								But both chief ministers are unlikely to be able to implement their decisions.																								Digvijay will run into the Supreme Court cap of 50 per cent on total permissible reservations. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes already have a 36 per cent quota in the state and hiking the OBC share from 14 would breach the upper limit.																								Gehlots quota will face problems on the economic criterion involved.																								Congress chief spokesperson S. Jaipal Reddy, however, asserted that the chief ministers contrasting moves were not aimed at the coming polls.																								Reddy told reporters that the states decisions were consistent with party policies and programmes.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 12: Electronic detection equipment recently imported from the West and from Israel have been installed along the Line of Control in Kashmir and they have helped check infiltration over the past few weeks.																								Defence sources claimed that infiltration in September this year was lesser compared to the figures for the same period last year. The figures were still being compiled, they said. Trans-LoC activity usually goes up during this period as forces on both sides prepare for the winter.																								The army chief, General .C. Vij, who returned to Delhi last night after a three-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir, personally surveyed the performance of some of the equipment. Signals from such equipment had alerted forces and there were encounters that were prompted by early detection, defence sources said.																								The army chief stated in a defence ministry release that surveillance equipment along the LoC had been activated and, combined with more frequent patrols, were acting as a deterrent to infiltration. He said the army, the Border Security Force and police had ensured that a record number of attempts to infiltrate into Kashmir were foiled.																								Defence sources referred to an encounter in Naugam sector on the intervening night of October 9 and 10 to illustrate action taken by using surveillance devices. They said as soon as a signal was received, a patrol was diverted to the indicated location where it attacked three Pakistani infiltrators who were killed. 																								Two AK rifles, a pistol and other equipment were said to have been found on them. This was the fifth infiltration bid foiled by the army over a period of seven days.																								The army chief also assessed the work on fencing along the LoC. Fences are being installed along stretches of the line that have been more frequently used by infiltrators.																								The army chief met Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and assessed the situation in the state as winter settled in. He issued orders for counter-insurgency operations to continue throughout the season.																								Earlier, speaking to soldiers in Gurez, North Kashmir, General Vij highlighted an operation in Kanzalwan forest in early September. The army had killed 19 militants and confiscated weapons and stores in the encounter.

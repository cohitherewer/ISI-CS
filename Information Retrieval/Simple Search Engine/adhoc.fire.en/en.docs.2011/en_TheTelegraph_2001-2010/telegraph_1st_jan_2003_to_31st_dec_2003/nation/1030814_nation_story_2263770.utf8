 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai Aug. 13: Pushed into a corner by anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazares indefinite fast, the Democratic Front government has announced some people-friendly laws.																								As Hazares fast-unto-death entered its fifth day, the Maharashtra government said it was thinking of passing an act that will regulate transfers of government officials and prevent administrative delays. If this happens, it will make Maharashtra the first state to examine government transfers.																								Hazare has been demanding a transparent system for postings and transfers and also the removal of tainted ministers and an inquiry against them.																								Another demand  that the President give his assent to the Maharashtra Right to Information Bill  has already been conceded.

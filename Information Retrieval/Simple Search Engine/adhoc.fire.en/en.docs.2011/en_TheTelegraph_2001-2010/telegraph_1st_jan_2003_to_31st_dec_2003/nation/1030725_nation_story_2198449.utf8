 Austerity scare for Digvijay sop
 RASHEED KIDWAI  Digvijay: What next? Bhopal, July 24: The spate of sops being offered by Digvijay Singh to the people has run into a state panels advice to slash salary for certain categories of government officials.With Assembly polls scheduled for November, the recommendations have the potential to antagonise a small but vocal section of officials.The Bramhaswaroop panel has suggested cuts in salary for a large number of gazetted, class II officers such as lecturers, account officers, deputy superintendents of police and assistant statistical officers in the state service.For instance, a slash from Rs 8,000-13,500 to Rs 6,500-10,500 has been suggested for deputy superintendents of police. A similar cut has been recommended for state administrative service officials and government lecturers.The panel, however, has advised an increase in pay scales of nurses, police inspectors and lower-rung officials.State employee associations have already reacted sharply to the recommendations of Brahmaswaroop, a former state chief secretary appointed to review facilities available to state workers.

He went ahead and slapped fines on those trying to forcefully occupy land allotted to Dalits.Farmers, too, are on the sop radar with the state planning to waive Rs 400 crore in electricity dues.When somebody from the finance department objected, Digvijay reportedly joked that in an election year, good economics does not make good politics.Government officials are now demanding to know why they should be singled out when others were getting  Copyright

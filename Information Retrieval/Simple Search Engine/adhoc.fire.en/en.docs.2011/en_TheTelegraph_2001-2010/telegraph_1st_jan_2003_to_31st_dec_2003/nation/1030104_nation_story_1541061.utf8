 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dhumal and Kumar																								New Delhi, Jan. 3: The BJP is banking on its state leaders closing ranks and the Congress infighting to see it through in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections.																								Our main strategy will be to get our ranks together, a central functionary dealing with Himachal said.																								It is well-known that chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal and his predecessor Shanta Kumar  now the rural development minister at the Centre  have been engaged in a turf war although ideally they should have complemented each other. Dhumal and Kumar make a winning combination because they represent the two dominant communities in Himachal: Dhumal is a Thakur, a community that accounts for 24 per cent votes in the state, and Kumar, a Brahmin, represents 18 per cent votes.																								Sources said just as Keshubhai Patel was neutralised in Gujarat with the argument that Narendra Modi was the best possible choice in the circumstances and that he should settle for a position at the Centre, Kumar was told that Dhumal was the BJPs mascot given his clean, uncontroversial image and his record of good governance and he should not be tampered with.																								The sources pointed out that Kumar was persuaded to attend Dhumals recent vikas yatra  a sure sign that they are closing ranks, they claimed.																								The BJP will also have to decide whether to retain its present ally, the Himachal Vikas Congress, led by Sukh Ram. The partys feedback was that Sukh Ram was losing strength to fight independently which is why the state BJP wanted to jettison him.																								Listing the BJPs advantages, sources said Dhumal had managed to erase the traditional upper-lower division in the state, which worked in the Congress favour.																								In the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, we led in 64 of the 68 Assembly segments, they said. The Congress base was in the upper reaches  known as the apple country  while the BJP was stronger in the lower part, called the mango region. Both Kumar and Dhumal hail from the mango region  the former from Kangra and the chief minister from Hamirpur.																								The other advantage was that Dhumals image as Himachals only development face after the states first chief minister, the Congress Y.S. Parmar. It is one of the few states in which development works as an issue. Every home has an ex-serviceman. The most vocal sections are the ex-servicemen and government employees, sources said.																								The hydel projects commissioned during Dhumals tenure were touted as a major source of employment generation  besides making Himachal power-surplus  as were the roads, schools and primary health centres set up over the last five years.																								Sources also spoke of the bandwagon effect in Himachal which, they said, bred a sense of insecurity, prompting them to remain with whoever ruled the Centre. Having a BJP government in Shimla and Delhi helped Dhumal pump in huge money for infrastructure development, they added.																								Even as there is uncertainty as to whether these advantages will work, the BJP is banking on the Congress failing to bring about a rapprochement between Vidya Stokes and Veer Bhadra Singh, both of who are reportedly eyeing the chief ministers chair.																								The partys assessment is that while Sonia Gandhi favours Stokes, Singh is the grassroots leader and has indicated that he will field rebels in seats where Stokes has her way.

		 Saturday, November 29, 2003 				 December CBI date for Judeo 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: As the CBI reportedly gets ready to question two key players in the cash-on-disc controversy, the Congress today objected to Arun Jaitleys alleged linking of the Chhattisgarh chief ministers family to the scam.																								The bureau is expected to question former Union minister Dilip Singh Judeo and his additional private secretary Natwar Rateria after the December 1 polls.																								Sources said the CBI had asked the two to make themselves available for questioning, but they sought time till poll day. Judeo is said to be the BJPs unofficial candidate for Chhattisgarh chief minister.																								Congress chief spokesman S. Jaipal Reddy criticised the Union law minister for flaunting some material, at a media briefing, that allegedly links Ajit Jogis family to the controversy. Is he passing the material to the CBI or is the CBI passing it on to him? he asked, seeking to know the source of the material.																								Jaitley, he emphasised, is not only a BJP leader but also a Union minister. 																								His problem arises when a minister doubles as spokesperson and minister and we would like to know whether he is acting as a minister or a spokesperson of the BJP, Reddy said. Constitutional distinction cannot be lost sight of, he added.																								The CBI has managed to speak to Rateria on phone, when he is said to have given the names and telephone numbers of two persons involved in the scam.

		 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 JP on lips, clean-up cop rolls from Leningrad
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Ojha																								Begusarai, Dec. 26: Former Bihar police chief D.P. Ojha today took to a political platform to launch what he called Total Revolution Part II aimed at dismantling Bihars mafia-politician raj.																								The former director-general of police chose Begusarai, an industrial suburb that was once a CPI bastion and thus called the Leningrad of Bihar, to declare open a movement that is obviously inspired by Jayaprakash Narayans Sampurna Kranti of the mid-1970s.																								There are moments in history when there is a need to rectify the aberrations of a movement. JPs Sampurna Kranti (Total Revolution), over 20-year-old now, was turned into Sampurna Bhranti (complete error) by ruling party leaders who used to be that great leaders followers, Ojha told a 6,000-strong crowd at Behat, about 7 km from here.																								Using a mix of revolutionary rhetoric drawn from Marxist canons and JP, he vowed to fight the incestuous relation between leaders and anti-socials. The state has withered away and it is nowhere seen now while the mafia role is everywhere.																								The governments head is now in mafia hand. The victims of crime are forcibly asked to sign papers to state that they were unaware of the accused involved so that the cases could be hushed up. The political power involved in wheeling-dealings to save the government depend on caste arithmetic to stay on in power, he said to applause and raising of supportive slogans. 																								Ojha referred to the events that led to his ouster as police chief when he implied that Bihar was coming apart at the seams. A don who had employed 12 shooters to commit 20 heinous crimes rises to become an MP of the ruling party. Not only does he get political patronage and the cases against him are destroyed, he was being protected by 12 armed guards provided by the government. When I decided to let the law take its own course on the cases, I was turfed out of my post, he said, without once mentioning the MP in question by name.																								Ojha, who had submitted a report to the government on the alleged criminal activities of Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin a day before his sidelining, was quick to add: I dont want to give the impression that one man is my target. There are so many and the whole lot needs to be weeded out. 																								On Monday, he had vowed to take to the streets when his detractors had claimed that would be the first step to Ojha joining politics. The rumours were fanned again today when 500 motorcycle-borne workers of the CPI, with red flags fluttering from their vehicles, escorted Ojha till Behat from Mokama bridge.																								Ojha, too, added fuel to the fire by clearly saying his early political leanings were towards the CPI. Speculation is rife that he might contest next years general elections from Begusarai as an Independent candidate with CPI support.

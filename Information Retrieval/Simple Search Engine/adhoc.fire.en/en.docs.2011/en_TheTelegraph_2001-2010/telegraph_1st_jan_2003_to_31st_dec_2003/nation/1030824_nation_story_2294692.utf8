 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: At least two persons were killed and nine feared injured when a local train collided with a stationary engine in the Shakoorbasti area of west Delhi this evening. 																								The engine, which was pulling another engine, and the train bound for Rohtak, in Haryana, caught fire under the impact of the collision. Delhi fire service officials had to use gas-cutters to rescue the passengers, mostly daily-wagers returning home, from the bogie behind the engine of the train. 																								Authorities were issuing conflicting figures of the casualties. The injured were rushed to different local hospitals, including the Jaipur Golden hospital and Sanjay Gandhi hospital. 																								Delhi police joint commissioner B.K. Gupta said they had information that two people have died while about nine were injured. Among the dead was a cyclist, who was run over while trying to get across a railway crossing before the collision. Though railway officials did not name him, Delhi police identified him as Sunil Kumar of Bahadurgarh. 																								The incident took place around 7.35 this evening after the local train left Tilak Bridge in New Delhi. It collided 500 metres short of the Shakoorbasti station after travelling for a few kilometres. The coupled engines were headed for the shed, a Northern Railway press information officer said. Senior railway officials, including the commissioner of railway safety, had reached the spot to ascertain the cause of the accident.

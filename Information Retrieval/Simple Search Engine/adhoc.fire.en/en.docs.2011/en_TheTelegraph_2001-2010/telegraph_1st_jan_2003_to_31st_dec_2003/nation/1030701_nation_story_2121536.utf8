		 Tuesday, July 01, 2003 				 BJP sniffs cash stink in trip
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, June 30: The BJP has alleged that the ostensible purpose of chief minister Ashok Gehlots visit to the US is to raise election funds.																								Rajasthan BJP spokesperson Kali Charan Saraf accused Gehlot of maligning the Vajpayee government by alleging that it had denied him permission for the trip. Gehlot is scheduled to go to the US to attend the Rajasthani Sammelan organised by expatriates.																								A spokesperson of the state government today confirmed that Gehlots visit got the Centres nod last evening.																								Pressure mounted on Gehlot from another flank, too, with Rajasthan High Court seeking clarifications on how the US visit will benefit the state. The court had pursued the matter on its own following media reports on Gehlots tour plan.																								The BJP spokesperson lashed out at Gehlot for launching a systematic campaign to malign the Centre despite getting timely approval to visit the US. The visit was unlikely to attract any industrial investment as was being claimed by the government, he said.																								The real purpose of Gehlots visit to the US is to raise funds from expatriate Marwaris for the forthcoming elections, Saraf alleged. 																								The foreign ministrys initial reluctance to clear Gehlots trip had triggered a controversy with the Congress accusing the Centre of being biased against its chief ministers. Before Gehlot, Madhya Pradeshs Digvijay Singh and Delhis Sheila Dikshit had been denied permission to go abroad.

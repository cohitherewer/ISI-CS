The eastern town of Gorakhpur erupted in violence on Wednesday when a procession of Holi revellers, led by local Hindu Mahasabha MP Mahant Adityanath, allegedly damaged Muslim properties in parts of the city.				 																																																	Later, the Imam of Ghazi Rauza mosque and another person were killed and 50 were seriously injured. Another injured person died on Thursday.				 																																																	Though state additional director-general of police (law and order) Vikram Singh said the situation was tense but under control, sources in Gorakhpur said they feared the trouble could spread to other parts of the region.

Adityanath, also the head priest of Gorakhnath temple, rebuffed the charges and claimed the killings were part of a conspiracy to eliminate him.

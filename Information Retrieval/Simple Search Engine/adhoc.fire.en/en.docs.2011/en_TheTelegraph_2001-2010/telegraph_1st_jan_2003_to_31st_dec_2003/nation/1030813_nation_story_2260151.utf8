 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Aug. 12: In an anti-climax to the Tamil Nadu standoff, one of the employees unions which had challenged the constitutional validity of the ordinance that amended the Essential Services Maintenance Act today withdrew its fresh petition in Madras High Court.																								The ordinance, enacted by the Jayalalithaa regime last month, had armed the government with powers to dismiss the striking employees without an inquiry.																								Hours before Justice K. Govindarajan was to pronounce his orders on the petition by the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Subordinate Officers Association, its president, . Dhandapani, filed an application saying he was withdrawing the petition. Accepting the application, the court dismissed the petition.																								Dhandapani later said he withdrew the petition in deference to the wishes of other union leaders to avoid a fresh standoff between the employees and the state government, and also to pave the way for amicably resolving the cases of the yet-to-be-reinstated employees.																								The Tamil Nadu government today de-recognised with immediate effect all employees and teachers unions that had called the strike. The move comes in the wake of the Supreme Courts observation that the strike was illegal. 																								The Supreme Court bench, which heard the sacking case last week, did not consider the constitutional validity of the Tamil Nadu Essential Services Maintenance Act, 2002, and the ordinance, as the government had gracefully agreed to reinstate most of the 1.70 lakh employees and teachers of aided institutions.																								While the apex court noted that the government had in the last instance agreed to reinstate 8,063 employees, the remaining 6,072 employees (including 2,211 arrested staff, 2,215 secretariat employees and 534 officers holding high positions) would be treated as suspended. About 1.5 lakh employees were taken back before the final hearing in the Supreme Court.																								The cases of these suspended employees would be heard by three retired high court judges to be named by the high court chief justice.

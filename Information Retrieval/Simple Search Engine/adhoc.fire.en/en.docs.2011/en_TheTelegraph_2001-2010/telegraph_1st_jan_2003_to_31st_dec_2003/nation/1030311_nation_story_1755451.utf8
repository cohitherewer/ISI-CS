		 Tuesday, March 11, 2003 				 Paswan rally to block VHP 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 10: Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan is organising a Bharat Bachao rally to counter the VHPs satyagraha to mobilise support for the Ram temple construction. 																								The rally, to be attended by delegates from across the country, will focus on the economic and communal policy pursued by the NDA government, Paswan said, demanding a ban on the VHP, the Bajrang Dal and the RSS for spreading the communal poison. 																								Telegana Sangharsh Samiti chief Chandrashekhar Rao, former BJP legislator Narendra, also a supporter of a separate Telegana state, leaders from western Uttar Pradesh demanding a separate Haritpradesh and leaders from Vidharbha would also take part in the rally. 																								Paswan has declared support for smaller states. 																								In the name of nationalisation, this government is pursuing its agenda of privatisation, which is only helping the elite class, he regretted. 																								Charging Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani with propping up a corrupt government in Uttar Pradesh, Paswan criticised them for inept handling of the controversial tape issue in the state. 																								Both Atalji and Advaniji, instead of debating the issue in Parliament, twisted the matter on the point of technicality, he said.

		 Tuesday, May 06, 2003 				 SC notice to states on judges pay hike
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 5: The Supreme Court today directed the chief secretaries and advocates-general of 21 states, including several eastern and northeastern states, to be present in person in court on Friday to answer why their governments have not yet implemented the Justice Jagannatha Shetti Commissions recommendation on increasing pay-scales and pension for judges across the country.																								Asking the Centre to file an affidavit on steps initiated in this regard, a three-member bench of Chief Justice V.N. Khare and Justices S. Rajendra Babu and M.B. Shah posted further hearings to Friday.																								Over 13,000 judges and judicial officers, both serving and retired, are expecting the states to implement the commissions recommendations on hiking salary, perks, pension and other benefits.																								The states, however, have cited fragile financial status for their inability to implement the recommendations.																								The 21 states which will have to answer the court are Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Orissa, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura.																								Attorney-general Soli Sorabjee told the court that most Union Territories have implemented the recommendations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, February 21, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Ex-PM families security curtailed				 																																																	 new delhi: The Special Protection Group (Amendment) Bill, which restricts security cover for the families of former prime ministers to a year after they leave office, was passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, reports our correspondent.				 																																																	The security, that will depend on intelligence assessment of the threat perception to the person concerned, will continue if there is fear of assassination or attack.				 																																																	The Bill lays down that protection to the immediate family members of former prime ministers will be for three months. Even this will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.				 																																																	The changes have been made because of the enormous manpower and money spent annually on protecting not just the former prime ministers but also their family members.				 																																																	Minister of state for home I.D. Swamy, who introduced the Bill, said there was a shortage of SPG personnel. The total expenditure on the SPG so far has been Rs 556 crore. Every year, Rs 75 crore is spent on the protection group.				 																SC laments slow trials				 																																																	 new delhi: The Hinduja brothers bail plea on Thursday made the Supreme Court lament over the slow process of criminal trials in the country in general and the Bofors case in particular, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	When Ram Jethmalani, senior counsel for the three Hinduja brothers  Srichand, Gopichand and Prakashchand  pointed out to the court how the case has dragged on for over 13 years now, the bench observed that criminal trial in India is a slow-motion picture.				 																																																	A division bench of Justices M.B. Shah and Arun Kumar, however, fixed February 27 for further hearing on the bail plea of the Hindujas, seeking a direction from the court that all the three brothers be allowed to go abroad simultaneously. Earlier, the apex court had ordered that one of the brothers should remain in India whenever the other two or one of them goes abroad.				 																																																	Replying to Justice Shah on the accused persons promise that no stay of trial proceedings would be sought, Jethmalani said the brothers had scrupulously kept their promises and had never sought a stay of the trial.				 																																																	However, after the accused brothers were discharged from the case by Delhi High Court, they sought stay of the trial at a much later stage when the CBIs appeal against quashing of charges against them came up for hearing in the apex court.

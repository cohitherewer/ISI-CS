 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 6: Underworld don Dawood Ibrahims brothers Noora and Mustaquim and some others detained in Dubai recently are believed to have been let off by authorities in the emirate. Government officials, however, said they have no confirmation about their release.																								Sources in intelligence agencies said they have information from informal contacts that some underworld operatives, probably Dawoods brothers who are not involved in criminal cases in India, have been released.																								Dawood has five brothers. Apart from Anees, who is said to have been allowed to leave the emirate on bail, his other siblings staying in Dubai are Noorul Haque alias Noora, Mustaquim, Humayun and Iqbal Hassan.																								Sources said the Dubai authorities are still to respond to the Interpol communiqu, sent to them on Tuesday. The CBI, through the Interpol, had requested the authorities there to confirm if they had detained the underworld operatives wanted by India.																								The others on the list of six that the CBI has asked Dubai to confirm include Eijaz Pathan and Mohammad Dossa, both accused in the 1993 Bombay blasts case, and Aftab Batki, who runs a counterfeit currency business of the D-company. 																								Diplomatic channels are also being explored to seek confirmation of their detention.																								Government sources said that even today some people are said to have been detained in Dubai. The Indian government is believed to be bargaining with the United Arab Emirates on the fugitives they would like to get back.																								The sources say there is a growing realisation on the part of Indian authorities that they would not be able to get the Dawood brothers. So they are likely to settle for the second-rung criminals against whom red corner notices are pending.																								Government officials feel there is a need to work silently, rather than frequently going to the media on what is happening in the UAE.

		 Sunday, January 12, 2003 				 NRI tragedy before festival
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 11: At a time when the Centre is extending a warm welcome to its people at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, comes a news not many non- resident Indians would like to remember.																								A US-based NRI was abducted from the Palam Airport in Delhi and murdered by three persons, including his girlfriend, in Gurgaon, Haryana, on December 26.																								According to Haryana police, Shivani Chopra and her paramour Manish have been arrested for abducting and murdering 50-year-old businessman Ashok Jain. The third accused is at large and the police are yet to recover the belongings of the deceased.																								Jain, who came from Mumbai and was settled in the US, owned shops in Karol Bagh, a prime shopping area of Delhi, selling artificial jewellery and antique items. Shivani was a receptionist in one of his shops when she met Jain more than two years ago. The two developed a close relationship, which ended in a nightmare for Jain.																								Gurgaon senior superintendent of police K.S. Sihag told The Telegraph that a few days ago an unidentified body was found in the Sohna police station area. They also found a Jet Airways luggage tag bearing the name A. Jain.																								The police called up the airlines office and found out Jains residential address in Mumbai. But it was his Delhi-based relatives who identified the body, the police said. They gave the police Jains mobile number.																								After analysing the printouts of the cellphone, the police zeroed in on a Delhi number that belonged to Shivani Chopra, a 26-year-old woman. She had spoken to Jain for the last time on December 26  the day he had landed at Palam Airport, Sihag said. Jain had called her from Mumbai, requesting her to meet him at the airport.																								During interrogation, Shivani broke down and confessed to her involvement in the murder. Shivani revealed she was having an affair with Jain and Manish at the same time. She said she had lost interest in the businessman but had carried on because of the bounties he showered on her. In the meantime, she had met Manish, a resident of Lucknow and a divorcee like her. The police official said the two murdered Jain because he was a hurdle in their relationship.

		 Monday, October 27, 2003 				 BJP terms Vajpayee peace push final effort
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Oct. 26: The BJP today said the Prime Ministers dozen peace proposals to Pakistan were Indias final effort at ushering in lasting peace.																								Party chief M. Venkaiah Naidus stand, made clear while interacting with reporters at the Chennai airport, is an iteration of defence minister George Fernandes remarks yesterday that the measures were part of Indias last effort to take Atal Bihari Vajpayees peace initiative to its logical end.																								Naidu said the BJP expected Pakistan to respond positively to the proposals as these constituted Delhis final effort for lasting Indo-Pak relations. External affairs minister Yashwant Sinha had announced the proposals on Wednesday.																								Naidu was categorical in his reassertion that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India, in an apparent reference to Islamabads suggestion of a composite dialogue to resolve all disputes, including Kashmir. 																								There is no question of giving away even an inch of land in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP chief said.																								He underscored the Centres oft-repeated position that Pakistan should stop sponsoring cross-border terrorism, saying there is no place for it in any form of peaceful co-existence. 																								Naidu took the opportunity to urge states not to misuse the anti-terror legislation. Without naming Tamil Nadu, which has the largest number of cases booked under the law, he emphasised that states should use it only against terrorists and not against political opponents. 																								The Vishwa Hindu Parishads state unit said here in a press release that general secretary Praveen Togadia would visit Pasumponn village in Sivaganga district on October 30 to pay homage to freedom fighter Pasumponn Muthuramalinga Thevar at his memorial on Thevar Jayanthi day. Thevar was a disciple of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Togadias visit to Thevar Samadhi would perhaps be the first by a top VHP leader in recent years.

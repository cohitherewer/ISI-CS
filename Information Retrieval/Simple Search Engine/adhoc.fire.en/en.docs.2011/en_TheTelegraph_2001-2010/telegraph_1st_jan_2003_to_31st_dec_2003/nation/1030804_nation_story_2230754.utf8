Following a state home department directive, the police on Saturday night registered a case against Fr Clement Kujur for allegedly sodomising Buddhadev Behera, a 17-year-old caretaker in the same institute.				 																																																										However, the police said they cannot arrest Kujur as he is undergoing treatment at the Baripada headquarters hospital, where he was admitted on Saturday following illness. The boy has been sent to the district hospital for medical examination.				 																																																										Kujur was coordinator of the North Orissa Resource Centre, a Baripada-based wing of the Centre for Development, Research and Training run by the Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar, when he reportedly committed the offence in January last year. Kujur had joined the institute in Gangraj village near Baripada three years ago. 				 																																																										Behera first complained to the Xaviers management against Kujur. They did not seem to have taken note, but later transferred Kujur to Loyla school in Sankhabhanga village near Baripada. The home department, which was investigating the allegation, gave the go-ahead on Saturday.				 																Hrithik hearing today Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has deferred  till Monday four petitions filed by filmmaker Rakesh Roshan  and his son Hrithik urging quashing of complaints of alleged  cheating against them in a lower court. The high court has  restrained police from arresting the Roshans in the cases.				 																																																										The petitions will come up for hearing before Justice V.M. Kanade. One petition was filed by the duo on July 28, while three others were filed on Saturday, Roshans lawyer Dipesh Mehta said. The petitions urged the high court to quash the criminal proceedings launched against the Roshans in a magistrates court by Jayantilal Gada, managing director of Popular Entertainment Network Ltd. 				 																																																										The petitions also urged a stay in the proceedings and asked the court to restrain Khar police from arresting them. The Roshans also sought the quashing of an order delivered by the magistrate in Bandra in May directing the police to investigate the charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust registered against the two.

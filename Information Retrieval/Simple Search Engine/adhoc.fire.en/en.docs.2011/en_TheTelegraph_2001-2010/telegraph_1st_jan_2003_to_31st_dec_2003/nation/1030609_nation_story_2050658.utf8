		 Monday, June 09, 2003 				 CBI to quiz Ajit Jogi
																								New Delhi, June 8 (PTI): Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi will soon be questioned by the CBI after the Intelligence Bureau denied his charge that it was engaged in tarnishing his image.																								Highly-placed CBI sources said the agency had sought time from Jogi to ask him to reveal the name of the source of a letter, on which he had based his complaints.																								The sources said the state director, information, had sought some clarifications like who were the accused named and under what sections of the Indian Penal Code it was registered.																								The CBI had last month shot off a letter to the chief minister asking him to make it convenient for its sleuths to question him in connection with the allegations levelled by him against the Intelligence Bureau. 																								The CBI had registered cases under Sections 417, 465, 468, 469 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code against unknown persons after receiving complaints of forgery of documents in the name of the special directorate, Intelligence Bureau.																								Asked whether it was mandatory for the chief minister to reveal the source of the letter, the sources said it was necessary as it would help solve the case. 																								The Intelligence Bureau had earlier denied Jogis charges that its sleuths had launched a special operation, code-named Black Sea, to tarnish his image in the state, which goes to polls later this year.																								The sources said the Intelligence Bureau told the CBI investigators that neither did any such directorate exist, nor had any such operation been launched.																								The CBI probe is aimed at verifying the authenticity of documents furnished by Jogi relating to his allegation that the Intelligence Bureau had launched an operation to defame the BJPs political opponents.

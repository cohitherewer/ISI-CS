		 Tuesday, July 15, 2003 				 Pawn Kalyan points at Big 2
																								London, July 14 (PTI): Kalyan Singh blamed Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani for the Babri Masjid demolition, claiming he was used as a pawn and deceived by the BJP and the Sangh parivar.																								I am telling you the names of the conspirators. The RSS chief at that time, Rajendra Singh, present sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudharshan, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, and Ashok Singhal and Giriraj Kishore of the VHP. It was the collective conspiracy of all these (people), Singh said while participating in Aap Ki Baat, BBC Ke Saath programme yesterday.																								So far as the conspiracy is concerned, I was kept totally in the dark  I was deceived, it was a breach of trust by the entire Sangh parivar, whether it be the VHP, the Bajrang Dal or the BJP, Singh, who was then chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, said. 																								He claimed he had no hand, directly or indirectly, in the pulling down of the structure. 																								They hatched a conspiracy so secretly to the extent, that I was not told anything.																								Singh said he was used as a pawn by the BJP, which wanted to exploit the issue for electoral gains. 																								They thought they could project me as a hero so that later they could make me zero politically. But they were mistaken. They are heading for a political zero in Uttar Pradesh, he said.																								Last time they had won 176 Assembly seats, this time they have 76 and in the next Assembly elections, they are not going to have more than 16-17 seats, Singh added.																								The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said if the Liberhan Commission, currently probing the demolition of the structure, summoned him, he would depose before it. So far as the Liberhan Commission is concerned, if it summons me, calls me  I will go.																								Singh, who has been expelled from the BJP, claimed: The entire Sangh parivar  Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi  all of them kept me in the dark. These leaders kept on talking about superficial issues with me.																								The affidavit which I was asked to submit before the Supreme Court was on the basis of the letters of Chinmayananda and the late Vijayaraje Scindia which pledged protection to the structure and also that no new construction would be done in the disputed area. These letters had clearly stated there would be a token kar seva on December 6.																								I had trusted all of them, and they made me submit an affidavit before the Supreme Court, that the structure would be protected, which did not happen, he said. 																								Even the new makeshift Hindu structure that came up was in contempt of court and I was handed a sentence of one day, and a fine of Rs 2,000. I have complied with both of them, Singh added.																								But look at these Sangh and BJP leaders, they do not have the courage to stand up and face the truth. They should have the courage to come out with the truth and accept the moral responsibility and say that yes, this has happened.																								Asserting that he wants the world to know the truth, Singh said: Today I am saying that BJP leaders are responsible for the demolition. At that time I was silent, it is true, but that was for the party discip- line. Today, I am clearly saying.																								Asked what BJP leaders like Vajpayee and Advani told him after the demolition of the structure, Singh said: What could they say and with what face? It was over once the structure had been pulled down. Let Advani today say whatever he wants. I ask him, why did he distribute sugar there, when the structure was pulled down? In the Bangalore session of the BJP in 1993, how and why did Advani call December 6, 1992, liberation day in his presidential address? And why did Vajpayee endorse this address? he asked.

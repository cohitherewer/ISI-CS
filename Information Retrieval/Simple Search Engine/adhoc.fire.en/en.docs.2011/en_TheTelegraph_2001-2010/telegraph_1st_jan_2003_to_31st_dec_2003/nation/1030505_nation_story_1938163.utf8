																								New Delhi, May 4 (PTI): Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee has asserted that his government is willing to reform madarsa education if there is a consensus within the Muslim community. 																								The Islamic Council of India said the step is necessary to dispel certain misleading propaganda about these theological schools.																								In a message to councils chairman Qari Mian Mazhari, in connection with a national symposium of representatives of madarsas today, Vajpayee asked Islamic leaders to evolve a consensus on introducing science, computer education, English and vocational training as part of the curriculum.																								Madarsas have produced many freedom fighters and make one a good human being, but it requires modern education to enable the students to play an active part in the nations progress and development, he said in the message.																								The Prime Minister said the National Democratic Alliance government is duty bound to ensure the educational and economic upliftment of the minority community.

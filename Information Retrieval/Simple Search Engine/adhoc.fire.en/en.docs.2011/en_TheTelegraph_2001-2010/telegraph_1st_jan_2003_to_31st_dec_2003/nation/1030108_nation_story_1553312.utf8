 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Patna, Jan. 7: The 16-year-old daughter of a bank officer was killed yesterday over a land dispute with builders in Shastrinagar  the same locality where an infamous encounter that set Patna afire occurred.																								Four armed goons, allegedly of a real estate developer, opened fire on Ashoke Ghoses daughter Jaya and wife Indrani. Jaya died and an injured Indrani was rushed to Patna Medical College and Hospital. Ghose was not at home then.																								Only last week, there was widespread arson and violence in Shastrinagar after three youths were shot in an encounter at a local market. The latest killing has fuelled fear in the locality.																								The Shastrinagar police have registered a case against two local builders who were named as the accused.																								Indrani told the police that A.P. Singh and M.P. Singh had last afternoon urged her to sell a piece of Ghoses land at Surya Bihar Colony in Asiananagar locality. Earlier, they had approached Ghose for a deal, she said. Ghose had refused outright.																								We offered them tea and there was a discussion for a few minutes. We repeated our earlier stand. The two persons then called some of their men, who began scaring us by firing from their revolvers, Indrani told the police.																								When she and her daughter tried to shut the door, the goons fired at Jaya. Indrani, too, was fired at when she jumped to her daughters rescue.																								Security has been beefed up in Shastrinagar after students and residents threatened to take the issue to the streets. 																								According to police sources, the builders have been forcing some long-time landowners in the city, especially Bengalis, to dispose of their land at throwaway prices.																								Several instances have been reported when builders have forcibly encroached on trust land to build multi-storeyed buildings.																								Last year, a person was killed in Anandpuri locality in a fight between two builders. A delegation of local Bengalis had met the district magistrate and expressed their resentment over landgrabbing and demanded security for themselves.

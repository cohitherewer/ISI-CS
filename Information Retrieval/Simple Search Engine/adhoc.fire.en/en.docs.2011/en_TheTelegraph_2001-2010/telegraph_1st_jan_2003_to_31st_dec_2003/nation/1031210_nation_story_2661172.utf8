		 Wednesday, December 10, 2003 				 Pak proposes train to Delhi
 IMTIAZ GUL 																								Islamabad, Dec. 9: Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri today said his country would like to link Lahore with the Indian capital by a train service.																								Speaking at a seminar on conflict resolution and regional cooperation, Kasuri said: We have proposed to the Indian side to extend the Samjhauta Express to New Delhi instead of stopping at Attari.																								Pakistani railway officials are due to arrive in Delhi on December 17 for the two-day talks aimed at resuming the Samjhauta Express that shuttled between Lahore and Attari, a few kilometres off the Wagah border. The express is the only rail link between India and Pakistan.																								Kasuri said confidence-building measures like establishment of a proposed communication link between Indian and Pakistani coast guards, to address difficulties faced by fishermen in particular, could also help improve bilateral relations ahead of the regional Saarc summit in Islamabad early next month. 																								The process of CBMs (confidence-building measures) must continue for durable peace and stability in South Asia, Kasuri said.																								The minister iterated that the Kashmir dispute lies at the core of (the) problems and both countries hold diametrically positions on it. Yet, he emphasised, a way forward has to be found and a choice has to be made.

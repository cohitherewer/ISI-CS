																								Lucknow, June 25 (PTI): Ignoring vehement opposition from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to a negotiated settlement of the Ayodhya tangle on the basis of the Kanchi seers formula, All India Muslim Personal Law Board today made it clear that it would go ahead with its July 6 meeting of the working committee to discuss the seers proposals.																								The VHPs opposition will have no affect on the boards working committee meeting slated for July 6 to consider the seers formula, board spokesperson Maulana Sajjad Nomani said.																								It may be recalled that a meeting of the pro-vhp saints at Ayodhya yesterday had asked the Kanchi seer to stop his efforts to broker any solution of the Ayodhya issue with some Muslim organisations.																								The meeting warned the nda government that if vhp and sants are not taken into confidence in the matter, a country-wide agitation would be launched to oppose the one-sided move.

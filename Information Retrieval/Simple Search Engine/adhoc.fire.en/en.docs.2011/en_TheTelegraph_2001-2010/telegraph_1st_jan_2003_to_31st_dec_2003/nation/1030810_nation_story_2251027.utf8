		 Sunday, August 10, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Damages rap for deficient MTNL				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi consumer court has ordered the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd to pay Rs 5,000 as compensation to a person for not repairing his telephone despite repeated requests.				 																																																										The telephone is not meant to be a showpiece... If the telephone goes out of order frequently (as in this case) and if is not set right...then naturally MTNL is deficient in service, the New Delhi District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum said in its order.				 																																																										Complainant Manoj Kumar alleged that his telephone was not functioning for 9 days in August 2001, 13 days in January and December, 2001, for a week in February and April, 2002, besides 10 days in May and June, 2002.				 																																																										Kumar sought a compensation of Rs 30,000 for the harassment caused to him by MTNL and Rs 15,000 towards costs.				 																																																										MTNL contended that it had granted rent rebate to the complainant as per department rules whenever the instrument had remained faulty continuously for more than a week.				 																																																										But district forum president L.C. Jain and members Janak Juneja and R. Narayana rejected this argument saying just giving rebate is no solace to the subscriber for the agony he underwent when his telephone was dead... Its working is also essential for the subscriber.				 																J amp;K lawyer faces terror queries New Delhi: A Srinagar-based lawyer was  questioned on Saturday by a joint team of Delhi police and  intelligence agencies following allegations that he had  stayed with two alleged militants in the city, reports our  special correspondent.

The polices special cell also found Rs 10 lakh.

He had come to know through the media that his name had figured in it. 				 																																																										Police sources alleged that Bhatt had come along with Sheikh and Saifuddin, said to be Jamait-ul-Mujahideen militants, to Delhi on July 23 and stayed with them.

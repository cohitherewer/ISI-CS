		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 BJP rekindles Najma hope
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 23: The BJP hopes to get Najma Heptullah re-elected to the Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra with the Nationalist Congress Partys help when her term expires next year.																								Heptullah is the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson and her term as a Congress MP ends on July 4, 2004.																								The BJP recently tried to get her inducted into the Upper House as one of eight presidential nominees. But though seven MPs were nominated by the President two months ago, the eighth seat was left vacant.																								The deputy chairperson has been at loggerheads with the Congress for some time. Matters came to a head on December 12 when she adjourned the House and walked out in a huff following a remark by party MP Kapil Sibal.																								The Congress has been reluctant to give Heptullah a fresh lease of life in the Rajya Sabha, whose member she has been since 1980. Rubbing salt into the wound, the party chose not to back her for the Vice-Presidents post when it fell vacant. Ever since, the deputy chairpersons relations with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi have been bitter. She has not been attending party meetings for the last two years.																								Realising that the chances of the Congress re-nominating her are slim, Heptullah has chosen to open a channel of communication with the BJP and the NCP.																								The deputy chairperson planned to quit the Congress before the anti-defection law was passed. She had hoped to re-enter the Rajya Sabha as a presidential nominee with the BJPs help after the law took effect. 																								But the BJPs attempts to nominate Heptullah fell through after top Congress leaders expressed displeasure at the move. BJP floor managers felt she would not be able to muster the required votes to get elected to the deputy chairpersons post. They also feared that all nominated MPs would not vote for Heptullah and felt the BJP could not be sure it would win the support of even these members. 																								An influential BJP leader also objected to the nomination move.																								 A message was also sent to the Presidents office urging A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to reject her file as he had done in the case of Samata Party leader Jaya Jaitly.																								The Congress told the BJP it would consider the nomination a very unfriendly and deliberate act of provocation. A senior leader told the BJP leadership that the Congress had failed to secure Heptullahs loyalty even after 26 years of association with the party. It was unlikely the BJP would succeed where the Congress had failed, he said.

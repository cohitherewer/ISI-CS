		 Monday, July 21, 2003 				 Desam move
																								Hyderabad, July 20: The Telugu Desam plans to move an adjournment motion in Parliament tomorrow over what it claims are illegal constructions by Karnataka on the Krishna and its tributaries, reports our special correspondent.																								A marathon parliamentary party session authorised Desam members to stall proceedings in the House if the Speaker disallows the motion. Spokesman U. Venkateswarlu said: We will also use the provisions of Article 193 to place our views on the undemocratic acts of Karnataka in denying Andhra its due share of Krishna waters. The party also said it would not support a bill on Ayodhya if the BJP tried to pass it in the monsoon session.

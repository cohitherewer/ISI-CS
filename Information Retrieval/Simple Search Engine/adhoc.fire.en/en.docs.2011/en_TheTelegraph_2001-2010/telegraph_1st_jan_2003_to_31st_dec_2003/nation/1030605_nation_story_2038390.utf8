 															- CM seeks fizz for womens groups			JayalalithaaBuy a two-litre Coke bottle and take a wicker basket free.																								Its not on offer yet but it could be  or some other version of it  if Patrick T. Siewert, Coca-Colas East and South Asia group president, meant what he told Jayalalithaa.																								Siewert made a courtesy call on the Tamil Nadu chief minister at her office to deliver syrupy concentrates of praise  as sweet as Pepsi?  for Jayalalithaas enthusing administrative abilities. 																								She may or may not have a sweet tooth but no politician has ever confessed to not feeling thirsty for a kind word or two about themselves.																								Jayalalithaa did not simply smile and nod approvingly. She sprang a proposition Siewert could not say no to. Would Coke, please, use its Kashmir-to-Kanyakumari distribution network to sell handicrafts made by womens self-help groups in Tamil Nadu?																								The Coke executive agreed to consider her proposal. Its difficult to tell if its one of those things people agree to because they cant say no, but anybody should know the dangers of tangling with Jayalalithaa.																								On the contrary, theres something quite absurd in imagining Coke selling wicker baskets, though approval ratings from globalisation bashers would be high. 																								Self-help groups, promoted in the thousands to economically empower women, is an experiment close to Jayalalithaas heart. These groups make a wide variety of handmade products and handicraft items at village and district levels. But, in the absence of a wide marketing network, they have to depend on erratic state-sponsored efforts to sell through exhibitions.																								Whether Coke will pursue the proposal is up for debate but it expressed the intent to invest more money in Tamil Nadu. The company said it planned to put up two more bottling units next year.																								Siewert laid it on thick, telling Jayalalithaa that Coke was buying most of the sugar it requires from Tamil Nadu because the quality was very good.																								The government has decided to privatise the states loss-making sugar cooperative factories and theres potential here for business to be done with Coke, including the possibility of the company picking up a large chunk of shares in them. 																								As a gaggle of government officials and Coke managers, including the chief executive officer in India, Alex von Behr, listened attentively, he paid compliments to Jayalalithaa for her progressive steps to open up the states economy for higher growth rates.																								Business is welcome, but Jayalalithaa turned the talk towards the social sector, too. She said Coke could help upgrade primary schools and primary health centres. Not to mention the wicker basket, of course.					 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN CHENNAI

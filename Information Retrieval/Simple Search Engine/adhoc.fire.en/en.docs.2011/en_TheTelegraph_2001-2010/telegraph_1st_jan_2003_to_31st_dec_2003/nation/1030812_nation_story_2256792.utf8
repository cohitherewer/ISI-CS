Farmers flex muscle at banks Kozhikode (PTI): The Kerala Farmers  Relief Forum on Monday asked all banks to write off agricultural  loans sanctioned to farmers and threatened to physically  counter recovery measures.				 																																																										According to the forums state general secretary, Thomas Kalapura, and state secretary P.P. Abdurahiman, a majority of the farmers who availed agricultural loans are not in a position to even meet their day-to-day requirements and are being harassed by the banks.				 																																																										Alleging that bank officials were indulging in inhuman acts to recover the loans sanctioned to poor farmers, they said the forum would in protest observe Farmers Day, which falls on August 17, as black day.				 																																																										The forum, they said, has already informed the government that farmers who had availed loans were not even in a position to pay the interest and, therefore, the loans should be written off.

They alleged that while the banks had not taken any steps against about 215 people who had availed over Rs 1 crore as loan since 1983, poor farmers alone were being targeted for recovery.

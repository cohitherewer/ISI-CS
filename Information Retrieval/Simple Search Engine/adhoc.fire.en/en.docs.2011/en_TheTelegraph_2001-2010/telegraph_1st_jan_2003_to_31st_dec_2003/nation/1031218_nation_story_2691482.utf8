		 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Fisherfolk float formula to bridge the creek
 BHARAT BHUSHAN				 	 A Pakistani fisherman with his children in Karachi after his release from an Indian jail. (Reuters)																								Ibrahim Hyderi (Karachi), Dec. 17: It is 5.30 in the evening and the fishing village of Ibrahim Hyderi, about 30 km from Karachi, is abuzz. About 2,000 Sindhi fishermen, with a large presence of women, have gathered to welcome an Indian. He is neither a Sindhi nor a Muslim.																								Suddenly someone shouts: Sabne naara lagaya hai Thomas Kocherry aaya hai. (Everyone is cheering Thomas Kocherry has come). Then clapping and singing in a lilting Sindhi accent the crowd starts chanting Velcome, Velcome. Thomas Kocherry Velcome.																								The young chairman of the Pakistan Fisherfolks Forum, Mohammad Ali Shah, escorts Father Thomas Kocherry, the president of the World Forum of Fisher People, to his seat.																								A fishermens theatre group has decided to entertain him. The skit begins with a dandy telling his wife that since her uncle (mama) from India worked for the welfare of fishermen, he should be honoured. Before the wife can guess what is in the offing, he declares that he is going to pour 63 mugs of cow dung over her 63-year-old mamas head. When she protests, he threatens to commit suicide.																								Scared at the prospect of becoming an orphan, his daughter gives in first and then the wife. She hesitatingly invites her mama on to the stage.																								Shaking his head in bewilderment, Kocherry goes up. The fisherman begins to empty a bucket he had filled with cow dung over his bald pate. Lo and behold, rose petals pour out of it by the kilo. The crowd erupts with loud clapping and whistling.																								Who would have thought that a mild-mannered Indian trade union leader of fishermen would be welcomed like this in Pakistan?																								Then a local fishermens leader, Majid Motani, comes on stage to say that he had spent three-and-a-half months in Porbandar Jail in 1988 after being arrested by the Indian Coast Guard. There are many in the crowd who have been imprisoned in Porbandar, Koteshwar and elsewhere in Gujarat.																								They are victims of an unresolved boundary dispute between India and Pakistan over a 38-km-long estuary, the Sir Creek. Because of the disputed land boundary along the creek, the maritime boundary has also not been demarcated. Fishermen from both sides often find themselves behind bars for fishing in alien territorial waters.																								Haji Shafi Mohammad Jamawar, chairman of the Pakistan Fishermens Cooperative Society, admits: We go across deliberately. Every fisherman worth his salt knows where he is from the position of stars, from the creeks. But we go in search of fish.																								Jamawar, who has visited Pakistani fishermen in Indian jails, says: The solution is not to arrest us but to allow joint fishing. Give quantity licences to fishermen on both sides, along with photo ID cards so that they are not mistaken for spies and terrorists.																								Shah echoes his sentiments. The custodian of all water bodies, he says, should be the fishing community. We will implement a sustainable fishing policy. Fishermen should be allowed to share border resources. The Pakistan government licenses foreign trawlers to destroy fish resources but has no policy for us, he says.																								Kocherry tells the crowd that the demand for sharing border resources is not outlandish. 																								The fish in Lake Victoria breed in the territorial waters of Kenya but then go off to Ugandan waters. Are Kenyan fishermen, therefore, to be denied access to fish? In the case of India and Sri Lanka, Colombo has already agreed to declare the border fisheries resources as a joint resource. This is what should be done between India and Bangladesh as well as India and Pakistan, he argues. He supports giving licences signed by the two countries sharing the border to prevent the fishermens arrest.																								He tells the Sindhi fishermen the good news that the Indian and Pakistani coast guard had come to an agreement on fishermen arrested in their territory  they are obliged to inform the other country within 24 hours; each countrys coast guard has to inform the fishermens families of the arrest and the case is to be settled within 30 days.																								When Kocherry says people are more important than territory and all the borders in the world, he brings the house down. Men, women and children give him a standing ovation.																								It is well past 9 at night. He is escorted to the fisherfolk unions office for a snack of samosas, potato chips and Pepsi. Please have something. We have spent our hard-earned money on this, someone tells him; others want pictures with him; children jostle for his autograph.

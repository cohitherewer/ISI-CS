		 Friday, August 22, 2003 				 Karisma to wed in October
																								Mumbai, Aug. 21 (PTI): Karisma Kapoor, who essayed the roles of a firebrand protagonist fighting against all odds in films like Zubeida and Anari, has opted for an arranged marriage with a Delhi-based businessman. 																								The wedding bells for the 28-year-old granddaughter of showman Raj Kapoor with industrialist Sanjay Kapoor of Sona Steering Company will ring around Dussera in October.																								The actress, who was lauded for her role as an obsessive lover married to a member of a royal family in Zubeida or that of a girl who is born with a silver spoon but defies family pressure to marry a simpleton domestic help in Anari, will settle down to being Biwi No 1 by tying the nuptial knot in the traditional fashion.																								The marriage is an arranged one and would be performed in the traditional manner in Mumbai around Dussera time, the actress father, Randhir Kapoor, said today.																								Going by the experience, the Kapoors have decided to skip the mangni ceremony. 																								We will not have an engagement but will straight go ahead and solemnise the wedding, Randhir added.

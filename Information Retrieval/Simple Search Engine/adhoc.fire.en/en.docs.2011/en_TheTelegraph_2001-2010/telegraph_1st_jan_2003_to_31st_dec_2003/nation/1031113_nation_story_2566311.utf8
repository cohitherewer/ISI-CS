		 Thursday, November 13, 2003 				 Farooq takes on Mufti
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jammu, Nov. 12: The National Conference is set for a knock-out round with the Peoples Democratic Party-led coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir.																								Addressing a rally in Jammu today, the father-son duo of Farooq and Omar Abdullah said the National Conference would act decisively against the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government in the interests of the people whose hopes have been belied. The Mufti government has failed to deliver on all its promises and its tell-tale signs are there for all to see, Farooq said.																								He took on his successor point by point on issues ranging from jobs to bringing back the Pundits to their homeland and providing an accountable administration. What happened to all those promises? Farooq asked.																								The former chief minister went on to underline what he called the PDPs deep links with terrorists. He dwelt at length on agriculture minister Abdul Aziz Zargars reported connection with the militants who attacked the Akshardham temple in Gujarat last year and the chief ministers daughter Mehboobas forays into terrorist-infested areas in Kashmir without protection.																								Farooq also pointed to the upbeat mood in the Valley following the announcement of dialogue with the Maulvi Ansari faction of the separatist All Parties Hurriyat Conference. He stressed on talks with one and all, including the Hurriyats Syed Ali Shah Geelani faction and separatist leaders Shabir Shah and Yasin Malik.																								The former chief minister also expressed hope that the ongoing India-Pakistan peace dialogue would be successful. The positive changes in Pakistan indicated this, he added. 																								I agree with (the) Pakistani information minister that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is the only leader who can resolve issues between the two countries, Farooq said.

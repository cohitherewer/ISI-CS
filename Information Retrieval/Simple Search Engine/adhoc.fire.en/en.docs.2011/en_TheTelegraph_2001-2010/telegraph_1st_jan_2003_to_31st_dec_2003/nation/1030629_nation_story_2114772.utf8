		 Sunday, June 29, 2003 				 Sangh patch-up drive
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 28: The karya karta (executive) meeting of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on July 5 and 6 at Kanyakumari may decide to intervene and work for a patch-up between the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad on the Ayodhya issue.																								While the government and the BJP, through Kanchi Sankaracharya Swami Jayendra Saraswati, are working towards a compromise, the VHP has toughened its stand and virtually decided not to allow construction of a mosque in Ayodhya. 																								The seers formula envisages that if the Muslim clergy does not oppose construction of the temple in the undisputed area, the Hindus will not object if a mosque is built in a place in Ayodhya that is mutually agreed upon.																								Senior BJP and government sources have come down heavily on the VHP leadership. The BJP sources said they have not taken kindly to the utterances of VHP leaders who had even threatened to work against the victory of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani in their respective constituencies of Lucknow and Gandhinagar.																								They said the VHP has totally alienated both the BJP and the government by their utterances. If BJP was not in power, they would have been languishing in jail by now, said a senior party leader.																								VHP sources said the organisations governing council meeting at Raipur today discussed a resolution on the Ram temple at Ayodhya and decided to oppose construction of any mosque in 14 koshi parikrama, which virtually covers the entire Ayodhya city. 																								A high-power committee of the VHPs dharam sansad is meeting on July 11 to finalise the strategy for the construction of the Ram temple and an agitation for the purpose may be launched any time after September, the sources said.																								VHP appeal to Advani																								The VHP today sought to drive a wedge between Vajpayee and Advani, asking the latter to take the initiative for a legislation for construction of the temple even if Vajpayee opposes the move.																								The meeting also discussed the issue of a ban on cow slaughter. The organisation also strongly opposed any compromise on the Kashmir issue with Pakistan, they said.

		 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 BJP puts ear to heartland ground
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 27: The prospect of early general elections gathering pace, the BJP chief today tried to assess the partys electoral chances in the crucial Hindi heartland state of Uttar Pradesh.																								M. Venkaiah Naidu met Kalraj Mishra, the party central leader in charge of the state, to seek his assessment of the ground realities there. Uttar Pradesh had first catapulted the BJP into the big league.																								The BJP regards it as a high-priority state, along with Bihar and Jharkhand, after the partys rout there in the last Assembly polls and its dismal showing in the Lok Sabha elections that came before.																								Party sources said their chief asked Mishra for the big picture in Uttar Pradesh and later directed him to make an assessment of each constituency. This would be analysed and discussed at the BJPs national executive in Hyderabad next month before a decision on early polls is arrived at.																								The Uttar Pradesh inputs, as also those from the other states, are expected to be incorporated into the BJPs action plan for Mission 2004, whose goal is to capture 300 Lok Sabha seats on its own and secure a two-thirds majority for the NDA.																								Mishra, sources said, broached the subject of Kalyan Singhs return to the BJP. Naidu told him there was no proposal before the party right now, one of them said.																								Kalyan, now the Rashtriya Kranti Party chief, had set aside his differences with the Prime Minister to greet him on the eve of his birthday in Lucknow, fuelling speculations of his return to his former party.																								Mishra, the Uttar Pradesh prabhari (in-charge), also talked about the ongoing organisational elections. 																								Although sources admitted the need to restructure the organisation and project new and fresh faces, it appeared that the partys state chief, Vinay Katiyar, would not be replaced in a hurry because of his backward origin. 																								Otherwise, the party fears its remaining Mandal constituency could desert it, the sources said.																								Naidu also met some Union ministers today and asked them for a briefing on the projects initiated by their departments, especially those that affected people directly.																								Among those who briefed him were ministers of health Sushma Swaraj, highways and roads B.C. Khanduri, rural development Kashiram Rana and social justice and poverty alleviation Satyanarain Jatiya.

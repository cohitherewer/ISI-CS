		 Monday, February 10, 2003 				 Row over beheaded hawker
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah (Hooghly), Feb. 9: The Hooghly district police and the Government Railway Police (GRP) are in a slanging match over who should inquire about a beheaded body found yesterday between the Hooghly and Bandel railway stations.																								The body found in a lake has been identified as that of Buro Saha, a 22-year-old local hawker. A person has been detained for interrogation.																								The district police claimed that Saha, who used to sell peanuts in trains, was shot dead on the railway track. But GRP officials said the body was recovered from an area under Bengal police jurisdiction, so the district police should probe the case.																								Saha was shot on the railway track between Hooghly and Bandel stations, Subir Ray, officer-in-charge of Chinsurah police station, said today. A cartridge was recovered from the spot where the hawker was shot dead.																								According to Ray, preliminary investigations have revealed that after being shot, Buros body was taken to a nearby abandoned railway godown where the head was severed with a sharp weapon.																								Blood stains have been found at the godown where Saha was beheaded by the criminals. The area belongs to the GRP, Ray said.																								A blood-stained stone, too, was recovered from a nearby manhole, he said. It seems Sahas head was initially dumped in the manhole by the murderers and later taken away, Ray said.																								GRP officials, however, refused to buy the argument. As the beheaded body was recovered from the lake under the jurisdiction of Bengal police, it is their responsibility to probe the murder, said a senior GRP official who refused to be named.																								Sahas body was identified by his brother-in-law, Pavan Jadav. I identified him by the scar on his hand, Jadav said.																								Saha, last seen a few days ago at a programme near Hooghly station, was the only earning member of his family of wife, son, mother and two younger brothers.																								According to local people, Buro had no enemy. Police officials said one Haddi Munna, a notorious local criminal, too, was shot dead at the same spot six months ago.																								The officials said raids were being conducted across the district and its neighbourhood on the basis of statements the man in custody had given.

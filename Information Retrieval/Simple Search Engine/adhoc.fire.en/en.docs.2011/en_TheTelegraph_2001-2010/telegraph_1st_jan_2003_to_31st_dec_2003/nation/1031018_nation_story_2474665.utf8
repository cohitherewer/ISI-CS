 Islamabad, Oct. 17: The  Pakistan government today denied the presence of Dawood  Ibrahim in Karachi and said it had nothing to do with him,  reports our special correspondent. 																								He is neither a Pakistan citizen, nor does he live in Karachi, Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed, the minister for information, told The Telegraph.																								If somebody is aware of his whereabouts, we will act on that information, the minister said. He added that the government has nothing to do with the people being identified as members of the underworld.																								 Dawoods name had resurfaced in the media after a bomb blast at the upscale commercial complex, Crown Plaza, in the heart of Karachi last month. There was widespread speculation that the plaza belonged to Dawood and the owners on paper were fronting for him.																								A Pakistani stringer for an American magazine had mysteriously disappeared after doing a story on the Indian crime lord early last year. Media reports had also talked about factional fighting among followers of the underworld don.

		 Tuesday, July 22, 2003 				 India ticks off Pak on Malik
																								New Delhi, July 21: Delhi today told Islamabad to refrain from commenting on Indias internal affairs and thus contribute to normalising relations, reports our special correspondent.																								Pakistan had described the recent arrest of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front leader Yasin Malik by security forces as yet another manifestation of Indias policy to brutally suppress the freedom movement in Kashmir.																								Foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said: We express our disappointment with the continued manifestation of negative attitude by Pakistan.																								Pakistan should concentrate on the grievous political and sectarian ills of its own society. It has enough problems of its own to worry about India, said Sarna.

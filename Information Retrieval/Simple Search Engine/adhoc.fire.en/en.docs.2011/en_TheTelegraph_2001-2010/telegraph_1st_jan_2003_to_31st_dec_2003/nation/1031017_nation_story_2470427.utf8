		 Friday, October 17, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																SC finds MLA too young to contest				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on Thursday set aside the election of Bihar MLA Rakesh Kumar, who had generated controversy by becoming the youngest minister in the state, on the ground that he was too young to get elected.				 																																																										The election of Rakesh from Parbatta constituency  who was dropped from the council of ministers on an objection from the governor  was set aside by a bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justice S.B. Sinha.				 																																																										The bench had allowed an appeal by defeated candidate Sushil Kumar, who challenged a Patna High Court order upholding Rakeshs election.				 																																																										Holding that Rakesh had suppressed his actual age, the bench relied on the age mentioned by him in an application in a criminal case, according to which Rakesh could not have been 25 at the time of the Assembly elections in 2000.				 																																																										Under Article 173(b) of the Constitution, a person has to be 25 years of age to contest an election in an Assembly constituency.				 																																																										Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Sinha said although a person is entitled to vote on attaining the age of majority, the makers of the Constitution deliberately inserted clause (b) in Article 173 so as to enable voters to elect a person who has attained maturity and has experience in life.				 																																																										Only a mature and experienced person can represent the people and take steps which could be beneficial to the electorate, the bench observed.				 																Abductor shot dead, girl saved Jalandhar (PTI): Five-year-old Aashna  Sonik, who was taken hostage by an unidentified gunman in  a house in the Adarsh Nagar area here on Wednesday, was  rescued after police shot dead the accused.				 																																																										The man, armed with two pistols, had barged into the residence of advocate Ashok Sonik around 3 pm firing shots and took his daughter hostage after injuring his wife.				 																																																										After waiting for over 10 hours, police swung into action and broke open the door of the house and shot the accused, who was standing near the bathroom, and rescued Aashna.				 																																																										The accused, who is in police custody, is yet to be identified.				 																																																										The incident started when Ashoks wife Seema opened the door of the house after her two children returned from school. 				 																																																										When Seema stepped out of the house along with her son, the gunman got hold of Aashna and locked the door from inside.

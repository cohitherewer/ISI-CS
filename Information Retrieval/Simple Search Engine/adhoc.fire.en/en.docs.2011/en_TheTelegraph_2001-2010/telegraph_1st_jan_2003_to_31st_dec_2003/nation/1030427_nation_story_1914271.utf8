Handwara police chief S.D. Jamwal said 12 persons, including 11 schoolchildren and one woman, were rescued by search parties till darkness set in.				 																																																	The children were trying to cross the Pohru river, which was flooded, on their way home from school. The river had a hook rope  device used to ferry boats across rivers in Kashmir  fastened on its either side and seeing no boatman around, the children decided to cross the river themselves by boat, police said.				 																																																	The rope, however, could not withstand the strong currents of the swollen river and snapped. The boat was swept away by the turbulent waters and it capsized in the middle of the river.				 																																																	We dont have the exact number of children in the boat when it capsized. Reports say there were nearly 30 from two private schools who were trying to cross the river, Jamwal said.				 																																																	As news about the tragedy reached Jagirpora village, residents rushed to the spot and, together with police and security forces, launched a massive search operation.				 																																																	Authorities said so far, 12 children and a woman have been rescued while around 14 are missing. The search operation to trace them is still continuing despite the heavy downpour. With the Valley being lashed by heavy rains since Friday, all the major rivers in Kashmir are flooded.

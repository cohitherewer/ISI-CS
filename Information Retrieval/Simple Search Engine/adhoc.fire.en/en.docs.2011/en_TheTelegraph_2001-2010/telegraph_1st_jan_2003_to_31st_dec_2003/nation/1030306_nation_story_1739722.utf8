Quantifying the difference between India and China as business allies, Girard said while bilateral trade between France and China stood at $ 50 billion, with India it is around $ 10 billion.

He also invited Indian entrepreneurs to explore business opportunities in France.																								On Bengals scope of attracting French investment, Girard highlighted the rich historical and cultural links between the two and said the foundation for a better relationship had already been laid. We now only need to build upon it, he added.

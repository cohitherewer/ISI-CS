 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ajit Jogi																								New Delhi, June 16: The Central Bureau of Investigation will question Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi tomorrow on his allegation that the Centre had unleashed the Intelligence Bureau to tarnish his image.																								Deputy inspector-general Harbans Singh, who is with the special crimes division-II of the CBI, will leave for Raipur tomorrow morning, sources said. Jogi will be questioned for an hour or so by Singh, who is also the information officer in this case.																								The CBI had registered a case on April 2 against unknown persons after Jogi wrote to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, alleging that the IB was being used by the Centre to harass political opponents. He had also attached a list of his assets, allegedly compiled by the IBs special directorate.																								Sources said the CBI would try to extract the source of the purported IB documents, which contain details of Jogis investments. The onus is now on him to reveal the name of the person from whom he got the documents because it was he who made the allegation, a senior officer said.																								According to the sources, the IB has already informed the CBI that it has no special directorate and that it did not prepare any dossier on Jogi.																								The CBI had written to Jogi last month, seeking time to question him. But for more than a fortnight, it did not receive any response, either from the chief minister or his office in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh.																								The response came late last month when Jogi dispatched a letter, asking what the case was all about, the sources said.																								The CBI replied with details of the first information report. Bureau sources said it was ironic that Jogi wanted to know about a case that had been registered on the basis of allegations he himself had made.																								Last week, the chief ministers private secretary dispatched a communiqu to the CBI giving June 17 as the date on which the sleuths could grill him. Following the letter, the bureau prepared a questionnaire.																								According to the CBI, the documents contain the allegation that Jogi and his wife Renu have bank accounts in Switzerland. Another allegation is that the chief minister and his wife possess National Saving Certificates and Kisan Vikas Patra certificates worth more than Rs 1.67 crore.																								The document also alleged that Renu signed a memorandum of understanding with a Malaysian company, which has a branch in Bangalore, and that she acquired a 50 per cent share in the company.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, March 22, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																30 officers in CBI corruption net				 																																																	 new delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday netted close to 30 officers in its special countrywide raids, spread over 15 states, against corrupt bureaucrats, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	Around 80 places in different states, including West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Delhi, were searched following complaints against officers who were either demanding bribe or had amassed wealth disproportionate to their known source of income.				 																																																	Details of the searches, which went on till late at night, are still coming in at the CBI headquarters. 				 																																																	A prize catch was S. Ramu, an additional commissioner of Income Tax, posted in Mumbai, the CBI said. Assets worth Rs 4 crore were recovered from Ramus houses in Mumbai and Hyderabad that, the sleuths alleged, he had accumulated through other means.				 																																																	The CBI has also registered a disproportionate assets case against two senior managers of the National Highway Authority of India and the Airport Authority of India. Both were allegedly demanding bribe from private companies for renewal of contracts. The agency has seized documents from their residence. This is the first such special drive carried out by the CBI this year, but the fifth since February last year. 				 																																																	Following the success of its special anti-corruption drive, the CBI has decided to make it a regular feature to probe corruption in public life.				 																Prasar mulls TV licence fee 				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): Faced with Doordarshans stagnant revenues, Prasar Bharati is toying with the idea of proposing re-introduction of licence fees for owning radio and television sets.				 																																																	The proposal mooted by some officials of Doordarshan and All India Radio is likely to be discussed at the Prasar Bharati boards meeting next month, sources said.				 																																																	Once the board clears it, the suggestion will be referred to the information and broadcasting ministry since the Prasar Bharati does not have the authority to impose the fee on its own, the sources added.				 																																																	Such a fee was in practice about 20 years ago but the Centre had revoked it.				 																																																	The board is also expected to request the government to give Prasar Bharati a waiver on Income Tax, as it was a public broadcaster, the sources said. 				 																																																	The government had only last year imposed Income Tax on the organisation, which the board feels would put an additional burden when it was already struggling to raise revenues.				 																Pollution panel rap on crackers				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): The Central Pollution Control Board has told the Supreme Court that over 80 per cent of firecrackers sold in the market do not meet noise pollution norms and suggested that district authorities be divested of powers to issue licence for manufacturing fireworks.				 																																																	The board, in an affidavit, said firecrackers purchased by it from the market and tested by the National Physical Laboratories indicated that 88 per cent of the firecrackers samples do not comply with the prescribed noise standards for firecrackers.				 																Team to Kerala				 																																																	 new delhi (PTI): Taking note of the alleged killing and torturing of women tribals in Keralas Wayanand district, a three-member team of the National Commission for Women will visit the state.				 																Dalit humiliated				 																																																	 datia (MP) (PTI): Police have registered a case against a priest for allegedly humiliating a Dalit woman for entering a temple at Indergarh in the district. According to the complaint, Munni Jatav was offering prayers at the temple when priest Virendra Pande abused her and threatened to kill her if she came again.				 																Execution order				 																																																	 medan (POOL-ANTARA): An Indian national, sentenced to death by an Indonesian court for allegedly smuggling 12.19 kg of heroin, is currently being guarded at a maximum security jail and is awaiting execution orders from the attorney-general. The clemency plea of Ayodya Prasad Chaubey (64) was turned down by President Megawati Sukarnoputri.				 																Bhopal victims				 																																																	 bhopal (PTI): Survivors of the 1984 Union Carbide gas disaster will appeal against the New York district courts order which dismissed their 1999 class action suit seeking damages.				 																Judge resigns				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): Rajasthan High Court judge Justice Arun Madan, against whom the Chief Justice of India had set up a panel to probe into allegations of corruption, has resigned.				 																																																	A week-long water conservation campaign will begin in Madhya Pradesh from Saturday to educate the urban population about water conservation methods. Programmes will also be launched to renovate urban reservoirs and clean overhead tanks.

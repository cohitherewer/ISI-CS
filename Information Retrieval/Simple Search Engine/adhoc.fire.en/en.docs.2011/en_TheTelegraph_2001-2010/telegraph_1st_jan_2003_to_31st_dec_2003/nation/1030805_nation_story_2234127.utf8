		 Tuesday, August 05, 2003 				 Valley rap on Blackwill
																								Islamabad, Aug. 4 (PTI): Pakistan today launched an attack on former US ambassador to India Robert Blackwill for his comment that terrorist incursions in Jammu and Kashmir were continuing. 																								Blackwill seems to be ill-informed, he is prejudiced and I think he is heartless because he is condoning the atrocities being committed by Indian troops on innocent Kashmiri civilians, foreign office spokesperson Masood Khan said here. 																								He is suffering from localitis, he said, commenting on Blackwills remarks to an Indian TV channel that militants were still crossing the Line of Control. 																								The problems persist, there are still terrorists coming across the LoC, Blackwill said four days before he left Delhi after his two-year stint. The spokesperson said there was no militant camp on the Pakistani side of the LoC.																								There is no substance in the allegations made by the Indian defence minister and no terrorists are being trained on Pakistani soil, Khan said while replying to a question on the allegation by George Fernandes that 3,000 militants are present on the Pakistani side of Kashmir.																								It has become usual for the Indian leadership to fabricate such stories.... Indian ministers are competing with each other in demonising Pakistan, he said.																								On Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees recent statement on Ayodhya, Khan said Pakistan regretted it. It is the responsibility of the Indian government to protect the places of worship of Muslims and not incite communal violence.																								Khan also said Pakistan has conveyed its concern over the activities of Indian consulates in Kandahar, Jalalabad and other cities in Afghanistan. Pakistan has alleged that the Indian consulates in Afghanistan were indulging in anti-Pakistan activities, a charge denied by both India and Afghanistan.

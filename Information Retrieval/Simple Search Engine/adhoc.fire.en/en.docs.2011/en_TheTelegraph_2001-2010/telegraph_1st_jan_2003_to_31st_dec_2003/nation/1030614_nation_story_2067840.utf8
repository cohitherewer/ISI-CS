 Washington, June 13 (PTI):  A priest was arrested aboard a Seattle-bound United Airlines  flight for carrying a four-inch knife. Nityaprakash Das,  45, was held after a flight attendant saw him pull out the  knife to cut a piece of fruit, said Mike McCarron, spokesman  for san francisco international airport. A flight attendant asked das to  hand over the knife but when he refused, the US marshal  on board arrested him.																								It was unclear how the priest travelling with a religious group passed through the security with the knife. He obviously had to go through  the security checkpoint in Newark. Apparently, this item  wasnt detected, nico melendez, spokesman for the  transportation security administration in los angeles, said.																								Items like this can slip through and thats why we have layers of security. Das was charged with possessing  a concealed and dangerous weapon on an aircraft and was  released on bond yesterday. His next court hearing is August  1.																								He may face federal charges for transporting an illegal weapon. Knives or sharp objects have been  banned on plane since the September 11 attacks.

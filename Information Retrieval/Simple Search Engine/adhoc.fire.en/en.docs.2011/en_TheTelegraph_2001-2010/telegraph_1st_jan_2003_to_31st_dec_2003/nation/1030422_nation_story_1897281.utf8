		 Tuesday, April 22, 2003 				 Storm in court over Stalin
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, April 21: Drama was witnessed in Tamil Nadu courts today with agitators clashing with police in Saidapet where DMK leader M.K. Stalin was produced and Nakkeeran editor R.R. Gopal alleging in Ponamalle that police were trying to implicate DMK leader M. Karunanidhi, filmstar Rajnikanth and Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna under the anti-terror law.																								Hundreds of Stalins supporters struggled to push past police and enter the Saidapet metropolitan magistrates court complex when the DMK youth wing leader was produced there and charged with attempt to murder. 																								Stalin had allegedly attacked police personnel who had gone to his Velacherry residence on April 10 to arrest him on charges of criminal trespass for entering Queen Marys College to address agitating students.																								In court, Stalins counsels argued the police had not remanded their client in the attempt to murder case for the last 11 days. 																								Magistrate V.P. Ravindran extended Stalins judicial remand in the attempt to murder case up to May 5, while the DMK moved a bail application in the principal sessions court. Late in the evening, Stalin was granted bail.																								In the anti-terror law court in suburban Ponamalle, Gopal alleged the prosecution was also trying to implicate Karunanidhi, Rajnikanth and Krishna under the anti-terror law in the probe into the abduction of Kannada actor Rajkumar by Veerappan.																								Gopal, who has been held under the anti-terror law, alleged police torture and expressed apprehension when police custody was sought. 																								However, chief minister Jayalalithaa explained in the Assembly that the case was transferred to the designated court trying cases under the anti-terror law because it had come to light that Gopal had been functioning as an associate of Veerappan.																								During investigations after his arrest on April 12 night  in connection with the murder of Rajamani, a police informer on Veerappans movements in the Sathyamangalam forest  it was also learnt that the Nakkeeran editor had links with the Tamil Nadu Liberation Army and the Tamil National Retrieval Troops, which have been banned under the anti-terror legislation, she said. 																								In another development, the court also rejected the bail pleas of Tamil Nationalist Movement leader P. Nedumaran and four others arrested under the anti-terror law in August.

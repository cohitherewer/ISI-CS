- Frisking relaxed after 13 years, highways to stay open late MUKHTAR AHMAD  Kashmiri women watch a procession from a rooftop in Srinagar. The procession was held to pay homage to those killed fighting the Dogra rulers in 1931. (AFP) Srinagar, July 13: The government has ordered a halt to roadside frisking which has been commonplace since militancy hit the state 13 years ago.On my instructions, frequent frisking of people on roads has been stopped and the Jawahar tunnel on the Srinagar- Jammu national highway kept open till midnight to facilitate movement of the people, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said here today.The chief minister made this disclosure while addressing a rally at the martyrs graveyard in downtown Srinagar.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 26: The Congress has formally asked Atal Bihari Vajpayee to order the CBI to expeditiously file a revision petition in the higher court against the discharge of L.K. Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case.																								In a letter to the Prime Minister, copies of which were instantly released to the media, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the Congress chief whip in the Lok Sabha, today asserted that the Rae Bareli special courts discharge order was based on a diluted chargesheet the CBI had filed before it.																								That the chargesheet was diluted was borne out by the CBI earlier, presenting a different case with supporting evidence of the deputy Prime Ministers involvement in the conspiracy to demolish the Babri Masjid, claimed the leader. The prosecutions earlier argument and the one made before the Rae Bareli court were self-contradictory, Das Munshi said. 																								The CBIs credibility is at stake and it should not only file a revision against the order but also argue diligently and forcefully, he said.																								The September 19 court order, he said, confirmed the apprehensions he had expressed in Parliament during the monsoon session when it became public that the CBI had submitted a diluted chargesheet against Advani, the Congress leader said.																								The revision petition should be filed at the earliest as any delay may lead to destruction of evidence, he added.																								That there was substance in the charge of senior BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal leaders involvement was established beyond doubt by the special courts order. However, even as Advani was discharged, the court took cognisance of the same charges against seven other leaders, including human resources development minister Murli Manohar Joshi, pointed out the Congress leader.

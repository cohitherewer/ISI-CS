		 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Hint of inside job in successive attempts
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 25: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf reshuffled the top brass after the bid on his life on December 14 and todays attempt was made at roughly the same place in the cantonment area of Rawalpindi where the General stays.																								Successive attempts  the second more deadlier than the first  indicate that the Generals suspicion of an inside job may not be unfounded, an assessment in New Delhi says.																								Rawalpindi is the heart of the Pakistani military establishment and Musharraf is clearly unsafe in his own backyard, in an area controlled by the army whose muscle he has used to hoist himself to power and retain it since overthrowing Nawaz Sharif. For the Pakistani President, who claims he is with the US in putting down fundamentalist forces with a heavy hand, an Islamised officer cadre in the army is less than an assurance of confidence.																								Musharraf had reshuffled the top brass in the wake of the last assassination bid and gave more powers and responsibilities to some of his trusted men. The reshuffle also opened up possibilities of some officers taking a shot at becoming army chief because Musharraf has announced he would relinquish the post by the end of next year.																								A new director-general of military intelligence, Major General Nadeem Taj, who was Musharrafs personal staff as military secretary, has been appointed.																								The commander of the Rawalpindi (10) Corps has also been shifted. The attempt was in his area of responsibility. Lt General Syed Aziz, who was Quarter Master General, has taken over the Rawalpindi Corps. Lt General Zaraar Azeem, who was the corps commander, has been moved as inspector-general (training and planning).																								(The Rawalpindi Corps 101 brigade is often referred to as the coup brigade for playing a crucial role in military takeovers in Pakistan).																								An explosion in a Rawalpindi bridge shortly after Musharrafs motorcade passed over it has unnerved the establishment with the militarys Inter-Services Public Relations wing also alleging a foreign hand behind the attempt. But a suspicion that it was an inside job continues to linger, analysts say.																								Pakistans director-general of military intelligence, Major General Tariq Majeed, was removed from the post within two days of the failed attempt.																								Majeed, however, was moved upstairs as the chief of general staff. Musharrafs new military secretary, after Maj. General Nadeem Taj was made DGMI, is another Major General, Shafatullah Shah.																								General Musharraf also appears to have changed the succession plan in case he gives up the post of chief of army staff by October 2004, as he has promised. The reshuffle will allow a crucial commander during the Kargil war of 1999 to have a shot at becoming the chief of army staff.																								The director-general of Pakistans Frontier Constabulary Northern Areas during the 1999 Kargil war, Lt General Javed Hassan, has also been made a corps commander  of the 30 Corps in Gujranwala.																								The perception in New Delhi was Lt General Hassan was integral to ground operations in PoK during the Kargil war and was a part of Musharrafs core team.																								By appointing Lt General Hassan as a corps commander, Musharraf ensures that he gets the experience that is a pre-requisite to be army chief.																								The 30 Corps commander, Lt General Khalid Munir, was moved as Quarter Master General. In other changes, Lt General Tariq Waseem Ghazi, 5 Corps (Karachi) commander, has been moved as commandant of the National Defence College and his place was being taken by Lt General Ahsan Saleem Hayat.

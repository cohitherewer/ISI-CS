		 Sunday, October 26, 2003 				 Regret over riot acquittal
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, Oct. 25: The conviction in the Lal Akhada murder case was the first in the Gujarat riot cases. Last week, a fast-track court in Vadodara sentenced four of the six accused of killing 22-year-old Pankaj Chauhan on March 22, 2002, during post-Godhra violence.																								But the verdict is no consolation for the victims father, who told a local newspaper yesterday that he was unhappy with the judgment.																								On October 16, the fast-track court acquitted former Vadodara deputy mayor Nisar Hussain Sayed and his driver for lack of evidence. 																								The judge, however, sentenced the mayors son, brother-in-law and two others.																								Sagarmal Chauhan, who had become untraceable after his statement was recorded, is dejected that the former deputy mayor  who he alleges is the main person responsible for the death of his son  has been acquitted. 																								Chauhan adds that he is yet to receive the Rs 1.5 lakh compensation promised to him by the state government in the aftermath of his sons murder.

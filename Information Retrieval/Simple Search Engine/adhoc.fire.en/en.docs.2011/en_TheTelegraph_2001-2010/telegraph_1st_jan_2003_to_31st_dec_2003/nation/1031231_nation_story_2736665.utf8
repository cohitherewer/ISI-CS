		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Daler gets bail as proof eludes police
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mehndi at the Patiala court on Sunday. (PTI)																								Chandigarh, Dec. 30: Daler Mehndi will sing again, not in custody but outside it.																								The Punjabi pop singer was released on bail today after lack of evidence prompted Punjab police not to seek extension of his remand. 																								The singer, whose police remand had been extended till today just two days ago, was arrested by Delhi police on December 19 in a human trafficking case. 																								Truth has prevailed. I have been crying myself hoarse that I am innocent. I have been hanged for no rhyme or reason, Daler said.																								Patiala duty magistrate Satpal ordered the singer to produce a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and two sureties of the same amount. The magistrate also ordered Patiala police to escort Daler back to New Delhi.																								Patiala police sources said they did not seek extension of remand as they had completed all the formalities against Daler. They had taken him to Delhi on Friday to help recover his passport and other documents relating to his overseas visits. No incriminating document was found in his possession.																								Bakshish Singh had filed a complaint in October, alleging he was not taken abroad despite paying Rs 13 lakh of the Rs 15 lakh sought by the accused, including Daler, for the purpose. Co-accused Shamsher, who is Dalers brother, is in judicial custody.																								A senior Patiala police officer said no incriminating evidence against Daler was found during investigation. He will be given a clean chit, but only after our probe into the trafficking issue is over and the guilty brought to book, the officer added.																								The police would now question the 31 complainants in the case. We would like to get to the bottom of the human trafficking issue. We would be questioning in detail the complainants and their sources of income. They have complained that they paid between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 15 lakh to Daler to be taken abroad in the troupe of the singer, Patiala senior superintendent of police A.S. Rai said.																								Now, they will have to prove the presence of Daler at the places where they allegedly paid the amount. Daler has claimed that he was not present at those places and we have verified it, he added.																								A police officer involved in the probe said Dalers cellphone records indicated he was not present at the places where the complainants claimed to have paid him.																								Daler has maintained he has a permanent group of artistes that accompanies him overseas. I can produce them with their passports whenever it is needed. They are all living in India, he had said.																								A relieved Daler thanked Patiala police for treating him with respect in jail. 																								He had earlier accused the police of demanding money to clear his name and telling him to strip and sing during questioning in October.																								Daler was also granted regular bail in the case of alleged threatening of Harinder Singh, a computer operator in the police department.

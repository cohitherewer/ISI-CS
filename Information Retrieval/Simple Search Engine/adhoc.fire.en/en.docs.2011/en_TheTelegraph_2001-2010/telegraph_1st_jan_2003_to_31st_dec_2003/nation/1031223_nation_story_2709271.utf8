		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Andhra poll roll under scan
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Dec. 22: A four-member team of the Election Commission arrived here today to look into complaints of irregularities in the electoral rolls.																								The team, the second to visit Andhra Pradesh in the last two days, will visit all the districts and review the roll revision in 294 Assembly constituencies, K.J. Rao, a consultant to the commission, said here today.																								The inquiry was prompted by a jump of 1.02 crore voters after the roll revision in August, official sources said. Such a jump meant involving 72.54 per cent of the total population of the state in the electoral process as against the national average of 62 per cent, Rao said.																								The leap, he added, could largely be attributed to the residual voters who have not received their photo identity cards.																								The commission had in August directed the state poll authorities to issue notices to voters who did not turn up for the cards why their names should not be deleted from the rolls. Under Section 22 of the Peoples Representation Act of 1951, those who have not sought the photo ID cards will cease to be ordinary citizens of the country, Rao said. He added the team would do a detective job and submit a report to the chief election commissioner.																								All major political parties called on the team and presented their views on the irregularities in the roll revision.																								The Congress and the CPM alleged in their memoranda that there was an abnormally high percentage of the electorate in the state. The process of additions and deletions (in voters list) has reached a scandalous proportion, Congress K. Kesava Rao said at a news conference.																								Both Opposition parties also sought an extension of the January 20 deadline for publication of the revised list. The commission officials, however, said there will be no change in the schedule.																								After the publication of the draft rolls, nearly 51 lakh applications for inclusion in the list had been filed (Andhra has 5.49 crore voters) and 2.79 lakh objections raised by political parties.																								Among these were the alleged 243 votes allotted to a farmer in Guntur and the 110 votes to an unmarried school teacher in Visakhapatnam. More curious were the 530 votes said to be in the name of a temple in Cuddapah.																								The Desam, which wants Assembly polls in February or early March, said the baseless charges of bogus voters levelled by the Opposition were aimed at delaying the elections. Liquor case relief  Andhra Pradesh High Court quashed  a criminal complaint filed by a Congress worker in a liquor  procurement case against . Chandrababu Naidu, two of his  ministers and 15 others.

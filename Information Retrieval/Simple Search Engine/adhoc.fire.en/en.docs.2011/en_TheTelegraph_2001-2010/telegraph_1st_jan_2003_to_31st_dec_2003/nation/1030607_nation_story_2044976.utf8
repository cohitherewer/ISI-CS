The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, June 07, 2003 				 Rain for some, burning wait for rest
 Pre-monsoon showers brought relief to Kochi  in Kerala (second from top) and the monsoon spread cheer  on Guwahati streets, but the Osman Sagar lake outside Hyderabad  and fields near Allahabad remained thirsty, waiting desperately  for the clouds to appear. Uttaranchal burned, with a forest  fire raging near the village of Dwarahat. The hot spell  has killed more than 1,200 people across the country. Pictures  by AFP, Reuters and PTI

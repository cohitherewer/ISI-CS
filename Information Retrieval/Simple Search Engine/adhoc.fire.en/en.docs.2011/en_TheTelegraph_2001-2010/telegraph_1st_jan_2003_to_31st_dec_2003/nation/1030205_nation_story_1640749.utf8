																								New Delhi, Feb. 4 (PTI): Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt has refused an invitation to attend the 51st national prayer breakfast meeting with US President George W. Bush in Washington on Thursday.																								It occurs to me, on second thoughts, that participating in such sessions with the President is to condone born-again-Christian Bushs terrorism of demonic proportions around the globe..., Bhatt said in a letter to a friend in Washington, copies of which were released here.																								Americas bullying ways must come to an end, said Bhatt, noting America has entered one of its worst periods of historical madness.																								Bush and his junta have succeeded in deflecting Americas anger from (Osama) Bin Laden to Saddam Hussein. It is, perhaps, one of the most clever eye-wash exercises that the government has achieved to date with the help of their awesome propaganda machinery, the filmmaker wrote in the letter.																								... What is at stake here is not an axis of evil, but oil, money and peoples lives, he added.

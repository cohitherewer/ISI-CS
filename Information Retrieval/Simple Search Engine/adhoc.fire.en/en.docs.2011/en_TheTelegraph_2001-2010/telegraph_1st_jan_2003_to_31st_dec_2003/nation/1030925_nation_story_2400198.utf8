Bush has said he is opposed to efforts to scrap the H-1B visa programme under which thousands of Indian information technology experts have been brought to the US.				 																																																										The H-1B programme is important to the US. I understand the current cap is approximately 200,000 and I will seek to maintain a strong H-1B programme, Bush was quoted as saying by the India Abroad newspaper here.				 																																																										The Presidents comments came during an interaction with Indian-Americans on the occasion of a Bush-Cheney fund-raiser reception recently.				 																																																	hen asked about H-1B bills on the floor of the House of Representatives, especially the Resolution 2688 moved by Republican Congressman Thomas Tancredo seeking to terminate the programme, Bush said: Tancredo and me are at opposite ends of the pole. I fully do not support Congressman Tancredos bill against H-1Bs.

Air hostess age plea rejected				 																																																	New Delhi: The Supreme Court has rejected a petition by the Air-India cabin crew union seeking a review of the apex courts judgment that had lowered the flying age of air hostesses.

Dharmadhikari reiterated its judgment on the issue and declined to grant permission to the petitioners, including the Air hostesses Association.				 																																																										On July 11, the Supreme Court had set aside a judgment of Bombay High Court that allowed air hostesses to fly till the age of 58. The apex court fixed the flying age till 50 and directed the airlines to give suitable ground duties to the air hostesses once they crossed that age limit.

		 Friday, August 01, 2003 				 Security ring for Modi visit
																								Coimbatore, July 31: The textile city has been turned into a virtual fortress for Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis visit tomorrow which would coincide with the entry of the rath the BJPs Tamil Nadu unit flagged off last month, reports our special correspondent.																								The security overdrive has come in the wake of a warning of a repeat of the 1998 serial blasts that killed more than 60 people during a visit by senior BJP leader L.K. Advani.																								The warning by suspected supporters of the banned al-Umma came soon after the outfits chief, S.A. Basha, and eight others were sentenced to life imprisonment on Tuesday by a special court here for their involvement in the murder of a Hindu activist.																								The outfit, blamed for the chain blasts, and a breakaway faction of the Dravidar Kazhagam, the Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, are opposing Modis entry.

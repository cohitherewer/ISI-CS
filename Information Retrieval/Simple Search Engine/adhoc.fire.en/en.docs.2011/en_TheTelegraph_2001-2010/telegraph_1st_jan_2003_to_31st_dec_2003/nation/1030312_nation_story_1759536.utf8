The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, March 12, 2003 				 Seer pins hope on site digging
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 11: The sankaracharya of Kanchi, Jayendra Saraswathi, today said all parties should accept the findings of the excavation that Allahabad High Court has ordered at the disputed site in Ayodhya.																								The seer, who was in the city to inaugurate the Rotary Narayana Sankara Nethralaya, a high-tech hospital built jointly by Dr S.S. Badrinath and Devi Shettys Asia Heart Foundation, said the findings should put all disputes to rest.																								The findings of the excavation should be accepted by all, he said and added that neither the Vishwa Hindu Parishad nor any party should object to the excavation results.																								The seer said he was confident the excavation would prove that the site was the birthplace of Ram and the VHP would be able to build a Ram temple on the site where the Babri Masjid stood before it was demolished in 1992. 																								We still have God in the site. He is, however, in a hut, but very soon he will be installed in the temple, he said.																								Describing the high courts excavation order to the Archaeological Survey of India as a balanced move, the sankaracharya said nobody should oppose the courts directive.																								However, he opposed suggestions that the VHP was fanning communalism in the name of religion. They are only spreading the Hindu religion and have never said that they would not abide by the excavation findings, he said.																								The seer said a Kanchi-Ayodhya Development Trust has been recently set up to train around 200 people, both Hindus and Muslims, for taking up jobs in the small-scale industry. They are also taught to spread love, peace and brotherhood in Ayodhya, the sankaracharya added.																								The eye hospital the sankaracharya inaugurated in Salt Lakes sector V will initially have 33 beds, said the director, Badrinath. The outpatients department will start functioning soon, Badrinath added.

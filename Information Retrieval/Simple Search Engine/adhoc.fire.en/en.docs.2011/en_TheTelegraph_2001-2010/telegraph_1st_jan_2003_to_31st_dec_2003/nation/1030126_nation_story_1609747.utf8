Army schools on Lashkar hit list				 																																																	 Srinagar (PTI): Less than a week after militants threatened Muslim women to quit government jobs or face death, Lashkar-e-Toiba, the Pakistan-based militant outfit, has asked teachers in army schools in Jammu and Kashmir to leave their jobs or attract its wrath.

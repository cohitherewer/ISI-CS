		 Friday, January 31, 2003 				 US system to track students
																								Washington, Jan. 30 (PTI): A new tracking system designed to keep up-to-date records on foreign students to discourage false students and prevent 9/11-like incidents has come into force, immigration officials said.																								The $ 37-million system will keep up-to-date records on when foreign students arrive, what they study, where they live and when they leave, the officials said. The shortcomings of the old system are now being publicised by red-faced officials.

Security personnel and others tried to pacify them but they continued with their demonstration until Congress general secretary Ambika Soni came down from the podium and accepted their memorandum.The memorandum rejected Rajasthan governments offer of reservation for Rajputs in the category of economically poor, asserting that since Jats had been included in the OBC list Rajputs should also be given similar benefit. Soni told the activists that some leaders of the manch had met her in Pushkar and their demand would be discussed soon.Gandhi could continue her speech  Copyright

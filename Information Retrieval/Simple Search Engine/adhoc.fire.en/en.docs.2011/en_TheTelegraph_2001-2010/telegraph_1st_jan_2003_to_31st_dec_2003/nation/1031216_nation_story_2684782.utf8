		 Tuesday, December 16, 2003 				 SC rap on Daler
																								New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Supreme Court today came down heavily on Punjabi pop singer Daler Mehndi and asked his counsel to advise his client to surrender in a trial court, reports our legal correspondent.																								A division bench of Justices Doraiswamy Raju and Arijit Pasayat orally observed: We would otherwise be constrained to order him to surrender, if he did not do on his own. The apex court has fixed Dalers application for anticipatory bail hearing on December 19.																								The judges expressed serious displeasure over the way the singer had taken advantage of the orders of the high courts of Delhi and Punjab and Haryana. He is yet to surrender before the trial court at Patiala, they said.																								Is it proper for him to seek relief from this court without surrendering before the trial court? the judges asked Dalers counsel Kapil Sibal.																								The bench, however, dismissed a related petition by Daler, seeking to transfer the case of human export against him to the CBI.																								In his writ petition, Daler had stated that false cases have been instituted against him as he refused to pay Rs 1.5 crore to Punjab police as per their demand and added that the case should be handed over to the CBI for a proper and unbiased investigation.																								Daler had alleged that on the pretext of investigation, the police had called him to the station and made him sing songs in his underwears.																								The singer had also challenged an order of Punjab and Haryana High Court refusing him bail.																								The high court had dismissed Dalers anticipatory bail plea, but had taken serious note of Sibals allegations that his client was asked to take off his clothes by the police during his interrogation at Patiala on October 27 and his car was smashed by a mob assisted by the police. It had sought a report from the police in this regard.

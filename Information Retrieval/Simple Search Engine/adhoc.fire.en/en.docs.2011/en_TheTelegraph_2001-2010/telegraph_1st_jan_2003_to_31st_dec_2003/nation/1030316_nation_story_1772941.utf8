		 Sunday, March 16, 2003 				 Raj Bhavan jolt for Marandi
 ASHISH SINHA																								Ranchi, March 15: Chief minister Babulal Marandi suffered another jolt today, with Raj Bhavan remaining silent over his contention that Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari had no right to reconvene the adjourned Assembly on March 17 for testing the governments strength.																								The BJP-led government, prima facie, has been reduced to a minority with seven ministers quitting office, switching sides and submitting a memorandum to Governor M. Rama Jois along with the Opposition MLAs. They have informed the Governor that Namdhari would be their leader.																								The Governor last night asked the Assembly to test before March 31 whether the government enjoys the confidence of the legislators because such a check, in the light of the Supreme Court judgment in the S.R. Bommai case (1994), can be done only on the floor of the House.																								Jois also asked Namdhari to ensure that the budget was passed before the end of the current fiscal.																								Acting on the message from Raj Bhavan, Namdhari today announced that he would reconvene the House on March 17. 																								This is necessary because once the governments strength is tested, the House can proceed to approve the budget during the months remaining days. This process has to be completed before March 31. The rules amply permit me to convene the House on March 17, he said.																								The Speakers decision created a storm in the BJP camp even as senior party functionary Rajnath Singh arrived in the capital. The chief minister, who has accused Namdhari of being partisan, today maintained that the Speaker has no power, under the rules of the House business committee, to reconvene an adjourned Assembly without consulting the leader of the House (the chief minister).																								Marandi met the Governor in the afternoon and apprised Jois of his stand. In the evening, the chief minister called a meeting of the Cabinet, which decided that the House should be convened on March 27 for a trial of the governments strength and the budget could be passed the next day.

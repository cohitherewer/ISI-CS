		 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Vajpayee stand on strikes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 13: The Prime Minister has assured the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh that his government is seeking legal opinion for reversing the Supreme Court judgment banning strikes by central government employees.																								A delegation of the BMS, the trade union wing of the RSS, raised the contentious issue of the ban when it met Atal Bihari Vajpayee to petition him to redress the grievances of government employees. The Prime Minister iterated what he has said at every forum of trade unions  that his government is not in favour of the judgment and will do what it can to reverse it.																								Hours later, PTI quoted a spokesman of the Prime Ministers Office denying reports that Vajpayee did not favour a ban on strikes. The Prime Minister has not given any indication that the government was not in favour of banning the right to strike he said, adding that the BMS had wrongly attributed this to Vajpayee.																								BMS leader Hansubhai Dave had said that his organisation would persuade the Prime Minister to find a way of reversing the judgment, before it joins Left trade unions in a one-day strike on February 12 to oppose the ban. The trade unions want the government to bring a legislation in Parliament that would negate the court judgment.																								Vajpayee was optimistic before the BMS delegation and said legal experts believe that the Supreme Court judgment was merely an advice and not an order.																								Vajpayees assurance is likely to increase the growing distance between the Left trade unions  the Centre of Indian Trade Unions and All India Trade Union Congress  and the BMS.

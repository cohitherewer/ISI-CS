 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, Dec. 28: Punjab minister for transport Tej Prakash Singh has ruled out that rebels demanding the ouster of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh would resort to splitting the Congress early next year to achieve their end.																								We have categorically told senior AICC members that we want Amarinder to go if the Congress has to be saved in the state. Manmohan Singh, Mohsina Kidwai and Ahmed Patel have understood our viewpoint. We are simply waiting for party chief Sonia Gandhi to decide whether it would be better for Amarinder to stay as chief minister or appoint someone else to do the job. The stalemate is hurting the party. Splitting the party would be the last resort, he said.																								Tej Prakash, who is slain Congress leader Beant Singhs son, has been demanding Amarinders removal for nearly a month. A loyalist of rebel leader Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, he was instrumental in getting 15 ministers and an equal number of Congress legislators to Bhattals camp in Delhi for over 10 days to pressurise the high command to remove Amarinder. In case the Congress splits, the rebels would float a new party, the Beant Singh Congress. 																								We are not against the Congress. This is not a Congress versus Congress fight. Amarinders style of functioning is dictatorial. He does not believe in collective responsibility. He believes in coterie raj, Tej Prakash said.																								Referring to the slapping of a corruption charge against him on Friday which made him rush with 9 legislators to governor .P. Verma and term it as Amarinders vindictive attitude for supporting Bhattal, Tej Prakash said the motive behind the complaint was proof that Amarinder has been misusing his powers.																								Tej Prakash has been charged with demanding money for bus permits. The move allegedly aimed at entangling him in vigilance proceedings. It is aimed at intimidating us into stopping our campaign against the chief minister. The governor has assured us that he would not allow any improper action to be taken in the case, he added. Senior AICC leaders have spoken to Amarinder on the issue following which the chief minister instituted a probe by the chief secretary into the matter. 																								Rebel sources said while Bhattal or her nominee could be offered the post of deputy chief minister to come to an amicable settlement in the Congress legislature party crisis, Amarinder would have to leave the home portfolio to his deputy. We will not stop short of the home portfolio. We want an end to the police raj under Amarinder. 																								Several policemen who retired months ago are still in their posts despite not getting salaries. They are not being removed because they are perceived to be helpful to Amarinder. Even Patiala SP (city) Ratan Lal Monga, who is investigating the human trafficking issue, retired in April. He was not given an extension. Instead, he was asked to continue on contract, a rebel leader revealed.																								Tej Prakash admitted that the main concern of the Congress high command at present was to avert a split. But with the stalemate continuing and Amarinder remaining firmly ensconced on the throne, the only beneficiaries would be the Shiromani Akali Dal and the BJP, he said.																								With Bhattal facing corruption charges during her tenure as chief minister in 1996, the rebels are prepared to face elections in the event of a split in the party. 																								Amarinders bid to mollify his detractors has not been able to bear fruits mainly due to the reason that his all-powerful media advisor B.I.S. Chahal, who has been removed and is in Canada at the moment, continues to call the shots and is being alleged to be behind the corruption case against Tej Prakash.

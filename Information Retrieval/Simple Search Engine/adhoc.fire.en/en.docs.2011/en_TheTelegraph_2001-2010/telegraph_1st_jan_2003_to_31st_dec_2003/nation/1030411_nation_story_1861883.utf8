Police sources said Bikash Debbarma, manager of the Tripura Gramin Banks Jampui Jala branch, and some of his colleagues and employees of the panchayat department were returning to Agartala from Jampui Jala when the vehicle in which they were travelling came under fire from militants at Belbari.																								Debbarma and Shibu Chakraborty, handyman of the vehicle, were injured in the firing. After the jeep came to a halt, the militants abducted the other 10 passengers. Two of them, Pradip Pal and Pradip Ghosh,however, escaped from their clutches.																								The injured bank manager and the handyman were found lying on the road by police personnel from Takarjala and Jirania. Both were rushed to G.B. Hospital here. The eight persons who were abducted have been identified as Kanu Ranjan Biswas, Sukumar Saha, Amulya Debbarma, Vikram Debbarma, Swapan Bhusan Roy, Adhir Mazumdar, Mahadeb Sil and Snehasish Deb. 																								The first four are employees of the Tripura Gramin Bank, while the next three are panchayat secretaries. Deb is the driver of the vehicle that was attacked. On February 2, 11 non-tribal members of a folk theatre group were abducted by the NLFT from Emraspahsa under Fatikroy police station of North Tripura district.

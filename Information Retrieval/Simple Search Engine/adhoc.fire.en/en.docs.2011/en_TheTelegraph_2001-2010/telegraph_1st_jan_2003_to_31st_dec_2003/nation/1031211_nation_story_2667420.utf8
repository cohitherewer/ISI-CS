																								Patiala, Dec. 10 (PTI): After spending over a week in jail, Shiromani Akali Dal president Parkash Singh Badal and his MP son Sukhbir Singh were released from Central jail here today after a Ropar court granted them bail in a disproportionate assets case. 																								On his release, Badal thanked thousands of party workers who had gathered to express solidarity with him and promised to continue fighting against the alleged repression unleashed by the Congress government. 																								He claimed the government would fall under its own weight and the dream of Sonia Gandhi to lead this country will never come true.

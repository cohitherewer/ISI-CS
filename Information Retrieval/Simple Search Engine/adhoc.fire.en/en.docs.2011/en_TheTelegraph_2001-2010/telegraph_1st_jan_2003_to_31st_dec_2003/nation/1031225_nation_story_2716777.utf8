(AFP)																								Kabul/Hyderabad, Dec. 24 (Agencies): Two Indian engineers kidnapped while working on a US-funded road project in Afghanistan have been released unharmed, but government officials denied claims by Taliban guerrillas that they had abducted them.																								P. Murali and G. Varadayya  from Nellore district in Andhra Pradesh  told reporters today that they had been treated well by their captors, who seized them on December 6 in the southern province of Zabul where they were working on the Kabul-Kandahar highway.																								Murali said he was not mistreated. Twice we were shifted to new locations and then for about 15 days we were kept in one place.																								The engineers  hired by the Hyderabad-based US firm, Seenaiah and Company (Projects) Ltd, one of several foreign contractors engaged in the project  were abducted when they went shopping without security. After their release, they were handed over to the Indian embassy in Kabul by Afghan authorities.																								Were delighted the boys are back with us, Indian ambassador Vivek Katju said.																								Delhi thanked the Afghan government and others for their efforts. We thank the Afghan authorities and others who worked continuously and tirelessly for the safe release foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said. Their release is a reflection of the fact that all sections of the Afghan people recognise the contribution that India is making towards the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan.																								The workers would have returned to Hyderabad today itself, but the flight left before they entered Kabul, B. Seenaiah, managing director of Seenaiah and Company, told PTI in Hyderabad. Now they will return on Sunday, he added.																								There were no demands made to us. The release was negotiated by the Afghan authorities. No harm was done during their detention Seenaiah said.																								Afghan interior minister Ali Ahmad Jalali said the men were released late yesterday. With some negotiations on the part of the government through tribal leaders and local elders in the area, finally the people who were keeping them agreed to free them with no conditions, he told a news briefing in Kabul.																								The people who kidnapped them had no relation with the leaders of the Taliban. They were local people. Although some Taliban leaders claimed responsibility for it, there is no connection between them and those who kept them in the area.																								The leaders of the Islamic militia, which was ousted in a US-led war two years ago, had demanded the release of 50 rebels held in Afghan jails in return for the Indians.																								The governor of Ghazni province, Assadullah Khan Khalid, said the captors were former members of the Taliban. They were local people, but in the past they had been Taliban, he said.																								A key player in securing the release of the engineers, who are in their twenties, was Mullah Abdul Salaam Rocketi, a commander with the anti-Soviet mujahideen, or holy warriors.																								C.S. Sethi, managing director of the joint venture for which the men worked, said they were brought to Ghazni city yesterday before being taken to Kabul. It is wonderful, he said. 																								Sethi added: We got them checked by Indian doctors at the embassy and they are in good shape and were treated well. The boys were saying that they were good people. I said to them Yes, but next time dont go with them.																								Seenaiah said his company bore no grudge against anybody in Afghanistan and would continue to work there till the job is completed. The engineers would resume work in Afghanistan after a months holiday in Andhra, Seenaiah added.

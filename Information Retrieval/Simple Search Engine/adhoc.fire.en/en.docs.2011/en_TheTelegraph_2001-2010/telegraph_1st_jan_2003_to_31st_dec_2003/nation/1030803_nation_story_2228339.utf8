		 Sunday, August 03, 2003 				 Muslims fume at PM temple vow
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Aug. 2: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees statement on a Ram temple in Ayodhya has evoked sharp reaction from the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and other Muslim organisations. 																								Before hundreds of mourners at Mahant Ramchandradas Paramhans funeral in Ayodhya yesterday, Vajpayee had announced that a grand temple would be built at the birthplace of Ram.																								Board spokesperson Qasim Rasool Illyasi described it as unfortunate and uncalled for and going against the Prime Ministers own commitment in Parliament that the government would wait for the courts verdict if a mutually agreeable solution was not found through talks. 																								The Prime Minister is fully aware that the dispute in pending in the court and his statement is tantamount to an attempt to influence the court, Illyasi said.																								The spokesperson reminded Vajpayee that he was the Prime Minister and, therefore, should not appear to be tilting towards one community against another. 																								Board vice-president Maulana Kalbe Sadiq refused to comment on Vajpayees remarks. Instead of acting and reacting, the need of the hour is to establish a dialogue for a negotiated settlement of the Ayodhya dispute. 																								Zafaryab Jilani, convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee, alleged that Vajpayees statement betrayed his governments utter contempt towards the Constitution of India.

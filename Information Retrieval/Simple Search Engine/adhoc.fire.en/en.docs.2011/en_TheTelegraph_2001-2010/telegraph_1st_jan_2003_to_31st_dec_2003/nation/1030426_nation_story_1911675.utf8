 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, April 25: Amid the growing discontent over the BJPs ties with Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party, L.K. Advani is coming here tomorrow to gauge the mood of the partys rank and file in Uttar Pradesh.																								He has been acquainted with the growing resentment in the party about continuing support to the Mayavati government and will have two interactive sessions with partymen in Kanpur and Lucknow tomorrow to discuss the state of the party, state BJP spokesman Hriday Nath Dixit said.																								Apart from addressing a party workers convention in Lucknow, the deputy Prime Minister will hold a closed-door meeting with state BJP ministers and top party functionaries here.																								Advanis meeting with the ministers will be an attempt to get the feedback on the issue of continuing support to the Mayavati government, Dixit said.																								On Advanis reviewing the performance of the BJP ministers in the state, the spokesman evaded a direct reply. It will be a free and frank discussion and anything can be discussed, he said.																								All the senior BJP leaders, including state president Vinay Katiyar, national general secretary Rajnath Singh and party in-charge of Uttar Pradesh affairs Kalraj Mishra, have been asked to remain in Lucknow for the meeting.																								The meetings assume significance as Advani will meet Mayavati in New Delhi on April 27 to normalise the relationship. 																								Both the meetings will be interactive ones in which party workers as well as ministers would be asked to freely express their views on the on-going BJP-BSP alliance, Dixit added.

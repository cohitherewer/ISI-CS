		 Tuesday, March 11, 2003 				 Mulayams son attacks BSP member
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 10: The Mayavati-Mulayam battle for supremacy in Uttar Pradesh derailed proceedings in the Lok Sabha for another day today.																								Mulayam Singh Yadavs son Akhilesh Yadav charged towards BSP member Ashok Chandel after the latter commented on the Samajwadi Party chief during zero hour, prompting Speaker Manohar Joshi to abruptly adjourn the House.																								The verbal exchanges between members of the Samajwadi and the BSP continued even after Joshi disallowed Akhilesh Singhs adjournment notice on the Mayavati tapes. 																								They clashed while BJP and Congress members were heatedly arguing about the Madhya Pradesh governments alleged non-compliance with the Election Commission directive to initiate action against some state officials on poll roll revision.																								Akhilesh Yadav, angry at Chandels remarks against Mulayam, menacingly rushed towards him. Samajwadi members Akhilesh Singh and Ramji Lal Suman backed him up.																								 Chandel, countering charges of corruption against Mayavati, had apparently wanted to know the graft charges against Mulayam, provoking Akhilesh Yadav to charge towards him.																								The development was so sudden and serious that former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar and Congress chief whip Priya Ranjan Das Munshi rushed to prevent an exchange of blows between the two.																								Sensing trouble, Joshi adjourned the House, then halfway through zero hour proceedings. Even after the Speaker left the House, the two sides continued to angrily trade charges. Mulayam was not present in the House.																								For the third day, the Samajwadi did not get support from other Opposition parties over the Mayavati tapes. Samajwadi member Akhilesh Singhs demand for cancellation of the MPs Local Area Development Scheme elicited no response either.

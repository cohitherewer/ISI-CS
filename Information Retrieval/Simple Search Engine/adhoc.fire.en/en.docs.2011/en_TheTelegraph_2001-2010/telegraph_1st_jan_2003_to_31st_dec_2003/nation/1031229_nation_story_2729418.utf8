																								Dubai, Dec. 28 (PTI): Only a minuscule 2 per cent of Gulf NRI households in India have any savings out of the remittances made from here by expatriates but they live a comfortable life, according to a survey. 																								As high as 98 per cent of the NRIs, mostly middle and low income workers from south India, who were interviewed through a questionnaire, said their families will not be able to maintain the comfortable lifestyle if they returned home.																								Thirty-four per cent of them had no savings and were eking out a hand-to-mouth existence and 31 per cent were sending money home every month, 24 per cent every two months and 11 per cent every three months. 																								The results would mean that immigrant Indians here, many of whom work on low salaries, will have to continue to slog in the Gulf as returning home does not hold out a pretty future, said K.V. Shamsudheen, president of Pravasibandhu, an NRI body which conducted the survey.																								Only 10 per cent of the 10,100 people interviewed had their family living with them in the Gulf. The surveyed people were in different age groups but the maximum of 4,857 were between 31 and 40 while 10 per cent of the total were unmarried. 																								Shamsudheen said there is only one mutual fund scheme  JM Pravasi Bandhu Fund  targeted at the low income NRIs. It would soon be implemented, he said.																								The government of India was planning to introduce an insurance scheme for NRIs before the second Pravasi Bharati Day celebrations in January next year. Kerala has already started an insurance scheme for non-resident Indians from the state.

 New Delhi, Dec. 29 (PTI):  The two Indians, who were abducted allegedly by the Taliban  on December 6 and released after 18 days, said they were  treated well by their captors and are willing to go back  to work.																								We feel as if we are born again. We almost went into the jaws of death and came back by the grace of the God, the duo  G. Varadayya and P. Murali  who arrived here from Kabul yesterday said.																								They said they were not going out to buy chicken at the time of their abduction as widely reported. Around 4.30 in the evening, we went out in the office vehicle as Varadayya wanted to call up his parents back home. Some strangers were also in the vehicle. After some Afghan colleagues got off, four armed men came in front of the vehicle, Murali said.																								We thought death was staring at us. The driver immediately stopped. The frightened locals left and the armed men got into the vehicle. They tied our hands and feet and blindfolded us. 																								After travelling for three hours, they took us to a house surrounded by hills and there they gave us food, he added.																								The duo said they were uncomfortable in the Afghani clothes which their captors made them wear, but they were treated well. 																								After two days, they kept us in a house for the rest of the period in captivity. A man, of around 18 years, who was our caretaker used to tell us that he would marry a girl from Hindustan, Varadayya said. 																								I thought that I will never be able to return to my country. I asked them thrice to release us, Murali said.																								Though their attitude towards us was good, one day a huge man threatened he would kill us. We were half-dead, he said. 																								The sound of bikes was like bells of death for them, Varadayya said.																								After 18 days, we were handed over to the mediator, Mullah Abdul Salam Raketi, who took us to a senior Afghan official. Next day, we were handed over to the Indian embassy, they said. The duo thanked the Indian government,  its embassy in Afghanistan and the Afghan government. They  expressed their gratitude towards BJP chief M. Venkaiah  Naidu for taking up the matter. Both hail from Naidus native  district Nellore in Andhra Pradesh.

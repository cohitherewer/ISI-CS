 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Thiruvananthapuram, April 29: Winds of change seem to be sweeping across the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), the CPM youth wing. The DYFIs Kerala state conference, which concluded at Kollam yesterday, made significant changes in its style of functioning.																								For the first time, the DYFI expressed readiness to work with environmentalist organisations, including the Medha Patkar-led Narmada Bachao Andolan, whose political affiliation it had called into question earlier. 																								The communist organisation also admitted that the increase in membership and support among youth was not to the leaderships expectations.																								The readiness to team up with the greens was expressed through a resolution that called upon the youth to take up environmental issues as a part of the anti-imperialist struggles.																								The resolution said: It is not right to label environmental protection activities as anti-development and to simplify them as the fads of some people. 																								It added that the youth should learn from movements led by environmentalists like Patkar and adopt them as models for future action.																								But the DYFI warned against environment fundamentalism propagated by pseudo-spiritualists, petty bourgeois elements and international financial agencies.

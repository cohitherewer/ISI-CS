		 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Rabri rapped for call to judge
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Dec. 16: The raging war between the judiciary and the executive scaled new heights today with the Patna High Court chief justice putting on record a phone call by Rabri Devi to discuss the arrest of her chief secretary.																								K.A.H. Subramaniam was yesterday briefly arrested for contempt of court and later released on bail after he refused to read out details of a case to Justice R.S. Garg.																								Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi last night called up Chief Justice Ravi. S. Dhawan to express outrage at the incident. Her husband and RJD boss Laloo Prasad Yadav, too, wagged his finger, saying no senior state government official would appear before court in future. Rabri Devi summoned Subramanian and senior officers to her house and spoke to them before making the call. She is believed to have fumed at the audacity of the court to insult her chief secretary.																								Justice Dhawan today stayed proceedings against the chief secretary on a petition filed in his court, but put on record the circumstances in which the chief minister called him up. Saying this could set off a dangerous trend, Dhawan said in an order: Unprecedented as it may seem, if certain situations have the makings of destroying a system, then they must be recorded for posterity.																								The first call from Rabri Devis office came in the evening when the chief justice was in a meeting. Her secretary was told Justice Dhawan would get back when he was free. Later, the judge returned the call in the presence of the registrar general. 																								The chief justice listened to what the chief minister had to say. The chief minister spoke on the contempt proceedings before a division of the court critically. The chief minister also desired that the chairman of the ruling party should speak to the chief justice, which he did these are dangerous trends, he said.																								Hinting that her call could have amounted to another contempt case, Justice Dhawan said: What if this court had to pass an order on the call, which was received from the chief minister? Calling up the chief justice will not solve the problem. This is not working inside the system; it will destroy the system. 																								Finally, he decided to gloss over Rabri Devis injudicious act, saying: Father forgive them for they know not what they do.																								As news of the order spilled into the Assembly, the BJP-led Opposition tabled a no-confidence motion, alleging the government was trying to intimidate the judiciary. 																								This act is unprecedented in parliamentary history, said Opposition leader Sushil Modi.																								The House has admitted the no-confidence motion. The debate on the governments performance is likely to begin tomorrow.

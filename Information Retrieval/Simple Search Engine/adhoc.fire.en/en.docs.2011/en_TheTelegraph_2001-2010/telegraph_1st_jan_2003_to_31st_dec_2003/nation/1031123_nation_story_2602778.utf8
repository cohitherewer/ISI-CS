		 Sunday, November 23, 2003 				 Apologetic Arjun queers Digvijay pitch
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Digvijay with Sonia at a poll meeting in ltarsi on Saturday. (PTI)																								Bhopal, Nov. 22: As Digvijay Singh fights a grim battle to hold on to power, his one-time mentor Arjun Singh has queered his pitch by apologising for the power crisis, so far the BJPs prime poll plank.																								AICC general secretary Ambika Soni got a taste of the intra-party feuds when she visited Bhopal to give a fillip to the election campaign. At a news briefing, she struggled to downplay Arjuns remark, claiming it was not a major issue. She said Arjun had merely apologised on behalf of the chief minister and promised that the government would tide over the power crisis in a year.																								Digvijay and the Madhya Pradesh Congress have all along maintained that the power crisis is much exaggerated. They have been saying it should be seen in context of three years of drought and the states bifurcation that saw Chhattisgarh walking away with major power plants in Korba.																								Asked why the Congress had failed to persuade chief minister Ajit Jogi to bail out Digvijay, Soni claimed Chhattisgarh did not have surplus power to dole out. Told Chhattisgarh was supplying power to several states, she said much of Madhya Pradeshs shortage had to do with sabotage and burning of transformers. But she had little to say when asked how the state proposed to prevent law and order problems.																								In Congress circles, speculation is rife about Arjuns motive in raking up the power issue. Many feel he is bent on fixing Digvijay and Soni who have displaced him as Sonia Gandhis eyes and ears.																								During ticket distribution, Digvijay, Kamal Nath and Soni had isolated Arjun and Jyotiraditya Scindia. Arjun was also against tying up with the Bahujan Samaj Party as it had upset caste calculations in Baghelkhand region where his son Rahul and another six loyalists are in the fray.																								At the central level, Arjun was seen as Sonias principal trouble-shooter and close adviser till he was replaced by lightweights like Soni and Ahmad Patel. On August 20, Arjun had given vent to his bitterness at Rajiv Gandhis birthday function in Delhi, saying self-seekers now surrounded the leadership. The remark had created a stir at 10 Janpath but could not undermine Sonis clout in the party.

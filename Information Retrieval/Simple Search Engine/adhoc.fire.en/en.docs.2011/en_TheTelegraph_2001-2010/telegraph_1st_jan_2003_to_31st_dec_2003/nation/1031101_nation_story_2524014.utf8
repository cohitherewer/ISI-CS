Carnatic great dies at 95				 																																																	chennai: Semmangudi R. Sreenivasa Iyer, the grand old man of Carnatic music, passed away on Friday at 95, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Popularly known as Semmangudi, he was the father figure to many generations of Carnatic musicians. He had been unwell for some time and was bedridden in his last week. He is survived by three sons and two daughters.				 																																																										In a musical career spanning over eight decades, Semmangudi was a vital link with an earlier generation of towering Carnatic musicians. M.S. Subbulakshmi learnt music from him.				 																																																										Born in a Brahmin family to Radhakrishna Iyer and Dharmasamvardhini Ammal on July 25, 1908, at Thirukodikaval in Tamil Nadus Thanjavur district, he had his elementary education at Semmangudi village, his fathers native place. As a schoolboy, he showed keen enthusiasm for music.				 																																																										Semmangudis musical training, which began in 1917, saw many ups and downs. He learnt classical music under four teachers. At 16, a change in his voice came as a serious setback. But it made him more resolute to become a singer.				 																																																										After he began performing in concerts in 1926 at Kumbakonam, Semmangudi developed his own style. He was the youngest artist to be conferred the prestigious Sangeetha Kalanidhi title by the Madras Music Academy in 1947.

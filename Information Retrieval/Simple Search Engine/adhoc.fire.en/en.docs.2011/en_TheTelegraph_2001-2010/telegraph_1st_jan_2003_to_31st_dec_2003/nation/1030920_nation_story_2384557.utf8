																								London, Sept. 19 (AFP): A sword used by 18th century ruler Tipu Sultan and later given to the British general who defeated him was bought at an auction in London today for over 175,000.																								Tipu Sultans bedchamber sword was presented to Scottish imperial general David Baird by the head of the British forces, Lord George Harris, following the capture of the sultans stronghold at Seringapatnam in 1799.																								Inscribed on the blade in Arabic with the words the sword of the kingdom, it was sold to an unnamed private collector for 176,438.																								It was the sort of figure we were hoping for, auctioneer Pierce Noonan said.																								I believe its one of the top five prices ever achieved at auction for a sword, Noonan added.																								Tipu Sultan, who died in the battle, was known as the Tiger of Mysore and was considered an enlightened ruler.

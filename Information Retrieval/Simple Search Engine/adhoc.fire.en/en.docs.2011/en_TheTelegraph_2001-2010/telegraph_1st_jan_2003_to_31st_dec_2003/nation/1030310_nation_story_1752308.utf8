The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, March 10, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																UK varsity rejects Indian-origin girl				 																																																	London (PTI): Bristol University is in the eye of a storm over its admission policy and discrimination against students from independent schools.				 																																																	It has refused admission to 18-year-old Sushila, daughter of a psychotherapist of Indian descent.				 																																																	Sushila became one of 100 girls studying for their A levels (equivalent to SSC in India) and was rejected by Bristol, despite scoring 296 out of 300 in A/S level in English.				 																																																	The only explanation for her rejection appears to be that she attends Westminster School, one of Britains most prestigious independent schools, which charges day pupils 12,000 per annum.				 																																																	Sushilas father, Trevor Phillips, a native of Guyana who is the new chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said his daughters rejection had shocked family and friends.				 																																																	We are extremely surprised that she did not receive an offer. Though I have no disagreement with greater access, I would have hoped that universities and the government would have a slightly more sophisticated policy than simply blacklisting independent schools, he said.				 																																																	Phillips said Bristols admission policy discriminates against many Black and Asian families who send their children to private school to escape racism within the state system.				 																17 pilgrims die in TN mishap				 																																																	Chennai: At least 17 pilgrims from Kerala were killed and 12 seriously injured in a road accident on Sunday in Dindigul district in Tamil Nadu.

Damages order on MTNL				 																																																	New Delhi: A consumer forum has directed the Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited to pay Rs 3,000 as compensation to a subscriber whose complaint was left unattended for a month.

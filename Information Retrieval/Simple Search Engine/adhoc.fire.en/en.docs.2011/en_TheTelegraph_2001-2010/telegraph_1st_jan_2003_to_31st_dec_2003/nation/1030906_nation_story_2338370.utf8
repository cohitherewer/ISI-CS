The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, September 06, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																UK Indians face heart failure risk				 																																																	London (PTI): People of Indian origin in the UK are four times more likely to be admitted to hospital with heart failures but are no more likely to die of the condition than people from the West, a study has revealed.				 																																																										A study published in the British Medical Journal found that Asian patients were on an average eight years young when first admitted to hospital. They were also more likely to be male and suffer from heart disease or diabetes.				 																																																										The checks covered hospital admissions and deaths from heart failure in 5,057 patients from the West and 336 South Asians of Indian origin between 1998 and 2001.				 																																																										The rate of heart failure is up to four times higher in the South Asians, yet survival rates for periods of up to two years are similar, if not better, the study stated.				 																																																										The authors suggested that this might be explained by heart failure among South Asians being less advanced when they were admitted to hospital, differing causes of heart failure, or by better family support after the patients were discharged.				 																NGO seeks strike verdict review				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The Kerala NGO Association on Friday filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking a review of a recent observation which said government employees had no fundamental, legal or moral right to go on strike.				 																																																										A division bench of Justices M.B. Shah and A.R. Lakshmanan had made that observation while disposing of a bunch of petitions pertaining to the dismissal of nearly two lakh striking Tamil Nadu government employees by the Jayalalithaa government.				 																																																										The bench said on August 5 that the reinstated employees would have to maintain discipline since they had no legal right, no fundamental right and no moral or justifiable right to strike work.				 																																																										Writing for the bench, Justice Shah dealt a blow to most trade unions by saying, Although trade unions have a guaranteed right for collective bargaining on behalf of employees, they too have no right to go on strike.				 																Pak to release 16 immigrants				 																																																	isalamabad (AFP): Pakistan will release 16 Indian Sikh illegal immigrants in a goodwill gesture aimed at bolstering the peace process between the two countries, its foreign ministry said on Friday.

The Indians, who will be released on Monday, were held for crossing into Pakistan without legal documents.

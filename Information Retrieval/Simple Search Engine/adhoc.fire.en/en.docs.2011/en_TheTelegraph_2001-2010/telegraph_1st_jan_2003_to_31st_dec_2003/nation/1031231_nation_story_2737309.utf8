		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Vajpayee advance guard in Pakistan
 Wagah, Dec. 30 (PTI): An  advance liaison team on security to Prime Minister Atal  Bihari Vajpayee during the Saarc summit in Islamabad today  crossed over to Pakistan through the International Border  here.																								Routes for Vajpayees travel in Islamabad, including the trip from the Chaklala airbase to the hotel, are being worked out with Pakistani agencies. A helicopter trip is not ruled out, sources said. A BMW with jammers for use in the Prime Ministers motorcade has already been taken to Islamabad.																								The team that went to Pakistan today with sophisticated gadgets and weapons, consists of personnel from the elite Special Protection Group, which takes care of the Prime Ministers security.																								Pakistan has permitted Indian security agencies to have their entire protection wherewithal during Vajpayees visit, although according to international practice the host country has to provide total security cover to a visiting dignitary.																								The sources said the Prime Ministers travel programme and route from his place of stay to the meeting venue and other places may be subject to last minute changes. Two close proximity teams have already crossed over and reached Islamabad to sanitise the place where the Prime Minister would stay. 																								Two more such groups and a house protection team would join the advance parties soon. A technical team carrying de-bugging devices would follow.																								The gadgets that the teams will carry include highly sensitive bomb detectors and those to sweep mines and explosives. The security team would carry Assault Kalashnikov rifles among other arms. 																								The sources said the threat perception for Vajpayee is very high in view of the growing activities of militants in Pakistan and the recent blasts aimed at assassinating Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf.

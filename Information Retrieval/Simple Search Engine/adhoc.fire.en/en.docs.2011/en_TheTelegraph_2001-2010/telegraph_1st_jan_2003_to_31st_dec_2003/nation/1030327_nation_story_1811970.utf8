		 Thursday, March 27, 2003 				 AIIMS clones in six states
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 26: The Centre is planning to set up health institutes modelled on Delhis prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences in six states  Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttaranchal.																								It has also decided to upgrade one medical college in every state to the status of AIIMS. A study is being carried out for this purpose.																								Health minister Sushma Swarajs decision is in line with the national health policy announced by C.P. Thakur, a former Union health minister. It envisages setting up a good medical college in all backward states.																								The main objective of Swarajs decision is to provide good and affordable healthcare to people in these states. The hospitals, like AIIMS, will be equipped with facilities for research and training.																								The Centre believes creating specialised medical institutes in states that do not have access to good healthcare will relieve the pressure on AIIMS. At present, AIIMS has to cope with a steady stream of patients from Bihar, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, many of whom camp on the hospital premises for months before being able to get appointments.																								The cost of the whole project works out to Rs 287 crore per hospital. The states will make available the land while the Centre will bear the entire cost. Swaraj said she expected the project to be completed by the 10th Plan period.																								The Centre also plans to set in motion a project to tackle emergency situations arising out of natural disasters.

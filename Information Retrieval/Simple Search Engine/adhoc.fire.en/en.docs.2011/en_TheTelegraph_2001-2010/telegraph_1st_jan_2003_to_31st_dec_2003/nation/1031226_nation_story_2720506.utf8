		 Friday, December 26, 2003  4000-kg laddoo, Kalyan amp; ally in  gift pack 
 Party fawns on birthday boy
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Minister of state for external affairs Vinod Khanna with his wife wait to wish Vajpayee. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Dec. 25: For a party that claims to shun personality cults and places a premium on the organisation rather than individuals, things were rather different on Atal Bihari Vajpayees birthday today.																								The BJP celebrations, which were set in motion with victories in three Assembly elections earlier this month, culminated with festivities marking the Prime Ministers 79th birthday. Paeans were sung, verses composed and programmes launched, with leaders falling over each other to catch Vajpayees indulgent eye.																								The jamboree actually got underway yesterday in his parliamentary constituency, Lucknow. Vajpayee gifted Lucknow five new trains and received an unexpected present when one-time bete noire Kalyan Singh turned up at a BJP function to greet him with flowers. The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister hinted he was ready to return to the BJP fold and provide it the leg-up it so badly needs in the state.																								Even when heavy fog caused Vajpayees Delhi-bound Air Force Boeing 737 to land in Jaipur last night, forcing him to continue to the capital by road, a buoyant BJP did not let slip the chance to felicitate the Prime Minister.																								Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia had already joined Vajpayee and his entourage  comprising Raj Pratap Singh, Ashok Tandon and Shiv Kumar (the conduit to Kalyan)  as they headed to Delhi from Jaipur. At the stroke of midnight, the group stopped at a Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation hotel to cut a cake and wish the Prime Minister Happy Birthday.																								The morning saw Vajpayee breakfast with his deputy L.K. Advani, finance minister Jaswant Singh and their families as well as Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.																								President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam broke protocol and called on the Prime Minister with a bouquet and a greeting card containing a few lines he had penned himself. It read: When guns are silent/ Flowers blossom on the earth/ Fragrance engulfs good souls/ Who created beautiful silence.																								Vajpayee later moved to the lawns of his 7, Race Course Road residence to receive a stream of visitors, including ministers and BJP workers, at a specially erected shamiana. His message to them was: Whatever I am, it is because of you and if the need arises, I will get down from the dais and sit amidst you.																								But he did not have to: Vajpayees presence was enough for his party workers who vied with each other to ingratiate themselves with their leader.																								In Lucknow, a 4,000-kg laddoo was distributed and a yajna performed by Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Vinay Katiyar, whose job is reportedly on the line. Lucknow artist Rajendra Karan painted Vajpayee in 51 different moods and had his paintings displayed at a government art gallery. The show was inaugurated by governor Vishnu Kant Shastri.																								In Jaipur, members of the BJPs mahila morcha prayed in temples. Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh marked the occasion with an announcement that Raipur Medical College Hospital will have a Rs one crore state-of-the-art blood bank.																								A special Jan Nayak Atal supplement brought out by a leading Hindi daily saw Vajpayees party colleagues indulge their literary passion. For Advani, Vajpayee was a swapnadrishta (visionary) and ithihaas purush (man of history). M. Venkaiah Naidu, who sparked a controversy some months ago with his lauh purush-vikas purush comparison, said Vajpayee was a model statesman for him, inspired less by political and more by nationalist feelings.																								Law Commission member and Vajpayee friend M.M. Ghatate wondered aloud: Atalji what gift can I give you? BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan extolled the Prime Minister as the captain who steered the ship through choppy seas.																								The icing on the birthday cake came from the BJP office. It launched five screen savers bearing Vajpayees pictures as well as audio accompaniments containing poems recited by him. A press release said the screen savers were the brainchild of spokesman Prakash Javadekar who expects at least one million people will download these screen savers on their computers in the next two months.

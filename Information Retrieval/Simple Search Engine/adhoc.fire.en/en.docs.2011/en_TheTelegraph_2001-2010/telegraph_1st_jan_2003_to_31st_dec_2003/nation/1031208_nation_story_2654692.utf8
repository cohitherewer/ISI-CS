		 Monday, December 08, 2003 				 Mufti plea to PM
																								Jammu, Dec. 7: Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has appealed to the Prime Minister to explore possibilities of allowing members of divided families, living along the Kishenganga in border areas of Kupwara district, to meet till the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service is launched, reports our correspondent.																								Some sort of ferry service in river Kishenganga, that serves as the border in the Karnah area, should be considered with some border posts on both sides so that members of the divided families can meet each other, the chief minister said.																								Addressing meetings in far-flung pockets of Kathua district today, Mufti spoke of recent visits by people from both sides of the river to the banks. The families exchanged greetings, expressing their desire to swim across to meet each other.																								Giving another example of love across the border, the chief minister said the local subdivisional magistrate had received a message from a distant relative who was keen to cross the river to meet him if the magistrate could not cross over himself. 																								Mufti said thanks to the ceasefire, the border, which had been out of bounds for civilians, now wears a festive look with members of the divided families throwing candies, biscuits, sweets and messages to each other across the river.																								The chief minister urged Atal Bihari Vajpayee to take note of these sentiments which he felt were the manifestations of the Prime Ministers initiatives and the pro-people policies of the state government. He said he would speak to Vajpayee and his deputy .K. Advani, requesting them to include a ferry service on the Kishenganga as part of confidence-building measures.

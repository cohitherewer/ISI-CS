		 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Amity train set to roll on Jan. 15
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Dec. 19: The  Samjhauta Express, the only rail link between India and  Pakistan, will start running from January 15.																								This was decided at a two-day meeting that ended here this afternoon.																								The agreement marks a significant step forward in normalising bilateral relations and strengthening people-to-people contact.																								India snapped the rail connection, along with air and road links, after the December 13 attack on Parliament two years ago.																								But with both sides striving to restore relations to pre-December 2001 levels, road links have been re-established and direct flights will resume from January 1.																								The Samjhauta Express will run twice a week as before, between Attari, a few km from the Wagah border, and Lahore. An extension of the service till Delhi is being considered. The old fare structure will be used until a new one is finalised.																								Samjhauta Express and freight services will resume with effect from January 15, 2004 as per the earlier timetable. The fare structure will be announced shortly, a joint statement issued at the end of the meeting said.																								The existing agreement on rail links is valid till January 20, 2004, but has now been extended till January 20, 2007.																								We are happy to announce that the two sides have agreed to restore the service on as-is-where-is basis, Muhammad Iqbal Khatri, additional general manager (passenger operation), who led the four-member Pakistani team, said.																								He expressed happiness at the very fruitful and cordial atmosphere in which the two-day talks were held.																								Continuing the bonhomie, Khatri said: I am happy to be here. The talks were constructive and co-operative. We were looked after well here.																								The Pakistan official said: I hope that the Indian delegation will visit Pakistan for further discussions. They await a warm welcome in Pakistan.																								The Indian side was led by S.B. Ghosh Dastidar, the additional member (traffic), Railway Board. 																								Ghosh Dastidar said the agreement would help India and Pakistan improve trade and commerce and interpersonal contact.																								Both sides addressed the media jointly, indicating that there was no disagreement or confusion over the issues discussed at the meeting.																								There were indications earlier that rail links would resume on January 1 just like aviation links. Asked about the significance of January 15, Ghosh Dastidar said: When we have to re-start such a service, we have to tie up all the details of the operations. Full preparations have to be made for it.																								An Indian delegation will leave for Pakistan soon to finalise details on the fare structure and the number and type of coaches in each train.

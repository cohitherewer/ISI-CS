		 Monday, March 17, 2003 				 Police hub strike claims 11 in Jammu
 BINOO JOSHI				 	 A policeman in front of a police station in Jammu. (PTI)																								Jammu, March 16: Terrorists killed 11 people when they overran a police post in Ind village of Udhampur district, north Jammu, between late Saturday and early Sunday.																								In an attack described as the most daring in the state in the past six months, the terrorists exploded grenades and fired at the police post around midnight. The rampage continued for more than an hour.																								They killed nine policemen and two civilians, injured nine people and took four policemen hostage.																								The terrorists escaped easily because of the remoteness of the village and the absence of communication facilities at the police post. They took away with them a light machinegun and more than a dozen rifles.																								The police post had become a thorn in the militants flesh because of its effective anti-terrorist operations in the mountainous terrain. 																								The police had recently eliminated Amanullah Khan, Hizb-ul-Mujahideen district commander, who was responsible for scores of murders and terror acts in the area.																								It (the attack) was an act of revenge, said Jammu zone inspector-general of police P.L. Gupta. Militants, he said, had become desperate and probably came in large numbers to attack the police post.																								Security forces have been put on alert and the mountainous terrain is being scanned, Gupta said. 																								Our first priority is to trace the missing policemen and shift the injured to hospitals.																								On Friday, militants had killed three policemen and four civilians.																								These attacks not only show the wide reach of terrorists, but also their renewed vigour after the disbanding of the special operations group of the state police that was working to contain militants.																								Bhim Singh, chief of the Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party, which is part of the governing coalition in the state, chastised the government for not allowing security forces to go the whole hog against terrorists. 																								This has caused demoralisation among the policemen in the state, he said.

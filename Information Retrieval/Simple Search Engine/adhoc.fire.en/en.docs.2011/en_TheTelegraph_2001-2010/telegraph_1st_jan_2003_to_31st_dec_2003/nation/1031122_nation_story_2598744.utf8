 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Nov. 21: The Central Bureau of Investigation has tightened the screws on former Uttar Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathi by lodging a formal protest with the state government against his unauthorised visit to the chief ministers secretariat last week.																								The CBI move puts the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in a spot as the bureaus petition in Allahabad High Court against a Lucknow magistrates order allowing Amarmani to attend the current Assembly session comes for hearing tomorrow.																								The bureau has alleged that state government officials were giving Amarmani  in jail for the murder of Madhumita Shukla  extraordinary freedom in and out of jail, enabling him to influence the probe. The CBI has protested against his use of cellphones in the jail.																								The CBIs has now alleged that though the court had allowed Amarmani to attend the Assembly only, he was taken to the secretariat annexe in a government car with a red flasher and allowed to stay there for two hours.

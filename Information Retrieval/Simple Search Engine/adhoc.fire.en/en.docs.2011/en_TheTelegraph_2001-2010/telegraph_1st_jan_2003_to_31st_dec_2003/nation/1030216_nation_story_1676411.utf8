		 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 Dhumal case on Amarinder
																								Shimla, Feb. 15 (PTI): Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and former Uttar Pradesh Governor Moti Lal Vora have been summoned by a court here on March 15 in connection with a defamation case filed by Himachal Pradesh chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal.																								Congress spokesman Anand Sharma was also issued summons on the same day in another defamation case by Dhumal.																								The court said there was sufficient ground to proceed against the three Congress leaders and directed them to appear in person.																								The case against Singh and Vora was registered on the basis of their reported allegations about Dhumals personal wealth. Sharma repeated these allegations at a news conference.																								The court directive came a day after a court in Ropar, Punjab, summoned Dhumal on February 22 in a defamation case over his alleged derogatory comments about Amarinder.																								Dhumal told reporters that Amarinder had insulted the people of Himachal, who would not forgive the Congress and give the party a befitting reply in the February 26 Assembly elections.

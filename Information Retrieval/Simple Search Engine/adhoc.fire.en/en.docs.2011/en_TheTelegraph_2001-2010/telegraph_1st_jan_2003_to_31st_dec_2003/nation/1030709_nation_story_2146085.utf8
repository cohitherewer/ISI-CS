 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 8: Commanders of the infantry divisions will begin a conference tomorrow to come to grips with the pressure of resources and the demands being made on the largest component of the army.																								The 27th Infantry Commanders Conference will be held at Infantry School, Mhow. The conference this year will be attended by the top brass from the army headquarters, including the chief, General .C. Vij, who is also from the infantry. There are more than 350 infantry battalions in the army of about 10 lakh troops.																								Official sources said the participants will discuss operational, training and management issues during the three-day meet. 																								An assessment of the equipment needed and a possible paring of demands to meet real cuts in budgetary allocations are also likely. 																								This is of particular importance because the cuts in allocations are being made when the demands on infantry units from prolonged deployment are increasing.																								It will be an introspection on the infantrys strengths and weaknesses, the sources said. 																								In future, the armys role will be infantry-centric. The conference is structured to deliberate on relevant issues through presentations and discussions and focus on ensuring the enhanced progress of the infantry, they added.																								Among the other officers expected to attend the meet are the commanders of the northern, central and training commands, director-general, infantry, Lt Gen. K. Nagaraj, and field force commanders.

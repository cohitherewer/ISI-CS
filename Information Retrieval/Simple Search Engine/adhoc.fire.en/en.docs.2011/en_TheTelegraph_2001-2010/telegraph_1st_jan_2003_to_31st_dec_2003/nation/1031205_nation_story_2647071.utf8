The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, December 05, 2003  Poll Briefs				 																Company for Jaya and Rabri New Delhi (PTI): Women never had it so  good in India with two more of them set to assume power  in the states in addition to the three already at the helm  of affairs.				 																																																										With Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan and Uma Bharti in Madhya Pradesh set to become chief ministers, in addition to Sheila Dikshit in Delhi, Rabri Devi in Bihar and Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu, it will be the first time that five states would have women chief ministers while consensus is still elusive on 33 per cent reservation for women in state legislatures and Parliament.				 																																																										Earlier, Uttar Pradesh had two women chief ministers in Sucheta Kriplani and Mayavati, Punjab in Rajinder Kumar Bhattal, Assam in Anwara Taimur, Goa in Shashikala Kakodkar, Tamil Nadu in Janki Ramachandran, Orissa in Nandini Satapathy and Delhi in Sushma Swaraj.				 																Margin master New Delhi (PTI): Delhi education minister  Raj Kumar Chauhan not only retained his Mangolpuri Assembly  seat, but also secured the highest margin. Chauhan defeated  nearest rival Megh Singh of the Bahujan Samaj Party by a  record margin of 30,315 votes. The BJP came a poor third  with its candidate Raju Balmiki polling 8,670 votes. The  BJP candidate from Saket, Vijay Jolly, defeated the Congress  Rohit Manchanda by the lowest margin of 121 votes. 				 																RSS free hand New Delhi (PTI): The RSS has remained  non-committal about early Lok Sabha polls, saying it was  for the BJP to decide. It is for the BJP to decide. We  have no opinion. The present position is favourable to the  BJP and it is a good situation, RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav  said. If the time is conducive, they can go ahead. Congratulating  the BJP, he said while in Madhya Pradesh it was a direct  fight between Digvijay Singh and the Hindutva ideology,  in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the victory could be attributed  to both the BJP leadership and the Sangh parivar. 				 																Bypoll balm New Delhi (PTI):The saffron wave has  failed to make any dent in Gujarat where the Congress romped  home in Jamalpur. The Congress retained the Jamalpur Assembly  seat for the second time by a huge margin. In Kerala, the  United Democratic Front, led by Congress chief minister  A.K. Antony, notched up a morale-boosting win in Thiruvalla,  warding off stiff challenges from Opposition LDF and the  Karunakaran faction in the party. Kerala Congress (M) candidate  Elizabeth Mammen Mathai defeated Verghese George of the  Janata Dal (S) by 4,669 votes.

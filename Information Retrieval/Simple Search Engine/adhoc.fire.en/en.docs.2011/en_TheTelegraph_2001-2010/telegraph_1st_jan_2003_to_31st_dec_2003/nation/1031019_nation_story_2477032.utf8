		 Sunday, October 19, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Pak guards on consulate vigil				 																																																	Islamabad (PTI): Pakistan on Saturday said the provincial Sindh government has removed encroachments from the disused Indian consulate building in Karachi and posted guards there and at five other properties of the Government India to protect them from potential intruders.				 																																																										Commenting on media reports about the alleged purchase of the Indian consulate building in Karachi, a statement issued by the Pakistan foreign office spokesman here said the federal government has taken up the issue with the Sindh government. 				 																																																										The Sindh government has today removed the encroachments from the said premises and posted guards there. Guards have also been posted at five other properties in Karachi belonging to the Government of India, the spokesman said on Saturday.				 																																																										The statement followed a Karachi resident Ali Baqir Naqvis claim that he had bought the property and filed a petition in Karachi High Court to permit him to take over. The court has issued a stay order and fixed the next hearing on October 22. 				 																																																										The encroachment was noticed by an Indian Airlines official in Karachi, Rama Krishna, two weeks ago and the Indian high commission had subsequently complained to the Pakistan foreign office. The Indian consulate was closed in 1992. Since then the building was kept under lock and key of the Indian high commission in Islamabad. 				 																HC stick for striking students Kochi (PTI): Kerala High Court has held  that striking students who resorted to violence in college  campuses were to be dealt with like any other offender  and should be made liable for any loss to the college property  during the strike.				 																																																										If the situation warranted, police could enter campuses without request or permission to prevent criminal activities. No special treatment could be meted to the striking students, who indulged in violence, solely on the ground that they were students or the incidents that took place inside the campus, a division bench of Justices Cyriac Joseph and K.K. Denesan said on Friday. 				 																																																										But as the college was a temple of learning, any action on the campus should, as far as possible, be taken with the knowledge of the college authorities, the bench said. 				 																																																										The ruling was pronounced on a petition filed by the principal of NSS College, Pandalam A.G. Vijayan, seeking police protection for peaceful functioning of the college. The petition said that following the dismissal of five students there was a strike in the college. The students had locked the principal in a room recently and only after police intervened, was he released.

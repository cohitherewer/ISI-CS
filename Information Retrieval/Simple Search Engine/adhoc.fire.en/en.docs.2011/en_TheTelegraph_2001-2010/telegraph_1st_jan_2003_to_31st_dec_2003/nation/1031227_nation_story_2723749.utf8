		 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Bhujbal faces quiz in stamp case
 ANAND SOONDAS Mumbai, Dec. 26: Chhagan  Bhujbal may soon be quizzed by the special investigation  team probing the fake stamp paper scam.																								The Nationalist Congress Party leader was rushed to Breach Candy Hospital yesterday after complaining of exhaustion, sleeplessness and very high blood pressure. He has said he is ready to be questioned over his alleged role in the scam.																								Bhujbal resigned as deputy chief minister on Tuesday after suspected NCP supporters attacked a television channels local office.																								The grilling will have to wait until Bhujbal is released. Doctors say Bhujbals vital organs are in order and his electro-cardiogram report normal, but add that he has been asked to remain under observation for at least a week.																								It would have been difficult for the SIT to put a (former) deputy chief minister and the states (former) home minister through hours of prolonged interrogation, a senior police officer monitoring the case said. He said it would be better if Bhujbal, who had been under intense Opposition pressure to quit, agreed to be questioned. 																								There still are a lot of loopholes in the case and the home ministrys name has been dragged into it ever since the case was busted by Pune police two years ago, he said.																								There has been speculation that Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer will be quizzed by the SIT. Sameer is rumoured to be Bhujbals messenger and the go-between in many deals. Karnataka calls CBI																								The Karnataka government has decided to hand over investigations in the stamp paper scam to the CBI. Defending the decision, the Karnataka home minister said: It was taken in the national interest when the Union government is going before the Supreme Court requesting that cases come under one umbrella.

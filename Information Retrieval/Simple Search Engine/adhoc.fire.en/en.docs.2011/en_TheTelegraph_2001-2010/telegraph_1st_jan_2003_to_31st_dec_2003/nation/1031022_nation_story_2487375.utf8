A 32-year-old phone-booth owner from west Delhi has died after being allegedly beaten by Delhi police in custody, reports our special correspondent. 				 																																																										Five personnel from Madipur police chowky picked up Sushil Kumar from his home in the localitys Jhuggi Jhopri colony around 11 pm on Monday. Chowky in-charge Rajbir Singh, head constable Kishan Singh and constables Rohtash Singh, Jai Prakash and Robin Singh had been told that residents of the slum cluster were gambling.				 																																																										Around 12.15 am, a badly bleeding Sushil was dumped outside his house. He was rushed to Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. His family said he was physically tortured.				 																																																										The police conducted an autopsy to find out the nature of injury. Sub-Inspector Rajbir Singh and the four others have been suspended, deputy commissioner of police (west) Satish Golcha said. A case of murder has been registered against them. Rajbir, he said, had failed to lodge daily diary entries regarding his arrival at and departure from the chowky and on the questioning of the suspect. 				 																																																										The action, however, failed to pacify the slum dwellers, who pelted stones and blocked traffic in the area. Even arson was reported as seven vehicles, including four buses and a government Maruti Gypsy, were damaged. The police took over seven hours to pacify the mob.

The two sides also agreed to work out a defence cooperation agreement and decided to enhance surveillance of their maritime zones to minimise incursions.

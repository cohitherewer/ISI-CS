		 Monday, June 23, 2003 				 Minister affair meet
																								Dehra Dun, June 22 (PTI): Uttaranchal Speaker Yashpal Arya has convened an all-party meeting tomorrow to resolve the impasse over allegations that a former minister had an affair with an unwed woman. 																								Arya called the meeting after the Opposition threatened to disrupt proceedings in the Assembly. We have convened an all-party meeting tomorrow morning so that the budget for the year 2003-04 can be passed smoothly, the Speaker said today.																								His comments came after leader of Opposition Bhagat Singh Koshiyari threatened to disrupt House proceedings. We want the report of the House committee on the scandal to be tabled, he said. 																								On Wednesday, revenue minister Harak Singh Rawat resigned after Jaini, an unwed Assamese girl, told a fact-finding committee that the minister had fathered her child. The chief minister ordered a CBI probe the next day.																								Criticising .D. Tiwari for giving a clean chit to bureaucrats whose names figured in the scandal, the Opposition leader asked: How come the chief minister gave a clean chit to bureaucrats without holding any inquiry?																								Koshiyari accused Tiwari of influencing the CBI probe by terming Rawats allegations against the chief secretary and the director-general on Wednesday as an emotional outburst. Rawat accused chief secretary Madhukar Gupta and his wife of conspiring against him.																								Opposition members, including MLAs belonging to the BJP, BSP, Nationalist Congress Party and the Uttarkhand Kranti Dal, also submitted a memorandum to Governor Sudershan Agarwal demanding that the government be dismissed.

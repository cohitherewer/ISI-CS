		 Friday, October 03, 2003 				 Jats seek more seats for top post
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 2: Having failed to unseat Ashok Gehlot as chief minister, the powerful Jat lobby in the Rajasthan Congress is hoping to grab the top seat by bidding for a large share of tickets for the Assembly elections. 																								The Jats are unhappy that none from their community has held the highest executive office in Rajasthan despite their dominance in the state. 																								The BJP has projected its chief ministerial candidate, Vasundhara Raje, as a Jat bahu to appeal to the community. 																								Since it is not clear if the Congress will accommodate more Jat candidates this time, the community has prepared a fact-sheet on the numerical strength of each caste in all 200 Assembly seats so that tickets are distributed according to their relative size and importance. 																								Allegedly based on a constituency-wise survey by party workers, the data has thrown up what Congress sources say are significantly exaggerated figures about how strong the Jats are in a number of seats. 																								If the Jat-sponsored survey is to be believed, there are more than six constituencies where Jats account for nearly half the population, and nearly 40 seats where they make up a quarter of the population. Jats also account for more than 14 per cent of the states population, contrary to current estimates.  Rajiv memorial																								Sonia Gandhi has been invited as a guest to a function on October 10 organised by the Union urban development ministry at Sriperumbudur in which President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will dedicate the Rajiv Gandhi Ninaivakam (memorial) at the place where he was assassinated on May 21, 1991.

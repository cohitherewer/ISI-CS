 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Sept. 3: Police have zeroed in on a man called Nissar in the Mumbai blasts case.																								According to the police, he is the man who helped train Sayyed Hanif, the mastermind of the twin blasts in the city, in explosives. 																								Nissar is also the man who is allegedly the link between Hanif and the Lashkar-e-Toiba, according to Hanifs confessions to the police.																								The recently formed Gujarat Revenge Force, of which Hanif claims to be a member, is supposed to be a module of the Lashkar. 																								The force may not have any more members except those involved in last weeks blast, said inspector Vinayak Saude, who is part of the investigating team.																								We are yet to find out more about the Gujarat Revenge Force and its links to terrorist organisations, said assistant commissioner of police Suresh Wallishetty, an investigating official. 																								The police today issued a statement saying the forensic reports of the blasts were expected within a week. 																								Joint commissioner of police Satyapal Singh said the reports were likely to prove that RDX was not used in the blasts. 																								Yesterday, investigating officer Vijay Salaskar had also said that RDX was not used in the blasts.																								Police sources said Nissar, who also allegedly operates under the name of Moin Khan, does not live in Mumbai, but drops in often from the Gulf.																								He seemed to have been here till the day before the blasts, but left town before they occurred and is expected to be in the Gulf region now.																								The police are expected to get a non-bailable warrant against Nissar from the court and issue a red-corner alert to Interpol on him.																								Nissar indoctrinated Hanif and another accused, Arshad Ansari, into avenging the death of Muslims in the riots in Gujarat last year.																								Hanif used to work in Dubai, where he got in touch with Nissar. 																								Hanif contacted Ansari, who was in Surat employed as a zari worker during the riots, and they joined hands. They were also responsible for the Ghatkopar blasts and had arranged a bomb blast in Seepz in Andheri on December 2, which was unsuccessful.																								On August 25, Hanif had taken a taxi to the Gateway of India with his wife and two daughters along with him, while Ansari had taken the other to Mumbadevi. 																								Both bombs exploded within minutes of each other.																								It is the women members of the killer team, however, that has led to a new worry for the police. 																								This blast was different from others, because here an individuals family was operational as a module. This is a much neater and more convenient way of operating terror, said a police official. 																								It would be more difficult to trace such units, as they would reside as families, as Hanifs did.

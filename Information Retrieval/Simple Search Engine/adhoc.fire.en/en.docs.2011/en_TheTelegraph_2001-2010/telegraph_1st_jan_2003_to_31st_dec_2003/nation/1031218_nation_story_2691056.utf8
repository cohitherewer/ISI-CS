 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 17: The Telugu Desam Party is mounting pressure on the Election Commission to advance Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh.																								A delegation of Desam MPs led by the partys leader in Parliament, K. Yerran Naidu, today met chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh and urged him to conduct the polls by March next year due to compelling reasons. Chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu has already dissolved the Assembly. 																								The move followed an attack by the Peoples War Group on his cavalcade a month ago.																								This is not the first time the Desam has petitioned Lyngdoh for early polls. Naidu had earlier addressed a letter to him with the same plea. 																								The party insists that the state administrative machinery will be under a lot of strain if polls are held after March 17 since school and college examinations are held around the same time and continue till late April.																								The Desam delegation argued that there would not be enough teachers available for poll duty if elections are held while the examinations are on. It would also be difficult, they pointed out, to acquire educational institutions to use as polling centres. It would be convenient if elections are held before the examinations, Naidu said.																								Elections in Andhra Pradesh would have been held in October next year had the chief minister not dissolved the Assembly in October. But now, there is a deadline of putting in place a new government by the second week of May. 																								The state will have to go for a brief spell of Presidents rule in case there is no new government by then. Naidu does not want polls under Presidents rule.

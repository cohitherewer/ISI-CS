Addressing the media, Sunanda said she had to demand Rs 2 crore from the owner of Prafful sarees, Pankaj Agarwal, as he had failed to adhere to a year-long agreement after making the first and only payment of Rs 4 lakh. She had to make a subsequent demand by sending a legal notice.				 																																																										She said they belonged to a civilised family and had no criminal links. This is a ploy to tarnish the image of my daughter and the matter has mentally affected all the members of the family, she said.				 																																																										A case has been filed against the couple and underworld don Fazlur Rehman for allegedly extorting money from Agarwal. According to police, the Shettys had hired a gangster to recover some amount which Agarwal reportedly owed their daughter as payment for featuring in an advertisement.				 																																																										We tried to settle the deal with Agarwal before he falsely implicated us, Sunanda claimed. Agarwal had made three calls in April to me in Kashmir where I was accompanying Shilpa for a film shoot. He finally filed an FIR with police on May 1 alleging that he was being threatened by an underworld gang.				 																																																										The Shettys, however, refused to comment on the recorded conversation, saying the matter was sub-judice and we are definitely innocent and will rely on the judiciary to prove our innocence. As per a Gujarat High Court directive, Surendra was on Friday interrogated by Umra police here for his alleged complicity in the case.				 																10 prisoners flee Bihar jail Supual (PTI): Ten prisoners escaped from  a sub-jail here by scaling the boundary wall after instigating  violence and injuring two security staff, officials said.

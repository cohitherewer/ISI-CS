		 Tuesday, April 29, 2003 				 Salman case charges filed
																								Mumbai, April 28 (PTI): The prosecution today submitted in a sessions court the charges it proposes to frame against actor Salman Khan, charged with killing one and injuring four people in a hit-and-run case. It said it would seek to have him charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.																								The court heard arguments on draft charges and put off the matter for further hearing tomorrow. 																								Salman urged the court to drop the charge filed under Section 304 (II) IPC, which can only be tried by a sessions court. He did not contest the other charges. 																								The actor had allegedly rammed his vehicle into a bakery in suburban Bandra on September 28 last year. He is charged with killing Noorulla Mahboob Sharif who was sleeping outside.

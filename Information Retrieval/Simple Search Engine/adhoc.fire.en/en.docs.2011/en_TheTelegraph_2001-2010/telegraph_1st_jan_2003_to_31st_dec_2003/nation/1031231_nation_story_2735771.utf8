 DEBABRATA MOHANTY																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 30: Orissa will allow industries and mining companies to establish plants in scheduled areas of the state despite a 1997 Supreme Court judgment that debars such activities by non-tribals.																								A lengthy cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here last evening decided that tribal lands could be leased out for industrial activities. 																								Chief secretary P.K. Mohanty said the 1997 apex court verdict in a case filed by NGO Samata against the Andhra Pradesh government was not applicable to Orissa as strict laws are in place for the protection of tribal lands in the state.																								The Andhra Pradesh Schedule Area Regulation Act had prohibited such transfer of land. But the law in Orissa is not the same, although it does ensure ample safeguards for tribals, he said.																								Mohanty said the industries will have to provide five per cent preferential equity shares to those displaced by the project and earmark five per cent of the net profit for education, health and other sectors in villages that fall within a 50-km radius of a factory. They would also have to have a sensitive rehabilitation policy.																								The court had ruled that transfer of land to non-tribals in scheduled areas was prohibited.

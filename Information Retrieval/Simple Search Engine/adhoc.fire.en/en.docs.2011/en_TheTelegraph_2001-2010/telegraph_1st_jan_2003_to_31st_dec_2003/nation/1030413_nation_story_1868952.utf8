 YOGESH VAJPEYI 																								Lucknow, April 12: The capital seems headed for a standstill on Monday if one goes by the chief ministers travel plans. Expecting a supporter deluge in the city for her Pardafaash rally, Mayavati has decided to hop to the venue on a helicopter. 																								A helipad has been hurriedly constructed at Ambedkar Maidan, where she will address the crowd  nearly a million people are expected  from a fort-shaped podium. 																								Moreover, April 14 is an official holiday to mark B.R. Ambedkars birth anniversary and banks and government offices will be closed. Now, the government has directed the labour department to ensure that all shops and commercial establishments are also closed.																								We will appeal to owners of shops and commercial establishments to keep their units closed. Offenders will have to face the music, a government official said. 																								Two days to go before the rally, the city already seems to be in a blue mood. Wherever one looks, blue buntings are fluttering in the wind. Nearly 800 gateways of blue cloth have come up at crossings. Walls, including the one opposite the Assembly and the state BJP headquarters, have huge blue graffiti appealing to people to attend in large numbers. 																								Huge cut-outs of Kanshi Ram, Mayavati and Ambedkar have sprung up across the city, including almost a dozen  each 30 feet high  at the venue itself. 																								The administration has made elaborate arrangements for crowd management in the city as well as Charbagh station, where 16 BSP activists were killed after Mayavatis rally on November 29 last year. An official of AGM rank will be present at the station on Monday to supervise the arrangements.																								Accompanied by mentor Kanshi Ram, Mayavati personally inspected the arrangements today. She visited the venue of the rally as well as the Ambedkar Smarak in Gomti Nagar and Laxman Mela, where major functions in connection with Ambedkars birth anniversary will be held. 																								The BSP has requisitioned four special trains, costing Rs 4.5 lakh each, for the safe and speedy return of its supporters. The railway authorities are also attaching extra coaches to existing trains to ferry the rallyists. 																								The district administration has requisitioned all 325 city buses in Lucknow to transport the rallyists. There would be no buses for ordinary commuters from Sunday evening to Tuesday. 																								The government machinery is working overtime not only to make arrangements for the comfort and convenience of BSP activists coming for the rally, but also to provide the chief minister with ammunition against Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav.																								As Mulayam Singh and his outfit will be the main target of Mayavati  the rally has been called to expose them after the release of the first Mayavati tape in March  state officials have been collecting evidence for her. 																								A five-member committee, headed by the chief secretary, has prepared a detailed report for Mayavati on misuse of discretionary funds by Mulayam Singh during his tenure. The information department has been asked to come out with clippings of Mulayam Singhs utterances during the Ayodhya movement. She intends to go for a ruthless and total exposure of Yadav and we are gathering facts about what he did and said during his tenure as the CM in 1990, said a senior official.

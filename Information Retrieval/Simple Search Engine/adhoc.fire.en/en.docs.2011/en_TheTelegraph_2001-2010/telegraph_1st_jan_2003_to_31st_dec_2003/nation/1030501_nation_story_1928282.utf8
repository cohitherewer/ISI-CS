		 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 VHP faces temple music
 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, April 30: The two-day conclave of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir Uchchadhikar Samiti today failed to come up with a time-bound programme for construction of the Ram temple. Instead, it ended with leaders blaming each other.																								Announcing the VHPs next phase in its agitation  sansad mein kanoon banao, mandir ka nirman karao (pass laws to construct the temple)  Ashok Singhal sought to distance the VHP from the BJP.																								The VHP chief said: The BJP should remember that its change in fortunes came about because of the sacrifices made by the kar sevaks, not due to Advanis rath yatra. This time, well approach all MPs, irrespective of party affiliations.																								But even though it was suggested that the MPs could be pressured into supporting the temple construction, VHP hardliners were far from satisfied. Speaking on their behalf, the chairman of the VHP-sponsored Ram Janmabhoomi Trust, Ramchandra Paramhans, said: The VHP was never serious about the temple. Had it been, the temple would have come up long ago. Instead, they were preoccupied with installing the BJP government.																								The chairman of the high-powered panel, Mahant Avaidyanath, said: Though there may be differences in perception, none of us will leave the VHP till the temple has been constructed. But he admitted that the impression that the VHP was working in tandem with the BJP had weakened the temple movement.																								Singhal went on to say that the campaign to persuade MPs would be launched in the current session of Parliament and would continue into the next. 																								He accused perverted secularists and Muslim fundamentalists of putting hurdles in the way of temple construction.																								Singhals remarks failed to impress veteran activists who recalled VHPs battle cry of the early 1990s  Ram lalla ham aayenge, mandir vahin banayenge. The VHP chief admitted that different versions of the song had not taken the outfit any closer to the temple construction.																								He said the VHP had tried to slow the tempo after the mosque was demolished in 1992. The new theme songs, Singhal said, were mandir kahan banana hai, mandir bana banaya hai. (The temple does not have to be built, it is already there) and its later version, mandir bana banaya hai, mandir bhavya banana hai (The temple is already there; we have to make it magnificent).																								In view of the November Assembly elections in four states and next years Lok Sabha polls, the VHP think-tank appears to have opted for moderation. A senior RSS functionary said: We dont mind placing the sadhus and mahants at the forefront, but we cant let them take over the movement. The creation of the 51-member high-powered committee in September last year was aimed at clipping the wings of Nyas chief Paramhans.

		 Saturday, June 07, 2003 				 RSS seeks quota rethink
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 6: The RSS has called for a review of the reservation policy before formalising a decision on earmarking a separate quota for the economically backward classes or Muslims left out of the Scheduled Castes/Tribes and Other Backward Classes lists.																								Responding to a question at a news conference held today, RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav underlined the need for a review, saying some backward classes deserve benefits but are not offered any.																								Due to certain political compulsions, different kinds of reservation proposals have been made for women, the upper castes and so on, he said.																								Asked to comment on BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidus proposal of reservation for economically backward Muslims, Madhav said: If it is given to the poor from all sections, Muslims and Christians should be included because they are part of our society.																								He, however, dismissed the idea of creating a reservation slot for religious minorities. The issue of reservation for religious minorities should be debated threadbare, he said.

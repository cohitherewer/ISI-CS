		 Friday, August 22, 2003 				 Amar attacks Mayavati over raids
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 21: Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh today alleged that Mayavati and a cabinet colleague of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister camped in Delhi to monitor the raids by excise officials on the factory owned by his father and younger brother in Ghaziabad.																								Singh appealed to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to take steps to stop the terror tactics against his family members and party leaders.																								The Samajwadi leader alleged that Mayavati deployed 2,000 police personnel for the search but neither spurious liquor, nor unaccounted money could be found. The raid on the ethyl acetylene factory owned by Singhs father Harish Chander Singh and his younger brother Arvind began late on Monday and continued well past midnight.																								I must thank Vajpayee for his statement in the Lok Sabha on the issue raised by party leader Mulayam Singh (Yadav). Mere statement is not enough. The Prime minister should initiate active steps to see that Mayavati does not use such terror tactics, Singh told reporters here.																								Vajpayee had talked of the need to stop the raids. 																								Singh said the Uttar Pradesh government was directly responsible for the raid while the Centre was indirectly involved and requested him to convene an all-party meeting to decide if family members of politicians are allowed to do business or not.																								I will be the first person to tell my family members to close down their business or factory, he said. But politically motivated action should not be encouraged in public life.																								The Samajwadi leader also requested the Prime Minister to ascertain the character and conduct of his father from Uttar Pradesh Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri, a childhood friend and immediate neighbour in Calcutta.																								Answering a question, he said the Samajwadi was committed to fight communal forces and would ensure that secular votes are not divided in the coming Assembly elections in five states.

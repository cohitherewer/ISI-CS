		 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 PM Bihar frown fires up Laloo opponents
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Rabri Devi in the Assembly on Wednesday. (PTI)																								Patna/New Delhi, Dec. 17: A censure of the Bihar government by the Prime Minister and a doomed no-confidence motion have breathed fresh life into the Opposition in Bihar, helping the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to regroup and revitalise forces opposed to Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								The no-trust motion fell through today after a full days debate on the malgovernance by chief minister Rabri Devi. But the Opposition put up a rare show of unity and launched a concerted attack on the government over issues ranging from the spiralling murder graph to the detention of the chief secretary for contempt of court.																								If the spate of deaths was not enough discredit, the chief secretarys arrest put the government to shame. Then the chief minister called the chief justice and sought to interfere in the jurisdiction of the judiciary, BJP leader Sushil Modi said while tabling the motion in the Assembly.																								Rabri Devi said it was within her power to call up the chief justice but added that I would rather not comment on that.																								Modis comment triggered a series of similar statements from leaders of the other Opposition parties such as the Samata Party and the Janata Dal (United).																								In the Lok Sabha, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee contested allegations that the Centre is meting out step-motherly treatment to Bihar. Vajpayee said infrastructure projects valued at Rs 2,500 crore have been identified in the state.																								Reprimanding the Rabri Devi government for poor pace of expenditure, the Prime Minister said it should gear up machinery for completing projects on time.																								Dissatisfied with the Prime Ministers statement, Laloo Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal legislators rushed into the well of the House.																								But the NDA in Bihar has seized on the Prime Ministers criticism and offer of projects to launch a fresh bid to forge unity.																								The Samata and Dal (United) national executives, which will meet on December 18 to formalise the merger, have been exploring the possibility of approaching smaller parties to join the NDA.																								BJP sources said a breakthrough towards regrouping of the anti-Laloo Prasad forces would be accomplished if Lok Janshakti leader Ramvilas Paswan rejoined the NDA. It is learnt that Paswan has favourably responded to this overtures. With Mayavati out of the BJP camp, the NDA will need a Dalit platform.

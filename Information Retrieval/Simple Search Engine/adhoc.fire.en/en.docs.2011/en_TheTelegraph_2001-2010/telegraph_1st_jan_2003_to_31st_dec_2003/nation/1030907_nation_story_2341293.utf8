		 Sunday, September 07, 2003 				 Cong sweeps Delhi varsity polls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 6: The students wing of the Congress made a clean sweep of the Delhi University Students Union elections by bagging all the four seats, in what is being perceived as an indicator for the coming Assembly elections.																								The National Students Union of India (NSUI) improved upon its last years performance by snatching the posts of president, vice-president and secretary from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and also retained the seat of joint secretary.																								The NSUIs Rohit Chaudhury beat the ABVPs Sheetal Sharda by nearly 13,000 votes to bag the presidents post. Narendra Tokas was elected vice-president with a margin of 8,500 votes, according to the results announced today.																								Ragini Naik was elected the union secretary, defeating her ABVP rival Niharika Sharma by 15,000 votes, while the NSUI retained the joint secretarys post with Pankaj Kochar defeating the ABVPs Gaurav Pandey by about 7,000 votes. 																								The ABVPs candidates for vice-president, secretary and joint-secretary got only about 4,500 votes, the results showed.																								We think that it was not just a students union elections but an ideological fight between the NSUI and the ABVP. The Delhi University students have discarded the BJP and RSS communal ideology by giving us all the four seats, said Nadeem, the NSUIs national vice-president and in charge of Dusu polls.																								Nadeem said the NSUI had worked throughout the year and had taken up students-related issues like fee hike, hostel problems. 																								The organisation had also protested against the NDA governments attempt to commercialise and communalise education, he added. In contrast, the ABVP had become complacent after clinching three posts last year, alleged Nadeem.																								Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit said: It is very heartening to note that NSUI has swept the polls. It gives us a lot of confidence but we have to work hard. It does not mean we can sit quietly.																								ABVP state secretary Jatin Mohanty attributed his organisations defeat to the support extended by the Congress to the NSUI. 																								Mohanty said the Congress was treating this as a prelude to the Delhi Assembly elections unlike us.																								Congress president Sonia Gandhi congratulated the four winning candidates when they went to meet her at her 10 Janpath residence.

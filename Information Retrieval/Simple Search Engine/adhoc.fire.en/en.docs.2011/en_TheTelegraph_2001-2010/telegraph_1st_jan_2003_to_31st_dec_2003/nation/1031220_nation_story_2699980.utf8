																								Mumbai, Dec. 19 (PTI): Encounter specialist sub-inspector Daya Nayak, under probe for his alleged nexus with gangster Chhota Shakeel, was today transferred along with nine other police officials.																								Nayak was moved out of the crime branch to Charkop police station in suburban Kandivili with immediate effect by city police commissioner P.S. Pasricha. Three other sub-inspectors of the department were also transferred.																								Bombay High Court recently rejected Nayaks petition that challenged a special courts order directing police to probe his alleged nexus with the underworld on a journalists complaint.																								The sub-inspector, who had shot dead 70 gangsters in encounters, is alleged to have accepted Rs 5 crore from Shakeel, along with the scribe, Ketan Tirodkar, to get policemen transferred.																								Based on Tirodkars complaint, the special court had ordered assistant commissioner of police Shankar Kamble to conduct the probe and carry out searches on Nayaks premises. Tirodkar has sought pardon.

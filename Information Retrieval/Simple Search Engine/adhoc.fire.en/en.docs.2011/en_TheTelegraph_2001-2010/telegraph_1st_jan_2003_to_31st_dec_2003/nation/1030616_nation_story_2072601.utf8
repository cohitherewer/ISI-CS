The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, June 16, 2003 				 Correction
																								Barrister P.C. Sen was inadvertently referred to as Justice P.C. Sen in the report, Karishma battle enters next round, on June 14. The senior counsel was appearing for author Barbara Taylor Bradford in the case against Sahara Manoranjan before trial judge Justice M.H.S. Ansari at Calcutta High Court last Friday. The error is regretted.

																								Hyderabad, Nov. 25 (PTI): Nine persons were charred to death and four injured in a blast that ripped through a detonator factory on outskirts of the city today.																								Seven bodies have been identified but two more are yet to be retrieved from the debris of the Indian Detonators Limited (IDL) plant, police said.																								Andhra Pradesh chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu, who visited the blast site, has ordered a judicial inquiry. Naidu also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 1 lakh to each of the victims. 																								Describing the mishap as unfortunate, the chief minister said all precautions would be taken to prevent recurrence of such incidents. The judicial probe, Naidu said, would go into lapses in safety systems.																								The blast was so powerful that the unit where the detonator fuse was being manufactured collapsed. 																								Assuring the agitated workers, Naidu said he would direct the Ranga Reddy district collector to negotiate with the management for adequate compensation to the families of victims. 																								This is the second such mishap in the IDL plant. 																								Earlier in 1980, seven people were killed in an explosion in the factory premises.

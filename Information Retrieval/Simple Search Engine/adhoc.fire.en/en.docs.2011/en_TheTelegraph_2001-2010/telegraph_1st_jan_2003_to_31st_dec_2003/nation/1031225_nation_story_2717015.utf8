Pataudi to vacate the government bungalow allotted to the royal family here 53 years ago.				 																																																										Following an undertaking that the bungalow would be vacated after four months, Justice Vijender Jain asked the ministry of urban development to allow the Pataudis to retain the 1, K. Kamaraj Marg residence till April 30.				 																																																										Pataudi had filed the petition following an intimation by the directorate of estates that its representatives will come on Wednesday to execute the eviction order passed on November 10.				 																																																										Advocate Rajiv Nayar, appearing for the Pataudis, said his client was not going into the legality of the matter and added that they needed four months to vacate the bungalow.				 																																																										He said Pataudi was seeking time as he has to go abroad for medical treatment.				 																																																										The bungalow was initially allotted to Pataudis father when he was appointed as an officer on special duty in the external affairs ministry in 1950.				 																																																										On his resignation in 1951, his wife, the Begum of Bhopal, was permitted to retain the accommodation considering the status of the family. After her death in 1995, Pataudi was also allowed to have possession of the bungalow on the same ground.

Garder has been directed not to leave the country without the permission of the trial court.				 																																																										US embassy consular Nyda Budig, who was present in the court during the proceedings, undertook not to issue any fresh travel documents to the accused, whose passport has been seized by the police.				 																																																										Additional sessions judge Deepa Sharma had on December 20 rejected Garders bail plea after he failed to prove that the weapons were actually purchased from Kabul and that he was authorised by the Afghan authorities to carry the same to the US.

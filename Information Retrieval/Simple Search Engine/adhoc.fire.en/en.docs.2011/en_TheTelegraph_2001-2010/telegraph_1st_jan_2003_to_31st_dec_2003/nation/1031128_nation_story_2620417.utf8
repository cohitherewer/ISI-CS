Both the collectors were earlier removed for violating the model code of conduct in force for the Assembly poll.				 																																																										The commission filed two separate petitions in the court of Chief Justice K.H.. Kuranga challenging the order of the tribunal. The court fixed the hearing for Friday by a division bench.				 																																																										Senior advocate Kanak Tiwari said the tribunal had the jurisdiction to hear the service disputes between the employer and the employees and the poll panel was a constitutional authority to hold elections and was not the employer.

Bastar and Jashpur collectors  L.. Suryawanshi and B.S. Anant  were not transferred as per the directions of the tribunal but when the new district collectors have taken charge of those districts it would not be in the interest of the people and the election to change them, the poll panel told the court. 				 																																																										The commission had on October 29 ordered for removal of Jashpur and Bastar collectors for violating the model code of conduct. 				 																																																										They went to the tribunal on October 31 and obtained a stay against the order but that was vacated by the Chhattisgarh High Court petition of the poll panel on November 14.				 																																																										Both the collectors were relieved on November 20.

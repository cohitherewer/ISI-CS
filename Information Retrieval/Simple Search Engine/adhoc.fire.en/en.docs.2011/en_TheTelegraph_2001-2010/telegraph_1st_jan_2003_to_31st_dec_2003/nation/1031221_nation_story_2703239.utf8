The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Surrender and handover hand in hand
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Guwahati, Dec. 20: The  first cracks appeared in the United Liberation Front of  Asom today, with seven hardcore rebels surrendering with  arms to Assam police.																								The militants fled their camp in Bhutan, which was later demolished, and accused the outfits leadership of not warning them about the Royal Bhutan Army offensive.																								The day also saw six Ulfa rebels, including publicity secretary Mithinga Daimary, being handed over to police by the army following a directive from Gauhati High Court.																								A report from Jalpaiguri adds that the army handed over abducted businessman from Cooch Behar Gopal Debnath and five top members of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation to the district police.																								The KLO militants handed over include Milton Burma alias Mihir Das, the second-in-command of the outfit, Tom Adhikary alias Joydev Roy, the chief of its action squad, Sanjoy Adhikary, Pabitra Singha alias Prakash Singha and Bhim Dakua alias Jayanta Das.																								In the case of the Ulfa, the army virtually had no option but to hand over the six rebels to Tamulpur police this evening with the Bhutan government clarifying today that all the captured and surrendered rebels are being immediately handed over to the Indian army.																								We have no use for them as the aim of the operations is to flush out all the rebels from our territory, Thinley Penzor, the counsellor at the Bhutan embassy in New Delhi told The Telegraph. 																								We have been handing them over immediately. Nalbari deputy commissioner K.C. Samaria confirmed tonight that the process of handing over the six rebels is under way, Penzor said.																								A source in the district administration clarified: Take it (the handover) as done. But the process of formalities for the handover is a lengthy one. 																								Daimary  alias Deepak Das  was captured by Bhutanese soldiers on Tuesday, a day after Operation All-Clear was launched to flush out the National Democratic Front of Boroland, the Ulfa, and the KLO rebels from Bhutan. 																								However, more damaging for the Ulfa was the surrender of the seven rebels  including a self-styled lieutenant and two sergeants  who gave themselves up to Darrang superintendent of police Izaz Hazarika. They also laid down at least four AK-56 rifles, 11 magazines and 335 rounds of ammunition. 																								The rebels, based in a Ulfa camp in Kawoipani, claimed to have fled soon after the operations started. 																								Hazarika quoted the surrendered rebels as saying they were kept in the dark by their leadership about the Bhutan army offensive. They fled soon after the surprise attack by the Bhutan army started on Monday morning and entered Darrang after trekking for five days without food and water, he said. 																								The allegations by the seven rebels will provide fresh fodder to security forces, which have claimed that the rebel leaders fled leaving the lower-ranked cadre to fend for themselves.																								Official sources said the formalities are under way for the handing over the body of seniormost Ulfa leader Bhimkanta Buragohain, who died in custody of the Bhutan army after his surrender, to Assam police.																								Ulfas woes continued with Captain Biju Deka alias Niloy Baishya surrendering to the Bhutan army this morning with 24 of his colleagues.

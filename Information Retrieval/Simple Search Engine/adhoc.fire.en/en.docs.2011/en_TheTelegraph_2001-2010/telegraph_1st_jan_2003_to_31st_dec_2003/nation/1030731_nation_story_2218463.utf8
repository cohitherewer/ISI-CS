		 Thursday, July 31, 2003 				 Now, Sena wants Shinde scalp
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 30: A day after the BSP forced repeated adjournments in the Lok Sabha demanding that a Union minister be sacked, the Shiv Sena today caused disruptions, demanding the Maharashtra government be sacked over Mondays bus blast in Mumbai.																								The BSP held up proceedings yesterday as it demanded that culture minister Jagmohan be sacked for allegedly tarnishing the image of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati over the Taj corridor project.																								Today, it was the turn of the Sena, which forced an adjournment during zero hour, demanding that the Congress-led government be sacked over the Ghatkopar bus blast in which three people were killed and over 40 injured.																								Sena MPs continued to shout even as agriculture minister Rajnath Singh spoke about the kharif crop and law minister Arun Jaitley introduced a bill to amend the Representation of Peoples Act.																								When the House reassembled at 2 pm after the lunch recess, Sena members rushed to the front row demanding a statement from deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani. Deputy Speaker P.M. Sayeed who was in the chair refused to oblige, saying the rules did not permit this as it was not zero hour.																								But the Sena MPs would not budge and kept shouting slogans, lambasting the Congress and the Sushil Kumar Shinde government. It was 40 minutes before order could be restored.																								The Congress had disrupted the House as soon it assembled, forcing question hour to be adjourned as it demanded a discussion on the Arunachal Pradesh crisis. After 20 minutes of slogan-shouting, Sayeed adjourned the House till 12 pm.																								But more trouble was in store. As soon as zero hour began, Sena members responded with slogans of no question hour, no zero hour. They alleged that the Congress had a hand in Mondays blast, prompting Congress members to stand up to counter Sena MPs.																								Order was restored after the chair allowed Sena leader Chandrakant Khaire to make a submission on the blast and BJP chief whip V.K. Malhotra said Advani would make a statement on the matter tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, July 21, 2003  Raipur puts faith in Atal, not Ram
 The Big Picture / Mahesh Rangarajan The road to power does not run  through Ayodhya. Belief in Atal Bihari Vajpayee outranks  the fervour for speedy construction of the Ram temple. This  is the key message of the Raipur session of the national  executive council of the BJP.  True enough, the issue was discussed  at the highest level in the party for the first time since  the NDA came to power in 1998. But in a neat flip-flop of  its position adopted at Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, 14 long  years ago, it sidestepped the demand for legislation raised  in strident terms by other Sangh affiliates.  The issue can only be settled  via consensus and the search for a settlement must continue.  Vajpayee minced no words when he took on the Vishwa Hindu  Parishad. It cannot cross the Lakshman rekha and  hope to enjoy his confidence.  The logic of the NDA has for now  stalled the drive to make the Ayodhya issue the be-all and  end-all of Indian politics. With his strident calls for  the Prime Ministers resignation, Ashok Singhal actually  virtually ensured there would be a strong response but not  on the lines he favoured.  As with other ruling parties,  the BJP will not brook an in-house opposition. It is now  in its interest and that of its leadership to rein in the  VHP and other affiliates. The issue must remain alive but  not get out of hand. The party will set the pace: other  parivar affiliates will have to fall in line.  The party resolution pointed to  the compulsions of power. It did affirm a belief in a law.  But it was more for form than for content. Such a prospect  only arises if the allies bolt, leaving the party in the  lurch. It would then need the Ram temple as a distinguishing  mark for itself. Such a situation looks highly unlikely.  Raipur actually marks a careful  retreat. At Palampur, then party president L.K. Advani had  proclaimed Ayodhya as the electoral mascot of the movement  and the party. Both were united on one question. The matter  concerned the belief of millions of Hindus and their will  would prevail.  Now, a polarised polity would  actually work against the interests of the party. Now, more  than ever, the partners have to be mollified. More than  that, playing the saffron card will only ease the Congress  newfound strategy of trying to unite all anti-Hindutva elements  on a secular platform.  By leaning towards the centre  of the political spectrum, the BJP will try to project a  reasonable image. And no better person than the one senior  leader who never took the rath bound for Ayodhya, Vajpayee.  A bow towards the cadre is evident  but it is largely a sop. Enacting a law would be ideal but  it must wait another day.  Hardheaded political analysis  also favoured a middle path. As recently as March 2002,  the Ram issue failed to yield a dividend of votes in the  Assembly elections of Uttar Pradesh.  At the national level, there is  even less chance the card will work wonders as it did in  1991. A close look at the line-up in the last elections  will explain why. It will also dampen some of the tall claims  made in recent weeks.  Party president Venkaiah Naidu  aims to secure as many as 300 seats for the BJP, up from  182 last time. At Raipur, general secretary Pramod Mahajan  raised the ante to 500 seats for the alliance. This compares  to 294 won in 1999 in the last general elections.  Given the Lok Sabha has only 543  seats, the key would be to bind the 22 remaining allies  together. Two small players, Ram Vilas Paswan and the National  Conference, have already left.  But there is the distinct possibility  of two new entrants. The Bahujan Samaj Party would enable  the party to make a fight of it in Uttar Pradesh, one of  the few strongholds where it can hope to increase its current  tally of seats. Across the Hindi belt and in Gujarat, there  is little extra ground to be taken from the Congress or  other rivals. There is ground to be retained, but little  to be won. The calculation is simple. The  alliance must reach and then cross the 272 mark. To do so,  it has to improve, not worsen, relations with its allies.  Though they won just over half the seats the BJP did, the  pooling together of votes is what gives the larger party  the edge over the Congress. In fact, it won as many as 54  per cent of the 339 seats in which it put up candidates.  The allies made all the difference.  None but the Shiv Sena shares the views of the Sangh on  the matter. Even Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati,  conceivably the single most crucial partner in the general  elections, would not want the issue to endanger harmony  in her home state.  In place of the Ram issue, raising  questions on Sonia Gandhis fitness for the post of Prime  Minister would work better. It would unify the allies, many  of whom have roots in antipathy to the Congress.  This is especially true of a potential  ally in the south who makes no bones of her opposition to  the Congress president on account of the latters foreign  origin. In Tamil Nadu, there is a real prospect that the  improvement in relations with the ADMK will bring back an  old ally to the NDA ranks. The party would displace the  DMK, now a shadow of its former self. The actual campaigns will assume  a clear shape only as the general elections draw closer.  But there is little doubt on the core of the Raipur resolutions.  Vajpayee and his credentials as coalition leader will be  the trump card. Ram will not be jettisoned but will remain  on the back burner. It may be a longer wait than some may  have counted on.

Following complaints about poor security, the temple administration has decided to install five secret close-circuit cameras at strategic locations, with a police officer in a nearby control room monitoring the pictures. The commandos will be placed at various locations inside the temple, said a temple official. 				 																																																										The identity of everybody working in the temple, other than the servitors, will also be recorded. 				 																																																										During a visit to the shrine, the National Security Guards commander had advised the temple administration to evacuate all encroachers from the vicinity. A proposal for an extensive security arrangement was submitted by the Puri superintendent of police in the aftermath of the attack on the Akshardham temple in Gujarat last year.				 																																																										Temple officials said metal detectors at the four main gates and four heavyduty searchlights are also part of the security programme. 				 																Sahara joins The Rising rowMumbai: The Rising seems to sink deeper into controversy every day. In a retaliatory move, Sahara India on Thursday withdrew its support to the film, saying that its producers dropped actress Aishwarya Rai from their rolls last week unceremoniously, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										The actress is closely associated with the Sahara family and is a director on its board.				 																																																										Sushanto Roy, chief of Sahara media and entertainment, said in a statement that it was unfortunate that Sahara was having to withdraw its association from Mangal Pandey  The Rising.				 																																																										But co-producer Bobby Bedi, speaking from Delhi, dismissed the Sahara statement. How can they withdraw support? They were never in, he said. Sahara is associated with Manmohan Shetty, who is very closely involved in financing and presenting the project. But Sahara had nothing to do with this project so far, he said. 				 																																																										The films producers said Rai was dropped because she wanted to double her fees after the agreement was drawn up on the advice of her American agent, a claim corroborated by her Indian agent.				 																																																										But the Sahara statement came out emphatically in support of the actress. We had planned to be joint partners in the project, however, we shall never continue with any association where the concerned people shall not care for the respect of our pariwar and pariwar people.

		 Sunday, August 10, 2003 				 Experts see hope in SC riot ruling
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Aug. 9: Legal experts have termed the Supreme Courts notice to the Narendra Modi government as a ray of hope for the riot victims.																								They say the apex court directive to the Gujarat government to provide all documents related to the Best Bakery case and the appeal against the acquittals by a fast-track court filed by the government in the high court is a slap in Modis face.																								Although the government was forced to appeal against a verdict it had consistently defended, experts do not expect much as it has sought only re-evaluation of the judgment, not retrial. It is merely an appeal, which in normal times takes at least 10-15 years to be heard, said criminal lawyer M.M. Timirzi.																								Rights activist and lawyer Girish Patel is cynical about the outcome of the appeal drafted hurriedly to make the NHRC appeal infructuous. It is very difficult to change or set aside the verdict of a court, Patel said.

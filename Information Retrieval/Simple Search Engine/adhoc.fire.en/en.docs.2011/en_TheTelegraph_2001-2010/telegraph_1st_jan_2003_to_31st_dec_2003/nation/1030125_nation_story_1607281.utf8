		 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 CBI seeks to cut data red tape
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 24: CBI director P.C. Sharma today advocated that conventional ways of seeking international assistance on criminal matters, such as gathering information through letters rogatory, should be done away with as it takes years to get a response.																								Serious crimes like terrorism, cyber crimes and economic offences, including money laundering, cannot be tackled without international cooperation, Sharma told liaison officers at embassies in Delhi.																								As an example of the problems faced in gathering information from abroad, the CBI director cited the difficulty in getting details of bank transactions of an accused due to secrecy laws of banks in other countries.																								The CBI director lamented that though various resolutions have been passed, nothing has worked out.																								Liaison officers of 18 countries that have their consulates in New Delhi were invited for the conference organised today by Interpol. 																								Among them were those of the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Nepal, Sri Lanka and South Africa. However, Pakistan was not invited to the conference.																								CBI officers of the level of joint director were also present at the conference held to find ways of speeding up international assistance and sharing of technology between nations, on the need for which there was general agreement between the participants.

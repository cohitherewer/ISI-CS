		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Amarinder bows to rebels in graft war
 GAJINDER SINGH 				 	 Amarinder: Face-saver																								Chandigarh, Dec. 30: Bowing to pressure from dissidents led by agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, chief minister Amarinder Singh today removed vigilance chief A.P. Pandey. 																								Pandey was handpicked by Amarinder for his crusade against corruption, which culminated in former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son, Sukhbir, spending almost a fortnight from December 1 in jail. He was provided unbridled powers that also allowed him to keep a close a watch on ministers.																								But Pandeys decision to refer for inquiry to the Chandigarh police an unsigned corruption complaint against transport minister and Bhattal-loyalist Tej Prakash Singh forced Amarinder to remove him. Tej Prakash was accused of taking bribes to provide bus permits. 																								Pandey has done a very good job since I picked him in early 2002. But he has exceeded his brief. He should have referred the complaint against Tej Prakash, one of my ablest ministers, to the chief secretary or to the minister of the department, that is me, before marking it to a different police force for a probe, Amarinder said. 																								Pandey will now swap places with Izhar Alam as additional director-general of police (administration), a punishment posting in police circles here. 																								Denying pressure from dissidents to remove Pandey, Amarinder said: I never buckle under pressure. 																								Amarinder today also ordered a probe by a retired high court judge into allegations of hawala transactions against his son Raninder as reported in a daily on Sunday. The report alleged that Raninder had received $100,000 in his capacity as partner in a firm called Punjab Intranet Company. The commission will submit its report in three months. 																								Claiming that his son was not involved in the scam, Amarinder yesterday said Raninder had nothing to do with the company in question. 																								The chief minister blamed the BJP for the allegations against his son. This is a major attempt to stop the anti-corruption drive we have launched in the state. They want us to put a lid on the drive, he said. 																								Reflecting a rift in the Punjab council of ministers, Bhattal and 12 of her supporters boycotted a cabinet meeting today. Amarider explained that no quorum was needed for a cabinet meeting and he has held them with fewer members. 																								Today, only 12 ministers attended the meeting. Apart from the chief minister, the cabinet comprises 25 ministers, 16 of cabinet rank and nine ministers of state. 																								The chief minister reiterated that he was ready for a rapprochement with the dissidents.

		 Sunday, October 19, 2003 				 Advani recalls Pervez lie
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 18: As Pakistan today denied that Dawood Ibrahim was in the country, L.K. Advani said Pervez Musharraf had lied to him about the underworld king at the Agra summit.																								Pakistan information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said Dawood, who was named a global terrorist by the US on Thursday, is not in the country. The US notice gave Dawoods location as Karachi and identified him by his Pakistani passport.																								At a function in Delhi, the deputy Prime Minister recalled telling the Pakistan President in Agra that with Prime Minister Vajpayee in power, there was a possibility of ending the acrimony between the two countries.																								I brought the reference of Turkey where I had just then visited and signed an extradition treaty. Musharraf was told that India needed the treaty with Pakistan more than Turkey.																								He did not realise where I was taking him and said, why not, why not, the deputy Prime Minister said today, adding that he then sought handing over of Dawood, the prime accused in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts.																								Musharraf said it was not a big thing, but I told him that he did not realise how common people in India would react if Dawood was handed over. 																								Then he said Dawood was not in Pakistan, Advani recalled. A top Pakistani official who was present at the meeting told me I forced him to speak a big lie in front of all the officials. Failed state jab																								India has demanded that the international community find effective ways to deal with states like Pakistan which were incapable of exercising their sovereign responsibilities and were becoming failed states.																								Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha made the demand today while delivering the ninth Field Marshall K.M. Cariappa Memorial lecture in New Delhi.

 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, April 22: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis presence at Mhow on Friday is being considered the BJPs attempt to consolidate the Dalit votebank.																								It is also being regarded as the partys attempt to hasten social engineering in Madhya Pradesh, a state that has often seen caste violence and discrimination.																								Advani will inaugurate the BJPs Dalit Declaration meet on Friday to counter the Digvijay Singh governments first of its kind Bhopal Declaration, popularly called the Dalit Agenda.																								The agenda, aimed at empowering weaker sections of society, has won the appreciation of Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and former President K.R. Narayanan for being innovative.																								The BJP, however, considers the agenda a publicity stunt of the states Congress government. So it wants to offer a real alternative for the development and uplift of Dalits.																								According to BJP leaders, the Mhow Declaration would be historic as it would serve as the guiding principle for the partys election manifesto.																								A team of party functionaries Ramnath Govid, Govindram Miri, T.A.N. Chelliah and Thawarchand Gehlot has been set up to prepare a blueprint for the declaration.																								The blueprint will be discussed and debated before the BJPs district presidents from across the country.

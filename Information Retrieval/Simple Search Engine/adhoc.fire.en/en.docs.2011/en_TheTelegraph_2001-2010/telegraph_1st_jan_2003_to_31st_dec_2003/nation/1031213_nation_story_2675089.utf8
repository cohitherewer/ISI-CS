		 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 IIT tribute to highway martyr
 							 - Tech school sets up fund in memory of alumnus YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, Dec. 12: The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, has established a Satyendra Kumar Dubey Memorial Fund to provide immediate relief to the family of its alumnus who was killed on November 27 while working as the project manager of the National Highways Authority of Indias Gaya section.																								The institute also plans to set up an award and start an annual lecture in his memory.																								Dubey had written directly to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on November 11, 2002, about irregularities in the Golden Quadrilateral Project and had accused some engineers of corruption.																								Dubey stood boldly for the cause of transparency in public life and his heinous murder has left the society stunned. The IIT-K fraternity has taken serious note and would meet Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for speedy justice, said Kripa Shankar, the deputy director of the institute, at a meeting yesterday.																								Students plan to send protest memoranda to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Vajpayee. While IIT-Kanpur made a good engineer out of Satyendra Dubey, it never taught him that corrupt government projects often lead to the road to dusty death, said Rahul Luthra, the convenor of the institutes students senate.																								Members of the IIT community feel that an act to protect those exposing corruption should be enacted by Parliament soon. Had this been done earlier, as recommended by the Constitution Review Commission in 2002, it would have ensured that Dubey was protected against revenge and any discrimination for reporting what he perceived as wrongdoing, said a senior professor.																								It was decided, at yesterdays meeting, to seek the support of the IIT alumni in extending financial help to the slain engineers family. Some friends of Dubey in the US have already set up the S.K. Dubey Foundation Inc. to raise funds for his family.																								A four-member committee, headed by Prof. .G.R. Iyenger of the aerospace engineering department, has been set up to collect money for the Satyendra Kumar Dubey Memorial Fund and work out other programmes in the memory of the alumnus. The panel has been asked to complete the task within a year and submit progress reports and recommendations to the institutes director every three months.																								Apart from helping Dubeys family and organising a lecture and an award in his name, the committee will also monitor legal action taken to bring his assassins to book with the help of the countrys top lawyers, said C.P. Singh, the superintendent of the institutes legal cell and a member of the committee.																								Kripa Shankar said the entire IIT community was being asked to join hands with the staff and students in extending their financial and moral support for the cause. Petition in SC																								The Supreme Court today fixed January 5 for the hearing on a PIL seeking investigation into the alleged disclosure of Dubeys identity that led to his murder.																								The petitioner said an independent inquiry commission should be set up to go into all aspects of the case pertaining to the murder.

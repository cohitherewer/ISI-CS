		 Tuesday, October 14, 2003 				 Daler gets bail cold-shoulder
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Daler Mehndi																								New Delhi, Oct. 13: A city court today dismissed Bhangra pop star Daler Mehndis anticipatory bail petition, saying his custodial interrogation is necessary in the visa racket case filed against him.																								Additional district and sessions judge A.K. Mehndiratta said a study of the FIR in which Punjab police named the singer as one of the accused showed that serious allegations had been levelled against Mehndi. Hence, it was necessary to question him.																								Last Thursday, Mehndiratta had ordered the station house officer of Nangloi to submit a report on the case on Monday. Mehndi is a resident of Nangloi, which falls in outer Delhi.																								The singer had moved the city court on Wednesday seeking two weeks to move an appropriate bail application before the Punjab court hearing the visa racket case.																								Mehndi sought interim bail on the grounds that his reputation and business would take a beating if he was arrested.																								In his petition, the singer said he had learnt through media reports that Patiala police had registered a case against him and his brother Shamsher Singh Shera, who was later arrested.																								The petition clarified that Mehndi had disowned his brother in 2001.																								The singer said he had issued a public notice in an English national daily on March 2, 2001 in which he had notified his brother to desist from impersonating him and had also advised (the) public at large not (to) be misled by such impersonations/misrepresentations.																								Mehndi alleged that the Patiala police were involving him in the case with mala fide intentions to gain media hype and tarnish his reputation.																								He termed the criminal case registered against him as false and baseless and alleged that the police were acting on behalf of certain people who had grudges against him.																								But Mehndiratta refused to entertain Mehndis allegations, saying the police did not have mala fide intentions. 																								The judge added that the singer had not approached the Patiala court where the case had been registered.

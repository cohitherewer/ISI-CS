 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 28: The Centre has drawn flak from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh over Chinas incursion across the Line of Actual Control and the government giving Kargil Vijay Diwas a go-by.																								The RSS pique was reflected in two separate editorials in the latest issue of Panchajanya, its inhouse Hindi magazine.																								The one on Chinas incursion, called Cheen aur hum bhole bhandari (China and we are prize fools), referred to how the Chinese army transgressed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) when the Prime Minister was on its soil. It would have been best for the government to make a suo motu statement and condemn the incident, the editorial said.																								The magazine was referring to reports of Chinese incursion across the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh.																								Any relationship which is cemented after compromising with ones territorial integrity is not worth it. Our desire for friendship is based on honesty but one cannot understand if one can keep reposing trust in China and Pakistan.																								Hoping that history would not repeat itself, the magazine recalled how Jawaharlal Nehru, the countrys first Prime Minister, was deceived by China after he advocated the Panchsheel principle.																								Panchajanya also emphasised that all that talk about China granting recognition to Sikkims integration (during the PMs visit in June) was hot air because Arunachal happened. The Chinese government refused to grant a visa to the Arunachal chief minister because it said that Arunachal was part of China and, therefore, its citizens did not require visas.																								Taking the external affairs ministry (MEA) to task, the RSS mouthpiece remarked: The MEA knows that whenever a senior Indian leader visits China, it will be up to some hanky-panky (harkat). The last time the former President K.R. Narayanan travelled to China, the Chinese army crossed the LAC across Ladakh. The more we try to forget, the more bent China seems on reminding us. Where are we to go from here?																								Berating the Centre for not observing Vijay Diwas or commemorating the loss of soldiers slain in Kargil, the mouthpiece said there was no contradiction in observing Vijay Diwas and pursuing peace talks with Pakistan.																								But those in the government have decided that if Kargil Vijay Diwas is commemorated, then it will not have a good effect on Pakistan. Which is to say that it would upset General Pervez Musharraf. Okay. Try this as well. After all according to Hindu tradition, one must allow ones wounds to heal so that fresh wounds are inflicted, Panchajanya said.																								More than 10 crore Hindus were killed by Islamic invaders. We tried to forget this because we wished to befriend Muslims. Muslims wanted Partition and the result was that in 1947, more than 10 lakh Hindu men, women and children were massacred.																								The editorial went on citing examples right up to the Lahore bus yatra and the Agra summit and concluded on an even more sardonic note.																								Now the defence ministry needs to do just three things -- get more and more brave soldiers killed, release the names and addresses of the terrorist organisations through the Press Information Bureau and give the bereaved families cheques of compensation, one, two or three years after the jawans are martyred.

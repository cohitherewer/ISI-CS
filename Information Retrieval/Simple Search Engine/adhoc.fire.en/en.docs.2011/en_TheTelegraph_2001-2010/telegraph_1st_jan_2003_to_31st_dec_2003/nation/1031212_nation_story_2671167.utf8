		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Pact push to smoking rules 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Dec. 11: The Centre will announce rules framed to give effect to a tough anti-smoking legislation within the next 10 days, Union minister for health and family welfare Sushma Swaraj said today.																								Parliament has already passed the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act in April to ban advertising of tobacco products and place restrictions on smoking and chewing tobacco in public.																								The occasion for speeding up the process seems to be the cabinet approval of the ratification of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control yesterday. With this, India will become the seventh nation in the world to ratify this global convention, the minister said.																								The convention, which will be implemented three months after at least 40 nations ratify it, enforces a comprehensive set of anti-smoking laws by member countries.																								Tobacco lobbyist Tobacco Institute of India director A.C. Sarkar refused to react, saying he is yet to receive any communication from the ministry about the notification.																								The reluctance comes as no surprise as the notification will spell bad news for cigarette giants like ITC and GTC who have helped float the institute.																								The Cigarette and Other Products Act, 2003, which will be given effect by the notification of the rules, bans advertisement of cigarettes and other tobacco products, beside prohibiting sponsorship of sports and cultural events by manufacturers of these products.																								The legislation also seeks to bring the tobacco industry under the Centres control. It bans the sale of tobacco products to minors and specifies that cigarettes and other tobacco products should not be sold within a radius of 100 yards of educational institutions.																								In view of the adverse impact of tobacco on health, all member nations of the World Health Organisation have resolved to implement tobacco control strategies through legislative means and increased public awareness. India has been one of those pushing for this convention.																								One of its principal aims is to enforce price and tax measures to reduce tobacco demand, non-price measures such as protection from tobacco smoke, regulation of contents of tobacco products and ban on advertising, promotion and sponsorship except for countries constrained by constitutional limitations.																								It also provides for prohibition of sale of tobacco products to and by minors and providing resources in developing countries for finding economically viable alternative to tobacco growing and for implementing tobacco control programmes.																								In a statement, the central government has said there are about 1.1 billion smokers in the world, of which 300 million are in developing countries. Kuwait extradition																								India will sign a treaty with Kuwait providing a legal framework for extradition of fugitive offenders, including those facing charges for economic crimes.																								The Union cabinet, which met last night, approved the signing of the treaty and authorised its ratification.																								Under the treaty, any person accused or convicted of an extraditable offence  an offence punishable with imprisonment for a period of at least a year  shall be extradited whether the act was committed before or after its coming into force, parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj said. 																								The extradition of own nationals is not permissible under the treaty.

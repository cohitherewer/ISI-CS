		 Saturday, January 11, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Cops held guilty of custody killing				 																																																	 Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh State Human Rights Committee has held seven policemen responsible for the death of a civilian in the Sadashivpet lockup and indicted them for human rights violations, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The policemen held guilty for Samba Rachappas death in custody are Sadashivpet circle inspector Seetharamaiah, sub inspector Kenny Ford, assistant SI Verayya and four constables.				 																																																	The government has been asked to pay Rs 2 lakh in damages to the victims family and order an independent inquiry into the killing, committee chairman Justice Y. Bhaskar Rao said. 				 																																																	The committee took charge of investigations after Pushpa, the victims wife, filed a complaint before it. According to Pushpa, the policemen picked up Rachappa from his house on August 26 last year and dumped him in the Sadashivpet lock-up but barred family members from visiting him. Some time later, they informed the family that Rachappas body was in the government hospital.				 																																																	After news of the death filtered out, an angry mob of 500 people attacked the police station and burnt properties, including jeeps, furniture and motorcycles.				 																																																	Rao said the committee was inquiring into five other cases of police atrocities. But police atrocities on extremists do not come under the purview of the Supreme Court guidelines on rights violations, he said.				 																Fresh CBI hurdle for Hindujas				 																																																	 new delhi: The Bofors case, the trial of which has been stayed, on Friday came back to haunt the three Hinduja brothers with the CBI opposing stay and sanction of prosecution on the ground that the respondents do not deserve any special treatment, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	A division bench of Justices M.B. Shah and D.M. Dharmadhikari adjourned the matter without fixing any date for future hearings.				 																																																	Last year, then Chief Justice of India G.B. Pattanaik had stayed proceedings of the trial against the Hindujas.				 																																																	CBI senior superintendent of police Umesh Lal filed the application opposing the stay, which said the Supreme Court had earlier  when Justice Pattanaiks predecessor Justice B.N. Kirpal was chief justice  ordered that the trial should continue.				 																																																	He said it was not filed by the Hindujas and that on oral mentioning of the matter, the bench (then headed by Chief Justice Pattanaik) asked the counsel to file an application and subsequently stayed the trial. 				 																																																	For mentioning a matter in the apex court, an application is usually filed and mentioning time is sought. In the Hinduja case, after permission for oral mentioning was given, the application was subsequently allowed to be filed and the stay was granted.				 																SC sets date for Gopal plea				 																																																	 New Delhi: The Supreme Court will hear on January 20 Nakkeeran editor R.R.

Subramanyam, said the state police had put his client under surveillance.				 																																																	 retired Karnataka police officer had alleged in his recently-released book, Rajkumar: Veerappans Price Catch, that Gopal took crores to negotiate the release of Rajkumar, the Kannada matinee idol, from Veerappan.				 																																																	Soon after the book came out, Gopal claimed harassment by the Tamil Nadu government through its police because his biweekly had often criticised chief minister Jayalalithaa.

		 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Kabul back on CBI radar 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 24: The CBI has written to the foreign ministry, seeking permission to visit Afghanistan again to question Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, foreign minister of the ousted Taliban regime and one of the key witness of the 1999 Indian Airlines hijacking.																								Sources said the bureau is awaiting permission to send a team to Kabul to question Muttawakil and former Taliban general Usmani. Some more religious militia leaders who have information about the hijacking might also be questioned.																								CBI officials said a request for cooperation has been sent to the FBI since some of the leaders to be questioned are in its custody. The FBI has already questioned Muttawakil on his alleged role in the IC-814 hijacking and has registered a hijacking case since one of the passengers on board  Jennie Moorie  was American. 																								However, the US agency has not shared the information it gathered from the former minister or the hijacking case as a whole with the CBI.																								A CBI team grilled Muttawakil in October, but could not extract much from the former foreign minister. Sources said Muttawakil has to be questioned again after reports surfaced that Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence operatives were present when the flight was grounded at Kandahar airport a day after being hijacked from Kathmandu on December 24, 1999.																								The CBI is also trying to get the former minister extradited to face trial in a Patiala court hearing the hijacking case. The sleuths are considering making him an approver if the Afghanistan government agrees to off-load him.																								Usmanis questioning could throw up important leads for Muttawakil has told the CBI that the former general knew inside details about the hijacking.																								Intelligence reports say the former general was an important link between the Taliban and ISI. Usmani might know the names of ISI officials believed to be involved in the hijacking.																								The CBI failed to obtain the voice recorder of Kandahars air traffic control during its October visit to Kabul. It is feared that ISI interaction with airport officials when IC-814 landed at Kandahar and the negotiations that followed might have been locked away.																								The bureau is expected to dispatch a letter rogatory to Afghanistan for handing over the air traffic control voice recorder tapes.																								The CBI has sought information from the FBI on some militant leaders of the Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Mujahideen present at Kandahar airport four years ago.																								The bureau has chargesheeted 10 people in the case. Of these, three, including Abdul Lateef, have been arrested while the rest are absconding. These include Athar Ibrahim, Azhar Yusuf, Mistri Zahoor, Syed Shahid Akhtar and Shakir Mohammed.																								India had to free three terrorists in exchange for the passengers. Those freed include Masood Azhar, founder member of the Harkat, who went on to form the dreaded Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Omar Sheikh, later jailed for killing US journalist Daniel Pearl.

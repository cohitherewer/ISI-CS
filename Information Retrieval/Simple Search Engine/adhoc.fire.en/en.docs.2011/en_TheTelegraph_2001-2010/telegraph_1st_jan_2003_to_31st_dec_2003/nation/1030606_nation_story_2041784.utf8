 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Students outside the deans office after the rampage. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, June 5: Students went on the rampage at Delhi Universitys north campus today, ransacking the office of the dean of students welfare. They were protesting the scarcity of college admission forms.																								The incident occurred around 11.30 am when students, led by students union president Mukul Bhardwaj, stormed dean Hema Raghavans office. The dean said the students broke window panes and threw office furniture.																								The students, after having stood in long queues since early morning, went berserk on finding that forms had run out.																								Police were pressed into action and lathicharged the crowd in an attempt to disperse it. One student received minor injuries. Police have detained some students.																								Justifying the violence, Bhardwaj said the students had to storm the office in order to make the authorities aware that they were being harassed.																								Soon after the incident, the deans office and centres selling forms in the north campus were closed.																								Delhi University has sold 9 lakh forms for its 79 colleges since counters opened yesterday. It was selling admissions forms for its colleges through 28 information centres and 100 post offices and schools.																								University authorities said they had not anticipated that they would run out of forms after printing 1.5 million forms for 50,000 seats in the arts, science and commerce faculties.																								The university has ordered more forms to be printed, but it will be some time before they are available for sale.																								Authorities feel extensive publicity about the availability of forms at the university seems to have boomeranged. They said students were opting for the cheaper forms which were available at one place, instead of going to various colleges to buy costly prospectuses.																								Additional police have been deployed in most parts of the universitys north and south campus to prevent trouble in view of the rush of admission-seekers.																								Mukherjee Nagar police officials said women constables in plain clothes had been posted there to check eve-teasing. Police rounded up one eve-teaser outside Hindu College in the north campus after he passed lewd comments at a woman, who happened to be a plainclothes constable. Ashok, a resident of Najafgarh, has been released on bail.

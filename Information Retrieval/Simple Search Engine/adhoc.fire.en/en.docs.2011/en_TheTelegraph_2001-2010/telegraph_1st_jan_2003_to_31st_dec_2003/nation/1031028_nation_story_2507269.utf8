		 Tuesday, October 28, 2003 				 Police gun for Telgi treasures
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Oct. 27: Mumbai police have moved to attach the properties of Abdul Karim Telgi, the alleged mastermind behind the fake stamp paper scam.																								The special investigating team set up to probe the Rs 3,000-crore scam has written to the banks where Telgi has 38 accounts and asked these to be frozen.																								The team has also called for attachment of all his properties. Its sources said Telgi, who is rumoured to be worth Rs 1,700 crore, has seven massive properties in Colaba, Cuffe Parade, Nagpada and Thane.																								The teams petition on attachment will be heard on October 30. 																								Three of Telgis alleged accomplices, arrested under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, have moved court for bail.																								Advocate Rasheed Kulkarni, police inspector Dattatraya Dal and Telgis alleged frontman Manoj Mehta charged the investigating team with forceful arrest.																								Dal has been charged with going slow on the investigation against Telgi and helping him in some cases in his capacity as a police officer. But Dal said he has been implicated and his colleagues have been threatened into pressing fabricated charges.																								Kulkarni has been charged with doing much more than what an advocate should be doing (and)going beyond to act as a middleman for the scamster, police said.																								They alleged Mehta had let Telgi use his bank accounts and bought machines for making stamps under a different name.																								Two MLAs and a host of police officials, including one of the rank of assistant commissioner, have already been arrested in the scam. Indications are a few more officers may be arrested by the time the team submits its report by next month.																								Bombay High Court in a recent order had gone to the extent of asking the team to probe the role of Mumbai police commissioner R.S. Sharma in the scam.

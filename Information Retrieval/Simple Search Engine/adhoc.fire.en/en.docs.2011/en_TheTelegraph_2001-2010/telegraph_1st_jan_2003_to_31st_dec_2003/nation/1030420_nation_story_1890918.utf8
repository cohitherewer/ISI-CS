		 Sunday, April 20, 2003 				 Mayavati targets Rajnath
 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, April 19: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati today opened new fronts against her predecessors Rajnath Singh and Kalyan Singh even as she continued her battle with Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav.																								District magistrates have been asked to investigate their use of the chief ministers discretionary fund. Mayavati is angry with both Kalyan and Rajnath for criticising her campaign against Mulayam.																								The chief ministers secretariat had last week issued orders to investigate the use of the fund during Rajnaths regime and submit a report within 10 days. But, fearing an adverse reaction from the BJP, she today sought to dispel the impression that she was targeting individuals opposed to her.																								Every case of misuse of the fund from 1994 onwards, including my period, will be investigated, she told a hurriedly-convened press conference and added that this did not necessarily mean that all chief ministers after 1994 would be put in the dock.																								Till April 7, 1994, rules put the limit for release of money under this head between Rs 5,000 to Rs 35,000. Mulayam violated the rules and has to face the music, but other chief ministers are exempt (as) the rules were later amended and they acted within the norms, she said.																								Mayavati also toned down her criticism of former Governor Motilal Vora, saying: My government will maintain propriety in the case of constitutional functionaries.																								Mayavati said fresh directives have been issued to all district magistrates on how to deal with fund-related cases. All those named in the FIRs would not be immediately sent to jail. The process would be routed through courts because this is not an exercise (of) vendetta. While not sparing the guilty, my government will not touch those against whom there is no evidence, she said.																								As the Samajwadi kicked off its hall bol agitation against her, Mayavati warned that any attempt to disrupt law and order would be sternly dealt with.																								Mulayam, who was supposed to flag off the cycle yatras of party activists in Lucknow, did not turn up. State unit chief Ram Sharan Das and leader of the Opposition Mohammed Azam Khan flagged them off. The yatras will continue for a month and culminate in a rally in Lucknow on May 21.																								Amar attack																								The Mayavati-Amar Singh spat hit a new low today when the Samajwadi leader called her a gangster. She is ruling as a gangster, not as an administrator, Singh said.

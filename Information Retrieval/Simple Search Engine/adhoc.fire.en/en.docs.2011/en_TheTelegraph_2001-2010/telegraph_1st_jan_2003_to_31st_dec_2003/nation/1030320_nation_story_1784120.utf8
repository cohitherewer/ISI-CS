		 Thursday, March 20, 2003 				 IIMs unite to bag jobs
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Calcutta, March 19: If market conditions are tight, its better to join hands. The three leading IIMs  Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta  switched to collaborate mode from the competitive mantra they preach in classrooms. 																								This year saw the institutes sharing information on recruiters  a never-before phenomenon  coming down to the campus to shop for budding managers. The big league of the premier B-schools also drew up their placement schedules in consultation with each other. So, for Bangalore, the final placements started on March 5, in Calcutta, Day Zero was on March 8 and the recruiters started trooping down to Ahmedabad from March 10. 																								We wanted to avoid clashing of dates and help recruiters in drawing up a smooth itinerary from Bangalore to Calcutta to Ahmedabad. So, some of us had to push back the placement timing to serve the common objective of placing our students, said Shekhar Chaudhuri, director, IIMC. 																								Planning in advance marked this years placement and along with the collaborative approach across the IIMs, there were efforts, at the institutes level, to face a recession-hit global marketplace. 																								So, the IIMC placement cell decided to sacrifice the pride in placing all the students in two days and stretched it to nine days to facilitate longer and objective interaction among the recruiters and the students. A separate placement schedule for students with prior work experience was drawn up, which resulted in 30 per cent rise in lateral placements from 42 in 2002 to 54 this year. 																								Earlier, the placement season meant students and recruiters running around, as they had very little time. We have started giving them more time to assess each other, explained B. N. Srivastava, dean, external relations cell, IIMC. 																								The planning did pay as the recruiters continued offering the best deals to IIMC grads. As per the placement results  made public on Wednesday  79 companies visited the campus and made 297 offers to 245 graduating students. 																								Consulting major McKinsey offered the highest domestic compensation package of Rs 14 lakh, while Deutsche Banks deal of $96,000 was the highest among the international offers made during this years campus interviews. 																								Despite the economic slowdown, domestic median salary grew by around 15 per cent, mentioned Chaudhuri. The median domestic annual salary was Rs 6,25,000 while in case of overseas placements it was $76,000. But, the number of foreign offers  the high point in 2002 placements  came down this year to 11 from 20 last year. 																								The sluggish growth in the market and the desperation of the companies in increasing their market share was evident from the placement statistics. 																								The highest number of offers, over 32 per cent, were made in sales and marketing while finance and systems slipped to 21 per cent and 18 per cent from last years high of 33 per cent. 																								Consulting and general management made a comeback after a lull with 24 per cent of the total offers, as compared to just 5 per cent in 2002. 																								This year we saw IT and IT- enabled services companies picking up students for other functional areas like marketing and finance, said Srivastava. 																								ICICI Bank with 22 offers was the biggest recruiter, followed by HCL Technologies (17), PricewaterhouseCoopers (14), Tata Consultancy Services (12) and fast moving consumer goods major HLL (11).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Desam legislator charged with aiding Telgi
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 29: The special investigation team probing the stamp scam today filed a 2,500-page supplementary chargesheet against nine persons in a city court.																								The charges allege that Telugu Desam Party legislator C. Krishna Yadav, four police officers  including an assistant commissioner of police  and four others actively aided Abdul Karim Telgi, the alleged mastermind of the organised crime syndicate.																								The probe team has, in its second supplementary chargesheet filed under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, relied on evidence obtained from a polygraph and brain fingerprinting.																								The tests, clubbed together as the lie-detector test, are used to extract the truth from the accused by using psychological and chemical catalysts.																								The probe team told the court that it has the depositions of 49 witnesses and the confessions of 15 accused under various sections of the act.																								The first chargesheet, filed against Telgi and 32 others on March 27, dealt mainly with the masterminds links at the Nashik-based India Security Press. 																								It detailed how he persuaded the staff to help him control, manage and expand his fake stamp paper empire.																								The first supplementary chargesheet followed on September 15. Sixteen persons, including Samajwadi Janata Party MLA Anil Gote, were named.																								The probe team had then asked the court for more time as there may be many more police officers and others involved in the scam.																								However, Gote  the first politician to be arrested in the scam  has added another twist to the Telgi tale by alleging in a letter to Maharashtra governor Mohammad Fazal that the SITs probe is lopsided and vindictive.																								In the missive to the governor from Yerawada jail, Gote has said the SIT was involved in an elaborate eyewash that is a result of the factionalism within the police department.																								The SIT, Gote said, was working under government pressure and clearly favouring leaders of the ruling party.																								How come the SIT has not been able to zero in on the senior politician who directed the former Mumbai police commissioner and a joint police commissioner to provide Telgi all the luxuries he needed while he was in the custody of the crime branch of the Mumbai police? Gote asked.																								This is the second letter written by an accused to the Maharashtra governor.																								Dilip Kamath, a police officer who has been jailed for his alleged links with Telgi, had earlier stirred a controversy when he alleged in a letter  leaked to the media by senior BJP and Shiv Sena leaders  that it was NCP leader and former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal who had instructed police officers to go slow on Telgi. 																								Bhujbal, who quit recently apparently under pressure from the Opposition which charged him with shielding Telgi, is at Breach Candy Hospital undergoing treatment for high blood pressure. Sources in the police department have indicated that he may be called by the SIT for questioning any day.

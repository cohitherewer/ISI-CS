		 Friday, July 25, 2003 				 Suspended Valley cop to move court
 BINOO JOSHI																								Jammu, July 24: Farooq Khan, senior superintendent of police, special branch, said he would move court after being suspended by the Jammu and Kashmir government.																								Khan was suspended and an assistant sub-inspector has had his services terminated yesterday after being found guilty of fudging the DNA samples of five civilians killed in a fake encounter on March 25, 2000.																								Security forces said the civilians were militants involved in the March 20, 2000, Chattisinghpora massacre which left 35 Sikhs dead at Pathribal in Anantnag.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani had complimented the security forces on the operation before news of the deception came to light.																								Following an outcry that those killed were innocent, the state government ordered a probe. The victims bodies were exhumed and DNA samples sent for tests. Fresh tests were ordered in March last year after it came to light that attempts had been made to tamper with the samples.																								A cabinet sub-panel that considered further action on the findings of a commission on the fudging of the samples recommended action against Khan and assistant sub-inspector Bashir Ahmad. But Khan, who was senior superintendent of police, Anantnag at the time, has threatened court action. 																								I have been condemned without being heard, he said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 10: The worlds databases will grow to mammoth proportions but shrink in numbers over the next 10 years, says Oracle Corp chief Larry Ellison.																								Ellison, chairman and CEO of the worlds largest enterprise software company, reckons that this will be fuelled by the growth of the Internet and the pressure on governments and companies to provide services to citizens of the world anytime, anywhere.																								Describing the phenomenon as Modern Information Age Systems, Ellison said some idea about the nature of these futuristic databases can be obtained from the explosive growth of the credit-card system across the world.																								Imagine of how its changed your life: you can take a flight from Delhi, land in London or the US and go to a shop that you have never heard or seen before and flash a square-shaped plastic card and make a purchase of your choice. The decision to give you credit or not is determined by your creditworthiness that is authenticated by the communication network, Ellison said.																								In his keynote address  his first to an Indian audience  at the Oracle Executive Summit here that was beamed over a satellite link from the companys global headquarters in California, Ellison projected a big growth of wireless technologies like 802 11.b or wi-fi. 																								This will help in faster and cheaper communication and promote a global Internet system for global integration, he said.																								The Oracle chief also spoke about the need to quickly develop a national citizen database that would not only help roll out policies and schemes in an efficient manner but would also be free from corruption.																								Announcing the companys decision to increase the number of professionals from 3,000 to 6,000 over the next few years, Ellison said his company would continue to support efforts in development of initiatives in India similar to those undertaken worldwide.																								Commenting on Indias advantage over China, he said: Both countries have their strengths -- China is being sought after by the multinational companies for manufacturing while India is the destination for software development and services. This is a trend that will continue.																								Ellison said: India provides tremendous high quality services at very competitive prices - thats one aspect of Indian business. But there are a variety of other aspects where India again is going to be under competitive pressure from other countries in the world to achieve high levels of efficiency.																								The Indian government can use technology to make businesses more efficient and to deliver high quality of services to citizens without having to raise the tax base. Governments are interested in the notion of open systems such as the low cost Linux operating system and a modern low cost technology is the foundation upon which we think these new government systems will be built as well as the new commercial systems, Ellison said.																								Oracle and Hewlett Packard jointly launched Centre of Excellence at Gurgaon, near Delhi, that will develop systems for e-governance projects.

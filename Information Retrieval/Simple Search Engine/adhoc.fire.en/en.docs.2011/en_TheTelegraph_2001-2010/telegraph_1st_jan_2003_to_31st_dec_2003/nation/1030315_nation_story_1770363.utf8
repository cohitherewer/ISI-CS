 BARUN GHOSH																								Calcutta, March 14: Presidency Jail officials have seized a SIM card, a mobile phone, a chordless phone, a map of Purulia district and Rs 572 in cash from the cell in which Peter Bleach, the main accused in the Purulia arms drop case, has been lodged since 1996.																								The officials also found two tape recorders and a telephone book containing about 500 phone numbers, both local and international.																								The raid, which comes close on the heels of the recovery of a mobile phone from Aftab Ansari  imprisoned in Presidency Jail since June in connection with the attack on the American Center  has put the administration in a tizzy. 																								The government has taken a serious view of last nights recovery.... We have already ordered a probe and may have to take it up with the British deputy high commission, state home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said.																								The investigators will find out if lapses on the part of the jail staff had helped Bleach get the SIM card, he said. 																								How can convicts get mobile phones and other things in a high-risk prison like Presidency Jail when there is a fool-proof security system? Deb asked.

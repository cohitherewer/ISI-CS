 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Nov. 9: A saffron-robed sanyasin, a fiery votary of shuddhikaran, a fading maharani and a former symbol of the capitals former Punjabi bastion are clearly not the BJPs best bet as star campaigners. 																								So whether it is within striking distance of power in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh or locked in a neck-and-neck contest in Rajasthan or picking up by inches in Delhi, the BJPs most bankable entity for the Assembly polls is the vikas purush Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								The Prime Minister is the partys mascot and not Uma Bharti, Vasundhara Raje, Madan Lal Khurana or Dilip Singh Judeo, the undeclared candidate for the Chhattisgarh chief ministers post.																								Sources said it was not so much Vajpayees evergreen charm or teflon-coated acceptability they were counting on as the perception that his name had become synonymous with development.																								The BJP, they said, willy-nilly fell back on the Prime Minister because of the decision to make development the principal poll plank. We are determined to shatter the myth that elections can be won only on emotive issues and not because of lack of power, water and roads, a source said.																								As a result, the NDA governments development dossier  imprinted with the Golden Quadrilateral project, rural road and phone connectivity, and Sarva Shikhsha Abhiyaan  will be the magic wand.																								The party has realised that Bharti, Vasundhara and Judeo are not the most credible of faces or voices to articulate the theme.																								While saffron-robed sanyasin Bharti has apparently been put through an image makeover to pass the test half-way in Madhya Pradesh, the BJP in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh will rely almost entirely on Vajpayee.																								Bhartis campaign mentor Arun Jaitley has managed to ensure she speaks of little else other than development, sources emphasised. Her Hindutva image does not need to be underlined. Its the first thing people associate with her, one of them said.																								What we are stressing is that she comes from a poor and backward-caste family, so she will be able to understand better the problems and issues of the disadvantaged sections than (chief minister) Digvijay Singh, who has a feudal background.																								Bhartis other attribute that will be highlighted is her fire-brand nature. She has the boldness and the ability to take on the entrenched interests so that the poor can get their share of justice, a source said.																								At the other end of the socio-economic spectrum is Judeo, a Thakur from a family of chieftains who once ruled Jaspur. He is also a champion of shuddhikaran (religious purification or reconversion). 																								But the tribals will still vote for him because for them he and his family are like bhagwan (god). He is not an impersonator like some Congress leaders, a source said.																								The partys reading about former maharani Vasundhara is that while she started off well with her Parivartan yatra (journey for change), the monsoon proved to be the deliverance for chief minister Ashok Gehlot.																								He may not be an articulate person but the huge gap between the Congress and the BJP which was (working) to Vasundharas advantage initially has been narrowed down, thanks to the feeling that Gehlots drought management was not bad at all. We have to break this feeling, a source said. 																								In Delhi, the BJP hopes that a combination of the impre- ssive stint of Madan Lal Khurana and the NDAs record will give chief minister Sheila Dikshit a fight.

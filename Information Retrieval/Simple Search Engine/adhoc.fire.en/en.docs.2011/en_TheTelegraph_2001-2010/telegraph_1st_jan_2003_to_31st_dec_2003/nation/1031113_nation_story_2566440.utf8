		 Thursday, November 13, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Nurse sues former Israeli employers				 																																																	Jerusalem (PTI): An Indian nurse, employed as a guest nursing aide in Israel, has claimed damages of Rs 14.20 lakh from her former employers for salary owed over three years, compensation for unpaid work, recreation leave and other social benefits eligible under Israeli law.				 																																																										In her submission to the Jerusalem labour court, 30-year-old Sofie Thomas from Kochi sued Joseph Oron and members of his family for forcing her to work under conditions approaching slavery and exploiting her vulnerability while nursing his aging mother, Esther, and then as a live-in maid and child-care help to other members of the family.				 																																																										Thomas first came to Israel in January 2000 at Orons invitation and a promised monthly salary of $100 and nursed his mother at Moshav Taoz, a farming community founded by Keralite Jews on Jerusalems outskirts. Esther died in March that year.				 																																																										For the next 15 months, Sofie, a former nurse at a Kochi hospital, was a live-in maid for Orons sister Dorit Josef Solomian. She worked 16 hours a day, doing all the household chores and caring for the familys two infants. She had no rest, no free time and no day off.				 																																																										I hardly went out, only to dispose the garbage. I didnt know even how the Moshav looked like, didnt meet anybody. And when I wanted to go out, Dorit would say, stay inside, youve nothing to do out there, Sofie told a Jerusalem local weekly, Kol Hair, on Friday.				 																Bleach back in hospital Calcutta: Peter Bleach, serving a life  sentence in the Purulia armsdrop case, was back at SSKM  Hospital on Wednesday after Alipore Central jail doctors  failed to carry out routine checks on the bedridden prisoner  suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis (TB), says a  staff reporter.				 																																																										SSKM doctors accused the prison officials of gross negligence in failing to perform the daily tests they had specified when they last examined Bleach more than a week ago.				 																																																										We are extremely unhappy with the jail authorities, said Dr S. Mitra, the chest specialist who examined Bleach.				 																																																										We had instructed them to carry out the tests 10 days ago, and we still havent seen the results. If they provide us with the samples, we can even determine the results here It appears they were so negligent that they failed to check his medical records. This is how jail authorities treat prisoners, he added.				 																																																										The former British intelligence officer had complained of fever and severe coughing fits over a month-long period, following a hunger strike in early September to protest against his continued incarceration.				 																																																										Jail authorities, however, claimed that while the tests had been carried out, they had been unable to get the results verified. We tried to get the results done at a private clinic, but nobody was able to spare a container for the liquid, said Alipore jail superintendent Ramapada Bhattacharya.

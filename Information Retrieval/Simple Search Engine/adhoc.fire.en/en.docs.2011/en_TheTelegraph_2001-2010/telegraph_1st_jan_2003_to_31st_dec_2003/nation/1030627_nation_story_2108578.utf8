		 Friday, June 27, 2003 				 Poll panel ban on evictions
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 26: The Election Commission has put a temporary ban on evictions and demolitions of unauthorised structures till the completion of Assembly polls in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram, scheduled later this year.																								The commission is concerned about the impact of such a dislocation on the electoral rolls, the panel has said.																								The electoral rolls for the 5 states have been finalised with 1.1.2003 as the qualifying date and by now, the electors, who reside in a particular area, are aware of the inclusion of their names on the electoral list, the commission pointed out.																								Thus, a demolition or eviction drive will lead to a dislocation of existing electors who are going to be relocated in an area outside their Assembly constituencies where they earlier resided, the panel said.																								Any election held on the basis of these defective rolls would, therefore, deprive a large number of electors their right to exercise franchise, it added.

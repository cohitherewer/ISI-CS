 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 24: Eighteen months on, victims of the Gujarat violence are still looking for justice, according to an international network of womens organisations working in the state. 																								Addressing a news conference, historian Uma Chakravarti, a member of the International Initiative of Justice, said: We had many women who came and testified before the (networks) commission. Every session spilled over. But these women would not go before an official state commission. The search for justice is not over, she added.																								A report released today by the group shows the extent of insecurities that the minority community suffers from. When democratically-elected governments cannot deliver justice, then international actors must intervene, the report points out.																								The report demands that the incidents of violence be tried in an international court of law. The use of sexual violence as a strategy needs to be specially addressed by the international community. It is urgent to challenge the charitable and tax-exempt status of organisations that support, directly or indirectly, the Hindutva agenda against minority communities.																								According to the report, the latest National Crime Records Bureau statistics show that Gujarat police have killed the highest number of civilians. They topped the list with as many as 506 cases of police firing that killed 222 civilians and injured 361, it points out. 																								Out of the 240 people booked till September 2003 by the Narendra Modi government under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, only one is a non-Muslim. The arrested have been charged with the burning of the Sabarmati Express, the Akshardham attack and the murder of former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya.

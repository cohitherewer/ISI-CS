The assault on the exchange had to be put on hold before seven troopers of the Special Services Bureau (SSB) and eight BSNL employees were evacuated early this morning.																								The SSB personnel were posted on guard at the exchange from where all the telephone lines in the area, including those to the armys 15 Corps, are operated. Civil telecom facilities to the entire cantonment was shut down following the destruction of exchange.																								Troops used mortars to blow up the BSNL hub in Indra Nagar. Fire from the blazing building engulfed two adjacent houses and destroyed them. 																								Police said the surviving militant entered an adjoining house and is firing on the forces.

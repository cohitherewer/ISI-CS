		 Tuesday, July 22, 2003 				 Two Simi members put away for sedition
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 21: Two members of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India were today sentenced to seven years of imprisonment on charges of sedition under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.																								Special Judge S.. Dhingra also awarded five years of imprisonment to Mohammed Yasin Patel, a US citizen of Indian origin, and Mohammed Afsal Jaffery for being Simi members. A fine of Rs 50,000 each has been slapped on the convicts.																								While announcing the verdict, the judge observed that the duo deserved no leniency since their actions were aimed at destroying Indian nationalism.																								He (Patel) is a person who believes in international Islamic order and wants to destroy nationalism of the people here. He, instead of working in the USA for his aim, of which country he is a citizen, has chosen India as his workshop, Dhingra observed in his order. 																								I consider that a person who chooses to become an American national and works for destruction of other countries does not deserve leniency, the judge said.																								Patel is an American national. All his brothers and sisters are settled in the US. He has studied in madarsas and has been working for Simi when it was not banned and he admits that he has been lecturing wherever he was called to.																								Patel, who appeared to be unfazed by the order, told the judge that this will strengthen our mission.																								Throwing light on Jafferys activities, the court said, despite being Indian, having been born and brought up in India and having liberties and freedom of this nation, he has been out to pollute the atmosphere of this country by bringing hatred between communities by propagating destruction of Indian nationals and bringing an international Islamic order in India.

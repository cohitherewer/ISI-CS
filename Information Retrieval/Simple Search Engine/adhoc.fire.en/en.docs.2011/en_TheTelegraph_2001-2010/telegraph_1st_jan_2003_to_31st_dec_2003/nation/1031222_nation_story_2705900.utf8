The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Remote in hand but channel out of reach
 															- No set-top, no jassi OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mona Singh who plays the lead role in Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: For the past week, marketing executive Rumi Khosla has been fidgeting with the television remote in her Uday Park house every evening, wanting to catch up on the latest twists and turns in Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin, the serial on a working woman. 																								Half an hour later, frustrated, she calls her cable operator. If she is lucky, the call will be answered. 																								Sorry Maam, she is told. That is on Sony and you have to buy a set-top box.																								In dozens of posh south Delhi localities, this is the scene in many households since the Assembly election results. The set-top box regime under the conditional access system (CAS) has not taken over yet, but cable operators are holding TV addicts to ransom. There is little the government can do about it because there is no policing system. Indeed, the Union information and broadcasting ministry, after having mandated the regime but failing to implement it, wants little to do with it now.																								The irritation of the television viewer in south Delhi threatens to catch on in the other metros shortly with cable operators determined to force-sell set-top boxes. The implementation of CAS in Delhi will signal a rollout in the other metros as well. While CAS has been technically implemented in Chennai, many viewers still watch pay channels without set-top boxes. In Calcutta and Mumbai, the local governments had objected to CAS unless it was rolled out in the national capital.																								Ministry officials were told that if CAS is made compulsory, there would not be a shortage of set-top boxes. Quoting figures from the customs, they said two lakh boxes had been imported till October.																								We are keeping a watch on the situation but frankly, we believe we had got too involved with implementing it in the past. Now we would like the market to accept or reject set-top boxes, says a senior I amp;B ministry official.																								But that is not entirely true. The ministry knows it cannot be aloof to the travails of television viewers  a constituency that is unmatched in size for any political partys. This week, I amp;B minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has summoned yet another meeting of multi-system operators and broadcasters to decide on CAS that makes set-top boxes mandatory to view pay channels.																								Cable operators spokesperson Roop Sharma says broadcasters are holding viewers to ransom by not declaring friendly prices for each channel. The Centre says operators cannot but distribute a minimum of 30 free-to-air channels for Rs 72 (plus taxes) and broadcasters are saying the time has come to renegotiate contracts with cable operators before the set-top box regime is implemented. All of this leaves viewers guessing.																								There is little doubt  as the experience in Chennai has shown  that the regime has not found favour. Chennai is the only city where CAS was technically implemented even as political pulls and pressures put it off in Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai. Television audiences, comfortable with the system of viewing cable channels over the years, have found it disruptive and despite the harassment of local cable operators have shown little evidence by buying the government line that CAS will make watching TV cheaper. Even the BJP has said the government may have to rethink the CAS regime. 																								Come January 1, however, operators say boxes would be a must to view pay channels.																								I amp;B ministry sources said two officers have assessed the availability of set-top boxes in the market and no shortfall is anticipated immediately. They have asked cable operators to begin a door-to-door campaign to popularise set-top boxes. The I amp;B ministry is awaiting directives from the Prime Minister who will have to take a political decision on the fate of CAS.

		 Thursday, December 11, 2003 				 CBI begins tape probe
																								Raipur, Dec. 10 (PTI): A CBI team from Delhi today began investigations into the cash-for-support scam, a day after it registered a corruption case against former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi.																								Immediately on its arrival here, the three-member team took the case details from the states anti-corruption bureau and scrutinised the audio-tape containing a conversation Jogi and Congress MP Punit Ram Khute allegedly held with BJP state secretary Virendra Pandey and Baliram Kashyap.																								The CBI will try to ascertain the source of money allegedly paid by Jogi to Khute in a bid to form government by splitting the BJP. Yesterday, the bureau had registered a case against Jogi, his son Amit and Khute under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act.																								Sources said the bureau would conduct a voice spectography test by matching those heard on the tape with the real ones.																								On Saturday night, law minister Arun Jaitley had displayed Rs 45 lakh and a taped conversation Jogi and Khute reportedly held with Pandey and Kashyap.																								 Jaitley had claimed that the former chief minister had allegedly bribed BJP leaders to prevent the party from forming the government.

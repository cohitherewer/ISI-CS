		 Friday, September 19, 2003 				 Charges in airport shooting
																								Mumbai, Sept. 18 (PTI): Three months after a CISF jawan gunned down his senior, police have filed a chargesheet against him in a magistrates court even as a sessions court has deferred his bail plea to September 20 for final hearing.																								Raj Namdev, the dismissed jawan, is charged with gunning down deputy commandant A. R. Karanjikar at the airport here on May 24. The chargesheet was filed recently in the court of the metropolitan magistrate at Andheri.																								Police have also charged him with kidnapping and wrongful confinement of colleagues. After fatally injuring Karanjikar, Namdev had held his colleagues captive at gunpoint but later released them.																								Namdev had said he shot dead his senior as he was refused leave and also because the officer was rude and arrogant with him.																								Namdevs bail plea will be heard by sessions judge .D. Deshpande. Lawyer Majeed Memon will argue for him.																								The sessions court had taken a serious view of alleged police pressure on witnesses. It had on July 9 ordered Andheri magistrate A.D. Joshi to record the statements of Namdevs parents and others concerned and thus deferred Namdevs bail plea.																								The court had decided on the move after Memon pointed out that police recorded the statements of Namdevs parents in Marathi and did not read these out to them in keeping with the law.																								The lawyer also said that six women constables held hostage by Namdev had alleged they were pressurised by police to give statements.																								Namdev had pleaded for bail on humanitarian grounds, saying he was not a criminal but a disgusted employee whose terms of service were stringent. He said he had no intention of committing the crime but had done it in a fit of rage.

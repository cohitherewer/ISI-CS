		 Monday, April 14, 2003 				 Cong fails to rein in Karunakaran
																								Thiruvananthapuram, April 13 (PTI): Decks were cleared for a head-on confrontation between the Congress high command and senior leader K. Karunakaran who tonight slammed the doors on last-minute attempts by AICC observers to get rebel nominee Kodath Govindan Nair to withdraw from tomorrows Rajya Sabha elections in Kerala.																								Somehow or the other, we could not work out a solution and we were not able to make him withdraw his candidate, AICC observers Ghulam Nabi Azad and R.K. Dhawan, rushed by the party high command to defuse the crisis, said after a 40-minute meeting with Karunakaran, their second since yesterday.																								Unfortunately, due to various reasons, a formula acceptable to all sections could not be evolved. What compromise could be worked out now? Tomorrow is the election, Karunakaran said.																								The official candidates nominated by the AICC high command will be in the fray and obviously they will win, Azad and Dhawan said.																								While the high command had nominated Vayalar Ravi and Thennala Balakrishna Pillai, Nair has been put up by the Karunakaran group.

																								New Delhi, April 10: A Congress member in the Lok Sabha today alleged that two persons from Gujarat were allegedly thrown out of a Delhi-Ahmedabad train on March 29 for refusing to join VHP supporters in raising Jai Shri Ram slogans, reports our special correspondent.																								Congress member Madhusudan Mistri raised the issue during zero hour, saying the incident occurred when VHP workers were returning to Ahmedabad from Delhi after a function. Some people in the train, he alleged, were beaten up by an unruly crowd and two persons were thrown out of the compartment for refusing to join in the slogan shouting.																								Mistri said the incident took place despite his plea to the government to make proper security arrangements in trains. Congress chief whip Priya Ranjan Das Munshi termed it a serious matter.																								Mistri said the father of assassinated former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya has charged the Gujarat administration with failure to provide timely medical attention to his son, who was taken to hospital more than two hours after he was shot.

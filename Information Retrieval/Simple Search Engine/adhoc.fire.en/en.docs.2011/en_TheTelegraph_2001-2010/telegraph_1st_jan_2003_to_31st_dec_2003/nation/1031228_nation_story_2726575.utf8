 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Dec. 27: A Jammu-based theatre group which hit the headlines when it was assaulted by hooligans on board the Howrah-bound Himgiri Express as it passed through Bihar early on Tuesday, travelled through Patna today without incident on its return journey.																								Mobbed by the media today at Patna junction when the Himgiri Express arrived here at 11am, Balwant Thakur, director of the cultural troupe Natrang, said the incident should not be misreported or exaggerated lest it spoil relations between Jammu and Kashmir and Bihar.																								Goons had teased Natrangs women members aboard the train two stations before Patna. When Thakur, a Sangeet Natak Academy awardee and former cultural secretary, Jammu and Kashmir, tried to intervene, he was seriously injured. The main accused kicked the director on his right eye just before getting off the train at Patna.																								Despite Thakurs injury, his troupe staged its play, Ghumayee, at Calcuttas Academy of Fine Arts on Wednesday. Thakur, whose badly-damaged eye is still swathed in bandages, said a lady police constable at Patna had pleaded helplessness when the girls were being harassed. Yeh sab Laloo ke admi hain (These goons owe allegiance to Laloo Prasad Yadav), she had told the Natrang members.

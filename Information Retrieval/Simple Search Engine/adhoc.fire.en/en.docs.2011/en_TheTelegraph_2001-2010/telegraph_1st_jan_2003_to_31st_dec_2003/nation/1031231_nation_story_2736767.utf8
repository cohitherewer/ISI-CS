 K.C. PHILIP Patna, Dec. 30: The only  working industry worth its name in present-day Bihar  the  Indian Oil refinery in Begusarai district  could be heading  towards closure, thanks to criminals and the extortion mafia.																								In a sign of the impending crisis, terrified workers at the refinery in Barauni went on strike today, a day after the killing of two contract labourers engaged in the construction of the companys LPG bottling plant.																								The labourers were killed and two others injured, allegedly as punishment for their contractors refusal to pay the Naga Singh gang, said to be based in Patna. 																								Two weeks ago, a contractor, Anjani Kumar, had fallen to the bullets of the same gang. The refinery, in north Bihar, employs about 150 contractors.																								Local sources say gangs headed by known criminals like Suraj Bhan, Naga Singh and Pappu Dev have managed to bag most of the contracts that are worth crores. 																								Their own agents of extortion have thus become petty contractors who are forced to pay their bosses big amounts every month, said a union leader.																								A social worker in Begusarai echoed the union leader. Today, what we see here is a loot ka bazaar perpetrated with the tacit support of the local administration, the activist said.																								Political leaders admit that all this is affecting the companys output. 																								Until proper security measures are guaranteed by the administration, nothing can move here, said Rajendra Rajan, the CPI legislator from Matihani constituency.																								Only the moneyed and powerful people can afford to have licensed weapons, which, anyway, is no guarantee of security, the MLA added.																								According to sources, the local police have told some of the workers to procure their own means of self-defence. One contractor was on his way to central Bihar to buy country-made weapons when he was contacted over phone this evening.																								Begusarai district magistrate Sandip Poundrick said the administration would soon make necessary security arrangements for the entire staff and work would resume soon.

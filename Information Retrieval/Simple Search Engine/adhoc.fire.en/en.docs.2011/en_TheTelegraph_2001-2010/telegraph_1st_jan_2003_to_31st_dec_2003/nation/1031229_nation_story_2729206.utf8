		 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Foreign villain in Valley spice love story
				 	 Villagers collect saffron flowers from a field in Pampore. (Reuters)																								Pampore, Dec. 28 (Reuters): The worlds best saffron grows here, reads a signpost in Kashmir near a vast swathe of grey-brown land ringed by snow-covered mountains.																								But thats little consolation for Shabir Ahmad Malik, a former saffron grower in the stunningly beautiful region who now runs a gold business. Illegal imports from Iran have hit the Kashmir saffron industry so badly that many of us had to change our business, Malik said. 																								Kashmiri saffron, known in old Kashmiri texts as lovers spice, was once the toast of every gourmet kitchen in the country.																								Astronomical prices failed to deter serious chefs from stocking up on Kashmiri saffron, which is considered the best in the world. The spice is used extensively in Mediterranean, Mexican and Indian cuisine.																								But today, thousands of saffron growers in Kashmir have been forced to move to other businesses because cheaper imports from Iran are eating into their business.																								Growers say Iranian saffron sells for Rs 25,000 a kg compared with Rs 40,000 for the Kashmiri spice, which growers say costs more because of its superior quality and a labour-intensive process of picking, drying and packing. Who will buy Kashmiri saffron? asks grower Mohammad Yusuf, as he smokes a hubble-bubble pipe under a crimson chinar tree.																								Business has also been hit by an unprecedented drought and neglect by the authorities because of the 14-year unrest in the Valley.																								According to the states agriculture minister, Abdul Aziz Zargar, saffron production in Kashmir plummeted from 17,300 kg in 1997 to 3,600 kg in 2001.																								Iranian saffron is sold on the Kashmiri brand name. It is sold not only in major Indian cities but in Kashmir also, says G.M. Pampori, president of the Kashmir Saffron Growers Association.																								Saffron has been grown in Kashmir since the Mughal period, which began in the 16th century, when saffron bulbs  a species of crocus  were brought from Iran. 																								Cultivation is an elaborate and painstaking process: it takes about 170,000 purple flowers and many, many willow baskets to collect one kg of saffron.																								On cold autumn mornings men, women and children in more than 200 villages in the Pampore area of southern Kashmir flock to the fields, pick the flowers and heap them into wicker baskets. 																								The bulbs of the crocus sativa flower are sown on an estimated 42,500 acres of well drained clay-loam land in May and June and the flower is harvested in November. The flowers reddish three-part stigmas are hand-picked and sun-dried before they find their way to market in December.																								Authorities say that, despite the problems, Kashmir has the potential to produce 30,000 kg of saffron a year. 																								The Jammu and Kashmir government says it plans to launch a series of initiatives to help production and marketing of the crop, which sustains more than 100,000 people.																								The government has decided to take up the issue of saffron imports with the central government. And we are soon launching programmes for quality control and marketing and increase in production, Zargar added.																								Indias chewing tobacco industry and pharmaceutical firms are among leading buyers of Kashmiri saffron, which has several uses apart from flavouring ranging from religious offerings to medicinal cures.																								Of course, Kashmiri saffron is the best, but it has suffered a lot in the last decade and a half, Masood Ahmad, a Kashmir university scientist, said.

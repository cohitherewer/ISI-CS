 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, June 11: The  Centre has decided to grant automatic approval to Indian  newspapers wanting to procure content from foreign publications,  according to revised guidelines issued by the ministry of  information and broadcasting today.																								So far, the policy has been to allow Indian newspapers and magazines to carry photographs, cartoons, crossword puzzles, articles and features from foreign publications on the basis of syndication arrangements with prior approval from the ministry.

The ministry will examine any case that may require relaxation of the conditions. 																								The new guidelines are not applicable in cases where the ministry has approved publication of the Indian edition of a foreign newspaper or journal.

		 Monday, February 24, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Damages order for jumbo mishap				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has asked the Karnataka government to pay Rs 2 lakh to a doctor who lost his eyesight after a fall from an elephant during Dussehra celebrations organised by the state over a decade ago.				 																																																	The Karnataka government is liable to pay for rendering deficient service, for not taking precautionary measures and for being negligent in its conduct, the commission said in a recent order and directed the state to pay Rs 2 lakh as compensation in addition to Rs 10,000 as litigation costs.				 																																																	Holding that the accident would not have occurred but for mismanagement of the authorities, the consumer court told the government, which organised the event, took the elephant ride casually knowing well that the animal could turn wild and cause unlimited damage to people and properties.				 																																																	The incident occurred on October 7, 1992, when the complainant, Mayi Gowda, and his family  two daughters, a son and two nephews  were sitting in a cradle, allegedly loosely tied to the elephant, for a joyride. 				 																																																	When the elephant was pricked with a lighted cigarette and sharp sticks, it caught hold of Gowda, pulled him out of the cradle and hurled him away. 				 																																																	Gowda  a doctor and the sole earning member of the family  banged against an electric pole which made him blind. He also broke his ribs, his counsel Syed Naqui said. 				 																																																	The children, too, fell down and narrowly escaped being trampled by the elephant. They sustained injuries. Gowda had claimed Rs 9.99 lakh as compensation.				 																Insat-3A launch put off				 																																																	 Bangalore (PTI): The launch of the Insat-3A satellite has been postponed to April as the Indian Space Research Organisation and European space consortium Arianespace are taking extra care to make sure it is a success, Isro sources said.				 																																																	Insat-3A, which would have applications in communications and meteorology, was originally scheduled to have been put into space by Arianespaces Ariane-5 rocket from Kourou in French Guyana during the week beginning February 28.				 																																																	But this was postponed to March 21, and now Arianespace has informed us that they would be needing 20 days more (for the launch), the sources said. 				 																																																	The postponement, however, has not come as a surprise. The recent Columbia space shuttle disaster has shaken the confidence of the space community, the sources said, adding that Ariane-5 was yet to establish itself having had a few problems in its earlier flights.				 																Pak militants gunned down 				 																																																	 Jammu (PTI): Seven Pakistan-trained militants were killed in an encounter with the army in the Mendhar sector of Poonch district on Sunday, a defence spokesman said.				 																																																	The encounter, which lasted about five hours, broke out when army personnel on a tip-off launched a search operation in the Harigala-Gani area of the Krishna Ghatti sector, he said. The militants appeared to be part of a group that had reportedly sneaked into India from across the Line of Control.

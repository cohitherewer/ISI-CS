Praveen was abducted from the heart of the capital at 7 am on January 15 just as he was about to enter school after alighting from a car.				 																																																	On Friday, the New Delhi district police raided a hideout, 5/11 Sat Nagar located in the centre of the city and rescued Praveen. They also arrested two accused persons  both with the name Senthil Kumar  who were guarding the school student. A third accused, Jai Raj, was apprehended on Thursday night and it was because of Rajs statement given during interrogation that the police managed to crack the case.				 																																																	The initial breakthrough came after police put the phone at Praveens residence under observation. On Thursday, the accused called four times between 1.30 in the afternoon to 8.30 in the night, to threaten the parents that they would kill the boy unless their ransom demand of Rs 35 lakh was met, police said.				 																																																	The familys driver, Balam, identified the person making the calls as his friend Mangesh. The New Delhi district police then sought the help of the Special Cell to trace the phone calls and found that they had been made from the highway connecting Jaipur, Ajmer and Udaipur. Subsequently, Praveen was rescued following leads given by Raj.				 																																																	According to one of the kidnappers, they had abducted Praveen so that they could extort money from his parents to pay off the loans they had taken to purchase a Toyota Qualis and a shop. Praveen, looking traumatised, faintly recalled eating chhola, chaawal and rajma. Beyond that he, however, did not say much about the harrowing experience.

On Friday, they kept Singhs body on the road and started shouting slogans. The blockade was lifted only on the intervention of social welfare minister Moula Ram and deputy commissioner Pawan Kotwal, the sources said.				 																																																	As tension ran high, authorities suspended two policemen, Ashok Thakur and Rai Singh, and attached the staff of the police station, including its in-charge Balwinder Singh, to the police lines.

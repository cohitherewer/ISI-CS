Khan with the arrest of four persons, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										The arrested persons have been identified as Pratap Kumar Singh, alias Kapil, Lalit Kumar Singh, his uncle, Tejbir Singh, and Ghambir Singh.				 																																																										Bureau officials said they zeroed in on them, following interrogation of Harinder Singh of Aligarh. Harinder had bought Khans car after he was kidnapped and murdered.				 																																																										The accused told the investigators that they accidentally killed Khan because they were looking for a car to be used for a kidnapping and they decided to hijack Khans Maruti Zen.				 																																																										Khan was kidnapped from Aligarh on February 14, while going to the history department after dropping wife Zulfia at JN Medical College. He was found dead near Ujharpur village of Akbarabad in Aligarh with two gunshots in his head. 				 																																																										The CBI has recovered a country-made pistol used for the murder and a CD player and the remnants of Khans laptop. Tejbir had allegedly destroyed the laptop, the CBI said.				 																																																										Khans killing had evoked protests from the university teachers and sparked communal tension. The teachers went on a strike, which was called off only after an assurance that the case would be handed over to the CBI.				 																SC scanner on Karishma case 				 																																																	New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday asked Calcutta High Court to give a copy of its judgment allowing Karishma  The Miracles of Destiny back on air to plaintiff Barbara Taylor Bradford, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																										The author, fighting a copyright infringement case against Sahara Entertainment, the channel broadcasting the serial allegedly based on her book, A Woman of Substance, took the legal battle to Delhi after Calcutta High Court on July 21 dismissed her appeal for a stay on the telecast.				 																																																										But the Supreme Courts division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and B.P. Singh turned down the appeal as it did not have a copy of the judgment.				 																																																										The next hearing is on August 4, by which time Calcutta High Court has been requested to hand over the complete judgment or give Bradfords lawyers access to the files. 				 																																																										No interim stay order was granted, so Sahara is free to telecast the Monday through Thursday soap opera starring Karisma Kapoor.

		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Get calls and get paid
 M. RAJENDRAN New Delhi, Dec. 11: Now  get paid for receiving a call on your mobile.																								Just a few years ago, a minutes call from your mobile would have burnt the pocket by Rs 16.80  now you get paid Rs 1.50 for each call you receive on your mobile. If it is an international call, you are richer by Rs 10 per minute.																								Unprecedented, but within the first eight years of the evolution of mobile telephony in the country, mobile operators have reached a stage where leading service provider AirTel has firmed up plans to launch a scheme to pay customers receiving a call.																								From calling a mobile number free to cheap mobile-to-mobile STD to receiving incoming calls free... cellular phone customers have had a bonanza over the last 12 months or so.																								We all know incoming is free, but now you are actually getting paid to receive calls. It is an international marketing trend which shows that the market is mature for operators to offer such plans, a senior AirTel executive said.																								Initially, AirTel will launch this plan in Delhi and spread it to all the circles of its operations. It is initially valid for one month, but is likely to be extended depending on customer response.																								All an AirTel customer has to do is ask a friend, acquaintance, relative or business partner who is visiting Delhi and is a mobile subscriber of any operator to log on to the AirTel Delhi network.																								For each call made from a mobile phone logged on to the AirTel network and to an AirTel mobile phone the subscriber will get Rs 1.50. 																								The initiative packs an unprecedented customer offering. In a sense, it is also reflective of the maturing mobile telephony market and our ability to innovate and keep ahead of the pack, said a source at Bharti Cellular Limited.																								The programme rewards existing customers for urging their acquaintances to log on to the AirTel network.																								This is a reward for having conveyed AirTels unique proposition to the inroamers and letting them experience the benefits of roaming on Indias largest pan-India network, a senior marketing executive of Bharti Cellular said.																								The market size for inroamers in Delhi is estimated to be nearly Rs 30 crore per month. If this number is any indication, there is a lot of money to be disbursed. Whats more, there is no eligibility criterion.																								Just go ahead and get as many of your acquaintances (outside Delhi) to visit the countrys capital, choose the AirTel network, and call your mobile number.

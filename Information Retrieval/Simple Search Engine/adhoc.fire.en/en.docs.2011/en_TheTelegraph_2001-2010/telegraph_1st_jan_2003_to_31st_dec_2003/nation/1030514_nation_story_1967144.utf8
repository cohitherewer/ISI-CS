		 Wednesday, May 14, 2003 				 Harassment cover for TN women
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, May 13: Tamil Nadu has formally notified sexual harassment of women at workplace as a misconduct as required by the Supreme Court order of 1997.																								An official press release here said the state labour department issued the notification amending its Model Standing Orders to include sexual harassment of women in the workplace.																								The apex court had in August 1997 ruled in the Vishaka case that it was necessary and appropriate for employers at workplaces and other institutions to ensure prevention of sexual harassment of women.																								Even private sector companies were directed to take steps to prevent sexual harassment under the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act.																								Now, unwelcome sexually determined behaviour such as physical contact and advances, a demand or request for sexual favours, making sexually-coloured remarks, showing pornographic pictures and any other unwelcome behaviour of sexual nature would be considered a misconduct, the press release said.																								The notification has been issued under the Tamil Nadu Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules, 1947.

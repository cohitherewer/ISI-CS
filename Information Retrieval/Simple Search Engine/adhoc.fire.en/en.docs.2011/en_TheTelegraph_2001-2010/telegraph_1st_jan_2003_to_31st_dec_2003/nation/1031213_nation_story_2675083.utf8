 OUR BUREAU																								Patna/Bhubaneswar, Dec. 12: Patna High Court today placed on record the dedicated plan of the Bihar government for immediate completion of the Golden Quadrilateral highway project while hearing the Satyendra Dubey murder case.																								Dubey, an IIT Kanpur engineer working as the project manager on the Gaya segment of the quadrilateral, was murdered in Gaya last month. The engineer, who was to take charge as the project director shortly, had written to the Prime Minister and the National Highways Authority of India chairman about the loot of public money in the execution of the project.																								The Bihar stretch of the quadrilateral, covering 202 km, is to be built on the Grand Trunk Road connecting four of the states districts.																								Yesterday, the division bench of Chief Justice Ravi S. Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh made top government officials scramble to submit a full-fledged report on the states plans to ensure completion of the project and total security for the staff. Given five hours to submit their plan, the state and police officials did so within the 4.15-pm deadline.																								At todays hearing, the bench told the officials: Let it (the plan) be tested, put into effect and tried. The court will review how the plan has been implemented during next Thursdays hearing.																								Union highways minister B.C. Khanduri today slammed the Bihar government for failing to provide adequate security. Inaugurating a 33.2-km Bhubaneswar-Calcutta stretch of the quadrilateral project in the Orissa capital today, the minister said he had written to Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, asking her to provide protection to engineers working on highway projects.																								I have written five letters to the chief minister during the last two years, saying that the people working on the Golden Quadrilateral need protection. It is a matter of record that personnel employed in the implementation of NHDP (National Highway Development Programme) in Bihar have been under constant threat. This has been a problem with Bihar for a long time, Khanduri said.																								He pointed out that another IIT graduate and Indian Forest Service officer Sanjay Singh had been kidnapped and murdered in Bihar in February last year.																								Back in Patna, Bihar chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanian was present in court today along with home secretary V.K. Haldar. The Patna and Magadh commissioners and the district magistrates and police superintendents of Kaimur, Rohtas, Aurangabad and Gaya were also present.																								During yesterdays hearing, the court said Dubeys murder could sound the death knell for development in the state, as none would dare to come here on an assignment. It sent a grim message that Bihar is unsafe, the chief justice said.

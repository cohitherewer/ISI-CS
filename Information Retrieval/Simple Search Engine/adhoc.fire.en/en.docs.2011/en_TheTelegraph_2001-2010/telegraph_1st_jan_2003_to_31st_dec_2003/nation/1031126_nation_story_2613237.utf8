The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, November 26, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Plan to broadbase medical councils				 																																																	New Delhi: The Medical Council of India (MCI) has agreed to appoint non-medical members in all the state medical councils besides its own, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																										The MCI on Tuesday accepted the suggestion of attorney-general Soli Sorabjee who made this point before the Supreme Court while responding to a public interest litigation. The MCI said the Centre could even come out with a gazette notification to effect the changes suggested by Sorabjee.				 																																																										The plea filed by Malay Ganguly, the secretary of People for Better Treatment, contended that for accountability of doctors involved in medical negligence cases and to safeguard the interests of a complainant against perceived bias of the medical fraternity which might not want to let down a doctor, non-medical members should be appointed in all state medical councils as well as the MCI.				 																																																										The organisation People for Better Treatment was started by US-based Indian doctor Kunal Saha after his wife Anuradha died from medical negligence five years back. Gangulys wife, too, died due to medical negligence. 				 																Grenade scare in security zone New Delhi (PTI): Detection of a grenade  on the busy, high-security Tilak Marg which houses some  embassies and residences of diplomats triggered alarm on  Tuesday.				 																																																										There was high drama for over two hours before the grenade was found to be in a defused state. It was brought by a retired army officer in connection with a court case against him and was in a suitcase kept by the roadside near an apartment building, opposite the office of the Tilak Marg assistant commissioner of police and close to India Gate, police sources said.				 																																																										The explosive was detected by a traffic policeman around 12.45 pm. The area was immediately cordoned off and a bomb detection and disposal squad rushed to the site.				 																																																										The suitcase also contained papers of the case in which retired Lt Col. S.K. Chowdhary is accused of killing a man by sending him a parcel bomb in 1983, they said. 				 																																																										The grenade was apparently being carried by Chowdhary to Patiala House courts, also situated on Tilak Marg, in connection with the case, the sources said.				 																																																										The area is close to the residence of Pakistan high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan, the Supreme Court and the venue of the ongoing international trade fair. 				 																Plane glides off Mumbai runway				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): All 53 passengers, including an infant, and four crew members had a narrow escape when a Jet Airways flight from Bhavnagar went off the runway after landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport on Tuesday.

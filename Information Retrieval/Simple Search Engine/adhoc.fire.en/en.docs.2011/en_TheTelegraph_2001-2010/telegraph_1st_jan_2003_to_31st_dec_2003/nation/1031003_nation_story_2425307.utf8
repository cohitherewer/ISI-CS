 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, Oct. 2: Cleopatras secret is finally out  ready to be bottled and marketed for those who wish to acquire the Egyptian queens legendary beauty.																								After three years of research, a group of Lucknow University scientists has recently managed to patent the process isolating the sugar chain constituents known as oligosaccharides in donkeys milk that Cleopatra used to enhance her beauty. Oligosaccharides are carbohydrates whose molecules are composed of a few monosaccharide units.																								Their application has been sanctioned by the Indian Patents office and was published in the Gazette of India on April 19 this year. We are set to hit the market soon, says Ainakshi Khare, head of the universitys chemistry department.																								The research to develop immunostimulants from donkeys milk was inspired by the legend surrounding the queens famous beauty baths, Khare admits. Donkeys milk was known as Cleopatras secret to eternal beauty. Poppea, wife of the Roman emperor Nero, would only bathe in donkeys milk. She travelled with 500 nursing donkeys so she could take milk baths to keep her skin smooth and supple.																								We soon found that they were not off the mark in their queer toilet preferences, says Desh Deepak, reader in the chemistry department and principal investigator of the project sponsored by the department of science and technology.																								During their research, the university scientists found that the oligosaccharides in donkeys milk have anti-aging properties which can be used in combating wrinkles.																								The oligosaccharides are also anti-cancer agents. With its high immuno-stimulant activity, it can also be used as a potent drug for diseases affecting the immune system, including tuberculosis and even AIDS. While this compound may not be able to eliminate the AIDS virus, it can improve body resistance, Deepak says.																								Initially, such claims generated scepticism and even ridicule among scientists, but the team persisted. After successful animal trials, it conducted extensive clinical trials for over a year before formally applying for patenting the process.																								Of all domestic animals, donkeys milk is the closest to human milk in its composition of sugars and proteins, Deepak says. Its rich in vitamins A, B, C, D and E and minerals. The soap (containing this milk) is good for all types of skin, especially skin thats dry and fragile, he adds.																								Indians knew the medicinal qualities of donkey milk much before the knowledge reached ancient Egypt and Rome, says Deepak, quoting the Charak Samhita, Sushrut Samhita and Dravya Gunadarsha extensively.																								Even today, in the Himalayan hills and especially the Terai belt, donkey milk is being used for treating rickets or as a balm, he points out.																								Deepak waxes eloquent about the amazing qualities of donkeys milk, which can offer a cure for chest and liver diseases as well as blood and bladder disorder. It is also a formidable aphrodisiac which can give Viagra a run for its money.																								The Lucknow scientists findings have been published in Biochemical et Biophysica Acta and also presented in various international conferences, including the recent symposium on immunopharmacology held in Delhi.																								They are now awaiting a nod for a project submitted to the Technopreneur Promotion Programme of the Department of Science and Technology for financial help to set up a donkey farm to make it easier to obtain the milk.

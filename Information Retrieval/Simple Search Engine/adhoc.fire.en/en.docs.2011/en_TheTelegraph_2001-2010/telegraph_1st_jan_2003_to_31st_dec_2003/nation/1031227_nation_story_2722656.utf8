Picture by Aranya Sen																								Patna, Dec. 26: With the Jammu theatre troupe recently attacked on a train in Patna scheduled to reach here tomorrow on their way back home, Patna Railway Police has filed a complaint based on a fax from Calcutta.																								The FIR (431/03) was filed yesterday on the written complaint by Balwant Thakur, the director of Natrang that performed in Calcutta on Wednesday at Nandikars National Theatre Festival.																								Though no accused has been named, the case has been registered under IPC Sections 341, 323, 307, 354, 504 and 34 for assault, abuse and attempted molestation.																								Laloo Prasad Yadav had earlier summoned four senior police officers to ask them to crack down on the suspects after he took serious note of the assault.																								Railway police inspector A.K. Singh said sub-inspector Raju Kumar and his team were in Calcutta to accompany the troupe on its way back to Jammu and Kashmir via Patna.																								A gang had started teasing the troupes women members on board the Howrah-bound Himgiri Express two stations before Patna on Tuesday, police here had said. The attackers are said to have threatened similar treatment on the their way back.																								Singh added that Kumar would record Balwants statement in person during the return journey. We will be able to take concrete action only when we are able to get detailed statements from the victims, the inspector said.																								A controversial district council member who was said to be travelling with escort in the same coach as the troupe has not been questioned so far. We cannot search for him and take him in custody unless he is directly named an accused, Singh said. He is yet to get the list of passengers on that coach. 																								Police here added they have no idea about the two attackers who were identified by the victims as Ashok and Mukesh. We will get a clear picture of the case only when our team reaches tomorrow with the troupe. Only then will we be able to start investigation into the case and search for the accused. Singh said.

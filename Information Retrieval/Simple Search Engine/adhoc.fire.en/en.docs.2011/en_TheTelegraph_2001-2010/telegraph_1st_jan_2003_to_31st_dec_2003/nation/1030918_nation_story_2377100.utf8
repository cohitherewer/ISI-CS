																								New Delhi, Sept. 17: Militant camps across the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir have been reactivated, intelligence inputs with the army say. The vice-chief of the army, Lt Gen. Shantonu Choudhry, today said the army has photographs of these camps, reports our special correspondent.																								Terrorist activity in these camps have been revived and are at the same level as they were earlier. There is evidence of armed training being given in the camps, the vice-chief said. 																								There is also no evidence that infiltration across the LoC was on the decline. The activity on the LoC is at the same level as it was this time last year.																								This is the period when the forces on both sides prepare for the winter. In the past, army sources say, Pakistan has used these weeks to push in as many militants as it can before snow chokes passes in the higher reaches.																								The killing of Gazi Baba had not provoked more attacks by the militants but recent violent incidents were more sensational, according to the understanding of the army. The killings of civilians and Kuka Parray were cited in this context.																								The vice-chief said the Territorial Army, a wing of the army that comprises professionals from the civilians on temporary duty, would set up battalions of counter-insurgents in Jammu and Kashmir. These units are deemed to be important in intelligence gathering and local action.																								The army has also proposed to the Cabinet Committee on Security that the Territorial Army should be expanded.

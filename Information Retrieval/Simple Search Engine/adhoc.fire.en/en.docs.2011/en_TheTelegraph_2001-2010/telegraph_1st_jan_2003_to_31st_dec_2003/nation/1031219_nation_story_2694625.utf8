 RASHEED KIDWAI Digvijay  Bharti																								Bhopal, Dec. 18: If only stars spared a thought for humans																								Despite the change of guard in Madhya Pradesh, new chief minister Uma Bharti has been forced to stay put in her home  all because of a celestial movement in the ongoing month of Paush which astrologers say is inauspicious for moving into new premises.																								The BJP leader might have to wait till January 14, the day north India celebrates Makar Sankranti. According to astrologers, Makar Sankranti is important as on this day the sun enters the constellation of Makar (Crocodile) and begins to move towards the north.																								Her predecessor, Digvijay Singh, is equally star stuck. Having packed his bags, the veteran Congressman is whiling away time in the picturesque 6, Shaymla Hills, which overlooks the grand Bhopal Lake.																								Bharti has called on Digvijay thrice, hinting subtly that she would like to move into the chief ministerial bungalow before January 14. But the former chief minister seems in no hurry.																								Sources close to Bharti said she consulted some diviners who suggested she should place a kalash in the new house to ward off any evil that is linked with Paush. The kalash is in place at the chief ministerial bungalow.																								Digvijays spiritual consultants, on the other hand, have advised him that from Makar Sankranti, he would be free to shift to the new house just across the road and currently held by party colleague Kamal Nath. This house  9, Shaymla Hills  is no less grand than the chief ministerial bungalow but does not overlook the lake. Second, the house is said to be a favourite with poisonous and not-so-poisonous snakes.																								Astrology apart, Digvijay and Bharti are on their best behaviour both inside and outside the Assembly. While the deposed chief minister calls his successor chhoti bahen (younger sister), Bharti addresses Digvijay as bade bhai (elder brother). The Congressman has even gone out of his way to help Bharti by introducing her to officers.																								In the Assembly today, Bharti was careful to maintain decorum and spared Digvijay the harsh words she had for the former chief minister before the polls.																								But that did not stop her from taking a dig at Digvijays austerity measures. Her target of austerity would be the top level  chief minister, ministers, secretaries, heads of corporations  Bharti said, lamenting the Digvijay regimes move to sack 20,000 daily-wage earners to cut costs. Why should the most vulnerable sections be the first to bear the brunt, she said.																								Bharti also said that from tomorrow, all farmers would get six hours of power throughout the state on three-phase connections. She promised to tide over the power crisis in a years time.

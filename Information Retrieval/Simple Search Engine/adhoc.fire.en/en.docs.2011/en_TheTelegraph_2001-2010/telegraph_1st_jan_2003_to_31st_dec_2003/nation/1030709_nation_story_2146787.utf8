		 Wednesday, July 09, 2003 				 Peer-rape taint on banker
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, July 8: A senior manager at the Industrial Development Bank of India was arrested last night on charges of raping a colleague. 																								The manager, released today on bail, was arrested by the Cuffe Parade police after a fellow manager accused him of rape and harassment after being lured into a long-standing relationship. 																								The accused is senior manager at a cash-clearing section and the complainant is a customer relations manager. They work in different branches of the bank. 																								Police said the woman employee accused her colleague of promising to marry her and regularly e-mailing and phoning her. After they came close, the woman found that he was married and had a child. She turned suicidal, consumed poison and was treated at St George hospital. 																								After this, their relationship became complicated and the senior manager raped her, the complainant said. 																								The manager was booked under Section 376 (B) of the IPC and released on a Rs 10,000 bail.																								A bank spokesperson said the organisation, which seemed to have been taken unawares, was following the developments and had spoken to the employees.																								The spokesperson said the managers seemed to have had a consensual relationship and had known each other for years. The bank was yet to decide if this was a case of sexual harassment. 																								He said on July 2, the woman employee approached the human resources department and submitted her resignation, alleging harassment by the senior manager. 																								But since she was a good employee, we did not accept her resignation. She also did not bring before us the charge of rape, though she told us that she had already filed a complaint to the police, the spokesperson said.																								We refused to accept her resignation because she was performing well. But we assured her that the organisation will see that there is no interference from his (the senior managers) side in her affairs, he added.																								The bank summoned the accused who stated that he had not harassed the woman and that they had a mutual relationship.

		 Tuesday, February 25, 2003 				 Sudden death for VHP sound and fury 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Vishwa Hindu Parishads protest march to Parliament did not begin with a bang but certainly ended in a whimper.																								Ashok Singhal, Praveen Togadia, Acharya Dharmendra and the sadhus who threatened to gherao Parliament yesterday tamely gave up the plan today at Parliament Street, half a kilometre from their target.																								The fire-spitting leaders did not even try to court arrest at the end of the three-hour demonstration that was billed as a major show of strength.																								But to sustain the impression that they meant business on their demands for a Ram temple and the return of the undisputed Ayodhya land, the VHP leaders spewed anti-government rhetoric, targeting even the Prime Minister and his deputy.																								They chanted the trademark Jai Shri Ram to the sound of conchshells though the protest appeared to be just another in a series of VHPs blow-hot-blow-cold tactics.																								The sadhus were reportedly all fired up for a showdown with the police but the RSS had counselled restraint, mainly because the case was still in the Supreme Court.																								The VHP fell in line this time after it was told that its agitational posture last year might have prompted the apex court to ban the shiladaan in Ayodhya.																								The sizeable number of VHP leaders and Bajrang Dal activists, armed with tridents and conchshells, today marched till Parliament Street police station, a stones throw from Parliament, where security forces stopped them.																								The sadhus and activists, from as far away as the northeast and Karnataka as also the cow belt, waved placards and shouted slogans demanding immediate construction of the Ram temple.																								Two trucks were parked close to make a makeshift podium for the religious leaders to address the gathering on the third and concluding day of the VHPs dharma sansad.																								Most speakers dubbed the ongoing agitation as the final religious war in their effort to get the Ayodhya temple built.																								VHPs Praveen Togadia warned every village would be turned into Ayodhya if the temple was not allowed. He said if the sants decided to build a temple, then Hindus would get come to the streets to ensure that it happened, irrespective of the consequences.																								Togadia wanted to know why the Centre couldnt hand over the disputed land in Ayodhya for temple construction if the Congress could amend the Constitution to give minority status to Aligarh Muslim University.																								He urged the Congress and other political parties to support the cause of the temple and promised a two-thirds majority in Parliament to any party that stepped forward.																								We dont hate you (Congress). We love all those who love Ram Lalla, Togadia said.																								Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas chief Paramhansa Ramchandradas said he would intensify his agitation from March 5, a day ahead of the Supreme Court hearing on the temple issue, and continue till March 25, irrespective of the apex courts decision.																								VHP international general-secretary Ashok Singhal said the problem lay in secularism. Its an Islam rajya (in India), not a Hindu rajya, he said while urging Hindus to unite to strengthen the community. We have not been able to portray our terror. That is why politicians are taking the help of Muslims to reach Parliament, he said.

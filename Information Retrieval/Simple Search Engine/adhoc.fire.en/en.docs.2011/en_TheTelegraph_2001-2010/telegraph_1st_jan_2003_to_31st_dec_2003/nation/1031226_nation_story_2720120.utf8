 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Dec. 25: The defeat of the Congress in the Assembly polls in the Hindi heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh may bring unexpected pressure on party chief ministers in other states.																								On the face of it, the party high command might have sought to downplay the anti-incumbency factor that led to the poll debacle by invoking a new factor  the allegedly missing names of several party voters from the voters list.																								The new cause seemed to have been invented more to contain the damage the debacle has caused to the cohesion of the party at the top. Privately, however, party leaders have no doubt that the debacle was caused in large measure by the anti-incumbency sentiment among voters. The leadership had either failed to perceive the sentiment or had glossed over the issue.																								The party has paid a heavy price for this as some of its showcase chief ministers have bitten the dust in the poll battle.																								The debacle in the elections has triggered a blame-game within the top leadership echelon and has also prompted a serious thinking that the performance of the party governments in states should be subjected to thorough assessments from the point of view of public perceptions.																								Congress chief Sonia Gandhis mechanism of holding periodic conclaves of party chief ministers had not addressed the performance aspect in practical terms, it is now being said. It was more an exercise in image building and could not help Digvijay Singh and Ashok Gehlot, it is said.																								The Pranab Kumar Mukherjee-led committee, probing the causes of the Assembly poll debacle, is said to be purposefully addressing more: What is to be done for the future in view of the lessons learnt from the anti-incumbency debacle.																								There is already a suggestion that the Congress governments states like Karnataka, Assam, Punjab, Kerala and Uttaranchal should be assessed to ascertain whether the anti-incumbency factor is already at work. Such an exercise, it is said, must precede the partys preparatory work for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.																								Informed sources indicated that the high commands verdict on the strong demands for changing Kerala chief minister A.K. Antony and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh was being kept in abeyance for the time-being, pending assessments on the anti-incumbency count. Mukherjee has also looked into the problems in Kerala and Punjab.																								There is a feeling that hard decisions might have to be taken about continuing with chief ministers who face the anti-incumbency sentiments of voters. More so because the leadership is wary of facing the Lok Sabha polls with the anti-incumbency factor operating against its state governments.																								Internal opinion poll surveys are already underway to ascertain the ground situation in Congress-ruled states and you cannot rule out surprises in the new year, say informed sources.																								There are also indications that all required changes at the state-level might be undertaken once Sonia starts her parliamentary poll-oriented changes in the organisational structures of the party at the top and at the state-level. Her changes might come soon enough in the new year.																								The Mukherjee panel is expected to submit its report to Sonia any time after December 29.

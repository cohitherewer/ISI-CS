		 Friday, June 06, 2003 				 Karishma signature seal 
																								Calcutta, June 5: The Calcutta High Court-appointed joint special officers can now put their initials on materials like script, tapes and CDs identified as related to the mega serial Karishma: The Miracles of Destiny, says a staff reporter. This, in effect, will safeguard the material against any interference while the matter is being contested in court.																								A bench of Justices Prabir Kumar Samanta and Arun Kumar Mitra passed an order in this regard on Thursday. The vacation bench was hearing an application filed by Barbara Taylor Bradfords lawyers for sealing all materials related to the Sahara Manoranjan serial, starring Karisma Kapoor, whose telecast was stopped by the courts after one episode. Earlier, Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose appointed two special officers, S.. Roy and Jayanta Banerjee, for making an inventory of the items related to the merit of the breach-of-copyright case filed by Bradford.

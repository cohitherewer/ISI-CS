The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, December 16, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Notices to Centre, Jaya on Hindu plea				 																																																	New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government on a writ petition filed by the former editor of The Hindu challenging the constitutional validity of Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code that provides punishment for defamation, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																										The notices were issued by a division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and S.B. Sinha on a petition filed by the former editor, . Ravi, who also sought a stay on the 20 defamation cases against the newspaper by the Jayalalithaa government.				 																																																										The petition challenging the defamation law contended that if the tax-payers money was utilised by a democratically-elected government for instituting defamation cases for articles written in a newspaper, it would have a chilling effect curtailing the right to free speech guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution.				 																																																										Senior counsel for The Hindu, Harish Salve, contended that in India the law provided that it would not be defamation if an article written in a newspaper against a public figure was true, not malicious and in public interest. He said the defamation law has undergone a lot of development and in countries like the US, the right of free speech has been recognised as a basic right of newspapers and criticism of public offices was not construed in the strict sense of defamation.				 																																																										This is the second petition by The Hindu against a series of actions of the Tamil Nadu government. The newspaper had been hauled up by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly which had passed a resolution ordering the arrest of five of its journalists. The Hindu challenged it in the Supreme Court which stayed the arrest and referred the matter to a five-judge Constitution bench.

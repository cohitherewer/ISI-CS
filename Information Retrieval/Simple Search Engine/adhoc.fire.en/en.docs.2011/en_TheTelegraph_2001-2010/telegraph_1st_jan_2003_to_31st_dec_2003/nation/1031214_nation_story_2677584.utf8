		 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Liquor probe blotch on Naidu
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA				 	 Naidu																								Hyderabad, Dec. 13: The Mr Clean image of the Andhra Pradesh chief minister took a beating yesterday when a city court ordered an investigation against the . Chandrababu Naidu administration in a liquor procurement case.																								Ananta Sayana Prasad, the special judge for Anti-Corruption Bureau cases in Hyderabad city civil court, directed the bureau to investigate the charges against Naidu, ministers T. Nageswar Rao and . Raghuram and 15 others, including former chief secretary K. Madhav Rao, and submit a report by January 29.																								The order was passed on a public interest litigation that Congress . Krishna Kumar Goud had filed on the basis of a vigilance commission report of 1997-98 that over Rs 200 crore was paid in excess to select Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) companies after prohibition was relaxed in October 1997.																								The government favoured select five companies for the special benefit, Goud alleged. 																								Some leading liquor companies were among the 76 firms with which the state beverages corporation entered into direct wholesale trade as the sole distributor for the state. 																								The vigilance commission report had been kept in cold storage by the Naidu government in 1999, Krishna Kumar said. 																								His petition has pressed charges under Section 13-1D (II and III) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Sections 409 (breach of trust) and 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. 																								The government dubbed the charges in the first criminal case against the chief minister vague and irrelevant. The charges are politically-motivated vague insinuations and no specific allegations have been made against either the chief minister or his cabinet members or the officials, an official spokesman said in a statement here.																								The government proposes to file an appeal in Andhra Pradesh High Court on the jurisdiction of the civil court to order an Anti-Corruption Bureau investigation against the chief minister and IAS officials.																								The government spokesman contended the bureau could not probe either the chief minister or the IAS officials. The bureau director-general, A.K. Mohanty, however, said he would swing into action once the official copy of the court direction is received.

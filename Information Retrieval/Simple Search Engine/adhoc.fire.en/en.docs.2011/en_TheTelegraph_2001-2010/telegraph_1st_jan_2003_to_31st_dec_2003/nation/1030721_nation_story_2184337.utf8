 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 20: The CBI will discuss early this week whether an FIR can be registered against former Uttaranchal revenue minister Harak Singh Rawat, alleged to have fathered a child of an unwed woman.																								A CBI team has returned from Dehra Dun after speaking to Indira Deori, alias Jenni, the woman who made the allegation. The team also spoke to government officers. 																								Jenni gave birth to a child on June 9 and later claimed that Rawat was the father of the child. The allegation snowballed into a controversy in the Assembly, forcing Rawat to quit office. His political career now hinges on the outcome of the CBI findings.																								Sources said the team spoke to Jenni for about five hours at Nari Niketan where she has been lodged. Apart from questioning her over her relationship with Rawat, the sleuths also quizzed her on how and when she landed up at the Niketan. 																								The state government has increased its vigil at the Niketan since she started staying there. Jenni is not allowed to step beyond the confines of the Niketan. A doctor visits the place regularly to oversee the growth of her newborn. 																								The sleuths also spoke to officials of the state social welfare department, which manages the Niketan. Senior CBI officers will assess the evidence to decide whether it is enough to register a case. 																								Chief minister .D. Tiwari had referred the matter to the CBI after the Opposition had cornered the government. 																								Though no case was registered by police, a team of MLAs was formed by the government to look into Jennis allegation.

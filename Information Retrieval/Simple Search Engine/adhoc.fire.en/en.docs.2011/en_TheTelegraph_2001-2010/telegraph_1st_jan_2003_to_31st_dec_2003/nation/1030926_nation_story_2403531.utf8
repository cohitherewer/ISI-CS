		 Friday, September 26, 2003 				 No vendetta, chants Samajwadi
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jamshedpur, Sept. 25: Refraining from all acts of political vendetta has emerged as the Samajwadi chant after the party took control of Uttar Pradesh just as its national executive meet here today clarified the noble intentions of the Mulayam Singh Yadav regime in relation to its political enemies.																								But the extraordinary insistence on this single agenda, Samajwadi sources said, was guided more by political compulsion than by choice.																								What rules Uttar Pradesh is a political collective of widely diverse backgrounds. The point is that no one can act against anyone. For instance, a strong group of former BSP legislators is with the chief minister. Obviously, Mayavati cannot be targeted any more than what she is already undergoing in the Taj corridor case. It is a tightrope and no one can afford to walk it wrong, they explained.																								Officially, the party said the court and the CBI were already seized of the matter and the government would not back out from extending point-by-point co-operation to both as and when sought. But the executive did not favour any direct action, not even against officials, though it alleged that the BSP-BJP dispensation had surpassed the excesses of the Emergency.																								With this as the backdrop, the resolutions adopted spoke about ushering in a positive administration and give the people a pro-poor government. Ram Manohar Lohia had opined that a government should be known by its work and not by the number of bullets it fires. We will abide by this, party spokesperson Amar Singh said, setting out the basis of its political resolution. But the attack on the BJP-led regime in Delhi and the Narendra Modi government in Gujarat was total.																								Communalism has scaled unprecedented heights wherever the BJP is the guiding force. Modis is a shameless government that refused to quit office after the Supreme Court order said it had failed. The Archaeological Survey report on Ayodhya is still to be placed before the court but the BJP has already made it the basis for creating fresh differences in society, the party said.																								The national executive, being attended by around 80 Samajwadi leaders, came down on the Centre for failing to control domestic terrorism and adopting a shaky policy on Pakistan.																								There is no permanent policy on the neighbouring country. The government has done a bhoodan of Tibet, which was to act as a buffer state between us and China. We caution the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime on its policy of countering international terrorism, the spokesperson said.																								The party said the Prime Ministers refusal to send troops to Iraq was an example where he had to take that stand under Opposition pressure. 																								But the way this government has treated the Palestine movement and hobnobbed with the Israeli government puts its intentions under suspicion.																								The attack on the Centres economic policies was led by the failure of the Prime Ministers promise to provide jobs. Unemployment has grown at the rate of 9 per cent every year.																								The economy has been handed over to the capitalists on a platter. The apex courts order setting aside the governments divestment plans for petroleum companies has acted as one of the checks. But the economic policies need to challenged on many more fronts, Amar Singh said.																								While realising that its core base existed just in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi conclave resolved to work for achieving the goal of emerging as a national party.																								Let it, however, be clear that we will neither join nor form any political front with other parties. We are open to issue-based combinations. If necessary, the Samajwadi party will contest the coming Assembly elections in four states (Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Rajasthan) on its own, the party said.

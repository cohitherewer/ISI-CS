The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, April 24, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Sparks fly over JNU Tamil Chair				 																																																	 Chennai: The state has instituted a Chair for Tamil studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, sparking a debate between the ADMK and the DMK over who is more committed to promoting Tamil language and culture, reports our special correspondent. 				 																																																	My government has decided to make a one-time lump sum grant of Rs 50 lakh to establish a Tamil Chair at JNU as we are convinced of its necessity to promote the study and research of Tamil in a famous university, ADMK president Jayalalithaa told the Assembly.				 																																																	The DMK, on the other hand, has resorted to rhetoric rather than action, she alleged. 				 																																																	In March 2002, when the Karunanidhi-led DMK was in power, the Centre for Indian Languages in JNU had written to the government, seeking help to institute the Chair. The former chief minister had given his consent and announced in the House that his government would help set up the Chair. In June that year, an order was issued and the government granted Rs 10 lakh to JNU, Jayalalithaa said. But the university sent back the funds a month later, saying the government should either give Rs 50 lakh outright or in five annual installments of Rs 10 lakh each, the ADMK leader added. 				 																Court focus on jailed Pak men New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday  directed the Jammu and Kashmir government to give details  of the number of Pakistanis detained in various jails in  the state within a week, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	The directive was issued on a petition filed by three Pakistanis seeking release from a jail in the state. An apex court bench heard three habeas corpus petitions filed by Bisarat Ali Rajput, Abdul Khaliq and M. Salahuddin saying they were detained arbitrarily for the last nine years.				 																																																	Jammu and Kashmir government counsel Anees Suhrawardy said the three were arrested while crossing the LoC in 1994-95 and were charged under Tada and the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act.				 																Medics strike work in TN				 																																																	 Chennai (PTI): Medical and dental college students across Tamil Nadu on Wednesday launched an indefinite strike, boycotting classes and hospital work, demanding hike in stipend and a ban on opening of new medical colleges in the state.				 																																																	A spokesman of the Medical and Dental Students, House Surgeons and Post-Graduate Doctors Association claimed the strike was total.				 																Groom killed				 																																																	 New Delhi (Reuters): A groom, accidentally shot in the head at his wedding, died on Wednesday, a hospital spokeswoman said. Software engineer Tapesh Kumar Singh, 22, was sitting next to his bride when a friend fired a celebratory shot from a revolver at the wedding on the outskirts of the city on Sunday. Police have arrested Singhs friend and say they have a video of the incident.				 																Sanctuary opens				 																																																	 Udhagamandalam (PTI): The Mudumalai Sanctuary reopened last week after being closed for a month due to dry conditions. Wildlife warden in-charge said four elephants had joined the Thepakkadu camp and nine guest houses inside the sanctuary have been provided with wells.				 																Immolation bid				 																																																	 Mettur (PTI): A youth attempted self-immolation on being denied admission to a hospital here. He suffered 30 per cent burn injuries. The youth, police said, was admitted to Mohan Kumaramangalam General Hospital a fortnight ago and walked out 10 days back. On Tuesday, he demanded to be re-admitted and set himself ablaze on being refused.				 																Dawood aides				 																																																	 Ahmedabad (pti): Four persons, allegedly belonging to Dawood Ibrahims gang, made an abortive attempt on the life of a Surat-based businessman, police said. Three of the accused were arrested from Surat and the fourth from Mumbai.

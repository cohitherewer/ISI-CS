		 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Mobile clue to engineer killing
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Dec. 13: Police today claimed to have made a sort of breakthrough into the Satyendra Dubey murder case, more than a fortnight after the young engineer was shot dead in Bihars Gaya district.																								The claim followed detention of two persons from the station area and the recovery of the slain National Highways Authority officials mobile phone from a rickshaw-pullers house.																								The mobile of Satyendra Dubey was recovered last night from the house of a rickshaw-puller who is absconding, said Gaya superintendent of police Sanjay Singh, a member of the special investigation team formed by the state government to probe the case.																								Singh, who was a friend of the 31-year-old IIT-Kanpur graduate, said: This is a sort of breakthrough. We are tracing the calls made from the mobile, both before and after the engineer was killed.																								On November 27, Dubey had got down at Gaya station at 3 in the morning and called up a driver who was to receive him. The car did not arrive as the driver reportedly said he had failed to start the engine because the battery was low.																								According to Gaya police, Dubey then boarded a rickshaw and headed for his official residence. When he was near Circuit House, unknown assailants gunned him down. The police appear to be working on the theory that some criminal gang, operating in the area late in the night, murdered the engineer. The recovery of the mobile and the fact that the rickshaw-puller is absconding appear to be supporting the state polices assumption.																								Deputy inspector-general of police .C. Dhondilyal was elated. Going from conspiracy to crime is a difficult process of investigation. We have decided, therefore, to start from crime, which may give us a clue to conspiracy. And see the result. The clue, the mobile, is with us. What more do you want?																								NDA leader Nandkishore Yadav was sceptical. When the CBI has already been handed over the case, what is the use of the state police claiming a breakthrough? he asked.																								But CBI sources here said they were yet to get the case diary from the state police. We are not in a position to comment on the state polices activities, said a senior official of the bureau in Patna.

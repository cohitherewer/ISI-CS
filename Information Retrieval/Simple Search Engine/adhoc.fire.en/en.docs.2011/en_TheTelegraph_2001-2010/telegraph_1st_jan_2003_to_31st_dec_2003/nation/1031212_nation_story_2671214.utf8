 GAJINDER SINGH				 	 Campbell handing over the US flag and medals to Udays mother Manjeet Singh in Chandigarh on Thursday. (PTI)																								Chandigarh, Dec. 11: No guns boomed in salute for the slain soldier. Only the last post sounded as the six American pallbearers stood at attention, mourning the young man who had died fighting their war.																								The Americans did not fire their guns  they could not in an alien land.																								In a rare gesture by a foreign army on Indian soil, top US army officials paid homage to India-born Sergeant Uday Singh  who was killed in an ambush in Iraq  shortly before the 21-year-old was cremated here in his hometown today.																								Uday, who had migrated to the US in 2000, is the first Indian casualty of Operation Iraq Freedom. He died in an ambush near Habbaniyah air force base, 65 km from Baghdad, on December 1. A green card holder, Uday was to receive his US citizenship earlier than expected for having joined the army.																								As the last rites took place with full US military honours, commander of the US Pacific Command Lt Gen. James Campbell, who led the ceremony, paid rich tributes to Uday.																								Today, two great democratic nations pause to mourn the loss of this courageous young man who chose the life of a soldier, he said. In his loss, we are reminded once again that freedom is not free.																								Besides Campbell, Pacific Command Brig Gen. Neil, US embassy deputy chief of mission Walter North, defence attach Col Sboto, casualty assistance officer Steven Stoiber and US country media adviser Arti Singh attended the ceremony.																								Earlier, Udays embalmed body was flown in from New Delhi at 9 in the morning in a special aircraft and placed on the front lawn of his house. Six pallbearers, all US soldiers, stood at attention next to the casket.																								Turning to Udays father, Col. Preet Mohinder Singh, and mother Manjeet, Campbell said he was deeply honoured to be here with his fellow soldiers to pay tribute to a brother-in-arms and Indias son, Sergeant Uday Singh. Campbell hailed Uday as a hero, who never quit. He always was and always will be an American soldier. He always placed the mission first. He never accepted defeat. He is our hero, he said as Udays mother, grandmother Anoop and sister Bani struggled to hold back tears.																								The commander handed his mother two medals, the Purple Heart for Udays wounds and the Bronze Star for meritorious service, and the US flag in which the casket was draped to his mother. Another flag was handed to his father. Campbell said Uday was an extraordinary soldier like his father; poised, professional, dedicated to both his mission and to his fellow soldiers.																								Wreaths were placed on the casket on behalf of the US government and the army. Two soldiers from the 5th Gorkha Regiment, Raj Kumar Shreshta and Deepak Shreshta, sounded the last post as the US soldiers could not fire their guns as a mark of respect for the dead soldier.																								Campbell stood in silence before the casket, saluted and then slowly went inside the house to spend some time with the family before leaving. The casket was then lifted by the pallbearers and placed on the veranda. The ceremony was over. The cremation was left to the family members.																								Udays father, in a brief address after Campbell had left, said the whole family was proud of his sacrifices. He was a brave Sikh soldier who died doing his duty, he said, tears streaming down his cheeks.																								An hour later, Udays body was taken to the crematorium. His father lit the pyre. The cremation, held according to Sikh rites, was witnessed by four US army officers, a departure from procedure as only one soldier is normally present during the funeral.																								Some Indian Army officers also attended the ceremony. They have not come in their official capacity as Uday died fighting for a different country. They have come here as friends, a family member said. Wreaths were also placed on the casket on behalf of the Chandigarh Garrison and the Cavalry Officers Association.																								Udays ashes will be taken to the Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, and interred there with a plaque describing his valour.

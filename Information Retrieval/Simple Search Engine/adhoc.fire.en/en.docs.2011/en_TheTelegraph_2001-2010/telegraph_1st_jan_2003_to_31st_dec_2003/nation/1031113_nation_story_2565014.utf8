 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Lucknow, Nov. 12: The CBI is contemplating action against a couple of Uttar Pradesh police officers who allegedly tampered with evidence in the Madhumita Shukla murder case to bail out former minister Amarmani Tripathi.																								Tripathi was put behind bars after a DNA report confirmed that he fathered the child the poet was carrying when she was killed on May 9 this year.																								The CBI has information which suggests that state police officers were helping out Tripathi to create and tamper with evidence to put investigators on the wrong trail. Among those under scrutiny is a former inspector general who was posted in Lucknow at the time of the murder.																								CBI sources said the bureau has gathered enough evidence against the inspector. If not anything else, we will write for a departmental action against the inspector, the sources said.																								The extent to which local police had allegedly helped Tripathi is baffling the sleuths. One policeman alleged to have gone out of his way was Yagya Narain Dikshit, the former station house officer of Manak Nagar police station in Lucknow. 																								Diskhit, it is alleged, had arranged for a priest to claim that he had conducted Madhumitas marriage with IIT Kanpur student Anuj Mishra in November or December last year and thus divert attention from Tripathi. This was widely published in the media but turned out to be a lie.																								Local police officers had also deliberately misplaced a chit carrying Madhumitas name and address which the two suspected assassins  Santosh Kumar Rai, alias Satya Prakash, and Prakash Chander Pandey  handed over to domestic help Deshraj on the day of the murder. Both Rai and Pandey are in CBI custody.																								The CB-CID, which took over the case from the police, got the chit back after it threatened departmental action against the officers. In fact, it questioned three senior officers to trace the chit.																								CBI sources said a cabinet minister in the state government may be interrogated as they feel Tripathi is still using his political connections to derail the probe after switching loyalties to the Samajwadi Party. 																								A CBI official said the former Bahujan Samaj Party minister was being given special treatment in the Lucknow jail where he is lodged. When a jail superintendent forbade Tripathi from using a cellphone and objected to the hordes of visitors, he was publicly castigated by a member of Mulayam Singh Yadavs cabinet and suspended. 																								Interestingly, no sooner than we told the jail authorities that we would put all this on record, the superintendents suspension was revoked unconditionally, which speaks volumes of the hanky panky going on, he said.

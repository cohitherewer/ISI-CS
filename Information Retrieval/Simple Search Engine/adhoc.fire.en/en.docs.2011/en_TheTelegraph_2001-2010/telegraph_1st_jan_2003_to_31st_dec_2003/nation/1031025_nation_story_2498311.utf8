		 Saturday, October 25, 2003 				 Another CBI quiz for Madhumani
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 24: The CBI will grill former minister Amarmani Tripathis wife again next week after the latest session on Wednesday proved futile.																								We will question her again after Diwali since she did not reveal anything substantial during questioning, a bureau source said.																								On Wednesday, she stonewalled sleuths attempts to get her side of the story in the Madhumita Shukla murder case. She kept saying Im not keeping well when questioned at her home in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.																								Amarmani was arrested after the DNA fingerprint of his blood sample matched that of the foetus extracted from the murdered Hindi poet. 																								During an earlier questioning session, Madhumani had said she was unaware of the relations between her husband and Madhumita as she was an uneducated village girl.																								Madhumanis suspected role in the murder is under investigation as she was earlier accused by the poets family of instigating the plot.																								CBI sources suspect she is aware of the identities of the two assassins who shot Madhumita dead at her Paper Mill home in Lucknow on May 9. 																								The bureau is clueless about the killers whereabouts though it has already prepared their portraits.

		 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Hi-tech link for paperless stamps
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: The government will soon introduce a pilot project to dematerialise  where no physical transaction is involved  stamp papers using a computer-based system that will link all states.																								Finance secretary D.C. Gupta will call a meeting of state governments next week to work out the details of the paperless system. 																								The finance ministry wants all states to have a computer-based secure set-up that will be nationally networked. 																								Stamp papers are used to record transactions ranging from affidavits and bequests to sale and mortgage of property and financial assets. 																								The move to dematerialise them and record them digitally will ensure not only safety from any future stamp paper scams but also secure citizens from fraudulent property deals, and misappropriation of inheritances. Cases related to such offences are currently clogging the law courts and we feel that a demat-based set-up would help all concerned, said top officials.																								The fake stamp paper scandal rocking the country forms the backdrop to the effort.																								Finance minister Jaswant Singh has been having a tough time trying to staunch the scandal, dubbed the Telgi scam after Abdul Karim Telgi, the mastermind who ran almost a nationwide a racket worth several thousand crores.																								Telgi had faked stamp paper in connivance with senior police and government officials and possibly politicians as well. Over Rs 3,000-crore worth of fake stamp paper has been seized and another Rs 30,000 crore is believed to be in the market.																								The home ministry will hold a review meeting of all central agencies involved in the probe to coordinate efforts to unravel the full implications of the scam. The Centre as well as states had knowledge of the scam from 1999 onwards but have started taking action only now. 																								Singh, who faced a torrid time in Parliament over the scam, today promised to amend the Stamp Act and called on states to share their probe findings with central agencies.																								While the BJP wants to prove the complicity of Congress politicians in Maharashtra in the case, Congress leaders would like the probe to focus on how Delhi allowed junking of almost-new stamp paper printing machinery at its Nashik press which were then snapped up by Telgi and misused.																								The ministry knows it has made two blunders which could still land it in a political soup  first, by selling machines which were in mint condition and, second, by allowing them to be carted away without being scrapped properly. 																								To be fair to Singh, the event took place during Yashwant Sinhas tenure. Soon after Singh took charge, he did purge the currency and coinage division in his ministry, which oversees security presses, by transferring many officers.

		 Saturday, June 28, 2003 				 CBI turns to video conferencing
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 27: For the first time, the CBI today recorded the statement of an eyewitness based in the US through video conferencing.																								American Tom Vorgitchs statement was recorded in a criminal case filed in August 2002, on the basis of a complaint lodged by Mumbai-based Geometric Software Solutions Company Ltd.																								The company had alleged that a former employee, Shekhar Verma, who was tasked to debug its Solid Works Source Code had illegally leaked the code to a company, Solid Concepts. Vorgitch is an employee of the US company.																								The CBI decide to record Vorgitchs statement to avoid bureaucratic hassle and the time-consuming process of getting a foreign national to fly to India and depose before the court. 																								Vorgitch was first examined by a metropolitan magistrate through video conference and then his statement was recorded. 																								This entire process, which started at nine this morning was successfully completed in less than three hours, the CBI claimed in its press release.																								The witness went live from the office of Dassault Systems of America Corp. in California. 																								The CBI claimed that the Supreme Court guidelines on recording statements of witnesses were adhered to even while adopting the innovative technique.																								Vinod Kumar, a diplomat posted at the Indian Consulate at San Francisco, USA, was present along with the witness to ensure that there was no other person present in the room while evidence was being recorded, the CBI claimed.

 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Vajpayee governments legislative proposals on reservations for the poor among the upper castes, cow slaughter and enhanced powers for the Delhi government have triggered a flurry of consultations in the Congress.																								Aware that the issues will have a bearing on the coming poll battle in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, Sonia Gandhi held an emergency meeting of the partys political affairs committee.																								Sources said the political objective of the party would be to emphasise that on two of the three issues, the initiative had actually been taken by the Congress.																								The sources said the Sheila Dikshit-led Delhi government had adopted a resolution in the Assembly pressing for full statehood for Delhi quite some time ago. Then two months ago, it was the Congress government in Rajasthan that adopted a cabinet resolution for 14 per cent reservation for the economically backward.																								Even so, the party seems not inclined to declare its support in advance for the statehood bill. For one, they (the Centre) have not even consulted the chief minister. So, how do we know what is there in the bill? Let the bill be introduced and we will then take a view on it, said a senior party leader.																								On the quota issue, too, the leadership is not in a hurry to endorse the Prime Ministers offer to amend the Constitution. We have asked for 14 per cent. Let us see what the government wants to do with the proposal of the Ashok Gehlot government, the leader said.																								On the cow slaughter bill, the main Opposition party is not inclined to extend support.

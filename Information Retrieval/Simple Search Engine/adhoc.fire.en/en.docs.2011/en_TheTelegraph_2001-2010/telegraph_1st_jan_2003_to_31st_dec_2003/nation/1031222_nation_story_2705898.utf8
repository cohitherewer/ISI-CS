The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Literacy kick from Karate Girl
 K.C. PHILIP				 	 Lalita with her mother Sarupia Devi in front of their hut. A Telegraph picture																								Sitamarhi, Dec. 21: When Lalita returned on Friday, hundreds of villagers gathered to receive her, garlands in their hands, songs and slogans on their lips. 																								Aadhee roti khayenge, phir bhi padne jayenge (We will study even if we get only half a chapati to eat).																								It was merely a slogan in official papers until Lalita brought it to life with her own life as she stealthily attended a non-formal education centre in her village, defying the scolding and the beating she received within her own family.																								Today, as Lalita says, I want to complete at least matriculation and declares that she wont marry until her studies are over, her parents nod in silent agreement.																								Her father Bhadohi Manjhi wants her to become a district magistrate or a superintendent of police. Lalita, however, is determined to be a teacher.																								After Unicef put her face on the cover of its latest State of the Worlds Children report, released earlier this month, it is tough for anyone  almost anyone  in this north Bihar village of Kopraha near the Nepal border to deny her consent.																								The welcoming party, as she came back from Delhi where she had gone to be present at the release of the report and to be held up as a model, consisted of people from all castes  a few even from the upper castes who would normally not allow the shadow of a Musahar, the untouchable community of Dalits Lalita belongs to.																								Outcaste as a pig-rearing, rat-eating people, the Musahars are almost all landless with an illiteracy rate of 98 per cent. Their women are nearly all illiterate, until Lalita came along.																								On Friday, they sang paeans to the 18-year-old Karate Girl  how she had brought glory to the village, helped by the didis of Mahila Samakhya, a non-government organisation running non-formal education and awakening programmes for girls and women.																								Lalita learned karate as part of the assertion of her person and now teaches the art at non-formal education centres even as she herself  a student of class VI  studies to complete her schooling.																								At the village jagjagi (awakening) centre where she studies, Kanti Devi  who is called saheli, a teacher  recalled how even a couple of years ago when Lalita would sneak in to attend classes, she would bring with her two or three girls.																								Now, she is drawing multitudes. You open any number of centres here, you will get enough children, Kanti Devi said.																								Ten-year-old Rinku has been watching with interest the crowds swirling around Lalita. Hum bhi padenge, she said.																								Normally, motivating the Musahar children to go to school is a hard task. They prefer wandering around to sitting and learning the alphabet, said Manju Devi, the coordinator of 10 centres in the area.																								But what bothers her more is how to manage the sudden rise in demand for new admissions in her centres. Every girl here now wants to become another Lalita, said Sangeeta, the coordinator of Mahila Samakhya in Sitamarhi district.																								In the Musahar hamlet of Kopraha, Lalita is the only literate woman. Barely half a dozen men have attended primary school. Lalitas parents, four brothers and two sisters earn their bread by doing seasonal cultivation jobs. As a small girl Lalita remembers how she accompanied her parents to paddy plantations and other odd jobs for five kg of rice as wage. 																								Earlier, women got a wage much less than men. Now with the coming of womens self-help groups formed by the didis, we get the same as men, said Lalitas mother Sarupia Devi.																								Thanks to her daughters new-found fame, Sarupia Devi will soon get a house that has been offered by the mukhia, the village headman, under the Indira Awas Yojana.																								Bipin Mandal is among those who did not turn up to felicitate Lalita. She had to call on him.																								For someone who has not stepped into the Musahara hamlet, though he has been headman for 24 years, the gesture was evidence of an eagerness to have a piece of the action Lalita had suddenly brought.																								It bothers Sangeeta. Certain politicians and parties are trying to use Lalita for their own interests. Till today, no one thought about us, now everyone wants a share of the cake. 																								Lalitas house now resembles the centre of a mela as villagers pour in for a darshan of their beti. Confident in demeanour and strong in body  she is eyeing the karate black belt  she has to bend to enter it through the three-foot opening. 																								The daily contortion for her and for her family should stop once they get the promised house.																								What about the other 59 families in my hamlet, wont they get a house, too? Lalita asked the mukhia when he made the offer.																								He did not answer.

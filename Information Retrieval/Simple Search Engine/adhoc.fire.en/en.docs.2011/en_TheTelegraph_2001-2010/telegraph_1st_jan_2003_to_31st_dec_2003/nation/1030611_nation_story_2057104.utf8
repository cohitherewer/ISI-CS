 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mohammad Shahbuddin																								Patna, June 10: Till a few years ago, he used to be a terror. Today, Mohammad Shahbuddin is a terrified man.																								The dreaded-don-turned-Rashtriya Janata Dal MP from Siwan believes his life is in danger from his own party and from the director general of police, D.P. Ojha.																								In a letter to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Shahbuddin said he feared police would kill him one day. To prove his point, he said the police raided his farm in Siwan and ransacked it while searching for him. Although they did not find me, they damaged property of my farmhouse, he wrote.																								The Presidents office sent the letter to the Union home ministry, which got in touch with the Bihar home secretary asking him to take action and report back. Ojha has refused to comment on the MPs allegation.																								Although DIG police (provision) Rituraj confirmed that the police had received reports from the Union home ministry, he, too, declined to comment on the fears of the MP.																								He, however, said all the police actions against all criminals would continue, but would not say if Shahbuddin came under the category of these criminals.																								As for the former don, he seems to have decided to lie low for a while. Calls to his mobile informed that he is out of the country.																								Shahbuddins allegation against the state police chief is believed to be a fallout of his soured relations with RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								The former chief minister had refused to help when his MP from Siwan demanded withdrawal of the Special Task Force from his constituency. He also reportedly ignored suggestions from Shahbuddin not to appoint Ojha director general.																								Shahbuddins allegations, his letter to the President and the Union home ministrys response have triggered speculation that he might be preparing the ground to quit the RJD.

		 Monday, May 05, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																India brings Russia ships across Suez Moscow (AFP): Russian warships passed  through the Suez Canal for the first time in 15 years to  take part in exercises with the Indian Navy in the Indian  Ocean, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in the Ukrainian  resort of Yalta.				 																																																	Putin met the commander of Russias Black Sea fleet, Vladimir Massorin, in Yalta, the Interfax news agency reported.				 																																																	Russian ships from the Black Sea fleet, based in Sebastapol in southern Ukraine, have reached the Indian Ocean to join those of the Pacific fleet based in Vladivostock for planned manoeuvres with the Indian Navy.				 																																																	The Russian Navy has suffered from poor funding since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and its long-range operations, such as those carried out during the Cold War, have been curtailed.				 																																																	The manoeuvres, which were announced in April, will be Indias first joint naval exercises with Russia.				 																																																	Despite years of robust defence ties  more than 70 per cent of the Indian Army, Air Force and Navy equipment is of Russian origin  the two Cold War allies have not held naval exercises before.				 																Dust haze cripples Rajasthan Jaipur (PTI): Dust haze continued to  disrupt normal life and vehicular traffic on the third day  on Sunday in Rajasthan even as the mercury plummeted by  3-5 degrees Celsius in the state, the weather office said.				 																																																	Due to weakening of winds that caused whirlwinds on Friday, the dust haze got suspended in the atmosphere, lowering visibility, the Met office said. There will be no respite from the winds in the next 24 hours, it added.				 																																																	The suspended dust particles will be cleared only by fresh strong winds or rain in a day or so, the weatherman said.				 																																																	The storm led to a fall in the maximum temperature from 45 to 39 degrees Celsius.				 																																																	In western Rajasthan, water scarcity and poor power supply worsened the situation. The worst-affected districts were Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Churu, Bikaner, Nagaur, Sikar and Phalodi.				 																																																	This is probably the first time in recent years that dust haze has affected normal life in eastern and southern Rajasthan, the Met office said.

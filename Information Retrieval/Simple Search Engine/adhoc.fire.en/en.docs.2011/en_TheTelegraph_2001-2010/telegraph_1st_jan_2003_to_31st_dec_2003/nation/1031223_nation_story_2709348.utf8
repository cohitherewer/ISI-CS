		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Army vacates Red Fort
																								New Delhi, Dec. 22 (PTI): Defence minister George Fernandes today gave complete possession of the Red Fort complex to the Archaeological Survey Of India and the tourism ministry.																								The Red Fort will now be developed into a world heritage site and opened up for tourists, 56 years after the army occupied it.																								Marking the occasion, Fernandes presented a memento inscribed with the picture of the Red Fort to tourism and culture minister Jagmohan.																								Unveiling the ceremonial plaque at Lahore Gate, Fernandes said the army has spent a long time in the fort and it is now time for the Lal Qila to be opened up for tourists.																								The armed forces have been here since Independence. The history of the armed forces is interlinked with the fort. Now it is time to show to the world an aspect of our history and heritage, he said. 																								It was another rite of passage for the fort, built by Mughal emperor Shahjahan as a royal residence within his capital Shahjahanabad, and later a symbol and seat of power for the British empire in India. After Independence, the British army which had occupied the fort since 1858 handed it over to the Indian Army, whose units stayed in the military garrison. 																								The defence ministers words were reminiscent of the writing on the plaque, which said: The Indian Army vacated this monument for reviving its old glory and presenting it as an epitome of rich Indian architecture and history.																								Jagmohan thanked Fernandes for his clarity of vision, decisiveness and capacity to get things done, which made it possible for the tourism ministry to be given possession of the fort.																								It was not an easy decision to leave for the armed forces, as it has developed a love affair with the fort, having spent so many years here. I thank the defence minister and the army for making the decision, he said.																								We would now be taking various measures for full restoration, conservation and environmental upgradation of the entire Red Fort complex and to move Unesco for its inclusion in the list of world heritage sites, a decision, which was deferred, he said.																								Asked how the armed forces felt about leaving the fort, Army Chief Gen. .C. Vij said: The nations cause comes first. I think it is a fair cause.																								He said Delhi lieutenant governor Vijay Kapoor has offered some land in Dwarka for accommodating the army units moving out of the Red Fort.																								The handing over ceremony was simple yet elegant. 																								Fernandes inspected a guard of honour by the Sikh Light Infantry before accompanying Jagmohan to Lahore Gate to unveil the plaque.

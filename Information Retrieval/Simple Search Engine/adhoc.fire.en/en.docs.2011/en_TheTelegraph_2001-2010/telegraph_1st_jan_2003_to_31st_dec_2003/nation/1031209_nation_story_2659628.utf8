		 Tuesday, December 09, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Soldier guns down two colleagues				 																																																	Jammu: A soldier on Sunday shot his two colleagues dead at an army camp in Kathua district before shooting himself in an incident that recalled a similar shootout in Srinagar in June, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										Lance Naik Jagtar Singh of 167 Field Regiment, posted in Janglote, south of Jammu, picked up his gun after a heated argument with colleagues. He showered bullets on Havildar Romesh Kumar and Havildar Jeet Singh, both of whom died on the spot. Havildar Baldev Singh was critically wounded.				 																																																										Later, Jagtar shot himself. He has been shifted to an army hospital at Pathankote along with Baldev. 				 																																																										The reason was not known. A court of inquiry has been instituted and an FIR registered.				 																																																										Sources said the tension of serving in a counter-insurgency environment has affected the troops deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. The soldiers often give vent to their feelings by entering into arguments that sometimes end in shootouts, they added. Officers are often the target when they refuse leave to subordinates, the sources said. 				 																																																										It would be a little premature to state that the havildar ran amok because of pressures of duty, an army spokesperson said in Delhi on Monday. We try to ensure that soldiers in a counter-insurgency environment get adequate leave. Troops are supposed to be rotated every three months. 				 																																																										In June, a CRPF constable had gone berserk at his battalion headquarters at the indoor stadium and killed two colleagues.				 																Indians safe, say Taliban Kandahar (Reuters): A Taliban official  has said two Indians kidnapped on Saturday while working  on a US-funded road project were alive and well, adding  that demands would be made later for their release.				 																																																										Mullah Roazi Khan, who the government says was behind the abduction of a Turkish engineer on the same project in October, phoned Reuters to say the men were being held by guerrillas linked to the Talibans former defence minister Mullah Obaidullah. The group, which holds the two Indians, will announce their aims at a later stage, he said. As far as I know they are safe and in good condition.				 																																																										The duo, identified by the Indian embassy as Murali, a soil sampler, and Vardharai, a foreman, were abducted in Zabul. An official said it had heard no word from the kidnappers. There has been no contact at all.

		 Friday, October 24, 2003 				 Panel in Jammu camp debut
 BINOO JOSHI																								Jammu, Oct. 23: A team from the National Commission for Minorities visited Kashmiri Hindu camps here for the first time today and promised to restore the displaced to their homes with dignity and honour.																								The four-member National Minority Commission on Rehabilitation of Kashmiri Migrants, headed by former chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir Moosa Raza, visited migrant camps at Muthi where it saw how families were squeezed into one-room tenements and were living in pitiable conditions.																								Raza said Muslims in the rest of India shared their anguish and the panel would do everything possible to ensure that the migrants get their rightful place.																								The other members of the delegation  Maulana Shafi Moonis, vice-president, Jamait-i-Islami Hind, Qasim Rasool from the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and Dr Hamid, of the Movement for Empowerment of Muslim Indians  echoed Raza.																								You dont feel that you are alone, we all are with you in this hour of trial and tribulations, the Jamait-i-Islami Hind leader told the migrant leaders.																								It is the right of Kashmiri Pundits to be in Kashmir and at the same time it is also the responsibility of Kashmiri Muslims to ensure safe and dignified return of Kashmiri Pundits to the Valley, the committee said.																								The delegation said Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India and that the Constitution assured everybody equal rights and privileges.																								The members said their mission was at the behest of the chairman of the commission and they would carry the message of the Kashmiri Pundits to the Muslim leadership in Kashmir.

		 Thursday, October 16, 2003 				 Mayavati stokes Godhra fears
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct.15: Mayavati has accused the BJP of planning another Godhra-like carnage with an eye on the coming elections, adding that the outfit has struck a deal with the Samajwadi Party over the Ayodhya march. 																								The Bahujan Samaj Party chief has alleged that the two parties are working to split society along religious lines in order to reap political benefits.																								Mayavati said the VHP, which had unleashed a media blitz over its proposed Ayodhya march a month ago, must have worked in tandem with the BJP, which announced dates for Assembly elections in four northern states on October 6.																								Why did Mulayam Singh Yadav allow such a large number of kar sevaks to assemble at Ayodhya in the first place? The trains were stopped for one day and again allowed to run. I hope they will not create a Godhra-type situation to take political advantage in the five states going to polls, the BSP president said. 																								She said the BJP had won the 2002 Gujarat elections soon after the communal carnage earlier that year.																								This betrays the secret understanding between the Samajwadi Party and the BJP, Mayavati said. 																								She appealed to chief minister Mulayam Singh to seal the Uttar Pradesh border and search all trains entering the state thoroughly to avoid a repeat of Godhra, in which kar sevaks returning by train from Ayodhya were set aflame by a mob.																								Mayavati alleged that Mondays Muslim-Dalit clashes in Agra in which two Dalits were killed was part of the BJP-Samajwadi plan to drive a wedge between the two communities. A Muslim BSP legislator, who had defected to the Samajwadi and was made a minister by Mulayam Singh, was heckled by Dalits, sparking the attack by Muslims.																								The BSP chief slammed Mulayam Singh and the BJP, saying the Ayodhya drama and attacks on Dalits were part of a hidden BJP agenda to create communal tension with an eye on the coming elections.

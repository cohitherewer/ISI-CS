		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Love story push to crossover
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA (Top) Actress Pooja  Bhatt at a news conference in Karachi on December 17.  Urmila Matondkar at a news conference in Lahore on December  10. (AFP) 																								Mumbai, Dec. 22: Bollywood is closely tracking Vajpayee and Musharraf these days and Shashilal Nair is a worried man.																								I wanted to release the film Ladki Panjaban before the Saarc summit, says Nair, who recently shot into the headlines with his film Ek Chhotisi Love Story.																								But with so many big films releasing, I couldnt. Now I want to release it before January 26. It will release in India first, then abroad and then in Pakistan. This is the first time a love story between an Indian girl and a Pakistani boy has been shown without any apology, adds Nair, who is distributing the film.																								With the two Prime Ministers behaving civilly, if only for the time being, Bollywood is hoping for an entry into Pakistan  a huge hub of pirated Hindi film VCDs  because the country does not allow Indian films for public screening.																								The theme is ready, too: cross-border romance. Watch me. I am the first one to come up with such a love story. Others will follow me, warns Nair.																								I dont beat around the bush, says Nair. The girl and the boy know from the very first that they belong to different religions. The girl, who is from Chandigarh, goes over to Lahore with her family when they are invited by their family friends across the border, he adds.																								Its not like in Heena, where a Hindu man (played by Rishi Kapoor) marries a Muslim girl Heena, while he is suffering from amnesia; or in Refugee, where the roots of the character played by Abhishek Bachchan are not clearly specified, Nair implies.																								For the time being, he is happy re-routing an Indian film to Pakistan through the UK. Nairs firm Paragon Pictures will distribute Ladki Panjaban, which is produced by a UK-based company and features newcomers from Pakistan and the UK.																								The UK production company will help Nair get around the bar on Indian films in Pakistan, though the film remains a typical Indian potboiler in every way.																								He says more films like Ladki Panjaban are needed because of the demand in Pakistan. They get to see our films before us. On Wednesdays, friends from Pakistan call and tell me they have watched a new film, because the pirated stuff is routed through the Middle East where the prints are sent a week before release, says Nair.																								But there is talk of a common currency between India and Pakistan. People are already meeting to ease trade terms. How can films be left behind? He claims that the process has already begun. Mahesh Bhatt and Pooja Bhatt are already in Karachi with their films, he says.																								The feeling is echoed by ad man Prahlad Kakkar, who recently shot a video with Urmila Matondkar in Lahore on being invited by the United Nations Development Programme.																								Theres a huge market out there, he says. Pakistan loses about Rs 1,000 crore in revenue and India about Rs 500 crore because of the piracy there. Hindi films are much bigger there than they are here. When Urmila was invited to a private dinner party for 40 in Lahore, people gatecrashed and it became a mela of 400, he says.																								Kakkar doesnt believe that Bollywood will get an easy entry into the theatres, but he also feels that a real exchange between the two countries has started on the basis of films and its natural for producers to look at the commercial potential.																								He, too, points at the ongoing Karachi Film Festival, which is being attended by Mahesh and Pooja. The festival, Kara in short, is in its third year and is meant to be a shot-in-the-arm for independent filmmakers in Pakistan who were crushed under Zia-ul-Haqs regime and are yet to revive. But Kara is crawling at the moment with representatives from mainstream Hindi cinema, with a sprinkling from the parallel.																								The Bhatts have taken two of their films  Paap and Zakhm. While its surely goodwill, and the films are not for public viewing, they are not exactly art-house cinema and would whet the appetite for Bollywood further.																								Nagesh Kukoonoors Teen Deewarein and two crossover films, Leela and Lets Talk, also feature among the 15-odd films that are being shown at Kara.

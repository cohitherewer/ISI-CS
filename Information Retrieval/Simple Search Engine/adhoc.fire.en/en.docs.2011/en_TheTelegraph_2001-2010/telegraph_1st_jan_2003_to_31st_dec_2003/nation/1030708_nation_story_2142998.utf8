 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 7: Barbara Taylor Bradfords counsel today concluded his arguments in his appeal to stay the telecast of Karishma  The Miracles of Destiny.																								Sahara counsel Siddhartha Shankar Ray commenced his reply on the date that had held out a glimmer of hope for the channel and its viewers.																								A Calcutta High Court division bench of Justices A.. Ray and J. Banerjee is hearing the appeal against Justice M.H.S. Ansaris June 30 ruling in the copyright infringement case that vacated the stay order and allowed Sahara Manoranjan to air the show from July 7. The division bench on July 3 extended the operation of the order till the case is dismissed or fresh affidavits are called for, whichever is earlier.																								Bradfords counsel, P.C. Sen, has been pleading before the division bench since July 3 for a further injunction staying telecast, arguing that an injunction is necessary to fully protect the writers intellectual property. 																								The Sahara counsel today commenced with the channels reply, questioning Bradfords conduct, that included suppression of material fact. Pammi Somal, the film journalist whose interview of Akashdeep Sabir, producer of Karishma, is now at the centre of Bradfords case, interviewed with a particular purpose, said Ray. The hearing will continue tomorrow.																								Manhattan-based Bradford slapped the channel with a lawsuit in May, accusing the producers of plagiarising her works, including A Woman of Substance, in the blockbuster starring Karisma Kapoor. 																								The serial premiered on May 12, only to be taken off air after the first episode following a Supreme Court stay order. 																								After the apex court sent the case back to Calcutta, Justice Ansari, despite finding a prima facie case of infringement, had ruled that the balance of convenience tilted in Saharas favour, as the channel had much to lose with the show indefinitely put on hold. 																								While keeping alive Bradfords hopes for damages, he had given the green signal for broadcast from July 7.

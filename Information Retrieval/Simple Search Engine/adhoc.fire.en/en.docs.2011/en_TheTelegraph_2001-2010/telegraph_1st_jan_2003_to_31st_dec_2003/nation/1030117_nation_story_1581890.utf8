		 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 BJP finds Pak terror link proof
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 16: The BJP has alleged an unholy alliance between the Pakistan government and the al Qaida and cited a report of the Pakistans auditor general as proof that the al Qaida is utilising lakhs of dollars deposited by non-resident Pakistanis in various relief funds of the Pakistan government.																								The auditor generals revelation, the BJP said, was ample and adequate proof for Pakistan to be branded and declared a terrorist country a long-standing demand of the party.																								Briefing reporters, BJP general secretary and spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: While making sensational disclosures of missing lakhs of dollars gifted to various government relief funds by non-resident Pakistanis, Pakistans auditor general has himself indicated that the money could have been misused by various terrorist organisations, including the al Qaida, which is a matter of serious concern to the entire world.																								Naqvi alleged that terrorist organisations like the al Qaida and the Jaish-e-Mohammad are thriving on Pakistans money to spread terror the world over. 																								He warned countries helping Pakistan financially that if they do not open their eyes to this glaring truth, then the common global war against terrorism shall not reach its logical end.																								However, the BJP spokesman was tight-lipped when asked to name the countries, saying: Everybody knows who they are. Asked if the US was Pakistans benefactor, Naqvi said: Everybody knows the US is helping them.																								He noted that the most important aspect of the auditor generals report was that over 20,000 blank passport copies were found missing from various Pakistani embassies and high commissions. 																								This, Naqvi claimed, goes to indicate that the Pakistan government and the ISI are trying to legitimise terrorist activities throughout the world.																								On the domestic front, the BJP general secretary said, the reactivation of pro-Pakistan terrorist outfits in Jammu and Kashmir  which forced women to don the burqa and issued an edict asking Hindu doctors to leave - reflected the soft policy of the Congress-Peoples Democratic Party government and their move not to use the anti-terrorism law.																								However, asked whether the BJP could produce corresponding figures of terrorist attacks and killings in the Valley from October to December in 2001 and 2002, when the National Conference was in power, Naqvi was silent.

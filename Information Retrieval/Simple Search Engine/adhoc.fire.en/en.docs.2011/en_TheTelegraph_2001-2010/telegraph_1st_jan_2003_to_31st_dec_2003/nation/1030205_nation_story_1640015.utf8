It landed at Sahar International Airport here at 6.11 pm.																								The plane was flying on the N-519 route segment that is not open between 6 am and 6 pm.																								Airport director Sunil Kumar said an Intelligence Bureau team from the Centre interrogated the 11-member crew of the commercial plane.																								According to airport authorities, the intelligence officials questioned Captain John Burg and his crew from morning.																								The plane, still at Sahar, will be allowed to leave as soon as it gets clearance from the directorate-general of civil aviation, Kumar said.

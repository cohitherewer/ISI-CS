		 Saturday, August 30, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Insat signal saves 28 sailors Bangalore(PTI): An Indian satellite has  helped save 28 people by detecting distress signals from  a Chinese cargo vessel, MV Yujiya, which sank in  the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Space Research Organisation  said on Friday.				 																																																										Isro said rescue authorities of the Indian Coast Guard were alerted by the space organisations mission control centre here soon after the distress signals were detected by the satellite-aided search and rescue transponder on board the Insat-3a spacecraft and all the 28 sailors were rescued.				 																																																										The incident occurred on August 11, Isro said in a statement and added that the centre was part of the international Cospass-Sarsat satellite-aided search and rescue programme.				 																																																										Insat-3a, launched on April 10, 2003, carries a search and rescue transponder, which keeps a constant vigil over the Indian Ocean region, complementing the Cospass-Sarsat satellites, to detect distress signals from beacons carried by maritime, aviation and land users.				 																																																										The satellites transmit the distress signals to the local user terminals established by Isro at Bangalore and Lucknow. The alert signals are then passed onto search and rescue coordination centres at Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Delhi along with location information.				 																																																										On July 24, it detected a distress signal from a Panama cargo vessel, MV Jubilee, which was sinking in the Bay of Bengal, and all the 21 crew members were rescued, Isro said. 				 																Chameli director dies at 41 Mumbai: Two days after Kareena Kapoor  posed for the cameras following the first shots for Chameli,  where she plays a prostitute, Bollywood has lost the filmmaker.

Balani, industry sources said, was a promising director. Though surprising for a filmmaker in Bollywood, the 41-year-old Balani was travelling in an autorickshaw when he suffered the attack. He was rushed to Nanavati Hospital, where he died a while later.				 																																																										The death shook up Bollywood. He was directing Kareena in a role that not only needed a lot of gumption but was also risky for the actress and the director. This was one movie many people were looking forward to, said a senior member of the production unit.				 																																																										Rangita Pritish Nandy, the producer, said she was dumbfounded with the news. Just the other day, he was shooting for Chameli with Kareena and on Thursday night we heard he was no more.

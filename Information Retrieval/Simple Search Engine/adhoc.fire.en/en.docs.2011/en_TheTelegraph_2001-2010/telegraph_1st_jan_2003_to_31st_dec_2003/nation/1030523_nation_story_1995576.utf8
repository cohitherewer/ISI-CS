 ANAND SOONDAS			Aamir KhanMumbai, May 22: The Mumbai policeman who has written about sex, sleaze and corruption in the police force in his novel, Carnage of Angels, is planning to turn the book into a film.																								Talks are on. There are about six producers who are interested in the film but I have to be convinced about the cinematic treatment, said Yogesh Pratap Singh. 																								The IPS officer, who was banished to the state reserve police as a commandant, wants Aamir Khan and Lagaan director Ashutosh Gowarikar to work on the film. Its not because I want the ingredients for a blockbuster, he said. My story is governed by a certain ideological fervour, an intense message for the country that I think Aamir can deliver. Its about who I think can do justice to my story because its not about a film, its about the rot that has engulfed us, something that threatens to inundate our lives and distort our integrity.																								Neither Aamir nor Gowarikar was available for comment.																								The films proceeds will be used to start a non-government organisation to fight corruption, the officer said. 																								Singh said he was an assistant inspector-general at the police headquarters here before he decided to expose corruption in the police force. I fought against Kapil Sibal in the Supreme Court when the Maharashtra government wanted to transfer me to Nagpur and send me on a years unpaid leave. In January 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that I be paid for the forced absence. I have been fighting ever since I joined the police force. 																								The officer said he draws a salary less than his juniors. 																								Even my current posting at the reserve police is illegal  this is not a post for an IPS officer and it is not meant to be permanent. I have been here almost six years now.																								Singh has just sent a hard-hitting reply to the showcause notice served on him asking why he wrote the novel. He knows his bad run is not over yet, but said: I have nothing to lose  they have killed my career and stifled my growth. Let the state government harass me all it wants, it doesnt matter any more.																								But wont Singh face another storm if his novel inspires a film? The producers approached me, he said, adding that he is interested in a film as it is for a good cause. But he will not compromise on things close to his heart. I will have to ensure that the police are projected correctly  not too harsh or too glamorous as most films tend to do.

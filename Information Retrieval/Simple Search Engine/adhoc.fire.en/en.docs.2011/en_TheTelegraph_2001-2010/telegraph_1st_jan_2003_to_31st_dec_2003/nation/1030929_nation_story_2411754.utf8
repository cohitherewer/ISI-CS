		 Monday, September 29, 2003 				 Togadia speech upsets Naqvi
																								New Delhi, Sept. 28: A day after he earned the wrath of Muslim members of the BJP over Praveen Togadias minority bashing, general secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi today distanced himself from the VHP leaders remarks, reports our special correspondent.																								Naqvi, also party spokesperson, received a delegation of BJP Muslim leaders today and said he was sad over Togadias unnecessary Muslim bashing.																								Naqvi faced the minority members anger as he had invited Togadia to the partys minority cell meeting here yesterday. The VHP leader had said: I dont like Muslims, I cannot like anyone who disputes my belief in the Ramjanmabhoomi.																								Naqvi also dubbed Togadias criticism of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee unacceptable.																								The BJPs Muslim leaders gathered at his home not only to express their shock at their guests unwarranted attack but also to register their protest with the party.																								They felt the purpose of the meeting  to kickstart another round of talks between Muslims and Hindus on the Ayodhya tangle  could have been served better without Togadias provocative speech.																								Naqvi said: Such provocative statements from either side are not going to serve any useful purpose in creating an atmosphere of trust and friendship between the two communities.

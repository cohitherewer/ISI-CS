		 Tuesday, September 30, 2003 				 Madhumita minister in four-hour truth test 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 29: Amarmani Tripathi was today subjected to a lie-detector test for nearly four hours at the CBI headquarters here.																								An expert from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory was called in from Lucknow to conduct the polygraph test from around 4 pm at the CBIs south Delhi office. The expert will hand over his report tomorrow.																								Tripathi, lodged in a cell at the headquarters, will be taken back to a Lucknow court tomorrow morning when his week-long CBI custody gets over. The bureau will seek his further custody as he has been giving vague answers during questioning.																								The former Uttar Pradesh minister had been apprehensive about undergoing the test though his lawyers, Rishi Pandey and Gaurav Mishra, were advising him to take it. He finally agreed today, realising his refusal could go against him in court. The lawyers confirmed the lie-detector test.																								According to Mishra, Tripathi was questioned from 9 am to 1 pm. Later, a doctor examined his physical fitness for the polygraph test. His lawyers said that CBI sleuths also took his fingerprints and a sample of his handwriting.																								For the polygraph test, the bureau provided the forensic expert information to help him with the questioning.																								Experts usually prepare their own set of questions on the basis of the material available. The accused is asked a mix of routine and complex questions to trace issues that make him uncomfortable. Certain questions are repeated at regular intervals to find if the accused is hiding something or not.																								During the test, electrodes are attached to the chest and hands of the accused. These help monitor blood-pressure fluctuation and breathlessness when an accused lies, forensic experts said. CBI officials believe it is rare for an accused to conceal body language.																								The information the CBI provided for questioning during the lie-detector test included those on Tripathis relationship with murdered poet Madhumita Shukla, his alleged attempts to tamper with evidence, whether he knew the two assailants and his alleged hand in the murder.

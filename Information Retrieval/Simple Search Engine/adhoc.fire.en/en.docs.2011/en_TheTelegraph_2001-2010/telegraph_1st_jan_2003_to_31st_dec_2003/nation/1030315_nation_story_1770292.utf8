		 Saturday, March 15, 2003 				 Crude bomb scare in Delhi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 14: An alert porter averted a major tragedy today by informing Delhi police of crude bombs kept at a taxistand outside the New Delhi railway station.																								Police immediately defused the six bombs, each in a cardboard box of the size of a matchbox and tied with thread.																								According to Delhi police, at around 3.30 pm, Hirday Ram saw a polythene bag containing the bombs and informed a constable, who, in turn, informed his seniors.																								The bomb disposal squad and the special cell were immediately pressed into action and the area was cordoned off. Officers of the special cell said each box contained a mixture of aluminium and silver powder and a few pieces of nails.																								These bombs have high sound value, equivalent to that of an RDX bomb, but result in minimum casualty. Though no gelatine was found in the bag, the police said the explosives are ignited through heat.																								Police officials suspect that those who planted the bombs could have ignited them two hours later when a tazia procession was to pass through the Paharganj area, where the New Delhi railway stations entry point is located.																								The police have increased vigil at other railway stations in Old Delhi and Nizamuddin areas in south Delhi following the incident. The Childrens Park near the India Gate has been closed for public and quick reaction teams have been deployed there.																								Ram has been awarded Rs 500 for showing alertness.

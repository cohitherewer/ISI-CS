		 Wednesday, May 07, 2003 				 Jaya blasted on protocol
																								Chennai, May 6 (PTI): Joining issue with Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa on the question of seating arrangements during Atal Bihari Vajpayees airport function here on Sunday, the DMK today said that as per protocol only Union ministers and Governors would be seated on either side of the Prime Minister, if it was a Central government function.																								If the function was state-sponsored, chief ministers and respective Governors would be seated on either side of the Prime Minister, former chief minister and DMK chief M. karunanidhi said in a statement here.																								If she is so much bothered about protocol, why was the first row allotted to people unconnected with the event, when she was sworn in as chief minister, and the leader of Opposition given a seat in the 40th row? 																								On her statement that the Centre had not acceded to her request to name the new airport terminal after late M.G. Ramachandran (her mentor), Karunanidhi said when a film city was established during her previous rule, the film industry wanted it to be named after MGR but she named it after herself. This shows her affection and respect for MGR, he said.																								 People have not forgotten her letter to late prime minister, rajiv gandhi, that mgr was jealous of her rising popularity, karunanidhi said. Pti sv bn aps 05062010 d

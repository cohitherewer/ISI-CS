		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Varsity high honour for Laloo
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Laloo Prasad Yadav Patna, Dec. 21: Laloo Prasad  Yadav is yet to find a cure for the strained relations between  his partys government and the state judiciary, but he will  soon have a Dr before his name, courtesy Patna University.																								The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief was chosen for an honorary Ph D by the universitys syndicate yesterday, sparking controversy. With the syndicate members, the Patna University Teachers Association and, reportedly, vice-chancellor K.K. Jha having given the nod, the Opposition has threatened to approach the chancellor, governor M. Rama Jois.																								This is a high watermark of sycophancy, said leader of the Opposition Sushil Modi of the BJP. He added it was a shame that a chargesheeted fodder-scam accused would be awarded an honorary doctorate.																								But the Rabri Devi government was ready to welcome another Ph D-holder in the RJD ranks. The partys state chief, Abdul Bari Sidique, said: We welcome this decision of the university. This would be an honour for the poor for whom (Laloo Prasad) Yadav has been fighting for the last two decades.																								The others with a similar honour are the controversial Siwan MP, M. Shahabuddin, and Munna Shukla, an Independent MLA who is said to have several criminal cases against him. Shahabuddin was honoured by a university in Muzaffarpur late last year.																								But in all those cases, the leaders in question had laboured to obtain this. Now, here is a university which has decided, on its own, to award a degree to a controversial leader, Janata Dal (United) spokesman Lakshmi Sahu said.																								University general secretary A.. Singh, who supported the Ph D proposal, said Laloo Prasad deserved it as he has been closely associated with the universitys student politics. Syndicate members also recalled his valuable contribution to the society in Bihar, Singh added.																								Sidique went a step further and asked why not? When P.V. Narasimha Rao and Indira Gandhi were awarded the same kind of honorary degree, nobody protested. 																								According to university sources, Laloo Prasad would be bestowed the degree at the convocation on January 11. National Human Rights Commission chief A.S. Anand is scheduled to deliver the convocation address.																								The latest feather in the Bihar leaders cap would be in addition to his law degree from Patna Law College and a stint as an actor in the 1998 film Mahua, where he played a student leader.

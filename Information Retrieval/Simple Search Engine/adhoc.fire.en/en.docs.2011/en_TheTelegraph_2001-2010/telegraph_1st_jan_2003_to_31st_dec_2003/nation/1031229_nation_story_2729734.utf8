HC blow to Glaxo toothbrush New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has  declined to grant copyright protection to a design of a  toothbrush manufactured and marketed by Glaxo Smithkline  Consumer Healthcare. The design was allegedly imitated by  Hindustan Lever Ltd to promote toothbrush under the brand  name Pepsodent Cushion.				 																																																										Justice M.A. Khan, now retired, has said in an interim order that there was no prima facie case and balance of convenience in favour of Glaxo Smithkline for grant of injunction restraining HLL from marketing its toothbrush with the impugned design.				 																																																										Glaxo Smithkline had filed a suit, seeking to restrain HLL from manufacturing and selling the toothbrushes which allegedly infringed their registered design.				 																																																										However, HLL contested the suit, saying the design was not worthy of protection as it lacked novelty and prior publication mandatory under the design act. The company had also said there was no question of copying the design as it was not the manufacturer of the toothbrush and was merely a marketeer. 				 																																																										Glaxo Smithkline also did not claim proprietary rights and exclusivity in the design of bristles and the neck and a band just below the head.

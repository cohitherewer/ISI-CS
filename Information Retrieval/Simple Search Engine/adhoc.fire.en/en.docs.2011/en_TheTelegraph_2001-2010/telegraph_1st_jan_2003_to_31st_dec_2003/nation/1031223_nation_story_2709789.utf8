		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Joshi blasted for Christmas holiday shift
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 22: Murli Manohar Joshi may have been trying to help students out when he shifted winter holidays in kendriya vidyalayas from their traditional third or fourth week of December slot to January. But the human resource development ministers decision has come under fire from the Opposition and Christians.																								We have always valued the rights of minorities. This decision will hurt their sentiments, CPM member A. Vijayraghavan said in the Rajya Sabha today. Congress MPs joined him in urging a holiday rethink.																								But BJP member S.S. Ahluwalia said the holidays had been shifted to help children in northern India who have a problem commuting in the dense January fog; the shift was not aimed at any community, he said.																								The sharpest criticism came from Kerala, home to a number of Christians. Parents and teachers have protested, saying the shift disrupts their holiday plans. Parties have joined them, pointing out that Kerala has no problems with fog and hence, no change is needed. CPM MLAs in Kerala have accused the Centre of targeting Christians, with Kerala Congress (M) leader and state revenue minister K.M. Mani demanding that the holiday revert to its Christmas slot. 																								Ministry officials say Joshi, who is out of town, could reverse his decision once he reaches Delhi.

		 Saturday, February 08, 2003 				 Himachal CMs Punjab property raided
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Jalandhar, Feb. 7: Hitting back at Himachal Pradesh chief minister P.K. Dhumal for filing a criminal defamation suit against his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh for alleging that he owned property to the tune of Rs 25 crore in Punjab, the state electricity boards enforcement bureau was today ordered to conduct raids on businesses owned by Dhumals relatives in Jalandhar. 																								A special team of the enforcement bureau raided the premises of Sant Brass Engineering Works, Crescent Engineering Corporation and Punjab Pipe Fittings Company late in the afternoon, official sources said.																								The Dhumal family described the raids as politically motivated.																								Unconfirmed reports stated that the state vigilance bureau had also started conducting inquiries on properties owned by Dhumal under fictitious names.																								The charges against me are baseless and the raids prove that the Congress party is desperate to win the polls in Himachal Pradesh. This type of strong-arm tactic to defame me before the polls will not help the party. The raids will not yield anything. The people of Himachal will give a fitting reply to the Congress, Dhumal said late tonight.																								The Himachal Pradesh chief minister, who sounded unruffled at the latest turn of events, said he was prepared to face any charges the Congress in Punjab cooks up against him in the run-up to the polls. 																								The Congress move is expected to make more murky an already vitriolic campaign.

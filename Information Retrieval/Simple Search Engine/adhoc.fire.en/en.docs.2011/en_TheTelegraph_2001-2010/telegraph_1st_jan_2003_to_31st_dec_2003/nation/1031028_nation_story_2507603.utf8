																								Dhaka, Oct. 27 (PTI): Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia is confident that her countrys ties with India will become stronger in the coming days.																								Our bilateral relations would be further strengthened in future, she told outgoing Indian high commissioner Monilal Tripathy, who visited her yesterday in a farewell call.																								During the meeting at the Prime Ministers Office, Khaleda stressed that the member countries of the Saarc, a forum to boost regional cooperation among South Asian nations, should increase trade among them for the benefit of their economies.																								She urged India to see Bangladesh as a market for readymade garments, tea and leather products and said any problem between the neighbours should be resolved through discussions.																								Dhaka denied Indias charge that it was sheltering insurgents from its neighbours northeastern states. Bangladesh does not allow its soil to be used for insurgency activities against any country, foreign minister Morshed Khan said, reacting to Tripathys assertion that top insurgent leaders from the Northeast were operating from Bangladeshi soil.

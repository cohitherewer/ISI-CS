		 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Delhi team to US for hi-tech trade talks
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Dec. 17: In a move that could go a long way in strengthening Indias relations with the US, a high-level delegation left for Washington this morning to give final touches to the high-technology commerce agreement between the two sides.																								It is not clear yet whether the agreement would be signed now or on a later date at the foreign ministerial level. But indications suggest that all the loose ends on the agreement would be tightened at the forthcoming meeting between the two sides.																								Interestingly, this would be the first official delegation from India to the US after the capture of Saddam Hussein and this would also give the two sides an opportunity to discuss the impact of the latest developments in Iraq and elsewhere in the wake of the former Iraqi Presidents arrest.																								The high-technology agreement forms part of the triad of issues, which include cooperation on civilian nuclear energy and space technology between the two sides. 																								A fourth area  missile defence system  has now been added to this group.																								Deputy national security adviser Satish Chandra and other members of the Indian delegation are scheduled to hold meetings with his US counterpart Steven Hadley on Friday. Attempts would be made by both sides to remove whatever irritants were there and finalise the agreement on high-technology commerce.																								Although a number of key world players came out with statements welcoming Saddams capture by the American troops, India has so far refrained from doing so. 																								Apart from taking note of the developments and expressing hope that it would now create a situation for an early transfer of power to the Iraqi people, it has not made any official comment.																								There were indications that Indias lack of response on the developments had not gone down well with the Americans. 																								But despite the disappointment, if there was some in sections in Washington, there was nothing to show that this has become a major stumbling block in the progress of bilateral ties.																								US secretary of state Colin Powell spoke to foreign minister Yashwant Sinha a day after Saddams capture to indicate that Washington considers Delhi as one of the key allies which needed to be informed about the latest developments.																								But the high-tech trade agreement is something that the Indian establishment sees as a litmus test in Delhis ties with Washington. 																								The fact that the US has not only lifted most of the sanctions it had imposed on India after the May 1998 nuclear tests, it also shows that Washington now feels confident that it could allow India access to sophisticated and dual-use technology, even though India has not yet signed the nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and had not given any indication to show that it was willing to give up its nuclear programme. 																								The two sides have held several meetings in Delhi and Washington in the past year or so to formalise their position on the high-tech transfer.

		 Thursday, September 25, 2003 				 Mulayam sets terms for BJP
 ASHISH SINHA				 	 Mulayam Singh																								Jamshedpur, Sept. 24: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today said the Samajwadi Party was ready to do business with the BJP provided the communal outfit gave up, forever, four issues dear to it  Ayodhya, uniform civil code, abrogation of Article 370 and its wrong opinion about the minorities.																								Sounding like a diehard exponent of coalition politics, Mulayam Singh, who is here to attend his partys national executive meeting beginning tomorrow, said the Samajwadi did not consider anyone untouchable.																								We are ready to join hands with any party, including the BJP, on common issues. If the BJP dares to give up its communal agenda and comes forward for the common good of the people, why should we have any problems? It is for them to decide, he said.																								Addressing a public meeting later, Mulayam Singh said the BJP had been raking up these four contentious issues only because the party had nothing worthwhile to talk about even after heading a coalition government in Delhi for six years. 																								It is not a coincidence that whenever I become the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, the BJP starts talking about the Ram temple at Ayodhya. The fact is that a BJP-led government could come to office because of the wrong policies of the Congress, he added.																								The Samajwadi president said indecisiveness leads to death and that the Congress had become a victim of this syndrome even over the question of joining his government.																								I have extended an invitation to all supporting parties to join the Uttar Pradesh government, he said. 																								But the Congress is still undecided. This is not a good sign even from that partys point of view. I am ready to forget the past, Mulayam Singh added.

		 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 Tribunal stops MP suspension
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, March 17: Politics in Madhya Pradesh has taken a curious turn following VHP leader Acharya Dharmendras arrest and the Central Administrative Tribunals stay order on former Rewa district collector Vinod Kumars suspension, recommended by the Election Commission.																								In an interim order in Jabalpur, the tribunal today stayed implementation of the poll panels recommendation to suspend Kumar, accused of alleged irregularities in revision of voters lists.																								The tribunal issued notices to the commission, the Madhya Pradesh government and the state election office and asked them to file replies by March 31, the next date of hearing.																								Kumar, among the three collectors whose suspension had been recommended by the commission, had filed a petition before the tribunal, claiming that the poll panels order was illegal and without any merit. Twenty other officials facing the commissions wrath are likely to follow suit.																								Chief minister Digvijay Singh, who has reluctantly accepted the commissions order to suspend the district officials accused of irregularities in the revision of electoral rolls, is insisting that the commission issue a formal chargesheet. Now, with the tribunal intervening in the matter, the controversy is set to linger.																								But what caught everyone, including the Opposition BJP off guard, was the Digvijay regimes decision to book Dharmendra for making an allegedly inflammatory speech at Dewas yesterday. However, the VHPs bandh call in Dewas, Bhopal and Ujjain to protest against the arrest evoked a poor response, as the BJP stayed away.																								Dharmendra is known for making fiery and often uncharitable references to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy L.K. Advani. His arrest comes two days after Advanis visit to Bhopal, where the state BJP under Uma Bhartis leadership decided to focus on the basics  power, water, roads and bad governance  instead of experimenting with a Gujarat-like scenario.																								Several state BJP leaders, including Bharti, is credited with the view that the presence of VHP hardliners in Madhya Pradesh is proving counter-productive. The BJP, in consultation with the RSS, had decided to discourage VHP leaders like Praveen Togadia and Dharmendra from visiting the election-bound state.																								But Dharmendra, who was in Dewas in connection with the VHPs trishul (trident) distribution ceremony, was off the block before he could be stopped. Addressing a modest gathering, the VHP leader, while asking Muslims to join the national mainstream, made a few references that local Muslims claimed were offensive.

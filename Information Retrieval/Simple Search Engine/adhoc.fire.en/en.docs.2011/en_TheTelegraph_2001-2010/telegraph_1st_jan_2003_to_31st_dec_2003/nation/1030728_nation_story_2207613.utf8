 VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR																								Hazaribagh, July 27: External affairs minister Yashwant Sinha today admitted India has a border dispute with China but added that Arunachal Pradesh is an undivided part of the country. 																								Sinha, who was speaking to reporters in the circuit house here, said the controversy over China was not new. It started during the Congress regime, soon after Independence, he said.																								He said that after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit to China, both sides had decided to deploy special representatives to solve the border dispute.																								The minister said efforts were on since 1979 to solve the problem. In 1979, Vajpayee had visited China as foreign minister, and from then to now, several Indian leaders, including former Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi and P.V. Narashima Rao, had visited China. Besides, Chinese leaders have also come to India, he said. 																								Sinha, however, said progress with China regarding the border dispute was not as expected, though, after 1975, no exchange of fire was reported on the border.

																								Noida, May 16 (PTI): Uttar Pradesh police today arrested Vidya Dalal, mother of Munish, the bridegroom in the dowry demand case in Noida, even as his estranged fiancee Nisha Sharma admitted she was attracted to one of her classmates, who is still ready to marry her.																								We arrested Vidya Dalal last night from Nangloi and will proceed against her in the dowry case, Noida Sector 24 station house officer D.K. Sharma said.																								Dalal had allegedly slapped Nishas father and demanded Rs 12 lakh in cash following which the engineering student called off her wedding at the last moment on Sunday. Munishs aunt, Savitri, is still absconding. Nisha today said she had been  fully attracted to classmate Navneet Rai prior to her  engagement with Munish, a Navodaya Vidyalaya teacher.																								Rai was my classmate and we worked together on several projects at the Institute of Telecommunication and Engineering, she told reporters here.																								Nisha said she had been ready to marry him but refused when his parents allegedly demanded that he be allowed to stay with the girls family after marriage as ghar jamai.																								Rai, however, said he was ready to marry Nisha even after this incident, provided our parents agree. He also claimed to have received anonymous threats yesterday asking him to stay away from the media.																								Nishas father disclosed that he had informed the police that Rai could pose problems during the wedding and that he should be kept away.

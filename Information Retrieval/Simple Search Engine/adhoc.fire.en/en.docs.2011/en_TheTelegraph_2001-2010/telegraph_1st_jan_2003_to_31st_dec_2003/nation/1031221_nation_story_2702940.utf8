		 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 BJP on horns of dilemma
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Karunanidhi at a party meeting in Chennai. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Dec. 20: The BJP leadership is divided over whether to cosy up to the ADMK or the DMK now that the latter has pulled out of the National Democratic Alliance at the Centre and withdrawn two Union ministers.																								One section of the BJP still views the DMK as a reliable ally and thinks that political viability should not be the only criterion for choosing electoral allies. But another group, influenced by the views of its Tamil Nadu unit, feels the M. Karunanidhi-led party should be dumped and a re-alliance with Jayalalithaas ADMK considered.																								But both camps agree that a decision can wait until the Lok Sabha elections draw near, especially since the DMK has said it will continue to extend issue-based support to the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.																								Asked about the pull-out, the Prime Minister said on the sidelines of a BJP function today: There is no official word from the DMK so far.																								Sources close to Vajpayee said: There is no question of the DMK leaving the NDA. When the polls come closer, then we (the BJP) may have to think of political realignments and alliances (in Tamil Nadu). Right now there is no cause for concern.																								The pro-DMK section in the BJP says Karunanidhi pulled his party out because he did not want an internal problem which might have arisen if a successor to Murasoli Maran was to be appointed. The Prime Minister had asked the DMK chief to recommend a replacement for Maran, who died recently after a long illness, but Karunanidhi was non-committal. The section says the DMK also wanted political space to criticise the (Vajpayee) government on issues like Pota.																								BJP sources said the following factors will determine who the party should ally with:																								The ADMK is bound to be affected by anti-incumbency sentiments since it is in power. A senior BJP leader said: We have told our Tamil Nadu unit, first build an atmosphere in favour of BJP, then we can decide on our ally. The implication is that the BJP should not ruin its chances by aligning with Jayalalithaa right away and thus share the incumbency disadvantage.																								The BJP also wants to weigh the advantage of allying with a politically viable ADMK against its chief Jayalalithaas maverick ways. Few in the party have forgiven her for keeping the Vajpayee government on edge during the 13 months it was in power in 1998-99. The ADMK then withdrew support, forcing mid-term elections.

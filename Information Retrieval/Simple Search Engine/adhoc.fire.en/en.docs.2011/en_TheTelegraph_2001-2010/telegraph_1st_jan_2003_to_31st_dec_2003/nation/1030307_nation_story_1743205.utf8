The children, who lost their parents to AIDS, were admitted to the Kummanaloor lower primary government school in Kollam after being turned down by several institutions over the past two years.

But all the other 119 children stopped attending school after the brother and sister joined, for fear of contracting the HIV virus.				 																																																	At a meeting on Tuesday evening, local legislator Prathapa Varma Thampan of the ruling Congress launched a scathing attack on the childrens grandfather for sending them to school. 				 																																																	District collector Rajan Ghorbade, education secretary P. Mara Pandiyan and health officials were also present.

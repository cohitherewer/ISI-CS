		 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Rival heat on Vaghela
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, Dec. 26: The Amarsinh Chaudhary faction of the Gujarat Congress today adopted a resolution urging the high command to immediately remove Shankersinh Vaghela and instal a genuine Congress leader as state unit chief in his place.																								Sixteen MLAs and top state Congress leaders, including aspirants for Vaghelas post attended a meeting at the Gandhinagar residence of Chaudhary, the Gujarat Congress legislature party leader. Those attending the meeting included Narhari Amin, Urmilaben Patel and Shaktisinh Gohil.																								No one from the Vaghela faction was present at the meeting in which Chaudhary alleged that the state unit chief was keeping in touch with old RSS friends. He added that Vaghela could rejoin the BJP if thrown out of the Congress.																								The immediate provocation for the Chaudhary offensive was the state unit chiefs recent decision to form a Shakti Dal, comprising youths armed with a wooden stick, to counter the VHP and RSS.

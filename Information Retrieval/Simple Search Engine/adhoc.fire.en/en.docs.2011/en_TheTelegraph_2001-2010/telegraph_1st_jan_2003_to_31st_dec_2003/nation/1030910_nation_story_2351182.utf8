		 Wednesday, September 10, 2003 				 Cry to send for Advani in Vaiko case
 M.R. VENKATESH  Chennai, Sept. 9: Three  of the nine MDMK leaders languishing in jail for over a  year in an anti-terror case have petitioned that deputy  Prime Minister L.K. Advani be summoned to court. 																								Former MP Ganeshamurthy, Madurai Ganesan and Alagu Sundaram pleaded that Advani be summoned to produce a vital document without which defences case will be greatly prejudiced. 																								The document, they claimed, is the demi-official letter chief minister Jayalalithaa wrote to Advani on July 2 last year, saying she had no option but to proceed against Vaiko (an NDA MP) under the provisions of Pota. 																								The MDMK leaders, including party chief Vaiko, were arrested for speaking in support of the banned LTTE in June 2002. 																								Jayalalithaas letter was written two days before police filed an FIR against them on July 4, the petitioners said. 																								The letter, whose contents were widely publicised, showed Jayalalithaa had already decided to prosecute them, the petitioners charged. 																								They also pointed out that the first prosecution witness, Thangavelu, station house officer of Tirumangalam police station near Madurai, under whose jurisdiction their crime was allegedly committed, has told court during cross-examination that he was not aware of the document. 																								The production of the letter was desirable and absolutely necessary to establish the defence argument that investigation was carried out only to foist a case against Vaiko and the other accused on the direction of the chief minister, Jayalalithaa, who is motivated by political vendetta. 																								Hence, Advani should be summoned to produce the document, they said.

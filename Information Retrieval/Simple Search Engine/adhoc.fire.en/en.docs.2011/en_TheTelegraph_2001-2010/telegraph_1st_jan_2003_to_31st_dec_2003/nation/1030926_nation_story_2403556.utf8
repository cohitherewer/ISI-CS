 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Hyderabad, Sept. 25: The Congress today dropped a letter bomb in the Assembly by tabling a missive that alleged that Rs 3 crore has been given to big boss  purportedly referring to . Chandrababu Naidu  to approve the transfer of a power project to a third party. 																								Deputy Congress Legislature Party leader M.V. Mysoora Reddy also released the letter to the media, along with the copy of an extract of an affidavit filed in the Singapore high court by J.C. Cassina, CEO of Energy Power Systems, Canada, in which it was clarified that big boss meant Naidu. 																								The Rs 1,300-crore gas-based project at Vemagiri in East Godavari district has courted controversy ever since it was taken over by the Vizag Bottling Company (VBC) owned by industrialist and Telugu Desam MP from Visakhapatnam M.V.V.S. Murthy. The project was initially allotted to Engineering Power Systems, now Energy Power Systems (EPS), in 1997. They turned over the project to Oakwell, but the deal ended up in the Singapore court as the two were at loggerheads over distribution of equity. Murthys company bought it from EPS in 1999. The letter, allegedly written by Murthys son M.S. Rama Rao, who is also managing-director of Konaseema Power Corporation, in which the VBC has a major stake, referred to the payment made through an intermediary, T.K. Prasad, who headed the publicity firm, UniAds. 																								Speaking to The Telegraph from Delhi, Rama Rao said the letter was forged. I have a certificate from the forensic labs and ministry of home affairs that the letter is a bogus one, he said. But, a triumphant Mysoora Reddy said: Let the government come out with details and the authenticity of the letter. We have many more skeletons.

		 Friday, July 11, 2003 				 Maharashtra freezes medical quota
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 10: The Maharashtra government has frozen admission on the all-India quota in all its medical and dental colleges.																								State senior counsel Harish Salve told the Supreme Court today that Maharashtra has frozen admissions on the all-India quota in its colleges for the academic year 2003-04.																								Salve was speaking during hearings challenging a state legislation that had quashed the all-India quota. 																								The legislation had quashed the quota despite an earlier order by the Supreme Court that every state and Union territory shall have 15 per cent as an all-India quota.																								The case assumes significance as the question of law to be settled is whether a state government can pass a law abolishing an all-India quota in its professional colleges.																								The Centre also filed an affidavit in court stating that any such unilateral withdrawal of an all-India quota by a state would upset the entire system.																								Additional solicitor-general Raju Ramachandran, appearing for the Centre, said as a result of the Maharashtra governments decision to freeze admission, the Directorate General of Health Services would postpone its second round of counselling, scheduled to begin from July 18.																								The division bench directed that the matter should be placed before the Chief Justice of India for further orders.

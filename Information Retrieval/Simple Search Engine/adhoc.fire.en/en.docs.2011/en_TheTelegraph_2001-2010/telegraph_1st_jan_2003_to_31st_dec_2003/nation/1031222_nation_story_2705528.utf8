		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Keshubhai cloud on Modi dream run
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN Patel Modi 																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, who has had a dream, dissidence-free, zero-opposition run for almost a year, may soon have to face his first political challenge from his predecessor Keshubhai Patel.																								Gujarat BJP sources said Keshubhai, now a Rajya Sabha member, has indicated his desire to return to state politics and would not mind taking over as state unit chief after present incumbent Rajendrasinh Ranas term ends. Rana will have to give up the post by December-end.																								But Modi, who had made it plain in the past that he would brook Keshubhais presence in Gujarat only until the Assembly elections, is reportedly pitching for his own nominee, Dilip Sanghani.																								Like Keshubhai, Sanghani is a Leuva Patel from Saurashtra, a successful Lok Sabha MP who won from Amreli thrice and most important, younger than Keshubhai by at least 20 years. The last is the most important qualification for our leaders who want to effect a generation change at all levels. After promoting leaders like Uma Bharti, Vasundhara Raje and Raman Singh, they cannot be seen installing a 75-year-old person to head the party in an important state like Gujarat, a source said.																								The sources added that an equally critical factor that went against Keshubhai was Modis disapproval. 																								Before the Gujarat elections, Modi made it clear to our leaders that if he was made the CM and expected to lead the party in the elections, he would not brook Keshubhais presence in the state. It was on his insistence that Keshubhai was brought to the Rajya Sabha, a source said.																								Having gone this far to placate Modi, Keshubhai has made it clear to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani that he has no intention of staying grounded in Delhi and, therefore, turned down repeated offers to become a cabinet minister.																								After lying low in the post-election phase, mainly because the BJP was riding high on the Modi euphoria, sources said Keshubhai emerged from the wings and played what he is deemed best at  namely, the Patel card  to demonstrate his popular base.																								Recently, Keshubhai held three caste-rallies at Morvi, Gondal and Mehsana. According to reports, the last was significant because for the first time, it brought the two major Patel sub-castes  the Leuvas and the Kaduas  together. 																								The Leuvas and the Kaduas are permanent rivals and vote separately. But the Leuvas are traditionally more dominant and call the shots. They support the BJP, a source said.

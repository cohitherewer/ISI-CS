																								Islamabad, Jan. 28 (Reuters): Pakistan today said it had shot down a pilotless Indian spy plane that crossed into Pakistani airspace in the Kashmir region.																								The military said two Indian remote piloted vehicles had crossed over the Line of Control in the past 48 hours. Pakistani troops took appropriate measures which forced the Indian remote piloted vehicles to abandon their spying. One intruding vehicle was seen falling in flames, the military said in a statement.																								Pakistan said the Indian aircraft had crossed 2 km and 6 km respectively into Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. The statement said more than 200 similar violations by India had taken place last year.																								India denied the incident. We have checked with all our forward areas and no such incident has taken place, a defence ministry spokesman asserted in Jammu. 																								The nuclear-armed neighbours went to the brink of war last year after New Delhi accused Pakistani-based militants of attacking its Parliament. Tensions have since eased, although the two sides each expelled four diplomats and embassy officials last week. 																								The rivals also frequently exchange artillery and small arms fire across the Line of Control and Pakistan said it had killed at least five Indian soldiers in exchanges of fire yesterday. 																								Earlier, Pakistani police said unprovoked Indian firing had killed a 12-year-old boy in Pakistani Kashmir last evening.

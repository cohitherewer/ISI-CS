		 Tuesday, November 04, 2003 				 Police to politics
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Nov. 3: The list of senior IPS officials from Andhra Pradesh who have joined politics grew today with deputy inspector-general M. Srinivasulu seeking voluntary retirement to lend his voice to the Telengana movement.																								The police officer gave up his official car and escorts immediately on tendering his resignation to the chief secretary. Srinivasulu then came to the press club in an autorickshaw to address a news conference. 																								He proposes to surrender his official residence and other facilities once the government accepts his resignation. However, the official might find it difficult to get voluntary retirement, say sources. There were seven cases pending against him with the Anti-Corruption Bureau, said a police official.																								Srinivasulu, from the Amarachinta Assembly segment in Mahboobnagar district, has three years of service left in the police department. 																								He has worked for more than a decade in the state intelligence department and this is expected to stand him in good stead in the political arena.

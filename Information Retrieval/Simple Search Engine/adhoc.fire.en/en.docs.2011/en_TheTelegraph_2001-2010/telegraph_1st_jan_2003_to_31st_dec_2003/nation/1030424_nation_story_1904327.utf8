		 Thursday, April 24, 2003 				 BJP Central leaders step on UP turf
 							 - Advani to address Kanpur rally to get feel of ground RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, April 23: A high-level BJP meeting on Uttar Pradesh today decided it was time to make a more serious assessment of the coalition government with Mayavati.																								The decision comes in the backdrop of the Uttar Pradesh chief ministers recent controversial moves against the Samajwadi Party and to resurrect the state BJPs own identity before the 2004 Lok Sabha polls.																								The meeting, convened by BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu and attended by deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, proposed that Central leaders should play a more interventionist role in Uttar Pradesh rather than sit back in Delhi and get feedback from state leaders.																								To this end, Advani will hold his first meeting with the states workers on April 26 in Kanpur, where he will also address a university convocation . This interaction will hopefully give him a good idea of what the feelings on the ground are about the alliance with the BSP, Uttar Pradesh BJP sources said.																								For the record, BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi repeated for the umpteenth time that the alliance would stay put. However, a section of the Uttar Pradesh BJP  which was not part of the coalition government  spoke of a big disconnect between the government and the party apparatus and how the alliance was being virtually rammed down its throat by the Delhi brass for its own interest.																								Asked what the interest was, sources hinted at the Ayodhya case concerning the Babri Masjid demolition  which is being heard by a special trial court  and the crucial role the state government could play. You are free to make your own inferences, said a source. Besides Advani, Central minister Murli Manohar Joshi was named in the case.																								Todays meeting also discussed how to give a distinct identity to the BJPs organisation in the state and not make it seem like a government appendage. It was decided that Naidu would visit Lucknow on May 18 to meet the heads of the district units and get their feedback on the governments performance and how the partys social base could be expanded.																								Asked why this meeting was called  after all it was a foregone conclusion that the BSP alliance would remain  sources said: The only difference is that this time we agreed that the government would be closely monitored.																								However, they clarified that this decision would not impinge on the conduct of Mayavati and her BSP ministers but that of the BJP ministers because there were reportedly several complaints against them allegedly misusing their office and running roughshod over party workers.																								As for Mayavatis announcement to probe the use of government discretionary funds by all former chief ministers  including herself and the BJPs Rajnath Singh  the leaders decided to adopt a wait-and-watch attitude. The only thing we all felt (was that) her actions should not seem like political vendetta, said sources.																								The BJPs Uttar Pradesh representatives, including state minister Lalji Tandon, state party chief Vinay Katiyar and Rajya Sabha member Kalraj Mishra, were told that Advani would shortly meet Mayavati to discuss the problems of sugarcane growers.

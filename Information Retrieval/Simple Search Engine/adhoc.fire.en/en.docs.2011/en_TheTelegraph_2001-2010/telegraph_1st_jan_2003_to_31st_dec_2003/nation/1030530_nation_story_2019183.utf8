		 Friday, May 30, 2003 				 CBI seeks trio extradition
																								New Delhi, May 29: The CBI will seek the extradition of three people from the US on charges of duping a bank of Rs 10 crore. The trio was declared fugitive in March after they failed to respond to non-bailable warrants issued by a city court, reports our correspondent.																								Earlier this month, the CBI sent the papers to the foreign ministry seeking the extradition of Manjit Singh, Devender Singh Maken and Anjali Maken. The ministry will forward the papers to the US after scrutiny.																								The trio had floated a firm, Maken Agro Oil Limited, here and obtained two credit limits, each of Rs 11.5 crore, from the State Bank of Travancores Karol Bagh branch in 1995. The officials said the trio had withdrawn Rs 10 crore of the Rs 23 crore credit and used it for their personal ends.																								The company got the credits for exporting de-oiled soya cakes and vegetable oils to US.																								The firm got its first credit pay-out of Rs 11.5 crore in February that year, and received the next one six months later.																								A case was registered against the firm and seven people on December 30, 1997. Charges were framed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1998 and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including section 420 (cheating).																								When the CBI began to probe the case, it found three chief managers of the bank -- Nayam Pillai Sudhir, T.K. Narayan Pillai and Sharda Singh -- had flouted rules by conniving to facilitate loans to Maken employees.																								CBI officials say Manjit, Devender and Anjali shut down the company and fled the country after they were asked to help in the probe. Investigations revealed that the firm did not submit export bills to the bank, a must so that the bank can liquidate accounts to recover the loan amount.																								The CBI charge-sheeted all the accused, including three bank officers and P.K. Maheswari, a senior Maken employee, on December 31, 2001.																								The court declared Manjit, Devender and Anjali proclaimed offenders after they failed to turn up for investigation despite having non-bailable warrants issued against them on March 5 this year.																								More than 25 people wanted in various swindling cases here are believed to be hiding in the US. CBI director P.C. Sharma submitted a list of 20 wanted people to the Federal Bureau of Investigation chief, Robert Muller, during his visit to India in 2001. But nothing came of it. Deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani will take up this issue once again when he heads to New York in the first week of June.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The CBI is likely to submit its interim report on the controversial Taj heritage corridor project to the Supreme Court tomorrow. 																								The apex court had given four weeks to the CBI on July 16 to file its interim report, to be followed up by a full report. Sources said investigations are almost over and the bureau is giving final touches to its report. 																								The CBI today questioned Ajay Agarwal, the Uttar Pradesh government counsel who was sacked after he alleged in the court that he was being threatened by former state environment secretary R.K. Sharma. He had even filed an affidavit in the apex court, alleging that Sharma was indulging in corrupt practices. 																								The Supreme Court had directed the government to give protection to him and his mother in Moradabad and asked the CBI to look into his allegations. 																								Confirming that the CBI called on him, Agarwal said: They were asking me questions based on the affidavit I had filed in the apex court.

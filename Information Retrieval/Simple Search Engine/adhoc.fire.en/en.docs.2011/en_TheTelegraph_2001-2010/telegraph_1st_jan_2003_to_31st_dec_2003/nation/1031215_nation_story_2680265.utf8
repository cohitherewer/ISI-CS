		 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Deportation cloud on Dalip Tahil
		 Dalip TahilLondon, Dec. 14 (PTI): Actor Dalip Tahil faces deportation to India as the British government has turned down his appeal to work here for the BBC.																								Tahil, 51, had come to London to appear in Andrew Lloyd Webbers musical Bombay Dreams but reportedly failed to get a proper work permit when he moved on to the soap opera East-Enders featuring on the BBC, The Sunday Times reported today.																								He has been sent a letter by the home office dismissing his appeal for permission to continue to work in the UK and now faces the prospect of being sent back to India, the report said.																								The home office, according to sources, accepted claims by Equity, the actors union, that other British Asian actors could have taken his role in East-Enders where he plays Dan Ferreira, the smooth-talking father of the dramas Asian family.																								British immigration laws state that nationals from outside the European Union should not replace residents capable of doing the same work. Those with international status are eligible for work permits as well.																								The setback is said to have caused chaos and confusion on the sets of East-Enders, with scenes being hastily rewritten, the report said. The cost to the BBC could be about 100,000, it said, quoting industry sources.																								The BBC and the actors agent claimed there was still hope and a meeting was being arranged on Tuesday. An East-Enders spokeswoman said: We are waiting to speak to a minister about this. He believes that the home office has behaved precipitously in this matter and it is far from being resolved.

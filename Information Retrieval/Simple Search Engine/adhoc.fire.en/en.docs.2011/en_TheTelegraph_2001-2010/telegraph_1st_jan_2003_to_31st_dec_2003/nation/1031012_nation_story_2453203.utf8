		 Sunday, October 12, 2003 				 Yashodhara back, BJP flock grows
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 11: Former CPM Rajya Sabha member Bratin Sengupta and former Union minister from the Congress S. Krishnakumar joined the BJP today in a function to commemorate the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan. 																								That, however, was not all. Arif Beg, one of the few Muslims to join the Jan Sangh in its inception, returned to the BJP after an eight-year gap in which he had sought refuge in the Congress but had got nowhere.																								There was more cheery news for the party. 																								Madhya Pradesh MLA, Yashodhara Raje, who had resigned following differences with Uma Bharti, agreed to withdraw her resignation and campaign for the party in the Assembly elections.																								Raje underwent a change of heart after a meeting with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu. 																								The younger sister of the BJPs Rajasthan chief ministerial candidate, Vasundhara Raje, Yashodhara got elected from Shivpuri in the Gwalior region in her first shot at electoral politics. 																								While Beg and Krishnakumar were present at the BJP headquarters to be welcomed by Advani and Naidu, Sengupta could not make it.

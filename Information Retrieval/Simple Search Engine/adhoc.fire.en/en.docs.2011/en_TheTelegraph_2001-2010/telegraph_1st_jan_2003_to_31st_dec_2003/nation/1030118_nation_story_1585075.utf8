																								Hyderabad, Jan. 17: The Andhra Pradesh government is planning to set up a toll-free centralised call centre to disseminate information and receive grievances of the people. 																								We have not yet decided how big the centre will be, but it will take up the entire complaint burden of the state, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu said today. 																								Once the centre is functional, citizens need not visit any government office to register their complaint or obtain information. All they have to do is dial the toll-free number. The centre will forward it to the official concerned using the computer network already in place, Naidu explained.																								The state government is working on a private-public partnership in the proposed project. The entire operations of the centre would be managed by a private group, the chief minister added. 																								Explaining the idea behind the centre, Naidu said: My primary concern is to offer corruption-free administration to the people of the state and I will use information technology to the fullest possible to achieve this goal. 																								The new proposal is also expected to make the field staff more accountable. The call centre will e-mail the complaint to the senior concerned, and will monitor the official till the problem is solved, Naidu said.																								The state government has also decided to provide about 10,000 cellphones to all grassroots level officials, who can be contacted round-the-clock by the people. We want the administration to be near the people and solve their problems, he added.

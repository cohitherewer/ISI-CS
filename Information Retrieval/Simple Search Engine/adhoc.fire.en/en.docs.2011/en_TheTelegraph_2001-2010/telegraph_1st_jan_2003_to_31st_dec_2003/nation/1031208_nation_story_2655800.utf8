Shakoor Khan, a resident of the Brari-Aangan area of the district, whose father was among the five killed by security forces as a sequel to the massacre of 35 Sikhs on March 2000, was handed the appointment order by Anantnag deputy commissioner A.H. Samoon on Saturday, an official spokesman said. 				 																																																										This is the first case of its kind.

Private varsities on UGC radar New Delhi (PTI): The University Grants  Commission has issued regulation mechanisms to check the  mushrooming of private universities offering degrees to  students at ease, in order to safeguard the interests of  the students.				 																																																										Under the UGC (establishment of and maintenance of standards in private universities) Regulations, 2003, private universities which started functioning before the regulations came into force would have to ensure adherence to them in three months.				 																																																										Failure to comply with the regulations would render any degree or diploma awarded by the university as unrecognised and would invite penalty under the the UGC Act. 				 																																																										UGC sources said that fresh regulations were needed as setting up of private universities through state acts was a recent phenomenon. 				 																																																										While as many as 150 private universities existed in Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal have also started following suit, they said.

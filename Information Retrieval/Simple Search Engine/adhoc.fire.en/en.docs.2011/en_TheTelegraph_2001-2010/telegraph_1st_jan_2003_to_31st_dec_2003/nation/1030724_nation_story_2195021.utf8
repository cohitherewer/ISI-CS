 UN mandate necessary, not enough
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  New Delhi, July 23: Two days after the Bush administration offered to work on a wider UN resolution, the government has made it clear than an explicit mandate from the world body would only be a condition and not sufficient reason for sending troops to Iraq.Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha told the Lok Sabha today that the government would reconsider sending troops only if there is a clear and explicit UN mandate. But even then, he emphasised, the situation on the ground and the command and control arrangement would have to be taken into account before reaching a final decision.Responding to the Opposition, the minister said US secretary of state Colin Powell, during their telephone conversation on Monday, wanted to know whether India would be willing to consider deploying troops if a wider UN mandate is in place.Sinha, however, disagreed with the suggestion of Opposition parties that India should not even consider deploying troops as long as American and British forces are stationed in Iraq.

It was clear that the minister was trying to drive home the point across the Opposition benches that even the Congress chief had not rejected outright the possibility of considering troop deployment to stabilise Iraq.Congress chief whip Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan and CPM member Roop Chand Pal had contended that the question of sending troops did not arise in view of the unanimous resolution Parliament had adopted.Bush appealStating that the killing of Saddam Husseins sons indicates that the regime is over, George W.

Karishma case tape in courtCalcutta: A tape containing an interview of Akashdeep Sabir, producer of Karishma: The Miracles of Destiny, was today produced before a division bench of Calcutta High Court, says a staff reporter.Justices A.. Ray and J. Banerjee heard the recorded interview which was taken by journalist Pammi Somal and is the mainstay in the fiercely fought battle between Manhattan-based author Barbara Taylor Bradford and Subrata Roy-owned television channel Sahara Manoranjan. The pulp-fiction writer has accused the channel of plagiarising her works, including A Woman of Substance, in the serial starring Karisma Kapoor.The judges also took a look at Sachin Bhowmicks script of Aparajita, submitted by the Sahara to corroborate their stand that the story-line of the mega serial was original and had nothing to do with Bradfords novel.

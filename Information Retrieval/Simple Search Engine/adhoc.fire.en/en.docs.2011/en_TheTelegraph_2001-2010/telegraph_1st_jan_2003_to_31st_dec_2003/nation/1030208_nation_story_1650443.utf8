 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, Feb. 7: Mulayam Singh Yadav seems to have decided to upset the Congress poll apple cart in Rajasthan if the party did not accept a political understanding with him, especially in Uttar Pradesh.																								The Samajwadi chiefs intentions were made public by his son Akhilesh Yadav, MP from Kannauj, who also looks after the partys youth wing.																								Akhilesh  who began a two-day tour of the state today on his fathers instructions to explore the Samajwadis prospects for the November Assembly elections  told mediapersons that his party had decided to field candidates in all the 200 constituencies of the state.																								Akhilesh, however, said Congress president Sonia Gandhi was yet to respond to his fathers proposal for an electoral alignment in the four states, including Rajasthan, that are going to polls in November.																								The Samajwadi youth wing leader did not mince words in lambasting the Congress for its political arrogance by rejecting the Samajwadis offer of an electoral understanding in Gujarat and elsewhere despite its failure to defeat the communal BJP.																								The Congress had to pay for its ghamand (arrogance) in Gujarat, Akhilesh said. This political arrogance assumed such a proportion that it did not take seriously Samajwadi leader Amar Singhs warning about the split in the Congress legislature party in Uttar Pradesh, he pointed out.																								That was why the Him Lok Tantrik Morcha in Himachal Pradesh, of which Samajwadi was a partner, had decided to contest 68 seats in that state. The Samajwadi will field its candidates in 40 seats in Himachal, he said.																								Akhilesh said that though the Samajwadi candidate lost in the recent Assembly bypoll in Bansur constituency in Rajasthan, the fact that he fetched 14,390 votes was an encouragement for the party. In that election, the Congress lost to the BJP.																								It was in this background that the Samajwadi has decided to field its candidates in all constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh asserted.																								Akhilesh said though his party disapproved of the economic policies being pursued by the Congress and the BJP, the Samajwadi wanted the Congress support in taking on the communal RSS-BJP-VHP-Bajrang Dal combine.																								When pointed out that if the Samajwadi cuts into the electoral base of the Congress, it would only help the communal forces, Akhilesh argued that the Samajwadi could not help it as it had the right to expand its base in Rajasthan. 																								In fact, our purpose is to offer a third alternative to the Congress and the BJP, the junior Yadav said.

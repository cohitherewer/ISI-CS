		 Wednesday, December 10, 2003 				 Dubey case 
																								New Delhi, Dec. 9 (PTI): The Prime Minister tonight disclosed the handing over of the murder case of Satyendra Dubey, an officer with a national highway project, to the CBI. 																								The case has been already handed over to the CBI. Those responsible for his death, wherever they may be, will not not be spared, said the statement by Atal Bihari Vajpayee in his first public reaction to the murder. 																								Like all right-thinking Indians, I am shocked and saddened by the murder of Satyendra Dubey, an upright and dedicated officer working with NHAI (National Highways Authority of India), who was killed recently in Gaya, Bihar, Vajpayee added.																								Dubey, a 31-year-old IIT Kanpur graduate, was a highways authority project manager. The civil engineer was shot dead on November 27 after he wrote to Vajpayee and the authority chairman about loot of public money in the execution of the Golden Quadrilateral project. He was scheduled to monitor a part of the project.																								The Prime Minister emphasised that the project was a great dream not only for him, but for the entire nation. Thanks to the efforts of talented engineers like Dubey, it has made remarkable progress already and my government is committed to ensuring that those working on it complete it without any fear, he said while conveying his condolences to the bereaved family.																								Patna High Court has issued notices to the Bihar government to ensure security to those working on the project. 																								The state government had yesterday formally recommended handing over the case to the CBI. On Friday, Laloo Prasad Yadav had announced the governments decision to call in the CBI.																								Vajpayee said the outpouring of sympathy for Dubey from across the world showed that Indians, wherever they were, had a commitment to honesty and transparency and a significant stake in the countrys future. The government shares that commitment and appreciates their concern.

																								Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 4: Chief minister A.K. Antony is likely to accept rebel leader K. Karunakarans challenge and seek a confidence vote to end the political uncertainty in Kerala, reports our special correspondent. 																								Antony is likely to seek the opinion of his colleagues on the confidence vote at the weekly cabinet meeting tomorrow. 																								There is a growing feeling in the UDF (United Democratic Front) and among the public that the government should not waste time to convene the Assembly and put to rest all doubts about its majority, front convener Oommen Chandy, an Antony lieutenant, said today. 																								But first of all Antony has to make up his mind, get the concurrence of the UDF partners and clearance from the Congress high command.

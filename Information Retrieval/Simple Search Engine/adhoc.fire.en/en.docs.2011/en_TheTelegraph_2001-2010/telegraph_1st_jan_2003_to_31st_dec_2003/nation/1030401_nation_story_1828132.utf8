		 Tuesday, April 01, 2003 				 Munda gift for Marandi baiters 
 OUR BUREAU																								Ranchi, March 31: Chief minister Arjun Munda tonight distributed portfolios in a please-all exercise that let at least two dissidents have the last laugh in the political drama that crippled Jharkhand for a good part of this month.																								While the Janata Dal (U)s Lalchand Mahto retained energy, fellow dissident Madhu Singh of the Samata Party managed to keep revenue and land reforms with the bonanza of registrations. Singh had virtually fought with Babulal Marandi over snatching the registrations department from him.																								Another rebel minister Bac-hcha Singh of the Samata, who at the last moment switched sides to Marandi, was given his original urban development ministry, while party colleague Jaleshwar Mahato was assigned the drinking water supply and sanitation department, the new name of the public health engineering wing.																								Samresh Singh was given back science and technology and information technology and Joba Manjhi was realloted tourism, social welfare and housing, while the Dal (U)s Baijnath Ram, a protege of Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari, was given excise and prohibition.																								Major changes were effected in the portfolios of the BJP ministers. Former law minister Ramjilal Sharda was given charge of commercial taxes and national savings with the chief minister holding law. Devdayal Kushwaha was shifted from agriculture to food and civil supplies.																								Ten departments have been retained by chief minister, fuelling speculation that another Cabinet expansion might not be far away.																								The portfolios are as follows.																								Arjun Munda: Cabinet secretariat, Cabinet coordination, home, public relations, personnel, Raj Bhasha, administrative reforms, institutional finance, programme implementation, relief and rehabilitation, mines and geology, law, fisheries, animal husbandry and departments not allocated to anyone.

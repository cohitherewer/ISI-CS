		 Wednesday, May 21, 2003 				 Court notice to IIT
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 20: Delhi High Court today issued notices to the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the chairman of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) on a petition filed by a student seeking transparency in its selection procedure.																								Judge S.K. Agarwal asked the respondents to reply within four weeks on the petition filed by advocate R.K. Saini, counsel for Jammu student Ranjit Singh. He fixed the hearing on July 24.																								Singh has requested the court to call up the relevant records and allow him to inspect his answersheets. The student appeared in the JEE screening test for engineering on April 20 this year. But he did not qualify for the test, which precedes the main examination.																								Challenging the selection procedure, Singh said he was shocked and surprised not to find his roll number among the successful candidates when the results were declared on May 9.																								He said he had answered 82 of the 84 questions correctly. Singh says this can be ascertained by looking at the answer papers issued by IIT-JEE every year after the screening tests are over.																								A premier autonomous institution, IIT imparts specialised education in engineering and allied technology. It has branches in Delhi, Mumbai, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Chennai and Roorkee.																								Every year, the IITs hold the JEE for admission to engineering undergraduate courses. 																								The test comprises the screening test and the main examination.																								In his petition, Singh has urged the court to direct the respondents to select 24,000 candidates for the main examination as was done last year. If this was the case, Singh says he would have passed the screening test. 																								The petition says only 12,000 students qualified for the main examination this year.																								Singh questioned IIT-JEEs decision not to publish his rank in the merit list. He termed the action as unjust, illegal and arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.																								Singhs petition says the brochure for the screening test does not disclose the criteria for selection of candidates.

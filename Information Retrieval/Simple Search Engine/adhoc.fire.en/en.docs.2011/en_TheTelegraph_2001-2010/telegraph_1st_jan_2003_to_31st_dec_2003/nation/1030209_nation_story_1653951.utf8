		 Sunday, February 09, 2003 				 Patna cool to NDA bandh
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Feb. 8: The National Democratic Alliance-sponsored dawn-to-dusk bandh here drew a lukewarm response.																								Bandh supporters set two buses on fire at Baily Road this afternoon in an attempt to trigger panic.																								The state NDA unit had called the bandh in protest against the breakdown of law and order in the state after a spurt in the killings and abductions of physicians.																								Much of the bandhs impact was lost after yesterdays return of Dr Bharat Singh, ending a 48-hour drama over his abduction by the Sultan Mian gang.																								Shops, business establishments and schools were closed till this afternoon. 																								Pedestrians, however, were seen on the roads.																								According to city superintendent of police O.P. Bhaskar, bandh supporters stopped two buses at Baily Road around noon and set them ablaze. Fire tenders doused the fire immediately. 																								The police arrested 200 bandh supporters.

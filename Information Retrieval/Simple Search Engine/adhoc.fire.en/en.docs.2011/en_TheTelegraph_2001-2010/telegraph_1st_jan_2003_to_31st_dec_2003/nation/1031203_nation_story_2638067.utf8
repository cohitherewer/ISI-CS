Jessica case bail plea rejected New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on  Tuesday rejected a bail petition by Manu Sharma, the main  accused in the Jessica Lal murder case.				 																																																										Sharma surrendered before a city court on November 13, two days after Delhi High Court rejected his application for regular bail.

Sharma had been out on interim bail in the case since January 25, 2002.

Singh rued that in these days, even if a murder takes place before a large gathering, not a single person comes forward to help the prosecution.

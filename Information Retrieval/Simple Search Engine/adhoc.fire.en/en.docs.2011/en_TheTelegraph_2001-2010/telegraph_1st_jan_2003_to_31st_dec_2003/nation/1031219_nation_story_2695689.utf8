		 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Over tea, Delhi talks fencing
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Dec. 18: India today made it clear that fencing along the border with Pakistan and the Line of Control will continue and it does not violate the ceasefire agreement effected since November 26.																								Arguing that the fencing began much before the ceasefire, India has claimed that it was compelled to do so because of the cross-border terrorism sponsored by Pakistan. 																								It also does not violate either the Simla Agreement or the December 1972 Agreement on the delineation of the LoC, Delhi said.																								The two sides today began their talks on resuming the Samjhauta Express, the only rail link between the two countries that was suspended after the December 13 attack on Parliament two years ago.																								The Prime Minister has convened a meeting of the cabinet committee on security tomorrow, which might give the leadership a chance to formalise few more steps towards normalising relations with Pakistan and strengthening people-to-people contact.																								Keeping up the bonhomie, Arun Singh, the joint secretary in the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran division in the foreign ministry, invited Pakistans deputy high commissioner Munawar Bhatti to sort out the issue over a cup of tea and a plate of cashew nuts in South Block this afternoon.																								Pakistan had recently lodged a formal protest with the Indian high commissioner over the fencing of the borders and the LoC by Delhi. Pakistan demanded that India abandon the work immediately as it violated the ceasefire agreement.																								Despite continuing the fencing, India is trying to avoid any fresh controversy with Pakistan, weeks before Atal Bihari Vajpayee is scheduled to travel to Islamabad for the Saarc summit to be held from January 2 to 4.																								Shedding its earlier reluctance to have a one-to-one meeting between Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf, Delhi has indicated that if such a request comes from Islamabad, the Prime Minister could meet the Pakistani President or Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali. He might even meet both.																								Although no formal request has come from Pakistan so far, chances of such talks have brightened considerably over the past few weeks. India has, however, said it would not be considered a summit-level meeting.																								South Block sources said there was not enough time to prepare for a structured dialogue between the top leaders. Vajpayees meetings would be more on the lines of a courtesy call, they said.																								India has always maintained that dialogues would not resume unless Pakistan stops infiltration and cross-border terrorism. The top leaders might discuss ways to revive the dialogue but there was nothing to suggest that India has shifted from its position.

 BHARAT BHUSHAN																								Karachi, Dec. 20: Recently, the South African and the New Zealand cricket teams agreed to play matches only in Punjab  in Lahore and Rawalpindi  but not in Karachi, Peshawar or Hyderabad (Sindh).																								This is also how foreign investors feel. We are not a safe country for Pakistanis, leave alone for foreigners. Even local investment is running away to Dubai, said S. Akbar Zaidi, an economist.																								The geopolitical situation has created a lot of uncertainty  for the foreign as well as domestic investors. Large regional markets are closed for us  we cant sell in India or Central Asia. There were hopes about the Afghan market but they have been belied by the slow pace of reconstruction and the feeling that Kabul prefers Indian firms, said a political observer who did not want to be identified.																								He went on to add: There is uncertainty about what is going to happen in Pakistan  no one is sure what might happen if there is a change of government or what the internal impact of our external policies in Afghanistan or Kashmir would be. Domestic law and order and the investment climate has much to do with our foreign and security policy.																								However, the Pakistani economy has in fact stabilised. But it is not growing. The banking system is flush with liquidity but the investible surplus is not being translated into productive investment. Foreign direct investment remains low at about $100 million to $300 million a year.																								Poverty has gone up from 17 per cent in 1997 to 32 per cent at present  about 50 million people are believed to be below the poverty line (pegged at approximately Pak Rs 900 per capita). The law and order situation even in the metros is such that the multinationals already operating in the country prefer to hold their board meetings in Dubai.																								Our economy is stagnant. People are losing jobs as industries close down. There is a continuous price hike in the utilities, gasoline and other essential commodities. The foreign exchange reserves have risen but not because of economic activity. After 9/11, insecure overseas Pakistanis have started sending their money home through legal channels. That is why inspite of a huge foreign exchange reserve, we have yet to reap its benefits, said Sharafat Ali, a trade union leader.																								Asad Sayeed, young Cambridge-educated economist who has chosen to come back to his country, felt that the present team of economic managers is so steeped in the stabilisation mind-set that it has no ideas for taking any pro-active measures for stimulating economic growth. He said the lack of an industrial policy and the governments almost ideological commitment not to step in to allocate resources was also impeding growth.																								Sayeed argued that the cost of doing business was very high in Pakistan. Electricity rates are two to three times that of the neighbouring countries, port charges are three times that of Mumbai and eight times that of Dubai, regulatory problems are such that you have to deal with 60 government agencies and there is a huge infrastructure deficiency. We need to change all this, he said.																								Akbar Zaidis recommendation is to radically change the economic policy. The Pakistan government needs to move away from the World Bank/IMF adjustment policies which focus on cutting down government expenditure. We need to take a more active Keynesian position on the economy  spending in the public sector, increasing employment and protecting local industry, he said.																								Another factor impeding Pakistans economy is one about which no one wants to talk about publicly  the huge presence of the army in industry. The Pakistan Army is not only the biggest entrepreneur in our country, it is becoming even bigger, said a political commentator who did not want to be identified.																								The Pakistan Army not only runs a bank (Askari Bank), buys and sells real estate (Askari Estates), runs a trucking business (National Luggage Corporation) and runs a road construction company (Frontier Roads Organisation), it also produces sugar, cement, fertiliser and food products, including sliced bread (Fauji Foundation and Army Welfare Trust). Serving and retired army officers are also present in the top management of most big public utilities and enterprises.																								The political commentator revealed: The army has captured a huge share of the domestic market because of its political clout. The Army Welfare Trust has been running huge losses. In the year 2000-2001 it actually received a direct subsidy of Rs 5.5 billion from the Budget. Its losses are much higher and are often picked up by nationalised banks and perhaps by the defence Budget itself. Every rupee that goes into subsidising the inefficient army enterprises is a rupee denied to the private sector.																								In fact, he went on to argue that the reason why the Pakistani military wants to capture political space also has a lot to do with safeguarding its business interest. Unless the militarys political space is not reduced, the sort of confidence required by the private sector will not come.

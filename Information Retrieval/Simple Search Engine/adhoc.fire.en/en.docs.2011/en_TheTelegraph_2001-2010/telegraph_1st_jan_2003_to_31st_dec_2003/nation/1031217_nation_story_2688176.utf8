Krishna district was the worst affected accounting for 24 deaths in house collapses and heavy rains, followed by West Godavari four and Guntur three, official sources said here this evening.				 																																																										Torrential rains, accompanied by gales, caused heavy damage to crops and roads and uprooted trees and power lines, leading to power disruption in over 900 villages in the three districts where over 500 cattle perished. Roads were heavily damaged and standing crop was destroyed.				 																																																										Deaths were reported from Machilipatnam, Gudivada and Nujiveedu divisions, Krishna district collector K. Prabhakar Reddy said. As many as 19 people, mostly fishermen, were missing in the district, he added.				 																																																										A record 46-cm rainfall was recorded in Nagayalanka while paddy and other commercial crops in all the 50 mandals of the district were damaged.				 																																																										The cyclonic storm crossed Andhra coast between Nagayalanka and Machilipatnam at midnight, uprooting several trees in Machilipatnam and Vijayawada towns, resulting in power breakdown in most of the places in the district, Reddy said.				 																HC blow to Coke plant Kochi (PTI): Kerala High Court directed  Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages Ltd, a Coke bottling subsidiary,  to stop drawing groundwater for use in its bottling plant  at Palakkad district in a month from Tuesday.				 																																																										The court also directed the gram panchayat under the jurisdiction of which the cola plant is located, as well as the state government, to ensure that the plant does not extract groundwater after the specified time limit.				 																																																										Groundwater under the land of the company does not belong to it. Normally, every landowner can draw reasonable amount of groundwater which is necessary for its domestic and agricultural requirements. But here, 510 kilo litres of water is extracted per day, converted to products and transported, thus breaking the natural water cycle, Justice K. Balakrishnan Nair observed while delivering the judgment on a petition challenging the government order permitting the company to function despite the closure notice issued by the panchayat.				 																																																										The court held that the groundwater belongs to the general public and the company had no right to claim a huge share of it. The government also has no power to allow a private party to extract such a huge quantity of groundwater, the result of which could be drying up of groundwater.

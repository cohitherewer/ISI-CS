		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Siwan MP bows to Laloo pressure
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 				 	 Shahabuddin																								Patna, Aug. 12: Mohammad Shahabuddin, the Siwan MP who has been dodging arrest since a court rejected his anticipatory bail last week, has decided to surrender tomorrow in the face of political pressure. 																								I had earlier thought of exhausting the legal means before surrender. However, now there is political compulsion. I will surrender tomorrow at 10 am, Shahabuddin said on phone from Siwan. 																								Wanted in connection with the abduction and murder of Munna Chowdhary, a CPI(M-L) activist, Shahabuddin had called director-general of police D.P Ojha mentally sick for implementing an arrest warrant pending against him since 2001. Ojha said the MPs threat had echoes of the organised Italian mafia. 																								The MP mellowed down as both the government and his party asked him to surrender first and then talk. Many of his confidants also advised him to surrender. I have faith in the judiciary. I will explain my case to the court, Shahabuddin said. 																								Sources in Siwan said the RJD MP is trying to mobilise his supporters tomorrow before his surrender. This is going to be a political show no less big than the ones you had seen during the surrender of Laloo Yadav in court, asserted an MLA close to Shahabuddin. 																								Siwan jail is apparently being spruced upto house the MP. He would first be accommodated there before being shifted to Beur jail, said a senior Siwan district officer. 																								Shahabuddin is unlikely to be granted bail as the plea has already been rejected. As the police do not want to take him in custody, it seems Shahabuddin would be remanded in judicial custody. The MP was last housed in Siwan jail in 1996-97 in connection with a murder case. 																								RJD sources said he was told by party chief Laloo Prasad Yadav to give himself up before the dispute on the 36 other cases pending against him can be discussed. Ojha has asked the government to recommend a CBI probe into these cases. The recommendation is awaiting chief minister Rabri Devis approval. 																								The sources said the chief minister has sought the chief secretarys opinion, which is not forthcoming. The top bureaucrats would like to see the mood of the political head and how he is disposed towards the MP before doing anything, said a senior home department officer. A lot will depend on what stand Laloo Prasad takes after his return from Pakistan.

		 Friday, August 15, 2003 				 Vajpayee scare for Shakespeare 
 RAJEEV BHATTACHARYYA AND VARUNA VERMA				 	 Kalam																								Meerut/New Delhi, Aug. 14: To be or not to be was the question for William Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw in Meeruts Choudhury Charan Singh University. The institutions board of studies, which recently rewrote the English syllabus for first year undergraduate students, had decided they were not to be.																								It had suddenly discovered the literary prowess of President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. And considered their writing good enough to replace the works of Shakespeare and Shaw.																								The universitys working committee formally changed the English syllabus for first year students on August 2. Vajpayees No War Again and We Shall Never Bend replaced the Bards classics, Macbeth and Twelfth Night, while Shaws much-acclaimed Arms and the Man was booted out in favour of Kalams Patriotism Beyond Politics and Religion.																								If undergraduate courses were not enough to drive the lesson home, Vajpayees poems  the literary merit of which is being debated in academic circles  had also been included in the eighth paper of the MA second year English syllabus. Kalam does not share the honours there.																								The universitys vice-chancellor, R.P. Singh, had opposed the changes. I was informed about the developments yesterday morning by the head of the department who also did not mince words in expressing his displeasure, Singh said. 																								A meeting was called today which was attended by members of the board of studies and the academic council. The suggestion by some members to replace the compositions of Shakespeare and Shaw with those of Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been rejected, he said.																								But the move itself has stirred a hornets nest, not the least for fear that somewhere, some day it will actually happen. Sycophancy, scream its detractors. Vajpayee can be called a Hindi poet at best, they say. And long-haired presidents dont necessarily make authors of classics. 																								Studying Vajpayee for an English course is like studying Voltaire for physics. How can the translated works of an author, known only because of his political position, be prescribed as a course book? asks former culture secretary and poet Ashok Vajpeyi.																								Writer Rajendra Yadav  editor of a Hindi literary magazine, Hans  is as scathing. Kalams book might be a worthy ode to patriotism, but it is not a literary masterpiece. This is quite obviously the work of sycophants, looking for political brownie points.																								Its not outsiders alone who are angry. The recommendation raised the hackles not only of the vice-chancellor but also of some members of the academic council. 																								We are at a loss to understand how anybody can claim that the syllabus would be replaced by translated poems of our Prime Minister, Singh said.																								It appears the protagonists had suggested that the inclusion of Vajpayees poems would not go against UGC guidelines.																								P.C. Pachouri, member of the academic council, said: Just because someones recommendation doesnt violate UGC guidelines doesnt mean that he can suggest anything. 																								Why did the board of studies do it in the first place? Brownie points are not always the consideration. Sometimes its a case of promoting peers. Not long ago, Premchands Nirmala was dropped from the Central Secondary Education curriculum and replaced by a novel written by Mridula Sinha, whose only claim to fame was a position she once held as the head of the Bharatiya Janata Partys womens wing. Academics cried foul. The CBSE reacted by taking both books into the syllabus.

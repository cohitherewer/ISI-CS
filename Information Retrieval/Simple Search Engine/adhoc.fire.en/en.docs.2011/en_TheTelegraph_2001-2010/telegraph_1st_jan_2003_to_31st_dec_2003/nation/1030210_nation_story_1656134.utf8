																								Patna, Feb. 9 (PTI): The Bihar government has decided to enact a law on the pattern of the Maharashtra Organised Crime Control Act to check organised crime, particularly kidnapping for ransom, official sources said today. 																								The Rabri Devi-led government has asked the newly-appointed director general of police, D.P. Ojha, to prepare a blueprint to formulate the new law. 																								Sources said once the law is enforced, underworld dons can be put behind bars for two years on suspicion despite the absence of substantive evidence against them.

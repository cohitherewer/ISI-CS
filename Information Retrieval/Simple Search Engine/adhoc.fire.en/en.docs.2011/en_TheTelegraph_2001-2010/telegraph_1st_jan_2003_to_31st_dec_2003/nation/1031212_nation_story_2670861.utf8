		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 China general at Fort William
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Dec. 11: A senior  Chinese army officer will visit the Eastern Command headquarters  at Fort William, Calcutta, tomorrow, adding a new passage  to the unfolding story of strategic equations involving  India and China this year. 																								Indian and Chinese military contacts this year continue to grow despite Beijings traditional ties with Pakistan. China and Pakistan are set to hold joint naval exercises on Indias western seaboard shortly.																								Defence sources said General Wu Quanxi, deputy chief of general staff of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army, is expected to reach Calcutta tomorrow and visit Fort William, the hub of the Eastern Command that monitors a long and disputed boundary with China. 																								This is the first time since the 1962 hostilities that a Chinese general will have first hand access to the Indian armys eastern command.																								General Wus visit is reciprocal and comes after China welcomed the chief of the armys Tezpur-headquartered 4 Corps, Lt Gen. Rajendra Singh, to Lhasa in Tibet. The 4 Corps, with two mountain divisions, is deployed along the Line of Actual Control in Arunachal Pradesh.																								Defence minister George Fernandes said in a written reply in Parliament today that Pakistani naval activity involving submarines and warships have been noticed off the Gujarat coast. Though Fernandes did not state it, it is known that a Pakistan-China wargame in the Arabian Sea is scheduled. In the event of exercises near international boundaries, neighbours are usually informed that no hostility is intended. 																								In Calcutta, General Wu is expected to be at the head of a delegation that will meet the eastern army commander, Lt Gen. J.R. Verma. Defence ministry sources were not forthcoming on the talks agenda. 																								It is understood that a review of confidence building measures underway along the border is possible. At the level of the army, the discussion on CBMs can focus on technicalities such as identifying sectors to schedule pullbacks and positioning of heavy artillery in accordance with the agreement on peace and tranquillity on the border. 																								The Chinese team is also slated to meet Fernandes and the deputy chief of the army, Lt Gen. Ashok Chaki in New Delhi.

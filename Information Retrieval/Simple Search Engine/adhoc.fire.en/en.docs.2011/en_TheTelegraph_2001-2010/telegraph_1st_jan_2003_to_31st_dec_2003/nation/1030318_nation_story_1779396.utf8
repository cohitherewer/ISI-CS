		 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 Medha set for Ayodhya march 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 17: Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkars three-month-long campaign in 14 states will end with a march to Ayodhya on March 30. 																								The march will end with a call for peace to save the country from destructive development and religious mono-culture, Patkar, who is also a co-ordinator of the National Alliance for Peoples Movements, said at a news conference.																								We will announce our next plan of action in Ayodhya. This may even include a call for boycotting of MNC goods, she added.																								Patkar said the Uttar Pradesh government has started rounding up activists in Ayodhya on the charge of disrupting law and order. It is strange that those who are campaigning for peace are being rounded up while those triggering hate are allowed to roam at will, she said.																								The organisation is addressing a gamut of issues ranging from alternative development strategies, opposition to globalisation, right to livelihood to struggle against casteism and communalism.

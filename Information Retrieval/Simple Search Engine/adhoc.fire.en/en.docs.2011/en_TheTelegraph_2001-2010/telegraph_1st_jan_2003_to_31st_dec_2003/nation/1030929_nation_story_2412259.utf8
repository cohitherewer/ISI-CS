		 Monday, September 29, 2003 				 Negligence charge on airline official
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 28: A city court has slapped negligence charges on an Air France official for not attending to an ailing NRI passenger for more than 10 hours, leading to his death.																								Additional chief metropolitan magistrate V.K. Maheshwari said prima facie there was evidence to frame charges under Section 304 A (causing death by rash negligent act) against Air France duty manager at Indira Gandhi International Airport Opender Nath Kaul. 																								Kaul has been accused of failing to arrange medical facilities for Ram Sarwan who was offloaded from the Air France flight when he complained of chest pain. 																								Sarwan allegedly had to spend hours at the airport without any medical attention. Finally, he was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.																								Originally from Jalandhar and settled in Birmingham, Sarwan had come to India in August 1998 to immerse his fathers ashes at Hardwar in Uttaranchal.																								Sarwan, who had booked a ticket on the New Delhi-London flight, was accompanied by an attendant at the airport who left after he boarded the aircraft.

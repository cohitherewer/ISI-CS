The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, January 05, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Doctor fined for defacing boy				 																																																	 New Delhi (pti): Convicting a doctor and the hospital which employed him for causing permanent damage to the face of an 11-year-old boy in an operation, a city consumer court has ordered them to pay Rs 1.8 lakh as compensation.				 																																																	The poor child shall have to live with permanent facial paresis (paralysis of the right side of his face) for the rest of his life. This would affect him mentally, physically, psychologically, socially as well as his future employment, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum II said in its order.				 																																																	Pointing out that the hospital had taken a share of the fees received from Mahesh Kumars father for the operation, the forum held that south Delhi-based Orthonova Institute of Advanced Orthopedic Surgery and Research was equally liable for the negligence committed by the doctor, a.k. mittal.				 																																																	Since Kumar is a minor, the amount shall be kept in a fixed deposit in a nationalised bank, forum president g.d. dhanuka and members Nargis Rajkumar and b.n. bansal said.				 																																																	However, Kumars father can withdraw the annual interest from the amount for the boys upkeep, the consumer forum said. It also directed both the opposite parties to pay Rs 5,000 towards litigation costs.				 																																																	Kumars father Raj said his son was operated on by Mittal for an ear infection on July 26, 1997 and Rs 26,000 was paid for it. But during surgery the boys facial nerve was cut by the doctor, resulting in paralysis of the right side of his face.				 																Child witness nails freed convict				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): A man, charged with the murder of a lady and a three-year-old girl, was acquitted by Himachal Pradesh High Court but the Supreme Court found the evidence of a child witness credible and upheld the conviction order of the trial court.				 																																																	However, keeping in mind that the accused, Prem Chand, had committed the twin murders nearly 11 years ago, a bench of Justices s. rajendra Babu and p.v. reddi commuted the death sentence awarded by the trial court to life sentence while asking the police to arrest him and put him in prison.				 																																																	The sessions judge found Chand guilty of brutally murdering Dhobi Devi and the child Madhu Devi. Earlier, the trial court had awarded death penalty on the grounds that the terrible deed had been committed by the culprit only to steal their belongings.				 																																																	The high court had found several loopholes in the prosecution story and acquitted the accused, dismissing the account of a child witness who was also attacked.				 																																																	On an appeal filed by the state and after hearing counsel Anil Soni and amicus curiae p.v. dinesh, the apex court upheld the conviction and said though the eyewitness was a child, he had been clear and cogent in giving his evidence.

On hearing the shot, she rushed to the room and found him lying in a pool of blood. He was rushed to a hospital where he succumbed to injuries, sources said. According to the police, Lal took the drastic step due to family problems. One of his daughters had committed suicide last year.

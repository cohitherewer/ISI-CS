		 Wednesday, November 26, 2003 				 Nayak snarls at probe order
 ANAND SOONDAS 																								Mumbai, Nov. 25: Daya Nayak, Mumbai polices encounter specialist, today questioned the validity of the special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) court to handle a case regarding his alleged nexus with the underworld. 																								The MCOCA court has ordered a special police team under assistant commissioner of police Shankar Kamble to probe Nayak after Ketan Tirodkar, a former crime reporter and self-confessed Dawood Ibrahim mole, accused the policeman of working at the behest of Dubai-based dons. 																								Nayaks house was raided a few days ago, but Kamble said nothing incriminating had been found. 																								Nayak today challenged the jurisdiction of the MCOCA court and its powers to initiate a police probe against him in Bombay High Court. In a petition, which will come up for hearing before Justices S.S. Parkar and Hemant Gokhale on December 1, he appealed that the probe order of designated judge A.P. Bhangale be invalidated. 																								In his complaint to the court, Tirodkar had said both he and Nayak worked for Chhota Shakeel and that, among other things, the policeman had recently taken Rs 5 crore from the don to get a few difficult police officers transferred. 																								The money, Tirodkar in his statement before the court alleged, had found its way to the pockets of some of his seniors in the police department. 																								Nayak has long been Mumbais polices poster boy, inspiring a slew of Hindi and Kannada films, including the recently released Kagaar and the in-the-making Ab Tak Chappan. 																								Tirodkar has said Kagaar was financed by the underworld and made at Shakeels behest. The police have raided the house of Kagaar producer Mrinalini Patil.																								Forced to take the legal route, Nayak, who had been pooh-poohing Tirodkars complaint, told the high court that a similar police inquiry ordered by it was still on. 																								The earlier probe instituted by the high court had reached a dead end. Kamble was later to tell the MCOCA court that the probe had been scuttled at the direction of some of his seniors. The seniors are yet to be named. 																								Nayak also pleaded that he had not committed any offence under the stringent MCOCA, an act that deals with organised crime. 																								The policeman says it is Tirodkar who is working for Shakeel and, on the directions of the don, is bent on filing cases against cops and tying them up in tedious litigation. 																								On his part, Tirodkar has appealed before the special court that the police are again not probing the Nayak case properly and that the probe should not be handed by Kamble and his team from the Mumbai Crime Branch, the same wing in which Nayak works. 																								He has called the raids on the houses of Nayak and Patil a farce. 																								The court has asked the police to file a reply by March 28.

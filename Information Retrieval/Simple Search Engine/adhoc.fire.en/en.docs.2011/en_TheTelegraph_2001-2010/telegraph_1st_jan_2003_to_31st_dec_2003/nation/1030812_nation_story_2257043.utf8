		 Tuesday, August 12, 2003  Former top cop joins Congress
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kumar																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: A former city police commissioner and member of one of Bihars foremost political families, Nikhil Kumar, joined the Congress today in a significant psychological boost to the party ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections.																								Kumar walked into the AICC headquarters at 24, Akbar Road from his residence situated a hundred metres away at 28, Akbar Road this afternoon to formally announce his initiation into the Congress.																								Later, a brief statement from the AICC said the former top cop had met party chief Sonia Gandhi earlier to pave the way for his entry into the Congress.																								Also a former special secretary in the home ministry, Kumars plans to join the Congress has been in the air for quite some time. 																								Son of former Bihar chief minister, the late Satyanarayan Sinha, his entry into the party also emphasises the Congress determination to win back the support of the influential Bhumihars in Bihar.																								Just a couple of months ago, Ram Jatan Sinha, a Bhumihar leader, was appointed Bihar Congress unit president. Shyama Singh, Kumars wife, is already a Congress Lok Sabha member from Bihar.																								Congress leaders, however, believe Kumar might be of greater value to the party in Delhi as his is a familiar face in the national capital.																								He has joined the party just as the city Congress under chief minister Sheila Dikshit launched its campaign to retain power for a second successive term. 																								Apparently, the former police commissioner, too, thinks his services could be better utilised in the national capital.

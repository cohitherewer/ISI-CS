		 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Atal forced to field queries on strike ban
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 16: The Opposition today forced Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to hear its point of view on the Supreme Court order banning strikes by government employees.																								As soon as Vajpayee took his seat in the Rajya Sabha after question hour to reply to an earlier discussion on the Judeo tapes, Congress and Left MPs demanded that they be allowed to speak before he gave his reply.																								Labour minister Sahib Singh Verma was in the Rajya Sabha and would have fielded the queries, but the leaders were keen on Vajpayee hearing them out.																								The protests forced parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to speak up. The Prime Minister has come at the request of the Opposition to give his reply, she said.																								But the leaders refused to give in. Finally, the Prime Minister had to intervene. I am sorry that proceedings have been thrown out of gear in the House because of such a small matter. I request that the workers issue be taken up first and later we can also take up my issue, he said.																								On Saturday, Vajpayee had assured a Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh delegation that his government was not in favour of banning strikes by government employees.																								The Congress and Left MPs asked the government to bring a legislation that would undo the Supreme Court judgment and restore the workers right to strike.

While admitting the petitions and fixing the matter for final disposal in March, a bench of Justices S. Rajendra Babu and G.P. Mathur said it was an important issue and needed to be heard in detail.				 																																																	The anti-terror Act is also challenged by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties and the All-India Human Rights and Justice Front on the grounds that its provisions, apart from being draconian, were violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution.				 																																																	The NGOs, in their public interest petitions, had challenged the Act in toto while Vaiko had questioned the constitutional validity of its Section 21 that makes any words spoken in favour of a banned organisation an offence.				 																																																	He has sought the quashing of the Section for violating the Fundamental Right of Freedom of Speech.				 																																																	Vaiko was arrested by the Tamil Nadu government in July for his alleged statements in support of the banned LTTE. His party had supported the enactment of the Act in Parliament.

Abdul Kalam for appropriate action by the Punjab government under Article 317 of the Constitution.

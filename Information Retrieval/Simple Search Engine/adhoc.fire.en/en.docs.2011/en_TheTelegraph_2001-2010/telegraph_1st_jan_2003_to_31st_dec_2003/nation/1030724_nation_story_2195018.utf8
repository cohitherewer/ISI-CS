		 Thursday, July 24, 2003 				 Unesco meet to save antiques
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 23: Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Najma Heptulla will convene a meeting of parliamentarians, experts and officials of law enforcement agencies on Friday to check increasing smuggling of antiques and heritage properties.																								The focus of the meeting is to sensitise decision-influencing people towards preservation and protection of cultural and heritage properties. 																								In enlisting popular participation, peoples representatives could be a vital resource in sensitising and educating the masses on the civic and legal obligations in such cases, Unesco, which is organising this meeting, said.																								The meeting would draw inference from Unescos Convention on Illicit Traffic on Cultural Properties, to which India is a signatory. 																								Union culture and tourism minister Jagmohan will be the chief guest at the meeting, which would also be attended by the director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India and MPs like Justice (retired) Ranganath Mishra, General Shankar Roy Choudhary, S.K. Mishra and B.P. Singh.																								Unesco, in collaboration with Interpol and the World Custom Organisation, has been organising various workshops on the protection of heritage properties and antiques.

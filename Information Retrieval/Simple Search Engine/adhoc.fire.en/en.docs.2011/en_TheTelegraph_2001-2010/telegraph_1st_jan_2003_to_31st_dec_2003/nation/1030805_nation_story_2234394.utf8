		 Tuesday, August 05, 2003 				 Lalit on Orissa route to Rajya Sabha
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 4: Indias ambassador to the US Lalit Mansingh, whose tenure ends on March 31, is likely to get a Rajya Sabha nomination from Orissa.																								Four seats to the upper House of Parliament from Orissa will fall vacant by early next year and indications are that chief minister Naveen Patnaik may nominate Mansingh as one of the four Biju Janata Dal candidates from the state.																								There is also a strong possibility that foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal, whose tenure in South Block comes to an end this November, may replace Mansingh as Indias envoy in Washington.																								Sources said Mansingh had been trying for a Rajya Sabha nomination and even sounded Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But there were too many aspirants who wanted a nomination from the governments quota, which included media and sports personalities, musicians and artistes. 																								Under the circumstances, Orissa appeared to be a better option. It also happens to be his home state.																								The sources said Patnaik has expressed his keenness to nominate Mansingh in the hope that the seasoned diplomat will be able to articulate the problems of the state.																								If Sibal is appointed Indias ambassador to Washington, it will be twice in quick succession that a former foreign secretary has been sent to head the important mission. Mansingh was sent as ambassador to Washington soon after he retired as foreign secretary three years ago.																								Though Sibal has more than three months in office, the race for the foreign secretarys post has already begun.																								There is also speculation on whether he would be given a short extension, particularly in view of the normalisation process between India and Pakistan and the possibility  if things go well  of a summit-level meeting between the two Prime Ministers by early next year.																								But sections in the foreign ministry argue that since the government has made it clear that it would not give extension to any official beyond the retiring age of 60, any exception in the case of Sibal may be difficult to explain.																								Secretary (Africa-Europe-Asia) Shashank, who is the senior-most after Sibal, has a good chance of becoming the next foreign secretary. The 1966-batch IFS officer is due to retire on July 31, which means he would have a nearly eight-month stint.																								However, the sources said, the government may think of bringing in someone who has at least a years service left. In that case, the ambassador to Spain, Dilip Lahiri, has a good chance of making it to the foreign secretarys post as he retires in July 2005. 																								Though P.K. Singh, Indias ambassador in Brussels, also has nearly one-and-a-half years before he retires in April 2005, his indifferent health could rule him out.																								Indications suggest that Lahiri may be sent to New York as Indias permanent representative in the United Nations to replace Vijay Nambiar, who retires by September this year. If Lahiri opts for it, then Shashanks chances of becoming foreign secretary would brighten.

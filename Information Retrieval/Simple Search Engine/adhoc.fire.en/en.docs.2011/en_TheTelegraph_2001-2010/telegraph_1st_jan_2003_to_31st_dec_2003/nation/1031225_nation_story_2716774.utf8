		 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 US firm on Lashkar, Jaish ban
																								Washington, Dec. 24 (PTI): The US has redesignated Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Toiba as terrorist groups and targeted their new aliases to intensify its crackdown on the Pakistan-based militant outfits operating in Jammu and Kashmir.																								By redesignating the two outfits as terrorist groups before the initial designations expire on Friday, we preserve the US governments ability to take action against them in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, state department spokesman Richard Boucher said yesterday.																								He said secretary of state Colin Powell took the decision after consulting the attorney-general and the secretary of the treasury, following a review of these groups terrorist activities over the past two years. 																								The secretary of state renewed their designations in the federal register, a gazette of government business.																								Powell has also amended the designations of Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Toiba.... To add new aliases currently in use by these terrorist organisations, Boucher said.																								As we carry on the global campaign against terrorism, we hope this list will help to isolate these terrorist organisations, to choke off their sources of financial support, and to prevent their members movement across international borders, he said.																								With this step, the number of designated foreign terrorist organisations remains at 36.																								The groups designated as terrorist outfits face a range of sanctions, including a travel ban on their members entering America.																								Americans are also prohibited from forming any economic relationships with members of targeted groups, which are liable to have their assets in US financial institutions frozen.

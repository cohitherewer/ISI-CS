																								New Delhi, Oct. 25 (PTI):An ordinance to amend the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act to confer statutory powers on the terror law review committees is expected to be promulgated in a day or two.																								With the arrival of the President, the ordinance is likely to be promulgated in a day or two, official sources said here today.																								Under increasing pressure with its Tamil Nadu allies like the mdmk and the dmk complaining against the alleged misuse of the terror law, the Union cabinet on October 21 cleared an ordinance to amend the anti-terrorism law that would make decisions of the review committees binding on state governments.																								A bill to replace the ordinance is expected to be moved in the winter session of Parliament beginning December.

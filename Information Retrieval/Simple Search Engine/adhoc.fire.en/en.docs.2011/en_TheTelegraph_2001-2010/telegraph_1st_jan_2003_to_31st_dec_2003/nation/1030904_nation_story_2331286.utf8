But the situation was soon brought under control, an official of Adalaj police station said.				 																																																										The official said preliminary investigation indicates that Bhandari had committed suicide but results of a detailed probe and the post mortem report were awaited.

The workers were stunned to find Bhandari lying inside the tandoor with his arms upwards.				 																																																										Tension mounted when the workers refused to give details of the incident to the police even three hours after the incident and demanded that the body remain at the spot till the owner arrived, the police said.

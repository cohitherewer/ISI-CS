 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Aug. 13: DMK chief M. Karunanidhi today gave a call to save democracy in Tamil Nadu following the Jayalalithaa regimes move to derecognise the employees unions which had called last months strike and recent raids by anti-corruption sleuths on at least three former party ministers. But the former chief minister stopped short of demanding the state governments dismissal.																								The situation has now come to such a pass, but I will not press for it (use of Article 356), Karunanidhi told reporters.																								Leaders of most other political parties, including those of the CPI and the CPM, also condemned the governments move to derecognise the staff unions which, they said, was unheard of in a democracy.																								The former ministers whose houses were raided included .K.K. Periyasamy (who held handlooms and textiles), K. Sundaram (dairy development), and K. Pitchandi (housing). The residence of former ADMK legislator from Srivilliputtur R. Tamaraikkani, who later defected to the DMK, was also searched by the sleuths from the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption. The house of Gomathi Srinivasan, a former DMK functionary who recently joined the BJP, was searched, too.																								Karunanidhi said the raids, which followed searches at DMK treasurer Arcot . Veerasamys properties in Chennai and other places a few weeks ago, were deliberate and politically motivated, but asserted that his party was unruffled. We are not worried about it, we will meet these things legally, he said.																								Asked about the derecognition of employees and teachers unions, the DMK leader said he would not be surprised if the action is extended to the mainstream trade unions. The fire can spread, he said. Only if there are unions, can employees grievances be aired and redressed.																								Karunanidhi, whose party is an ally of the BJP-led coalition at the Centre, disagreed with the Union cabinets recent decision to appoint a committee to consider reservation for the poor among the upper castes and introduction of a bill to ban cow slaughter throughout the country.																								There is no change in the DMKs position that reservation should be only on the basis of social backwardness, Karunanidhi said. As for the proposed ban on cow slaughter, the bill is unnecessary, he asserted. In a development related to the  strike, the Madras High Court chief justice announced names  of three retired judges  as directed by the Supreme Court   who would hear pleas of the 6,072 yet-to-be reinstated  staff.

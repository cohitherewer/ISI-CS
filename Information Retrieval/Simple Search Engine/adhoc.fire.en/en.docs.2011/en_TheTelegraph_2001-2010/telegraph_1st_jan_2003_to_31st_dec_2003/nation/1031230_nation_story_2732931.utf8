		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 RSS defends Atal on Pak talks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 29: When Krishna had held talks with the Kauravas again and again to defer the Kurukshetra war, what is wrong if Atal Bihari Vajpayee meets Pervez Musharraf on the sidelines of the Saarc summit? This is not a line of reasoning put forward by a pink liberal, but the RSS Hindi mouthpiece, Panchajanya. 																								In an editorial in its December 28 issue titled Ataljis Pakistan trip, the Panchajanya says: Atal Bihari Vajpayee is travelling to Pakistan and he is likely to meet and talk to General Musharraf. It is natural for questions to be asked on whether Vajpayee should talk to him or not. But we have full faith in an impeccable nationalist like Vajpayee. If he talks to Musharraf, it does not automatically follow that he is going to compromise on national interests. Even Lord Krishna spoke to the Kauravas again and again to avoid the Kurukshetra battle and instill some sense into their heads.																								Apparently intended to dispel any misgiving the Sangh cadre might have on the Prime Ministers Islamabad visit, the RSS mouthpiece says: The world knows if India wants to teach Pakistan a lesson, it can do it without any difficulty. We are far ahead of Pakistan in the defence and economic sectors, and are on the verge of becoming a strong power. So if an Atal-Musharraf meeting does take place, it should not be seen as a sign of weakness.																								But there is a note of caution. If talks are to be held this time, history should be kept in mind. We have tried to be reasonable again and again, but we were deceived by Pakistan. Of course, Pakistan has been the net loser. Its backwardness, total dependence on the US, poverty, illiteracy and industrial stagnancy are all gifts of Islamic jihad, but they will not even do Pakistans maulanas proud. The Pakistan press is full of reports highlighting Indias progress and blaming the military establishment for the state of affairs in the country.																								Caught between US pressure and resentment against the continued presence of American troops, Panchajanya notes that Pervez Musharraf has softened his anti-India stance. 																								He has given up his demand for a plebiscite in Kashmir. He has also jettisoned his insistent stand on UN intervention. These two moves are in Indias favour. In this scenario, while India has come across as a strong country, Pakistan has been shown up as a country running for cover it says.																								The RSS had earlier decided to back Vajpayees foreign policy, which saw no point in holding bilateral talks unless Pakistan desisted from fomenting cross-border terrorism. At the same time, the outfit had made it clear that it was not against people-to-people contact, the restoration of rail and bus services and holding cricket matches. 																								BJP sources said the RSS-government bonhomie was a result of the parivars perception that post-Assembly polls, Vajpayee was on a high. Any criticism of his government would appear churlish, a source said. 																								On its part, the BJP reciprocated by acknowledging the role RSS played in the elections.

		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Clean-up cop ready to cleanse Bihar politics
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 D.P. Ojha																								Patna, Dec. 22: Successful in turning his personal adversity into an advantage, former Bihar director-general of police D.P. Ojha today said he is ready to take on the politician-mafia nexus. Ojhas detractors criticised his statement and said this was the first step to joining politics formally.																								Ojha will launch his crusade by visiting Bihat, a tiny village in Begusarai district on Friday. Bihat, birthplace of veteran CPI leader Chandrasekhar Singh, will see the former police chief publicly vow to fight the criminalisation of politics, as represented by controversial MP Mohammad Shahabuddin. The don-turned-Rashtriya Janata Dal MP was sent to jail in August after Ojha cracked down on his terror apparatus in Siwan district.																								The spartan lifestyle and popular appeal of Singh, an eminent CPI leader of the 1970s and an MP, made him a model for socialists in Bihar. Ojha perhaps wants to send out a political message by paying respects to the veteran in his native village before starting his campaign.																								Ojha was removed as DGP after he commented last month that power in the state had passed into the hands of lafanga (hoodlum) politicians. He also said Shahabuddin headed gangs that kidnapped businessmens children for ransom, adding that many powerful politicians looked up to the MP. 																								An indignant Laloo Prasad Yadav warned him not to cross his limits and proceeded to remove him from his post on December 6, prompting Ojha to go on leave. He has now asked for premature retirement.																								I believe my effort to extend this battle to other leaders having criminal nexus cost me my job, the senior policeman said today. I have, however, to intensify this on the ground.																								Ojha said he would put together a group of students in Bihat to help him organise the people there against criminals. My platform for cleansing the public life and politics from the influence of (the) mafia would have no leanings to any political party. I am going to Bihat in a symbolic gesture because the village had given birth to a leader like Chandrasekhar Singh whose brand of politics is such a contrast to the ones in contemporary times, he said.																								His associates say Ojha was once a member of the CPIs students wing and went on to join socialist camps. He is going back to his roots to get inspiration for a big fight, said a retired police officer who has teamed up with the former DGP.																								Ojha, who has been accused by the RJD of being hand-in-glove with the RSS, today said he was being identified with a particular party to confuse the people. He said he could not have remained a spectator when Bihars criminal-politician nexus was giving the state a bad name.

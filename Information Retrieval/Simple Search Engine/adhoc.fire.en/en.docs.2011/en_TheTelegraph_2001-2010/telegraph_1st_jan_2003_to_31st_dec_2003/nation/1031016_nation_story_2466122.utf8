		 Thursday, October 16, 2003 				 BJP ad plea
																								New Delhi, Oct. 15: The BJP has asked the Election Commission to revoke its directive to the Centre and the five poll-headed states not to release advertisements highlighting their achievements as this flouted the model code of conduct, reports our special correspondent.																								BJP general secretary and spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi argued that people had a right to be informed of the governments achievements and elections should not be a roadblock. Every year there are byelections or state elections. It would be better if the model code of conduct is enforced only in the states going to polls rather than the whole country.																								Contending that the achievements highlighted in the advertisements were those of the governments and not a partys, Naqvi said the report of the Tenth Five-Year Plan revealed many central schemes had not got off the ground because the public was not informed properly.																								Maintaining that the BJP respected the poll panels model code of conduct, he urged the commission to review its decision.																								Naqvi, however, could not explain why the Centre chose to put out its advertisements at this particular juncture when it had been in power for four years.

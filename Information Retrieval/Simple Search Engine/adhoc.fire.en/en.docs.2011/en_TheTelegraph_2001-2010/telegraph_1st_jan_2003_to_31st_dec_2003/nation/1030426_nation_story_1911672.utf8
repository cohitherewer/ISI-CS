Hearing a petition by the Indian National Trust for Culture and Heritage (Intach), a bench of Justices y.k. sabharwal and h.k. sema directed the corporation to frame the regulations and by-laws to check the pulling down of old historical buildings, though they did not figure in the heritage building list.				 																																																	The bench directed the corporation to complete the exercise in two months and asked it to send the regulations to the Delhi government for its comments. The court said the Delhi government should forward the regulations and by-laws with comments to the Centre in two weeks.				 																																																	Posting the matter for further hearing in the last week of July, it asked all parties concerned to file their affidavits.				 																																																	Intach had alleged that many old buildings of the city, which had played some role or the other in history, were being pulled down by builders for construction of high-rise buildings.

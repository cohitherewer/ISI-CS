A bench of Justice Doraiswamy Raju and Justice Arijit Pasayat also issued notice to the doctor on the petition filed by the girls mother.				 																																																										Appearing for the petitioner, counsel Colin Gonsalves and Aparna Bhat contended that the high court had erred in granting bail in a non-bailable offence, and that, too, on the ground of delay in filing of FIR where there was none.				 																																																										The counsel further contended that in such a serious offence, the high court had chosen to grant bail saying the relief needed to be granted to the accused keeping in view his family background.				 																																																										Justice S.K. Aggarwal of the high court had granted bail to the 55-year-old doctor, V.K. Nigam, after he furnished a bail bond of Rs 25,000 and a surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.				 																																																										According to the prosecution, the 13-year-old girl, suffering from TB, had visited the accused doctor at Holy Angel Hospital in Vasant Vihar on September 23 around 11 am.

Authorities opened a murder investigation after 21-year-old M.S. Gurry died of his head wounds on Thursday, said police spokesman Ricky Chong. 				 																																																	Gurry was a Hong Kong resident, said Chong, who was unable to provide the name of the Indians hometown.				 																																																	There were no immediate arrests in the attack that allegedly took place early Wednesday after the Pakistanis became angry at the noise the Indians were making in a playground in Wanchai district earlier, Chong said.				 																																																	The police were not able to say how many Indians were in the group that was attacked or whether any of the Indians fought back. It is unclear whether nationalistic sentiment played any role in the assault.				 																																																	Officials at the Indian and Pakistani consulates here said they had no immediate comment.				 																																																	The injured man was identified as 28-year-old G. Singh. 				 																Snatched teen rescued by kin				 																																																	AMRITSAR (PTI): A 17-year-old girl, who was repeatedly raped after being kidnapped, was rescued by a relative after 16 months, her parents claimed on Friday. 				 																																																	Her parents alleged reluctance on the part of police to get the victim medically examined. The girls father claimed that after she was rescued by her cousin four days ago, she was produced before city superintendent of police Shiv Kumar Verma, who referred her to the civil lines police station where a written complaint was filed. 				 																																																	Civil lines police, after accepting the written complaint, referred us to the police post at Company Bagh for further course of action. But the police is hardly bothered to get the girl medically examined for initiating any action against the accused, he alleged.				 																																																	The police said the matter was still under investigation and whatever was required would soon be done. 				 																																																	The victim said she was kidnapped on August 8, 2001, by her neighbour Sajjad Ali and his wife. They came to my school and took me with them, saying my father was in hospital in a serious condition. But they took me to Chandigarh threatening dire consequences, she said. 				 																																																	The victims cousin, a Samajwadi Party activist who had gone to Punjab and Haryana High Court in Chandigarh, spotted the girl. 				 																																																	Her parents alleged that the police registered an FIR after six months and that, too, on the intervention of some social workers. They were not ready to lend us an ear, they added. 				 																Tourists die in boat capsize				 																																																	Bacolod (Philippines) (AP): Two Indian tourists drowned when their small boat with eight other Indians capsized in rough seas in central Philippines, police said.

																								Patna, Jan. 17: Fourteen minors from Bihars Sitamarhi district, who were rescued from Mumbai last month, were handed over to their parents here, says our special correspondent.																								The children were allegedly subjected to physical and mental torture, denied wages and forced to live in sub-human conditions in the outskirts. They were produced in the juvenile courts there and were ordered back to Bihar. 																								The minors, aged between 9 and 14, were engaged in various silk units violating minimum wages rules.																								The child labourers were first brought to the chairman of the Bihar Assembly council, Mohammad Jabir Hussain who said the state government had been directed to grant the children compensation of Rs 20,000 each. The government will make adequate arrangements for their rehabilitation, Hussain said.

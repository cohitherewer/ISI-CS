 K. SUBRAHMANYA 																								New Delhi, Dec. 11: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has rejected the Opposition demand for setting up a joint parliamentary committee to probe the Judeo tape episode, asserting that nothing will come out by constituting it. 																								Replying to a special Lok Sabha debate on an Opposition-sponsored motion, Vajpayee said the CBI was already holding preliminary inquiry into the cash-on-camera scandal involving Dilip Singh Judeo and assured members that the inquiry would be impartial and throw light on all aspects of the case. 																								The Opposition was denigrating the CBI by charging that the premier investigating agency was biased, Vajpayee said and added that such criticism would not do anybody any good. 																								Moreover, even if a JPC were constituted to go into the case, its members would still have to rely on the CBI to establish the authenticity of the videotape, the identity of the persons who allegedly paid Judeo money and the reasons for which it was paid. Proper inquiry will start once these questions were answered, he said. 																								The Prime Minister also rejected the Opposition charge that his government was treating Judeos case and Ajit Jogis money-for-MLAs scandal differently. What double standards are you talking about? What touchstones are you talking about? Dont you see Jogi peeping from behind the curtain? he asked. 																								The two cases were different. In Jogis case, he was playing the game openly, whereas in Judeos case basic questions were yet to be ascertained, Vajpayee said.

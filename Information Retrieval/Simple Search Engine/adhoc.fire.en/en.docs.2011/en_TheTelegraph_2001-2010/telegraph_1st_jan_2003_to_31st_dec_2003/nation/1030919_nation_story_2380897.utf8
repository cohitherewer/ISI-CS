The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, September 19, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Rape accused acquitted				 																																																										The sessions court here set free Bidhan Mukherjee, Pinto Ghosh and Rampath holding that though the blood sample of Mukherjee, the prime accused, was taken, the investigating officer had not sent it for DNA tests.				 																																																										However, the court did not pass any strictures against the investigating officer as he has retired from service. The law department has decided not to file an appeal keeping in view the sensitive nature of the case.				 																																																										Mansi, Mukherjees aunt, ran a placement cell and got a woman from Bengal employed as a maid with a lady doctor at Meenakshi Garden in west Delhi. But the doctor sent the woman back to Mansis house at Malviya Nagar as she fell ill.				 																																																										On September 23, 2000, Mukherjee allegedly raped the woman at Mansis residence. The woman did not register a complaint immediately as the trio allegedly threatened her with dire consequences.				 																																																										When the woman recovered from her illness, she went again to the doctor for work. Finding the woman pregnant, the doctor sent her back to Mansi. Though she gave birth to a baby, it died after a few months.				 																																																										The three accused were arrested on May 16, 2001.				 																																																										The defence contended that not only was there a delay in filing of the complaint, DNA tests were also not carried out.				 																Breather for blacklisted NRIs New Delhi (PTI): The names of 355 Sikh  non-resident Indians, who were allegedly blacklisted due  to adverse activities following Operation Bluestar and denied  visas, have been cleared after the National Human Rights  Commissions intervention.				 																																																										The panel initiated action on the basis of a letter received by the National Commission for Minorities, which pointed out that certain Sikh NRIs were being denied visas. 				 																																																										Issuing a notice to the home ministry, the NHRC sought information on the number of blacklisted NRIs, the date when the list was last revised, the current status of the list and the possibility of its expeditious revision, sources said. 				 																																																										The ministry last month said in a report there were 489 names in the 1998-99 negative list of persons of Indian origin holding foreign citizenship who were to be denied visas, the sources said. 				 																																																										NHRC was told the list was reviewed from time to time and on July 28 this year, the last deletion circular was issued. The number of persons on the negative list as on August 6 was given as 134, they said.				 																Youth forcibly operated upon Akola (PTI): An unmarried youth was allegedly  forcibly operated upon in a family planning camp on September  16 by a nurse and an agent to meet the target number of  cases. Police have registered a case against them following  a complaint by the youths father.				 																																																										The youth, from Dharni village in Amravati district, was deranged. The agent and the nurse took advantage of this and allegedly took his consent and performed the operation, the police said. Under the family planning scheme, nurses have a target of 30 cases per year and those who fail to meet it are not given increments.				 																Hospital ransacked				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): Shiv Sena activists allegedly ransacked a private hospital in suburban Mira Road asking the authorities to fulfil the wage demands of some employees, who were dissatisfied with their increments, police said.

Sobhraj alert Kathmandu (PTI): Police have raided some  hotels in the tourist centre of Thamel here following reports  that notorious criminal Charles Sobhraj was sighted there  on Tuesday. A local newspaper had published a photograph  purportedly showing Sobhraj in Thamel on Wednesday.

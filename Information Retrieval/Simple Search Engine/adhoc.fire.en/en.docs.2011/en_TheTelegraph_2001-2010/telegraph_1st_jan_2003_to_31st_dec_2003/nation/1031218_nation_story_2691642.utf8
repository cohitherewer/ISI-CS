		 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Bakery case put off
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Dec. 17: The Best Bakery case that came up for hearing before a division bench of Gujarat High Court today has again been adjourned. 																								Justice A.L. Dave passed an oral order, not before me, meaning the hearing cannot take place before the division bench. The case has been referred to the chief justice, who will have to constitute another bench which will hear the amended appeal filed by the state government challenging the acquittal of 21 accused and seeking retrial.																								On December 1, the high court had adjourned the hearing after about 10 lawyers appearing for the accused submitted that they had not received the paper book prepared by the prosecution. The lawyers had asked for three weeks to obtain and study the paper book. Advocate-general S.. Shelat, appearing for the government, had said he had no objection. 																								On June 27, a fast-track court in Vadodara had acquitted 21 people accused in the Best Bakery massacre during the post-Godhra communal riots. After the National Human Rights Commission filed a petition in the Supreme Court and key witness Zahira Sheikh revealed that she had been forced to turn hostile by a local BJP legislator, the court pulled up the state government.

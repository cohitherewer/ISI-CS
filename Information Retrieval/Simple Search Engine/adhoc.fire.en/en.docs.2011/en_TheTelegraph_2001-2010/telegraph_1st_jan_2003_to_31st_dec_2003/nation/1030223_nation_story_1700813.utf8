The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 Cricket survey
																								But falling Indian batting line-up = falling advertising returns, warns TAMs S Group, a specialised strategy cell that analysed the date.																								According to a minute-by-minute analysis of viewership in the Mumbai market, they have measured this decline. 																								Calling it the Sachin Phenomenon, the survey says that Tendulkars wicket causes a massive viewership drop of 20 per cent. As Australia romped home to victory, the TRP fell to less than 1, while it shot up to 16 as India looked close to a victory during the India-Holland match. 																								Availability of Set Max increased to almost 100 per cent in all metros, thanks to the demand felt by cable operators. It rose to almost 100 per cent from around 5 per cent in Mumbai and a little less than 10 per cent in Calcutta in the previous week. 																								The top six metros, Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad, recorded the highest rate of viewership, with Uttar Pradesh and the rest of Karnataka coming up next. 																								The survey also measured the audience for the ad spots and said Pepsi was the winner. According to figures from TAM AdEx Services, the brands in cable and satellite homes that made it to the top slots during the week on DD and Set Max, are Pepsi, Reliance India Mobile, Close Up Lemon Mint T Pas, Bharat Petroleum Mak, Samsung CTV, Bajaj Pulsar, Thums Up, Videocon CTV, Fair and Lovely Ayurdevic Fairness Cream and Coca Cola. 																								For all television homes, the brands are Pepsi, BSNL, Bajaj Pulsar, Reliance India Mobile, Pepsodent Germicheck Plus, Videocon CTV, Coca Cola, Close Up Lemon Mint T Pas, Thums Up and Pepsi Blue. 																								The brands made their mark on their audience, says TAM, quite emphatically, with 100 per cent audience retention on Set Max during the breaks while the India-Australia match was on. That means the viewers didnt just walk away from their TV sets during the commercials and there was no movement to other channels.																								It was a clear victory over Lagaan, the blockbuster that proved another winner for Sony, which had recorded an audience retention of 86 per cent. This could be a function of smaller breaks on a cricket match, but reveals the involvement of all the viewers, says the TAM group.																								Pepsi emerges as the clear leader by delivering around 80 million gross impressions (40 million on DD and 40 million on Set Max). The survey calculates gross impressions by keeping in mind the number of times an ad is seen by the viewers and the audience mass watching it. 																								The message? So far so good for the sponsors, says the TAM unit. But given the sharp difference in viewership for a winning India and a losing India, they can come to their own conclusions.

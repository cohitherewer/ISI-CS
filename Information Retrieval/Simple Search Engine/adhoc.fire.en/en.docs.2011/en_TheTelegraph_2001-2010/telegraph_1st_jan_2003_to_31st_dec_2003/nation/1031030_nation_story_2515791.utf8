Anant and Bastar collector L.. Suryawanshi from their posts for allegedly violating the Election Commissions model code of conduct. The state will go to polls on December 1.				 																																																										Following the directives of the Election Commission, chief secretary Suyogya Kumar Mishra directed Jashpur collector B.S. Anant and Bastar collector L.. Suryawanshi to immediately hand over charges to the next seniormost officers of their district and get relieved, a senior official said.				 																																																										Anant was removed for travelling with chief minister Ajit Jogi in a private helicopter requisitioned by the Congress last week for campaigning and for participating in an official programme for distributing spectacles with Jogis wife Dr Renu, state election office sources said.				 																																																										In Suryawanshis case, allegations were levelled against him by both the Opposition BJP and the Nationalist Congress Party that school bags with Jogis photographs on them were given out in Bastar even after the commission banned its distribution, the sources said.				 																																																										Last Friday, the commission asked both the collectors to submit their explanations by Monday and thereafter ordered their removal.				 																Fingerprints must for US visas Chennai (PTI): Recording of fingerprints  of all US visa applicants would be made mandatory from next  year, a senior US consulate official said on Wednesday.				 																																																										It is proposed to have fingerprints of all US visa applicants taken on the spot at all visa processing offices of the US from October 26 next year, Michael Thomas, chief consul, consulate general of the US, Chennai, said. Thomas was addressing a meeting organised by the Federation of Indian Export Organisations here.				 																																																										Speaking on US visa regulations post-September 11, he said certain changes had been made in visa issuing procedures in the interests of national security.				 																																																										Thomas said under these procedural changes, visa applicants need to provide specific details about the purpose of their visit, place of stay and financial support in the US.				 																																																										The US consulate in Chennai is currently processing at least 180,000 visa applications a year and most of them are from Indian IT professionals, students and parents visiting their children settled in the US.				 																																																										Thomas said while the consulate was keen to encourage genuine travellers to the US, it was equally concerned about its security.

		 Friday, February 14, 2003 				 Togadia snubs court 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Feb. 13: Praveen Togadia today cocked a snook at both the Congress-led government in Karnataka and the state high court.																								If his presence at the massive Hindu Samavesh rally at Mangalore was embarrassing for the government, which wanted to ban the VHP general secretary from entering the state, his speech virtually challenged the high court.																								The court had earlier in the day struck down the governments order banning Togadias entry. But it had attached a rider  that the VHP leaders speech should not be derogatory to any religion or community or incite communal passions in the assembly. The VHP had approached the high court challenging the governments order.																								But not only did Togadia talk about Ayodhya and the VHPs plans to build the Ram temple at the earliest, he repeated what he has said often  Muslim madarsas all over the country should be banned because they are factories producing terrorists.																								He also said courts could not decide on the mandir-masjid controversy as Hindu sants and mahants would deliver the final decision on the matter.																								Under fire within the VHP for demanding that India support the war on Iraq, he steered clear of the subject today. In another turnaround, he praised Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for dharma raksha (protecting religion).

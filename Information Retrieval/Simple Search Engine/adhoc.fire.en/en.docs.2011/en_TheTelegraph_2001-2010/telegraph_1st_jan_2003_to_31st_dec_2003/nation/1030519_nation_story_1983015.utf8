		 Monday, May 19, 2003 				 Morocco push to terror fight
 SEEMA GUHA																								Thiruvananthapuram, May 18: India hopes that the attacks in Casablanca and Riyadh would force the international community to refocus on terrorism, and by implication, compel Pakistan to fulfil its promise to end cross-border strikes in Kashmir.																								We hope these two recent incidents trigger a fresh round of proactive thinking in the international community as to how civilised democracies can get together and fight terrorism, deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani said today.																								For India, it is important that the international communitys focus on terror should not be diluted. Advani did not refer to Pakistan by name, but the implication was evident.																								New Delhi is disappointed that the US has not used the leverage it has over Pakistan to restrain anti-India activities. Advani had put this across to US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage when the American official came to Delhi recently.																								As far as India is concerned, Pakistan continues to be the epicentre of terrorism. Its leaders have not done enough to dismantle its militant support system, despite joining the coalition against terror led by the US.																								Advani had said two days ago that he had no problems with Pakistan issuing statements supporting the Kashmiri struggle. What we want is for Islamabad to stop terrorism, he had asserted.																								Terrorism continues to be a menace to civilisation, Advani said today, reacting to the suicide attack in Casablanca.																								Delhi is hoping to exert maximum pressure on Islamabad to stop the attacks in Kashmir and elsewhere in the country ahead of its engagement with Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan are being urged by the US and the rest of the international community to cool the temperature in the region.																								After the September 11 attacks, the US, which had long been deaf to Indias concerns on terrorism, came to the forefront to organise the coalition against terror. But militant activities in the region have not stopped with the removal of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.																								Advani hoped that the fresh attacks would force the international community to draw up a long-term and effective strategy to fight terrorism.

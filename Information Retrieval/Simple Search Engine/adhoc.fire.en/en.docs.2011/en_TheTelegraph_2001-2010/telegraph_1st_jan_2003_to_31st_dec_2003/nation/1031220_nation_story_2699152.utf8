 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: Stung by criticism over its indifference towards smaller anti-BJP parties during the recent Assembly elections and its disastrous consequences, the Congress has decided to forge a joint front for the ensuing polls in Andhra Pradesh. 																								Congress leader in charge of Andhra Ghulam Nabi Azad said the party would like to consolidate all anti-NDA votes. We dont want a split in the votes of parties opposed to the Telugu Desam Party-BJP alliance.																								Azads assertion, made at a press briefing in the capital today, is a clear signal that the party high command will now take direct charge. During the recent Assembly elections, it had left the decision on seeking poll adjustments with smaller parties to its state units. 																								In the wake of the poll debacle in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the stakes in Andhra have become very high both for the party and its president Sonia Gandhi. The Congress needs a significant victory before the parliamentary elections that will follow. 																								Although Azad did not name the prospective partners, the party is believed to be eyeing the Telengana Rashtra Samiti (TRS), the CPI, the CPM, the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) and the TDP (NTR). 																								The CPI, the MIM and the TDP (NTR) are understood to have expressed willingness to join hands with the Congress. 																								But the party considered the most crucial is the TRS, which is perceived to have emerged as a key player in the states Telengana region that accounts for 107 of the 294 seats in the Assembly. 																								That the Congress leadership is seeking closer ties with the TRS became evident today as Azad announced the formation of a Telengana regional Congress committee on the lines of the Mumbai panel.

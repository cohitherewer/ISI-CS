		 Friday, October 17, 2003  Sonia fends off foreign origin jabs
 - Cong fights on two fronts
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA  Jaipur, Oct. 16: Sonia  Gandhi today took the issue of her foreign origin to the  electorate, an emotional move that was welcomed by the massive  crowd with repeated rounds of applause. 																								Meri deshbhakti par ungli uthane wale batayein, Indiraji ki bahu banne se lekar aaj tak kaun si Bhartiya parampara maine nahi nibhai hai? (Those who are questioning my patriotism should tell which Indian tradition or propriety of conduct was not followed by me?) she asked. Maine maryada ko hamesha upar mana hai (I have always given propriety top priority), she said, launching the Congress campaign. 																								In an obvious reference to her opponents in the NDA, she said those who could do anything and could resort to disruption and even violence for lust for power were unable to understand it. 																								She pointed out that following the death of Rajiv Gandhi, if she wanted, she could have had the countrys top executive post. But she decided against it. 																								She accepted requests to lead the party only when she saw that the values of the freedom movement were under threat and the unity of the 110-year-old Congress was endangered. 																								Contrasting her entry into politics with the self-serving politicians, she said: Main sochti hun desh ki rajneeti ko kya ho gaya hai, har cheez ko swarth se dekha jata hai.

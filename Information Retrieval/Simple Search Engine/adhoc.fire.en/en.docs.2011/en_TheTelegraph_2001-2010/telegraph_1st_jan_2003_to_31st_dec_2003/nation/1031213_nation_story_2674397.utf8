		 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Dissident heat on Amarinder
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 12: Amarinder Singh, whom the Congress had hailed as the second-best chief minister after Ashok Gehlot, has come under pressure soon after his Rajasthan counterpart was voted out of office.																								The Punjab chief minister, in the midst of a crackdown against Parkash Singh Badal, has come under attack in his own party. Taking a cue from the party high commands growing unease over Amarinders leadership style, his detractors in the state Congress have demanded a leadership change.																								On Thursday, agriculture minister and former chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal paraded 33 of the 65 Punjab Congress MLAs before a three-member party central panel to press for his ouster. Today, Bhattal staged a show of strength before Mohsina Kidwai, Congress general secretary in charge of Punjab.																								But, away in Mohali, Amarinder slammed the dissidents, saying he still enjoys the support of 42 MLAs.																								Party sources say a decision on the leadership will be taken only after the Manmohan Singh-led panel submits a report to the high command. Amarinder, who was reportedly told a few days ago to mend his way of functioning, may yet get a reprieve. 																								Senior leaders are concerned the chief ministers anti-corruption drive against Badal and other Akali Dal leaders could backfire on the party just like the Dilip Singh Judeo cash-on-camera episode turned the tide against the Congress in Chhattisgarh.  Badal demand																								Badal today announced his partys decision to seek an emergency Assembly session to test the chief ministers strength on the floor of the House. We will go to the governor with the demand. It is damning for democracy for a chief minister to say he has the support of only 40 in a House of 117 and still remain chief minister. Badal also demanded a CBI probe into charges of corruption levelled against Amarinder by his no. 2 in the cabinet, Bhattal.

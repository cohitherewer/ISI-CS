		 Wednesday, December 03, 2003 				 BJP settles a score with Laloo
																								Patna, Dec. 2: The BJP today snatched the Sitamarhi seat from under Laloo Prasad Yadavs nose, in what could be called a revenge upset in the Bihar bypoll, reports our correspondent.																								Sunil Kumar of the BJP defeated RJD candidate Shahid Ali Khan by 34,360 votes. Khan had won the seat last time  by a margin of 35 votes, triggering charges of foul play. However, his victory was set aside by the Supreme Court.																								The RJD, however, retained the Barachatti and Fatuha seats. Samata Devi  daughter of RJDs Bhagavatiya Devi after whose death the Barachatti seat fell vacant  defeated Rajesh Kumar of the Janata Dal (U) by over 7,000 votes.																								Although poll pundits had predicted otherwise, the RJDs Om Prakash Paswan emerged winner in the Fatuha reserved constituency. He defeated Sarju Paswan of the Dal (U) by some 2,000 votes. Lok Janshakti Party candidate Punit Rai stood a poor third.																								Fatuha fell vacant after Dinesh Choudharys election in the earlier round was nullified because he faked that he belonged to the scheduled castes.

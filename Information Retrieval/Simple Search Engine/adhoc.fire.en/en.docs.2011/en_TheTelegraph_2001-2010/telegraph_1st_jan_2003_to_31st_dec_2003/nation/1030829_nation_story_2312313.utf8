		 Friday, August 29, 2003 				 BJP to revise poll strategy
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: With its honeymoon with Mayavati over, the BJP is reworking its election strategy for the poll-bound states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi.																								Although the party has time to breathe before the Lok Sabha elections slated for 2004, the former Uttar Pradesh chief ministers threat today to expose those BJP leaders at the right time has left the saffron think-tank uneasy.																								While a campaign to expose the communal politics of the BJP may help the Congress in the poll-bound states, the Samajwadi Party-led government taking over the reins in Lucknow will only help the BJP.																								Now the Samajwadi and the BSP will cut each other and we will reclaim our old space, a senior party leader said today.																								The BJP has called its leaders from the poll-bound states here on September 11 for a two-day strategy session. Leaders from the heartland are also being summoned to chalk out a plan to expand the partys base in the politically-key state.																								The BJP central leadership will be holding a meeting with Uttar Pradesh leaders to chalk out a strategy. The date will be finalised soon.																								We will open a front to counter the caste-based politics of the BSP and the Samajwadi and our emphasis will be on development and to expose these parties. The BJP will play the role of an effective and positive Opposition party in Uttar Pradesh, party president M. Venkaiah Naidu said here today.																								Naidu also accused the Samajwadi and the BSP of indulging in vindictive politics.																								Reacting to Mayavatis Babri backlash, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadeker said there was not an iota of truth in her allegations. She is making false allegations every day. She is now accusing the BJP, but she has no credibility. In future, we will not respond (to the allegations), Javadeker said.

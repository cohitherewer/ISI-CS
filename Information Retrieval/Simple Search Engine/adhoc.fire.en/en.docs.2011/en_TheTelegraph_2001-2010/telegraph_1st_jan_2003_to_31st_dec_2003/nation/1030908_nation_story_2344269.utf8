		 Monday, September 08, 2003 				 Kalyan warrant 
																								New Delhi, Sept. 7 (PTI): Within hours of issuing a non-bailable warrant against former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh on Tuesday summoning him to appear as a witness, the Liberhan Commission probing the Babri Masjid demolition had converted it into a bailable one.																								The order was changed on the request of Singhs counsel B.B. Saxena. The former chief minister was summoned after he threatened to expose the role of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy L.K. Advani in the conspiracy to demolish the structure. Singh had said he would depose only when the commission questioned Vajpayee and Advani. 																								He approached Delhi High Court challenging the commissions order and to revive his earlier petition that was dismissed as infructuous after his counsel submitted that the recording of evidence had concluded.

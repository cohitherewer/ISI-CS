But both  love dogs that too Labradors, quite the ideal trapping  of power considering Russian President Vladimir Putin, too,  owns one, Koney. 																								While Buddy traipsed across the lawns of the While House, Golu and Bholu  Umas two well-groomed Labradors  are itching to be let loose at 6, Shyamla Hills, the official residence of the Madhya Pradesh chief minister. 																								To keep them company, Uma, clubbing her stunning electoral success with the approaching new year, has gifted herself two Labrador puppies. Kalu and Bhura  black and buff as their names suggest  were bought in Delhi during a recent visit and Uma brought them to Bhopal in her first class air-conditioned coupe. 																								Planetary positions have prevented Uma from moving into the Shyamla Hills bungalow, still occupied by her predecessor, Digvijay Singh. A makeshift temple is also coming up in the bungalow to take care of the sadhvis religious commitments. 																								While the dogs are assured plenty of open spaces to exercise their limbs, their menu in the chief ministers household is a little limited. Sources close to Uma said the sadhvi is a strict vegetarian when it comes to feeding her favourite pets. 																								Unlike Buddy and Koney, milk, bread and rotis form the staple for Golu, Bholu and now Kalu and Bhura. The meals are often spiced up with cooked vegetables, which, Uma associates said, are relished by the older dogs. 																								Uma firmly believes dogs can live healthy and active lives on vegetarian food and cites numerous studies to back her claim. Since grains, vegetables and cruelty-free supplements can meet all the needs of a dog, why not choose the diet that causes as little suffering as possible, she argues. 																								From her experience, the sadhvi claims that cooked vegetables are easily digested by dogs. Baking is best for nutrient retention, but boiling is fine if you use the water in the food. Dogs love most cooked vegetables, but prefer them cut into small pieces or pureed. Whole cooked potatoes make an excellent snack. 																								One of Umas aides said the question of proper nutrition is not related to whether or not the diet contains animal products, but rather whether it contains sufficient amounts and proportions of a variety of nutrients. 																								Quoting from a study by the US National Research Council, he said dogs require specific nutrients, not specific foodstuffs. Research comparing the digestibility of meat and plant protein found that no differences in protein digestion of cereal-based diets... were observed in this experiment, he added. 																								The aide, who spent considerable time with Uma planning her electoral campaign, said she plays with the dogs and feeds them whenever she gets time.

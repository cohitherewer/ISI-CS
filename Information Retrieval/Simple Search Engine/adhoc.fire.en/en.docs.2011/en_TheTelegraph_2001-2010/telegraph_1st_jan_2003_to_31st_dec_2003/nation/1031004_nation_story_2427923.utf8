		 Saturday, October 04, 2003 				 Kalam speech creates code row
 K. SUBRAHMANYA New Delhi, Oct. 3: Fourteen  months in Rashtrapati Bhavan, and A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has  not courted controversy even with a bargepole. But, unknown  to him, a storm of sorts is brewing in Bhopal and he is  its eye.																								Hoardings screaming that President Kalam had spoken up for one of the BJPs pet demands  uniform civil code have sprouted on the streets of poll-bound Bhopal, courtesy star sadhvi Uma Bharti.																								Chief minister aspirant and the BJPs state poll campaign leader, Bharti is believed to have swooped on a four-day-old media report alleging that the President supported the common code at an interactive session with children in Chandigarh on Monday.																								Quoting the remark freely to add sting to its campaign, the BJP has been using it to throw chief minister Digvijay Singhs barbs on soft Hindutva back in his face.																								Rashtrapati Bhavan today expressed surprise that such reports had come out in a section of the press. Although four days too late, official sources said the media had inaccurately reported what the President said.																								The sources said Kalam had been responding to a schoolgirls query on what he thought about the common code. All he had said was that in a country with a population of over a billion,  the laws should be uniformly applied to all.																								As the President had used the word uniform and the question had been on the civil code, reporters had wrongly interpreted his remark to mean that he was for the code, the sources explained. The report was not correct, they said, adding they had been present at the Chandigarh interaction.																								Rashtrapati Bhavan has not issued a formal clarification. The President is away in Hyderabad.

		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 CBI to quiz Jogi accuser
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 11: The CBI will question BJP state secretary Virendra Pandey, who had lodged a complaint against former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi accusing him of trying to bribe party legislators to defect.																								CBI sources said that since Pandey was a complainant in the case, the bureau would have to question him to find out what transpired between him and Jogi and how and when Rs 45 lakh allegedly changed hands to finance a split.																								A CBI team has landed in Raipur and taken into custody the case diary, original audio tapes, the Rs 45 lakh that Jogi allegedly offered and the former chief ministers hand-written letter to the governor. Sources said the CBI will try to ascertain the source of the money.																								A team of forensic experts would reach Raipur tomorrow to conduct a voice spectography test by matching those heard on the tape with the real ones. The tapes purportedly have Jogis voice on them trying to bribe the BJP members.																								The investigators have also questioned local police officers, who were handling the case before it was passed on to the CBI.																								In the cash-on-camera scam, former Union minister of state for environment and forests Dilip Singh Judeo and his additional private secretary, Natwar Rataria, appeared before the CBI today.																								Senior bureau officials confirmed that the duo had appeared before the investigators, but added that they would be called again.

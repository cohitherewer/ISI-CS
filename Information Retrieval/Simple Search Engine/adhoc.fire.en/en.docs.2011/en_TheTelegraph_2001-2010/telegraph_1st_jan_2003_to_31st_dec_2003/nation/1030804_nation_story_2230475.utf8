																								New Delhi, Aug. 3 (PTI): Mohammad Shahabuddin, the controversial Rashtriya Janata Dal MP from Siwan, said he was ready to surrender but would wait for the verdict of the Siwan court on August 7 on his bail petition.																								The MP, however, alleged that Bihar director-general of police D.P. Ojha initiated action against him for cheap publicity.																								I am ready to surrender but would like to avail of my right to seek anticipatory bail, Shahabuddin, against whom an arrest warrant has been issued in a kidnapping case, told a news channel from Gorakhpur where he suddenly got off yesterday while going to Siwan by train.																								Ojha refused to comment on the allegation. He said in Patna that Shahabuddin was an accused and action would be initiated against him. The MP said he disembarked from the train after getting a message that a crowd was waiting for him at Siwan and his arrival could lead to a law and order problem.

																								Hyderabad, Jan. 28: Iranian President Syed Khatami today urged the Indian government to treat Muslims as assets, reports our special correspondent.																								At a reception in the Iranian consulate here, Khatami, who arrived from Delhi after witnessing Republic Day celebrations, said Muslims should participate actively in the progress and development of the land they live in. He said they should also help contain extremism and communal tension.																								Khatami also visited the IT establishments at Hitech City to preview the initiatives taken up by the state government in the IT sector. We are hopeful of a fruitful understanding with Andhra Pradesh for replication of some of the IT initiatives, he said.																								Later speaking to newsmen, Iranian foreign minister Kamal Karrazi said: It appeared that the US had an hidden agenda, in its attempts to wage war on Iraq.																								 and urged the West to prevail upon the US against waging a war and also appealed to the Iraq to abide by the UN resolutions.																								Iran did not want any war in the continent as its impact was felt everywhere.																								Karrazi said it appeared that the US wanted to control the entire continent and hence was pressing its forces on Iraq.																								He added that Iran would not interfere in the talks between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. We have no role there and we do not wish to compound the issue, he added.

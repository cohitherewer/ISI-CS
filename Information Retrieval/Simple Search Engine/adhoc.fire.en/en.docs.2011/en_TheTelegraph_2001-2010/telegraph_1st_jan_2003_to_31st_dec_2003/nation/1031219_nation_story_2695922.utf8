																								New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Rajya Sabha has passed amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Act after the Congress-led Opposition walked out, reports our special correspondent.																								The Opposition said the government should repeal the Act instead of making cosmetic changes to benefit an ally.																								Jayalalithaas ADMK pressed for a division, with eight of its members voting against the motion. 																								The ADMK, whose government in Tamil Nadu arrested BJP ally and MDMK leader Vaiko under the Act, feels that the amendments will dilute the law.																								A key amendment empowers a committee to review a case under the anti-terror law. The review committees decision will be binding on the state as well the centre.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 7: Condemning Fridays suicide bomb attack on a Shia mosque in Quetta in which 53 people were killed, India today urged Pakistan to assess the internal cost of pursuing terrorism in Kashmir.																								Pakistani Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali had suggested Delhi was involved in the attack and referred to the activities of Indian consulates in Afghanistan near the Pakistan border.																								Responding with surprise and disappointment at Jamalis remarks, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said in a statement this evening: Pakistani leaders have unfortunately, on several occasions, referred to imaginary activities of our consulates-general in Kandahar and Jalalabad.																								Sarna said motivated and baseless reports had appeared in the Pakistani media about the activities of non-existent local employees of the Indian consulates-general. He added that Islamabad should give up its old approach towards Afghanistan.																								Sarna said: The government and people of Afghanistan, including those in Kandahar and Jalalabad, have widely welcomed the re-establishment of our consulates and the trade and project-related cooperation that has been facilitated as a result																								The spokesman said India severely condemns the attack on the Shias. But he went on to say: Continuing sectarian violence points to the need for Pakistan to assess the internal cost to it of the policy of using terrorism as an instrument of state policy externally.

		 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Vaiko plea turned down
																								Chennai, Dec. 12: A special court today rejected MDMK leader Vaikos plea seeking permission to go to New Delhi to attend Parliament, reports our special correspondent.																								Vaiko had moved the court on December 4, asking for leave to participate in a debate and voting on the anti-terror law amendment bill in the Lok Sabha. Vaiko was arrested under the anti-terror act in July last year.																								Special public prosecutor S. Jayakumar today said those arrested under the anti-terror law could not be treated on a par with ordinary citizens. He argued Vaiko could not hope to be allowed to attend Parliament as there is no provision under the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Tamil Nadu Prison Rules.

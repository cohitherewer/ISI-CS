		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Assam offers amnesty; raid on Myanmar lips
 A STAFF REPORTER Guwahati, Dec. 23: Assam  chief minister Tarun Gogoi today announced general amnesty  for all militants who surrender before January 31, hoping  those on the run because of the military offensive in Bhutan  will readily accept the offer.																								Dispurs move coincided with the arrival of news about the Myanmarese junta planning to flush out Northeast militants from its territory. Myanmar foreign minister U Win Aung made a statement to this effect in New Delhi this afternoon. We will flush out Indian insurgents, if any, in our country, he said.																								Nine more militants of the Ulfa and the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) surrendered to the army at the Four Corps headquarters in Tezpur. The rebels fled Bhutan after the launch of Operation All Clear there on December 15. 																								As many as 20 militants who were based in Bhutan have surrendered in Assam since the operation began.																								The nine rebels who laid down arms before Four Corps general-officer-commanding Lt Gen. Mohinder Singh included six from the Ulfas crack Enigma hit squad. They deposited seven AK-56 rifles, a carbine and assorted ammunition.																								The army did not allow the media to speak to any of the surrendered militants. All of them were whisked away to an undisclosed location after their surrender. 																								Gen. Singh said the militants reached Assam after trekking through dense jungles in Bhutan. He said the army killed 14 militants who tried to sneak into the state immediately after Bhutans offensive began.																								Realising that most militants were unwilling to surrender for fear of being targeted by the army while entering Assam, the government announced a few telephone numbers for them to contact officials before crossing the border. 																								Gogoi, who made the offer at a news conference, promised full protection to the surrendered rebels and steps to rehabilitate them. They are facing action in Bhutan and I appeal to them to be positive and contact us at the designated telephone numbers when they decide to surrender, he said.																								The chief minister said his government had made arrangements for the militants to convey their willingness to surrender over phone as most of them were wary of crossing the India-Bhutan border because of the risk of being confronted by the army. He assured them of safety if they contacted the government and promised to surrender.																								Making no bones about Dispurs eagerness to capitalise on the Ulfa and the NDFBs predicament in Bhutan, Gogoi said anyone willing to mediate between the government and the militant leadership was welcome. He said the government would facilitate his or her trip to Bhutan after consultation with the Centre. 																								On whether Dispur had sought details from Delhi about the operation by the Royal Bhutan Army, the chief minister said it was not necessary given the fact that the offensive was taking place outside the country. 																								Echoing minister of state for home Rockybul Hussains statement in the Assembly, he said the state government had no information about the fate of veteran Ulfa leader Bhimkanta Buragohain. 																								Gauhati High Court yesterday asked the army to hand over the body of the Ulfa founder member, if it is in its custody, to the police amid speculation about his fate after Dispur said it had no official information on him.																								In Bhutan, officials have yet to compile a list of the casualties during the past eight days. We require a day or two to complete the exercise, the Himalayan kingdoms deputy head of mission in India, Thinley Penjor, said from New Delhi.																								The envoy said the royal government had informed the Red Cross, which had offered humanitarian assistance, that its help was not required at this moment as we have been able to handle the situation on our own.																								He claimed that all women and children who had been staying in and around the militant camps were safe in transit camps.

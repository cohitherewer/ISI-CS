		 Wednesday, May 21, 2003 				 Respite for son of ex-minister
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 20: The Supreme Court has stayed the arrest of Jeevan Bose, son of former Kerala minister Dhamodharan, in a cheque bounce case on a complaint by his sister, Girija.																								A vacation bench of Justices Santosh Hegde and Shivraj Patel yesterday issued the stay after petitioners counsel T. Raja told the court that Bose had already undergone one-month imprisonment and had settled the amount due to his sister while in jail.																								After coming out on parole, Bose sought remission of the sentence but Kerala High Court declined the plea on the ground that only the Centre, through the Union home ministry, was competent to give remission.																								Bose appealed to the Centre but the matter was not disposed of by the Union home ministry. On his appeal, the high court directed the Central government to dispose of the application on or before May 28 and hence no fresh arrest should be made, Raja said. 																								Bose had borrowed Rs 1,33,000 from his elder sister and had issued a cheque to her as a security to the loan. 																								But due to a quarrel in the family, she presented the cheque in the bank, which bounced back for paucity of funds.																								She then complained under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act and the case ended in the conviction of Bose with one-year simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs 5,000. Bose had surrendered and while in jail paid his sister.

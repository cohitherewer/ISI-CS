		 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Madhumita killer
																								New Delhi, Nov. 11 (PTI): Madhumita Shuklas domestic help today identified Prakash Chander Pandey as one of two persons who had called on her before she was found murdered. 																								Desraj, the lone witness in the case, recognised Pandey, arrested yesterday in Lucknow, at an identification parade in Unnao jail, CBI sources said.																								Desraj had earlier identified Santosh Kumar Rai as the second of the duo that had called on the poet, whose murder led to the arrest of former minister Amarmani Tripathi, at her Paper Mill Colony flat in Lucknow on May 9. He was arrested on November 6. 																								The CBI believes Pandey pulled the trigger, the sources said. The bureau is now searching for the murder weapon. 																								The CBI today sought a stay from Allahabad High Court on a lower court order allowing Tripathi to attend the ongoing Assembly session and its subsequent quashing. 																								The agency had protested that Tripathi, lodged in a Lucknow jail, might try to influence witnesses. 																								The petition may be taken up tomorrow, bureau sources said.

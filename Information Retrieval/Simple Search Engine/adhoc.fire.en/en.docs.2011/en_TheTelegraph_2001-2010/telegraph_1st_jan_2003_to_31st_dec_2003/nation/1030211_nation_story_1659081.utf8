		 Tuesday, February 11, 2003 				 Sudarshan speaks up for Saddam
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 10: Iraq and Saddam Hussein may have found an unexpected ally  the RSS. Its chief, K.S. Sudarshan, has come out strongly against the US proposed strike on Iraq. Instead of Iraq, the US should tighten its leash on Pakistan, he said.																								Sudarshans statement on the proposed strike on Iraq will appear in the next issue of the RSS journal Panchajanya, which will hit the stands tomorrow. An abridged version, which was given to the press today, quoted the sarsanghchalak as saying: 																								To protect its own interests, America can make any excuse to attack Iraq. But the results will not be good from any viewpoint. Even American interests will be harmed.																								Urging India to strongly oppose the war, he said the argument that the US was striking at Iraq only to end terrorism was untrue. If that was the case, the US would first have taken action against Pakistan, asserted the RSS chief.																								Sudarshan advocated a pro-Iraq line for two more reasons: Iraq had always supported India on the Kashmir issue and had supplied oil at a low rate to the country. Our interests are linked to that of Iraq, he stressed.																								The RSS chief made out a case for the US to first come down on Pakistan. Even today Pakistan is encouraging terrorism. All the terrorists are holed up there. It is said that even Osama bin Laden is hiding in Pakistan, he maintained.																								However, despite such proof, the US continued to help Pakistan, he noted ruefully. Even recently it offered a $363 million aid package. The US only offers India false sympathy but in concrete terms it refuses to act on Pakistan, alleged the RSS chief.

		 Sunday, October 26, 2003 				 Sacked officer sues BSF
 New Delhi, Oct. 25 (PTI):  A 30-year-old man, who wants to make his case a precedent  for HIV positive people in the armed forces, has taken the  BSF to court for dismissing him from service in an alleged  show of discrimination after he disclosed that he had AIDS.																								The former BSF personnel, P. Bala Husein, said the force should not have thrown him out of work solely on the ground that he had tested positive for AIDS.																								Husein, awaiting the next court hearing in November, told a private television channel that a senior BSF officer had told him to leave the job. 																								He told me that I was not fit for work any longer as I will die soon, said Husein, now putting in 12 hours of work as a security guard in a Delhi-based private firm.																								However, the director-general (medical) of the BSF, S.K. Jha, said Huseins services were terminated as he was not only HIV positive but was also suffering from tuberculosis and herpes.																								Altogether 86 personnel have tested positive for HIV so far in the BSF.

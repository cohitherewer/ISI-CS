		 Monday, September 08, 2003 				 Hurriyat splits down middle
 MUKHTAR AHMAD Srinagar, Sept. 7: The  All Parties Hurriyat Conference today suffered a vertical  split after 12 major constituents of the separatist conglomerates  general council expelled its recently-elected chairman and  senior Shia leader, Moulvi Abbas Ansari.																								The general council, which has 24 constituents, met here this morning and formed a five-member interim committee headed by Muslim League chairman Massarat Alam. The other members of the committee are senior Shia leader Agha Syed Badgami, Ghulam Nabi Hubbi, Ghulam Nabi Sumji and Firdaus Ahmad Shah.																								The committee has been asked to contact separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who was recently expelled from the Hurriyat executive, to lead the conglomerate. We will soon meet Geelani to request him to lead the Hurriyat Conference, Massarat Alam said over phone.																								In todays meeting of the general council, a no-confidence motion was moved, which was later carried by a majority against Hurriyat chairman Moulvi Abbas Ansari. He has been expelled from the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, Alam said here.																								Ansari lashed out at the general council, saying no one (in the Hurriyat) has the power to expel him. I was elected by the executive members. The Hurriyat executive is meeting tomorrow and we will take action against the general council members, he said.																								The general council also decided to expel the moderate Peoples Conference headed by Bilal Ahmad Lone, the son of slain separatist leader Abdul Gani Lone. It also expelled the Muslim Conference headed by former Hurriyat chairman Abdul Gani Bhat from the executive.																								Geelani was removed from the Hurriyat executive after he had asked the conglomerate to expel the Peoples Conference from the executive. 																								Geelani had alleged that the Peoples Conference had fielded dummy candidates  in last years Assembly polls  from Kupwara district. The Peoples Conference had denied the allegation.																								However, Geelani would now not have to carve out a new political party for himself as the split in the Hurriyat has made him the focal point of the hardline faction in the conglomerate.																								Political observers here say Geelani has emerged as a power centre yet again, routing his opponents in the battle for supremacy in the Hurriyat.																								The split has also come as a blow to the intended dialogue with the Hurriyat that chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had been advocating.

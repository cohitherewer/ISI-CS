		 Tuesday, January 07, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Damages on BA for denying seat 				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): British Airways has been ordered by a consumer court to pay Rs 22,500 as compensation and litigation costs of Rs 5,000 to an Indian passenger for denying him a seat on its flight despite his having a confirmed ticket.				 																																																	However, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission rejected the complainants claim for Rs 25 lakh and said asking compensation for remote losses like injury to professional standing and loss of reputation in the international community was not maintainable.				 																																																	The commission took into account the complainants actual losses and said the sum of 150, which the international carrier had paid him for denying him boarding, was not enough.				 																																																	A passenger who is denied boarding should be offered hotel accommodation etc. And also be paid compensation, and it is not that it should be done only on his request. A passenger may decline hotel accommodation (like in the present case), but he should be apprised of the offer, the commission said.				 																																																	In similar cases, the international practice was to provide both hotel accommodation and to fly out the passenger on the first available flight besides paying a compensation ranging from US $ 300-400, commission president Justice D.P. Wadhwa and members Justices J.K. Mehra and B.K. Taimni said.

Allowing the request by the Centres standing counsel, Jayant Bhushan, and counsel for Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to give them more time to file replies, the court specifically asked the Karnataka government about its initiatives as Veerappans latest activities were confined to its territory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, June 20, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Red rain sparked by Gulf dust cloud 				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The mystery of the red-coloured rain in Kerala two years ago has now been resolved. 				 																																																										Analysing data from satellites and a laser radar, scientists at the Vikram Sarabai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram have found that the culprit was a dust cloud that originated in the Gulf.				 																																																										On July 25, 2001, many places in coastal Kerala received coloured rain overnight and in the morning. The rainwater contained suspended particles and many elements, including carbon, silicon, calcium and magnesium. It was then believed that the water was coloured because of the presence of red spores of some species of fungus.				 																																																										S. Veerabuthiran and M. Satyanarayana of the space physics laboratory at the centre have reported in the Indian Journal of Radio and Space Physics that the strange event was due to dust from the Gulf countries in combination with several meteorological phenomena. A day before the rain, the laser radar located in Thiruvananthapuram detected a thick layer of dust cloud at a height of 4 to 5 km, they said. Satellite pictures taken earlier had shown the cloud originated over the Gulf. 				 																																																										High relative humidity (75 per cent) in that layer was conducive for the fine-grained dust to form the nuclei of raindrops spraying myriad colours over Kerala, the scientists said.				 																																																										The scientists said dust storms occur frequently during summer in the dust bowl of the Gulf countries. It takes about a week for the dust-laden air to travel from the Gulf to the Kerala coast. But red rains are rare. The spectacle witnessed in Kerala was because of a rare combination of the Gulf dust arriving at a time when monsoon activity was high on the coast and several other meteorological factors.				 																Call for CBI probe into affair				 																																																	 dehra dun (PTI): Uttaranchal chief minister .D. Tiwari has asked for a CBI probe into allegations that his revenue minister fathered a child by an unmarried woman.				 																																																										Harak Singh Rawat resigned on Wednesday after allegations of his improper relationship with an Assamese woman, Jaini, rocked the Assembly.				 																																																	iwari told the House on Thursday: In the interest of the people, I have recommended an independent CBI probe so that the truth comes out.				 																																																										The chief minister said he would write to deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, urging him to direct the CBI for an inquiry. Tiwari said the CBI would probe all aspects of the episode in which Rawat was being linked with Jaini.				 																																																										Tiwari appreciated Rawats decision to quit immediately, saying the move was in the best traditions of parliamentary democracy				 																																																										Rawat announced his resignation in the Assembly after a fact-finding House committee told Speaker Yashpal Arya that Jaini had named the minister as the father of her child.				 																Canada lists terror groups				 																																																	vancouver (PTI): Canada has declared three Sikh organisations and two Pakistan-based outfits terrorist groups, giving it the power to seize their properties and arrest group members.

Two Pakistan-based outfits, the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, are also on the list.				 																Airport gun				 																																																	Calcutta: A 65-year-old passenger was arrested at Dum Dum airport on Thursday for carrying a loaded pistol.

Trader killed				 																																																	Calcutta: Four youths shot dead a 40-year-old trader on Thursday night after barging into his shop at Maheshtala bazar on the outskirts of the city.

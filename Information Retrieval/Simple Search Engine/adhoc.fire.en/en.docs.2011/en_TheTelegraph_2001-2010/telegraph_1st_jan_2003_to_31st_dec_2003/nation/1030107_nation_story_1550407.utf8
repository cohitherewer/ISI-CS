		 Tuesday, January 07, 2003 				 Indo-Pak peace top priority: US
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Haass																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: The US today declared as one of its biggest foreign policy challenges this century the need to resolve the hostility and normalise relations between the South Asia nuclear powers, India and Pakistan.																								Richard Haass, director of the US state departments policy planning, emphasised the point and reiterated that an essential first step to cool temperatures was to respect the Line of Control and ensure zero infiltration into India from Pakistan.																								Haass visit and discussions with the countrys leadership occur in the wake of Delhis public articulation of its nuclear policy, which stresses a no-first-strike posture and a retaliatory capability that is massive and designed to inflict unacceptable damage.																								Indias nuclear doctrine has been seen in many quarters as a fresh warning to Pakistan to stop infiltration and exporting violence across the border. It is important that there be no infiltration of any sort across the LoC, Haass said.																								Describing infiltration as a regular topic the US has been raising with Pakistans Pervez Musharraf regime, Haass said: It is essential. It is important. We are working to bring it about. He was speaking at an interactive session on Current Challenges of Americas Foreign Policy, organised by Ficci.																								A detailed discussion on infiltration and cross-border terrorism will take place again between the US and India next month when foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal goes to Washington for foreign-office talks.																								The decision of Haass, a key member among US President George W. Bushs advisors and policy-makers, to club India-Pakistan hostilities with half a dozen other challenges facing US foreign policy  including global terrorism, North Korea, Iraq and the West Asia crisis  indicates that a nuclear South Asia is very much on Washingtons radar.																								Haass said the US would not impose a final solution on Kashmir  one of which is to convert the LoC into the international border. Washington, he said, was keen to help evolve a more normal relation between Delhi and Islamabad.																								Later in the day, Haass separately met foreign minister Yashwant Sinha and Sibal for nearly two hours. South Block made it clear it saw no change either on the ground or in rhetoric from Pakistan to spark any hope of normalising relations with Islamabad.																								The Indian leadership, though satisfied with the progress in its ties with the US, is not happy with Washingtons inability to press Pakistan to stop infiltration and dismantle its terror apparatus. 																								Haass said the US was doing what it could to make Pakistan honour its international commitments.																								He disagreed with suggestions that the US was no longer pushing Pakistan for a return to democracy. Though the October election in Pakistan was not the (most) perfect in the world, it is the first step in the right direction.																								It was now the job of the Pakistani leadership, Haass said, to ensure that democracy found its roots in the country. But we know that we cannot snap our fingers and make it come about overnight.

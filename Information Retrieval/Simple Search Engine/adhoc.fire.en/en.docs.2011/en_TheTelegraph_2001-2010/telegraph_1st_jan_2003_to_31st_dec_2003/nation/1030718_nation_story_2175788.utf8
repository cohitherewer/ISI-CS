 Seth bags a million and more 
 ROSIE WATERHOUSE  London, July 17: Time Warner Books has paid an estimated 1.3-million advance for a memoir by Vikram Seth, award winning author of the best-selling novel A Suitable Boy, after an auction involving 10 publishing houses. The advance is believed to be the largest paid for a literary, non-fiction title.The deal for Two Lives was secured by Seths literary agent Giles Gordon of Curtis Brown after five shortlisted publishers bid for the work on the basis of a proposal and a presentation by Seth. They did so without seeing the manuscript and the book is not due to be published until autumn 2005.Time Warners imprint Little, Brown outbid Orion, publisher of A Suitable Boy, and Penguin, the underbidder, which was rumoured to have offered over 1 million.Richard Beswick, Little, Browns publishing director, said it was not so unusual to bid for a work without seeing even a draft manuscript. Not for a writer of Vikrams stature, he said. He brings warmth, vitality and a profound, enriching humanity to all his writing.The deal was secured on the reputation of A Suitable Boy, a 1,400-page love story set in post-Independence India, recently chosen as one of the BBCs Hundred Great Novels, which has sold a million copies worldwide.Two Lives tells the remarkable story of his great uncle, Shanti, an Indian, and aunt Henny, a German Jew, who met in pre-war Germany as Hitler came to power, and eventually escaped to England where Seth lived with them during his adolescence.

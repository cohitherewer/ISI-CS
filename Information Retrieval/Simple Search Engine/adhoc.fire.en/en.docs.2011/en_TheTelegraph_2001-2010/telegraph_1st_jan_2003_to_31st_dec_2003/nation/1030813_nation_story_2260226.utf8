 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The VHP has roped in two architects to prove that the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was built on the ruins of three temples of various periods.																								The move is to pre-empt the Archaeological Survey of India, which has just finished nearly five months of excavation ordered by the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court to determine if a temple existed on the site before the mosque was built.																								Until now, the ASIs excavations have thrown up some articles that do not support the VHPs arguments. The survey is expected to submit its final report to the court shortly.																								Today, chairman S.P. Gupta and Suraj Prakash of the Delhi-based Indian Archaeological Society shared a dais with VHP leaders Ashok Singhal, Acharya Giriraj Kishore and Onkar Bhave to present their own scientific picture of the excavations. The idea was to rebut the claims of medieval historian Irfan Habib and archaeology professor Suraj Bhan that the ASIs findings did not confirm the existence of a temple.																								Gupta and Prakash, who have been associated with the VHP earlier, said there were three shrines dating back to the seventh century, eighth-ninth century and 12th century AD below the structure.																								The seventh century shrine was described as an apsidal Shiva shrine, made of bricks having a pranala in the north while a wide brick wall is supposed to corroborate the existence of the second temple.																								Gupta and Prakash said evidence showed the wall had collapsed when the Saryu river was in spate and a new wall was raised using the bricks and discarded stone remnants of its predecessor in the 12th century.																								They added that the evidence proved that the floor of the second temple had at least 75 black stone pillars erected to the north and south below the site housing the present sanctum sanctorum of Ram Lalla.																								Further evidence clearly shows that all these pillars were removed as today we get only the square stone pedestals and circular brick foundations of these pillars. This was evidently done by the builders of the disputed structure, the archaeologists said. They added that, in places, even the debris had been destroyed to level the ground.

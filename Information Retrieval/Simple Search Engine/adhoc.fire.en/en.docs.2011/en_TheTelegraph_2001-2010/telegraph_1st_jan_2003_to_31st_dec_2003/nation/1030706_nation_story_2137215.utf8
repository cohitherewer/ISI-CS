 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Rae Bareli, July 5: The CBI today told the Rae Bareli special court it had enough evidence to prove that deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and other top BJP and VHP leaders conspired to demolish the Babri Masjid.																								After deciding to bring down the Babri mosque, all the accused worked in tandem to give effect to their conspiracy. Leaders like Advani, Joshi, Uma Bharti and others delivered inflammatory speeches and instigated the kar sevaks the agency said, opening the arguments in the case against the leaders.																								Neither Advani nor any of the accused was present in the court, but were told to be present at the next hearing on July 19.																								CBI counsel S.S. Gandhi sought to prove that the accused were guilty of committing offences under Sections 153 A and 153 B (spreading communal frenzy), 147 (rioting), 149 (committing a criminal act with a common object) and 505 (creating ill-will between two communities at a place of worship) of the IPC.

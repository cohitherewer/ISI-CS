		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Talks and treaty on Sinhas US menu
 PRANAY SHARMA New Delhi, Dec. 23: Foreign  minister Yashwant Sinha is heading for the US for talks  on bilateral and regional developments and sign a high-technology  commerce agreement, close on the heels of Prime Minister  Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit to Pakistan.																								The minister is likely to be in the US from January 17 to 20 and his talks with the Bush administration is expected to focus on the progress made in the South Asian peace process. The US has been closely watching India and Pakistans peace initiative and has been encouraging the neighbours to keep up the momentum and normalise their strained relations.																								Sources said Sinhas main interaction would be with US secretary of state Colin Powell with whom he is scheduled to sign the agreement, negotiations for which began almost two years ago. The agreement not only gives Indian firms access to sophisticated technology in the US, but also indicates the maturing of ties between the two countries.																								Sinhas proposed meetings with US officials would give him the chance to clarify Delhis stand on relations with Pakistan and present his views on how the situation in South Asia has evolved after the Prime Ministers visit to Islamabad.																								Although the US has been mindful of not playing a visible role in bringing about a rapprochement between India and Pakistan, it has been urging the two sides to take more steps to strengthen people-to-people contact and create an atmosphere in which the stalled dialogue could resume.

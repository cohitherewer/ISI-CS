		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Couple turns to court against sons torture
 New Delhi, Dec. 29 (PTI):  A septuagenarian couple has knocked on the doors of Delhi  High Court for action against their son and daughter-in-law,  who allegedly tortured them and tried to usurp their property.																								Treating a letter from Suraj Prakash Kawatra, 78, and Raj Rani Kawatra, 75, of Mansarovar Garden here as a public interest litigation, a bench of Justices Vijender Jain and Pradeep Nandrajog issued notices to their son Navin Arora, his wife Neeru and police. They were asked to file a reply by January 20, the next date of hearing. The court also directed the police to provide protection to the two senior citizens.																								The Kawatras wrote in their letter that driven by uncontrollable lust for money, Naveen and Neeru had pushed them to the confines of a third of their house. The parents also alleged that in connivance with Neerus brothers, they had captured the rest of the building along with valuables.																								Navin and Neeru had allegedly obtained a power of attorney from Suraj Prakash on August 14, 2000 on the pretext of getting some construction work done through a builder. But Kawatra cancelled the power of attorney after 15 days as he smelt a rat.																								However, Navin illegally executed a sale deed in favour of Neeru on September 12, 2000, Suraj Prakash alleged. He added that he suffered a paralytic stroke after the unexpected betrayal.																								Navin and Neeru had also snatched a shop run by Suraj Prakash at Mahavir Bazar leaving the couple and their younger son with no source of income, the letter said. My son Navin and his wife Neeru have stooped down to such an extent that we are subjected to physical and mental torture and beating very often and thereby we have been reduced to mental wrecks, he alleged. Neeru had also tried to strangulate Raj Rani many times, the letter said.

																								Kolar, Feb. 14: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today commissioned what is probably the longest direct current transmission line in the world and also expressed concern at the alarming power theft situation, reports our special correspondent.																								He hoped engineers who have built the 1,376-km technology marvel between Kolar in Karnataka and Talcher in Orissa would provide means to stop power theft, which set the country back by Rs 20,000 crore annually.																								The high voltage bipolar line has the capacity to carry 2,000-MW power continuously. The installation is the largest in the country, third largest in Asia and the fourth largest in the world. The system, already at work, supplies about 500 MW surplus power from the eastern region to the south.

		 Tuesday, November 25, 2003 				 Common test offer from XLRI
 PINAKI MAJUMDAR																								Jamshedpur, Nov. 24: The Xavier Labour Relation Institute (XLRI), a leading business school, has suggested that the admission test it holds be also adopted as the entrance examination for the Indian Institutes of Management for the coming academic session.																								A letter containing the proposal will shortly go out to the IIMs offering them an alternative to organising the common admission test (CAT) they held yesterday but which was cancelled by the government on allegations of a question paper leak.																								The XLRI admission test (XAT) is scheduled for January 4. Father P.D. Thomas, the director of XLRI, said such a move would save the IIMs the time-consuming job of holding a re-examination, which would include resetting and reprinting question papers and finding a suitable date.																								XAT will be convenient for CAT aspirants as the examination is conducted across the country. We will take up the matter with the concerned IIM and CAT authorities within a day or two, he said. 																								Father Thomas added that those who qualify from the examination may opt for the IIMs or XLRI.																								After the alleged CAT paper leak, XLRI is taking some precautionary measures. Father Thomas said: We have been conducting the test smoothly for the last four decades. No question paper leak has ever been reported from any part of the country. However, this time we would be more serious and every precaution would be taken. I will soon convene a meeting of the XAT admission committee and the faculty members involved in setting the question papers.

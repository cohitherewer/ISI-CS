		 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Gujarat riot rapes under CBI scanner
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Dec. 16: The  Supreme Court today directed the Central Bureau of Investigation  to probe cases of mass rapes during the Gujarat riots last  year.																								A three-judge bench of Justices S. Rajendra Babu, A.R. Lakshmanan and G.P. Mathur, which ordered the CBI probe, directed the bureau to file a status report within eight weeks.																								The Gujarat government had initially opposed a probe by the bureau but relented after the judges said if the state did not order a CBI inquiry, the apex court would. At this, additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi, who appeared for the Gujarat government, said the state would request the Centre for a probe by the CBI.																								The order came in a case of alleged gangrape of a pregnant woman, Bilkis Yakoob Rasool. Rohtagi also said the government would order a CBI probe into other cases, especially the alleged gangrape of women from the minority community at Panivala village six days after the Godhra train massacre.																								The additional solicitor-general told the court that the CBI would confine itself to these cases as the state police was competent to probe other cases.																								Analysts felt the governments decision to agree to a CBI probe was a strategic move. Human rights activist Girish Patel said the decision was not prompted by a desire for justice but the compulsion not to displease the Supreme Court.																								The Congress termed it a defeat for the Narendra Modi government, which was forced to bow down before the apex court. However, both BJP spokesman Suresh Gandhi and government spokesman Saurabh Patel claimed they were not aware of the state governments commitment to the Supreme Court.

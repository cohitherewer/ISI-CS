		 Saturday, July 12, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Torture complaint against Bhoot Ahmedabad (PTI): A court in Rajkot has  ordered police to probe allegations of mental torture  against the director and actors of Bhoot, official  sources said.				 																																																										A complaint was filed by Kishoregiri Bhupatgiri Goswami, an employee of a courier company, alleging that he had been experiencing mental torture and sleeplessness after watching the horror scenes of the film.				 																																																										Goswami alleged that the scenes from Bhoot were haunting him even 20 days after watching the film. The mental trauma had affected his physical activities, Goswamis complaint said.				 																																																										Goswami has found a sympathiser in Rajkot-based Bharat Vigyan Jatha, a rationalist organisation, which issued a press release stating that such movies should be banned.				 																																																										Rajkot police commissioner Sanjay Shrivastav said officials were perplexed about how to probe this case as it was an unusual one. Such complaints are not very common and all relevant sections of the law would be considered before taking any step, Shrivastav said.				 																SC breather for Karunakaran New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday  stayed the trial against former Kerala chief minister K.  Karunakaran in the palm oil corruption case, reports our  legal correspondent.				 																																																										A division bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justice S.B. Sinha admitted for hearing a petition by Karunakaran, challenging the filing of chargesheet and framing of charges in the case relating to irregularities in the import of palm oil to the state when he was chief minister.				 																																																										The case was registered in 1997, two years after Karunakaran demitted office as chief minister. CPI leader V.S. Achutanandan had filed a complaint accusing him of corruption in the deal.				 																																																										Senior counsel and Congress Rajya Sabha member Kapil Sibal appeared for Karunakaran and said the trial court had rightly sent back the chargesheet to the police as the prosecution did not obtain sanction from the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Karunakaran was a member of the Lok Sabha when the chargesheet was filed, he argued.				 																																																										Kerala High Court had ruled that the Speakers sanction was not necessary to prosecute Karunakaran as the deal to import palmolein was struck during his tenure as chief minister and not when he was MP. Karunakaran challenged the high court ruling in the Supreme Court.

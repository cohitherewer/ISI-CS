		 Thursday, September 04, 2003 				 BJP calls for revolt against jihadis 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 3: The BJP has called on Muslims to revolt against self-styled jihadi militants, who, it alleged, used events like the communal violence in Gujarat as a security cover to justify their activities.																								Organisations like al Qaida, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Toiba and Students Islamic Movement of India, all known terrorist and secessionist outfits, are always seeking some excuse to camouflage their terrorist activities. This is part of a well-planned conspiracy nurtured by them. Earlier they used Kashmir to spread terror in the country. Today it is Gujarat, BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said today.																								Voicing his partys concern over the new ways of working adopted by these groups, Naqvi said what was particularly worrisome was that educated youths were joining them and consequently, sophisticated technology was also being used.																								He stressed the need for a strong social campaign against such groups and said it was especially incumbent on Muslims to revolt against such elements. 																								Because of a handful of such outfits, the entire Muslim community is in the radar of suspicion. Many European countries have banned new entries of Muslims and even Islamic countries like the United Arab Emirates have enforced an undeclared ban on new entries of Muslims from India, Indonesia and Pakistan. An entire community cannot be branded as terrorist because of a few organisations, but unfortunately that is the case because these groups have misinterpreted Islam and the concept of jihad, Naqvi said, explaining the turn of events post 9/11.																								He urged parties to rise above vote-bank considerations and not to link terrorist strikes with national happenings like Gujarat. Without naming the Samajwadi Party, Naqvi criticised it for opposing the ban on Simi. Today when Simis links to al Qaida have been established, what do these parties have to say? he asked.																								Naqvi said it was imperative for Muslims to revolt against militancy because its members are soft targets for these groups to infiltrate into the community and create a base to operate from there. He added that educated youths were being enticed by these groups on emotive propaganda.

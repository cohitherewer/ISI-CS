		 Friday, July 18, 2003 				 Composers at Advanis doorstep 
 SEEMA GUHA																								New Delhi, July 17: Bollywood music directors Khayyam, Ravindra Jain and Anandji of the Kalyanji-Anandji duo are here to lobby for a change in the copyright act to save the music industry from those who lift and remix tunes without acknowledging the original composer.																								The three directors, accompanied by music company executives  Universals V.J. Lazarus, who is also president of the Indian Music Industry, Sanjay Tandon of the Indian Performing Rights Society, RPGs S. Vasudeva as well as a representative of HMV  met deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today.																								We want J-52 of the Indian Copyright Act of 1956 scrapped, Khayyam told reporters after the meeting. He explained that once a song is recorded, the existing act allows the artist control over his product for just two years.																								After this period elapses, anyone can lift it without impunity, Khayyam, who produced the hits for films like Kabhie Kabhie, Reshma aur Shera and Prem Parbat, said. Unless this is changed, our music will continue to be lifted by producers, remixed and made to appear vulgar.																								Lazarus said the music industry had lost over Rs 400 crore in the last 18 months because of these loopholes. It is a grave injustice to music directors, producers, lyricists and music companies, he added.																								Khayyam was particularly scathing about the vulgar display of flesh in new versions of old songs like kanta laga. 																								They are nothing but an opportunity for the video director to exploit a young womans body, he fumed. Can you imagine a song like chandan sa badan being made into a vulgar remix?

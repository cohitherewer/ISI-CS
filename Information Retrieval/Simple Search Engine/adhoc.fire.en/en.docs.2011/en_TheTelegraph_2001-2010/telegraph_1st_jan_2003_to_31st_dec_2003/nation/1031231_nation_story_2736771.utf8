		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Talks with Hurriyat, but after summit
 SEEMA GUHA																								New Delhi, Dec. 30: The Centre is in no hurry to begin talks with the Hurriyat Conference and would rather wait till the Saarc summit in Islamabad is over to get an idea of where India-Pakistan ties are headed.																								The home ministry insists that talks with the Hurriyat, led by moderate cleric Abbas Ansari, is an internal matter. However, the reality is that Pakistan is an important factor in Kashmir.																								Officials are loath to admit in public that not taking Pakistan into account over Kashmir would be foolish. However, in private, they concede that deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis discussions would begin only after the government has picked up the signals on relations with the neighbour at the South Asian summit, which begins on January 4.																								Pakistan has always denied any direct involvement in Kashmir, and has maintained that it has extended only moral support to the Kashmiri cause.																								However, President Pervez Musharraf had said in an interview recently that Islamabad was willing to drop the demand for a UN-mandated plebiscite in Kashmir, though Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali was quick to insist on sticking to the UN resolution.																								Highly-placed sources in the government said Advani is in no hurry to plunge into negotiations. In fact, both sides want time to make their individual assessments of what happens at the Saarc summit. Talks with the Hurriyat leaders will take some time to be off the ground, a senior official said. The officials also insisted that the government does not have an agenda for the discussions. 																								We are willing first to listen to the demands put forward by the Hurriyat leaders. We would like to spend the first few sittings listening to them, explained a senior official.																								The bottom line is greater autonomy for Kashmir and nothing more. Discussions will finally have to boil down to this, another official said. The talks are likely to stretch over a long period and questions of autonomy would not come up till much later, the official added.																								Home ministry sources said Delhis aim is to keep the Hurriyat engaged. Engagement is a good way to learn each others point of view, a source said. The most Delhi can hope for, he added, is manage the situation in Kashmir as best it can and try to get the state back to the pre-1989 stage, that is before the violence began.																								The Ansari group of the Hurriyat has much more at stake than the government. By being called for discussions by the Centre, it hopes to regain much of the ground it lost to chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds Peoples Democratic Party.

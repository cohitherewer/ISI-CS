		 Saturday, April 05, 2003 				 Judge takes back quit letter
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 4: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) scam took another twist today with Delhi High Court Justice Shameet Mukherjee writing to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam yesterday that he wanted to withdraw his resignation to first clear my name.																								On March 31, Justice Mukherjee had offered his resignation after his name allegedly cropped up during the CBIs investigation into the DDA scam. The judge, however, wrote to the President yesterday withdrawing his resignation.																								Considering the type of reports appearing in the media, subsequent to my resignation, I consider it my duty now to first clear my name before giving precedence to my personal domestic circumstances, Justice Mukherjee said in his letter to the President. 																								I, therefore, hereby withdraw my resignation with a humble request to kindly not act upon my communication of resignation dated 31-3-03, he concluded in his one-page handwritten letter.																								The judge has also addressed letters for withdrawing his resignation to Chief Justice of India V.N. Khare and the Delhi High Court chief justice. In these letters, Justice Mukherjee has said he would like to remain on leave/not perform judicial work during this period of time required to clear my name.																								Justice Mukherjee has denied any involvement with the tainted DDA officials or Dharam Bir Khattar, the main conduit through which arrested DDA vice-chairman Subhash Sharma had allegedly been fixing deals.																								However, the question that is bothering the legal fraternity here is whether he can withdraw his resignation. Justice Mukherjees resignation issue was to be taken up before the full bench of Delhi High Court today, but the matter has been deferred till early next week as the bench could not meet.																								After the raids, senior CBI officials had a meeting with Khare and the Delhi High Court chief justice where the issue of corruption was taken up.

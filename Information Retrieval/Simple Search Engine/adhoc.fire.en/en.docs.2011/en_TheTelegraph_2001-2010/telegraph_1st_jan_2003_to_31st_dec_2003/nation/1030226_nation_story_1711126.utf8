 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Election Commission has rapped Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa for doling out pre-poll sops in the Sattankulam constituency, which goes to polls tomorrow.																								The commission has also rejected the state governments arguments in defence of its actions.																								The poll panel had communicated to the Tamil Nadu government its disapproval of the chief ministers promise to operationalise several projects that will benefit the constituency. In its letter, the commission said the announcements violated the model code of conduct and that it was constrained to note that such assurances were given only with an eye on electoral gains.																								Today, a full bench of the commission met to discuss the issue and rejected the state governments defence. A full bench of the commission has gone through the contents of Jayalalithaas letter carefully and it is regretted that the explanation offered has not been found satisfactory by the commission, said a spokesperson.																								The commission flayed the state government for taking recourse to semantics. Using technical loopholes, indulging in semantics and quibbling between promise and promise to consider are not the defence that the commission expects from a person holding a high political office, it said.																								The government had argued that the chief minister made no specific promises but had only assured the people that some of their long-pending demands will be met.

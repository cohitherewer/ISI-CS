 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Salman Khan																								Mumbai, Feb. 19: If Hansie Cronje can be invited to speak on moral transgression at Pretoria University, Salman Khan can also be invited to address children.																								The controversial actor has been invited to a conference in Abu Dhabi to speak on his life and times before schoolchildren, though unlike Cronje, he will be speaking as a role model.																								Khan, facing trial for hunting black bucks and chinkaras in forests near Jodhpur and also accused in a case under the Arms Act, was today granted permission by two Jodhpur courts to go abroad to address the conference from February 21 to 24.																								The conference  called Education without Border  will be attended by 500 students from 17 countries, along with senior business executives and academicians from around the world.																								The actor, who recently hit the headlines again after a pavement dweller was crushed under the wheels of his car, will be speaking on his experiences in the film world and of how he became one of the most successful actors of the day.																								The conference is being organised by New Medical Centre, an organisation based in Abu Dhabi, Khans spokesperson said. He added that actress Shilpa Shetty is also one of the guests, but said he had no information about the other speakers.

																								Mumbai, Nov. 5 (PTI): Large parts of Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat were severely affected today following a breakdown in power supply. 																								Due to the suspected fault in Maharashtra State Electricity Board system coupled with the prevailing low voltages at many strategic locations, there was a grid disturbance in the western region at 10.28 am leading to a power breakdown, Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd general manager Anjan Roy said. 																								Maharashtra sought an inquiry by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) into the failure. 																								Restoration work was initiated immediately by the power grid and the system was normalised by 1.00 pm with the synchronisation of the 400-KV Gandhar-Padghe line thereby integrating all the state grids, he said. 																								Mumbai was spared due to the immediate islanding by Tata Power Company and was ensured power supply also by Reliances BSES. But neighbouring Navi Mumbai and other cities like Pune and Kolhapur were crippled by the failure.

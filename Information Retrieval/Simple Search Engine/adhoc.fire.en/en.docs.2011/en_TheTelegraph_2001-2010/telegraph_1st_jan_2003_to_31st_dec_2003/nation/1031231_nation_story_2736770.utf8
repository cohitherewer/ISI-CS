 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 30: Abdul Karim Telgi, the prime accused in the fake stamp paper scam, has named Mohammed Sayeed, arrested here on May 2 last year, as the brain behind the racket.																								Telgi recently told CBI sleuths during interrogation that Sayeed was the key man. 																								He (Telgi) claimed that Sayeed, who was arrested from his residence in central Calcutta, was involved in the scam. We are working on the allegations (made) by him and (are) trying to find out whether he is trying to mislead us, a CBI official said.																								Echoing him, city detective department chief Soumen Mitra said: Telgi will claim many such things but the sleuths have to find out whether he is trying to pass the buck on to someone else and go scot-free. We had assisted the special investigating team to arrest Sayeed when he was picked up from Calcutta. This was one of his many addresses. He is presently housed in a Mumbai jail.																								Sayeed, in his mid-50s, is reported to be an expert in forging stamp and stamp papers as well as recycling stamps. Telgi and Sayeed were lodged in the same prison cell in Bangalore. 																								Multi-millionaire Antim Totla and his brother in-law Prakash Jakhete underwent a P-300 brain fingerprinting test at Ahmedabads Forensic Science Laboratory yesterday, adds PTI from Mumbai. The duo has been questioned by the Special Investigation Team from Maharashtra in connection with the scam.																								Investigation team sources today said Totla and Jakhete were subjected to the test in which experts take out an electro-echogram by fixing several electrodes to the accuseds body while he is bombarded with questions.

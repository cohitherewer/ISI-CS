																								New Delhi, March 2 (PTI): The Lashkar-e-Toiba has issued a fresh threat to unleash suicide attacks in India and Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee is among its targets.																								Pakistani weekly The Friday Times quoted Lashkar chief Hafeez Saeeds taped speech, played at a mosque in Rawalpindi, as saying listen o (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee, we are about to unleash a spate of suicide attacks. I have ordered my warriors to undertake this duty. 																								The Lashkar also threatened deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, saying his days were numbered.																								In yet another sign of continued failure of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to rein in the militants, Saeed said listen o Musharraf! we shall not submit to you or your government....We will not allow you to besmirch the jihad.... 																								The speech, in violation of law, did not spare US ambassador to Pakistan Nancy Powell and said: We cannot tolerate the unholy presence of Nancy Powell.... Pakistan should cleanse itself from her unholy existence.																								A former Pakistani general, Lt Gen. Nishat Ahmed, warned that chances of war with India were ripe as Islamabad was not keeping its word. Cross-border infiltration is on. The government may not be supporting it but it is certainly looking the other way.

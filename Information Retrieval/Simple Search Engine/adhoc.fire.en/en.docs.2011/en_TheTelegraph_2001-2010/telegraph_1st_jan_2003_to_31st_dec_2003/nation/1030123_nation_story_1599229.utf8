		 Thursday, January 23, 2003 				 CPM beats Delhi with Dhaka stick
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 22: The CPM high command has accused the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of treating the Bangladesh government with kid gloves even after the Left Front government of Tripura supplied the Centre with detailed information on terrorist camps operating from the neighbouring country.																								The Centre is conspicuously silent on the issue of terrorism on the eastern border. It is only interested in raising a hue and cry about what is happening on the western border, said CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury at a news conference today. 																								The Centre must initiate a dialogue with Bangladesh immediately, he added.																								Earlier, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had raised the issue of terrorism from across Bangladesh borders with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, also the home minister.																								The main target of Yechurys attack, however, was the Congress, the ruling CPMs main adversary in Tripura that goes to polls on February 26. The Congress has no compunctions about allying with the Indian Nationalist Party of Tripura (INPT), a unit of the outlawed National Liberation Front (NLFT) of Tripura, Yechury said.																								The CPM presented a detailed list of attacks on its cadre by the NLFT and the INPT between January 11 and 16 as proof of the extent of violence that was building up in the run up to the polls.

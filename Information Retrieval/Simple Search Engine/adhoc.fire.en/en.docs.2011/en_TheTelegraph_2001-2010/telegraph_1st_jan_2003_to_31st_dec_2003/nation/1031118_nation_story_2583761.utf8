 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 17: The panel set up to suggest how laws could be amended to bar people of foreign origin from holding posts in local bodies has been established to give the issue an objective look, said Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.																								Unfortunately, the question of whether persons of foreign origin should occupy constitutional posts has become political. It has got linked to one political personality and that is Sonia Gandhi. But we must go beyond personalities and study the matter in its totality, Modi, who is in the capital to inaugurate the Gujarat pavilion at the India International Trade Fair, said.																								I am not talking of the post of President and Prime Minister. I have restricted the framework to the post of sarpanch. Nobody can object to this, said Modi.																								The panel, the chief minister added, was eliciting the views of legal and constitutional experts, academics and other members of the intelligentsia and is expected to hand in its report in three months.

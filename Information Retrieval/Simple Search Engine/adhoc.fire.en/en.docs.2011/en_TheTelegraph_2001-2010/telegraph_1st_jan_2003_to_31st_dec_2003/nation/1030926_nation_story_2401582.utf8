		 Friday, September 26, 2003 				 Finger protest
																								Hyderabad, Sept. 25: A former legislator tried to cut his finger off in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly today to protest the raw deal meted out to Telengana in sharing of Krishna waters, reports our special correspondent.																								K. Varada Reddy, a former Congress legislator from Jangaon in Warangal district, tried to cut a finger of his left hand in front of the Gandhi statue inside the Assembly.																								But police stopped him and rushed him to hospital. A case was registered against the legislator.																								Reddy later said he wanted to focus attention on the non-release of water from the Sriramsagar reservoir to canals which irrigate the land in his native Warangal district.																								When Telengana Congress Forum leader P. Chinna Reddy, a Congress MLA, tried to raise the matter in the House, Speaker K. Prathibha Bharathi stopped him. As other forum members P. Govardhan Reddy and T. Jeevan Reddy rose in support of Chinna Reddy, Bharathi adjourned the House for lunch.																								The Assembly has been the venue for emotive demonstrations, verbal duels and fisticuffs, but this was the first time that anyone had sought to stage a bloody protest there.

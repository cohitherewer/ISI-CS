 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 15: Senior Congress leader A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhurys deal with a BJP representative to wrest control of the Malda zilla parishad is a non-issue for the party high command. 																								A senior AICC member today ignored the leaders reported assertion that he could not care less if the move went against the party line. The lone BJP members support to the Congress to control the Malda zilla parishad should be viewed in the context of the local situation in Bengal where the CPM was the main rival, said the AICC member. 																								In West Bengal, the BJP is not such a formidable rival. It is hardly our principal foe there. Nor are we talking about Parliament or Assembly elections. It is just a local election, he said. Such local adjustments do take place from time to time in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura where the Left has been the Congress main rival, he said.

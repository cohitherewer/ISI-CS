		 Sunday, April 06, 2003 				 Advani in conduct clarion call
 							 - Deputy PM preaches idealism as party unveils Powerful BJP, Powerful India slogan RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Pramod Mahajan and LK Advani at the BJP national executive in Indore. (PTI)																								Indore, April 5: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today said conduct in public life was more important than ideology because people judged politicians by the first yardstick rather than the second.																								Regarded as the BJPs most articulate and credible purveyor of the Hindutva ideology, Advanis apparent turnaround in his political position came as he delivered his concluding remarks at the BJP national executive here.																								The BJP leader said idealism was his partys distinctive tradition. It was the conviction that we were striving for a goal higher than our individual selves, he said. A goal for which it was proper and necessary to shun everything that had to do with oneself  home, comforts, security of a job or profession  and do everything that had to do with the nation.																								Advani cited the example of Jan Sangh founder Deen Dayal Upadhyaya  who, it was noted, always practised what he preached  to drive home the point that the BJPs culture of selflessness was its greatest strength.																								Ideology is important, and we are distinctive in that respect, too. But ordinary people do not judge a political worker by his ideology, by what he preaches. They judge us by our conduct in public life, he emphasised.																								The deputy Prime Minister underscored the importance of conduct by maintaining that it mattered more than even governance. Government performance is important, but even more important is the behaviour and conduct of the BJPs ministers, MPs, MLAs, office-bearers, etc, he said.																								BJP sources said Advanis remarks should be seen in the context of the partys defeat in the recent Himachal Pradesh elections.																								Although for official consumption the leadership had put it to central minister Shanta Kumars covert rebellion, in private sources admitted that many former ministers, including the chief minister, had cut themselves off from the cadre.																								The party-government disconnect has also been seen in Uttar Pradesh, where legislators and workers have periodically complained to the Delhi brass about lack of access to ministers.																								Advani placed the BJPs slogan of being a party with a difference in the context of the ideal he talked about today. The question I ask myself  and I would like all of us to ask ourselves  is: why should something that has been our strength, our sustaining force get diluted now when we are in power?																								Does this mean that idealism and power politics cannot go together? There are many who think so. We have to prove them wrong. Without this unique aspect of a party with a difference, the BJP will be seen as a party like any other, the printed copy of his speech given to the press quoted him as saying.																								Therefore, we must remind ourselves that we are not in power for the sake of power  and all that it entails, he added, expanding on the ideal that would go down as the most significant message emanating from a perfunctory meeting.																								Rather, we are in power, and we want to be in power for a long time to come, because we want to be instruments for the realisation of a higher national ideal. An ideal in whose light our individual self counts for nothing, but our collective self as the party counts for a lot.

		 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Bihar awaits CAT scam brain
 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Dec. 14: The Bihar unit of the CBI may soon manage to get custody of alleged CAT scam kingpin Ranjit Singh.																								The bureau, sources say, is planning to get him on remand in Patna in connection with the leaking of question papers of the CBSE medical entrance test conducted on May 1.																								The CBIs state unit had on December 11 registered a case (no. RC.24A/2003) against Singh and three of his accomplices from Bihar, as well as 12 students from various medical colleges in the state. The bureau had arrested the scam mastermind and his accomplices on November 23 in Delhi for the CAT paper leak.																								The bureau has already moved a Delhi court seeking the custody of the four. A team of its state unit had earlier gone to Delhi to interrogate them. 																								According to CBI sources, its interrogation of Bihar medical students shows many of them passed the entrance test with the help of the scam kingpin.																								Those passing the entrance test under the CBSE quota get admitted to the countrys top medical colleges. Bihar admits 56 to its six medical colleges. 																								It is believed that of the 1,600 candidates who passed the last CBSE entrance test, about 600 were from Bihar and Jharkhand, including those on the waiting list. Most reportedly took the test from centres in Mumbai, Calcutta, Nagpur and Delhi.																								This year, Rajasthan has reportedly outdone Bihar by bagging about 700 seats.																								Bihars medical education department is said to have found most of the students unqualified. 																								Recently, a newspaper in Patna reported that three months ago, some students of the 2001 batch at Patna Medical College locked up their principal M.L. Varma demanding to be declared passed in post-graduate exams.																								These students, admitted on CBSE quota, had allegedly failed the post-graduate exams.																								The income-tax department, too, is moving fast to book Singh for possessing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. There are indications that the department has traced unaccounted wealth worth Rs 2 crore from two of his farms. 																								Singh is also said to have properties in Bihar, Jharkhand, Delhi and Maharashtra, most of which are registered in the name of his relatives.

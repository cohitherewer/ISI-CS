 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 12: BJP allies Samata Party and Janata Dal (United) today joined hands with Rashtriya Janata Dal and Lok Janshakti Party MPs from Bihar in the Lok Sabha in criticising the step-motherly treatment meted out to the state, much to the embarrassment of the Centre.																								Prabhunath Singh, Arun Kumar and Raghunath Jha of the Samata and Devendra Prasad Yadav of the Dal(U) joined Raghuvansh Prasad Singh of the RJD in vociferously protesting against the Centres lack of concern for the development of Bihar and its attitude towards a financial package for the state.																								The turmoil also resulted in the House  for the first time  not being able to dispose of the calling attention motion under which the members wanted to discuss the financial package for Bihar.																								Calling attention motions are disposed of the same day. However, as the time allotted for the discussion was over and private members business had to be taken up, deputy Speaker P.M. Sayeed, who was in the chair, decided  following a consensus of the House  that a fresh motion be moved next week for the discussion.																								Initiating the debate on the calling attention motion, Raghuvansh Prasad said the condition of national highways in the state was very poor and accused the Centre of not taking any action despite repeated reminders from the state government.																								The uproar in the House followed minister of state for planning Satyabrat Mukherjees reply on the demand of the members from Bihar, which Opposition leaders and some of the BJPs allies termed highly disappointing.																								The members said they would listen only to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the financial package was a policy matter and Mukherjee would not be able to reply. Repeated efforts by Sayeed and parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj failed to pacify the members. Swarajs contention that the minister be heard and, if they were dissatisfied by his response, the Prime Minister could be approached in the matter, went in vain. 																								The MPs from Bihar relented only after the minister agreed to urge Vajpayee to reply to their demand next week.

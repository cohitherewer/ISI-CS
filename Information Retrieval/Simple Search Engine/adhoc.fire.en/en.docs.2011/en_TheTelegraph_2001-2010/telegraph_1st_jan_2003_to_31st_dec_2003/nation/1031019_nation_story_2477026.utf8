The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, October 19, 2003  Smiles all around, only VHP by wayside
 The Big Picture / Mahesh Rangarajan The peaceful conclusion of the  denouement at the temple town of Ayodhya has pleased all  key players but one. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad stands isolated  in the political landscape. The governments in both Lucknow  and New Delhi have managed to avert crises. A new precedent of co-operation  between regimes of opposing political hues has been set  in a troubled region of north India. Ashok Singhal continues to breathe  fire but there is little sign that the spark has spread.  In sharp contrast to October 1990, when Mulayam Singh Yadav  and the Sangh parivar were both on a warpath, there is little  resonance in the vast Hindi heartland. The card has been  played many a time and over and now yields sharply diminished  returns. The other possible explanation  is more complex. For both Mulayam Singh and the BJP, the  politics of polarisation is past the peak. The former is  trying to put together a new social coalition that has space  for all but the Dalits. This should explain why he has been  so restrained and measured in his containment of the VHP  cadre and volunteers. In the early nineties, north India  was just emerging into a post-Congress era. Both the claimants  of majority and minority support wanted to up the ante.  It was a means to garner and consolidate support. The Hindutva groups succeeded  beyond all their dreams and even came to power in 1991.  Ram Lalla proved more powerful in the voters mind than  the magic of Mandal.  All that was long ago: the saffron  party is now a shrinking force in Uttar Pradesh. What was once a masterstroke now  looks like a desperate gamble to hold together a constituency  increasingly, perhaps, irretrievably fractured on the lines  of caste. The BJPs predicament is of a  party leading the Union government. It is busy back-pedalling  on the emotive temple issue. The Centre even helped the  state government with central paramilitary forces. The government is also mindful  of the growing distaste in a significant part of the body  politic for the ferocity of the Gujarat massacres last year.  Any untoward developments at the disputed site in the temple  town would only worsen matters for the Gujarat government.  The latter already faces further Supreme Court strictures  on tardy investigation of the massacres. The party also put some distance  from Praveen Togadias comment that violence would follow  if the Ram bhakts were prevented from offering prayers  at the disputed site. In a sense, this suits Vajpayees  team in its larger battle plan. The new stirrings of realignment  within the NDA indicate the smaller parties will try demand  a greater pound of flesh. Any new conflagration will only  decrease the larger organisations clout. Conversely, a Vajpayee under attack  from the firebrands of the VHP attracts centrist support.  This only adds to his image as a man who stands above the  fray. He did appeal that the Parishad be trusted and allowed  free run of the town but it was a statement for the record.  It was not followed up and there was no secret about where  his sympathies lay in this instance. All the more so, since it is the  main challenger against Congress ministries in the four  Hindi belt Assembly elections this December.  The Ayodhya card and its variants  such as cow slaughter are simply not working. It is more  prudent to focus on the shortcomings of the chief ministers.  Riding a wave of anti-incumbency has worked more often than  not in the past. All the more so in north India where the  gap between promise and performance is all the greater. Interestingly, both Mayavati and  the Congress were left on the sidelines in the most recent  round of the battle for Ayodhya. Both are out of power but  trying to play up on the Samajwadi Party-led coalitions  record. Neither made much headway. Mayavati alleged complicity  of the Sangh and the Samajwadi Party and asked all trains  with kar sevaks be stopped at the Uttar Pradesh border  if possible. The political implications are  clear enough. The build-up by the VHP did not work wonders.  Bereft of a sympathetic administration and faced with police  batons and tear gas, the cadre are like paper tigers. The larger implications are significant.  The general elections are due a year from now. If the BJP  and its allied organisations do not play the Hindutva card  full tilt, it will deprive the Congress of a key rallying  point for secular forces. Few would have imagined a decade  ago that Ayodhya could signal such realignment. The VHPs  trial runs on the issue in the late eighties had convinced  the BJP that the temple could be its electoral mascot. Whether  the reverse will be the case is yet to be seen. But last  Friday did provide a pointer in that very direction.

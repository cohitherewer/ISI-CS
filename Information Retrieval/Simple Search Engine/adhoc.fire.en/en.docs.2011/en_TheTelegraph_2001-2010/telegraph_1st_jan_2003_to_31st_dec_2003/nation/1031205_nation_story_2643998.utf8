		 Friday, December 05, 2003 				 Two killed in flag clash
																								Hyderabad, Dec. 4: Two persons were killed and 15 injured today in a communal clash here, reports our special correspondent.																								Early in the morning, Sikhs in the Kishan Bagh area found the burnt Nishan-e-Mubarak (religious flag) of the local gurdwara lying on the ground, police said. Suspecting the involvement of Muslims, armed Sikhs attacked houses and shops belonging to the community.																								A 25-year-old autorickshaw driver, Mohammad Afzal, was stabbed. Ghan Singh, who was critically hurt, succumbed to his injuries. A sub-inspector was among those injured.																								Residents alleged that the violence continued for one-and-a-half hours but the police did nothing to stop the attackers who were armed with swords.																								Mahmood Ali, a daily wage labourer, said he was returning home when a group of Sikhs attacked him. A heavily-bandaged Ali said he was attacked by sword- wielding men. I was hit on the left hand and on the back, he said. A Sikh woman saved his life, he added.																								The situation was brought under control after local legislator Asaduddin Owaisi stepped in. He also got the Sikh flag restored.																								The situation is now under control. The elders of the two communities sat together and expressed their regrets over the incidents, the police officer said. 																								The police have taken 15 people into custody and swords were seized. Additional police personnel have been deployed.																								Kishan Bagh is an outlying area of Hyderabad with a Sikh population of about 7,000.

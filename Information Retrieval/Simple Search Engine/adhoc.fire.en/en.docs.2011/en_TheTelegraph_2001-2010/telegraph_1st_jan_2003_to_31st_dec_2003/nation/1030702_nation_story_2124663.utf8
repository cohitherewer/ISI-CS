		 Wednesday, July 02, 2003 				 Call for Ayodhya summons to Kalyan
																								New Delhi, July 1 (PTI): The All India Muslim Personal Law Board today moved the Liberhan Commission, urging that former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh be summoned before the panel.																								Singh had recently alleged that the BJPs top leaders, including Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, were involved in the conspiracy to demolish the Babri Masjid.																								The board said Singh being the main witness and the chief minister at the time of the demolition has special knowledge of the facts relevant to the commissions inquiry and, therefore, he must be examined. 																								The plea is likely to be heard on July 10.																								The board also pointed to the Centres reported stand holding Singh guilty of failing in his duty to protect the mosque.																								The former chief minister has been resisting being summoned on the ground that his submissions before it might be used against him in the CBI probe into the demolition.																								Singh had filed a writ petition against his summoning in Delhi High Court, which was dismissed as infructuous on April 1 after the commission closed recording of evidence.																								The commission maintains that if Singh chooses not to depose, appropriate inference will be drawn in the report.																								Only yesterday, Mohammad Aslam, alias Bhure, on whose petition the Supreme Court had banned all religious activity on the 67.703 acres of acquired land adjacent to the disputed site, sought summoning of Vajpayee, Advani and Singh, following the former Uttar Pradesh chief ministers recent revelation.  ASI seeks extension																								The Archaeological Survey of India today sought a three-month extension to complete the excavation at the disputed site in Ayodhya, says a report from Lucknow.																								An application was moved by the ASI before the special/full Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court.

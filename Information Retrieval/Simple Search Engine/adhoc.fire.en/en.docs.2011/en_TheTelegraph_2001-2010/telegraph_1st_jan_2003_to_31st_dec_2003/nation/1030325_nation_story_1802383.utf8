		 Tuesday, March 25, 2003 				 Centre smells Pakistan move to taint Mufti govt
 SEEMA GUHA				 	 Women of the minority community mourn the death of Kashmiri Pundits at Nandimarg. (Reuters)																								New Delhi, March 24: The Centre believes this mornings massacre of 24 Kashmiri Pundits is an attempt by militants to discredit Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, the popular chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, who poses a threat to Pakistans interests in the state.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani will visit the massacre site tomorrow for an on-the-spot assessment of the situation. Worried about the likely repercussions of the massacre on minorities, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security this morning.																								Apart from Vajpayee and Advani, defence minister George Fernandes and foreign minister Yashwant Sinha were present at the meeting. The committee reviewed the situation in Kashmir and decided to closely monitor events in the state.																								Government of India condemns the incident in strongest possible terms, Sinha said after the committee meeting. The government would put the situation under review and take whatever steps necessary to meet it, he said.																								The committee is aware of the dangers of Muftis attempts to win back Kashmiris. It knows his mantra of applying the healing touch to Kashmirs wounds is the best thing to happen in the state after the polls last year.																								As a result, despite having arch rival the Congress in coalition with Muftis Peoples Democratic Party, the BJP-led Centre has fully backed the state administration. Even the Centres interlocutor in the Kashmir talks, N.N. Vohra, is considered close to Mufti.																								The Centre, keen to exploit the goodwill generated by the free and fair Assembly polls, is aware that the massacre is Pakistans attempt to disrupt the cordial ties between Srinagar and New Delhi.																								The Centre believes Pakistan wants to discredit Mufti and put him on a collision course with the Vajpayee government. If this agenda fails, Pakistans other option is to put Mufti in a position where his political base is destroyed, so that he turns against the popular mood and becomes New Delhis stooge  a kind of Farooq Abdullah clone, disliked by Kashmiris as Delhis yes-man in Srinagar.																								Either way, Pakistan and the terrorist groups want to strike against Mufti, who poses a real danger to its interests, a home ministry official said. Our attempt is to ensure Pakistans gameplan does not succeed.																								But many in the BJP believe that Muftis soft approach towards militants has led to the current situation. They want the Centre to pull up the state and ask Mufti to adopt a much tougher stance against militants. Early today, there was talk the BJP would call for the state governments dismissal.																								When the BJP finally came out with a statement, it was watered down at the insistence of the Centre, which is in no mood to let down Mufti. He is doing a good job, but a healing touch must not be confused with a soft approach to terrorists, the Central official said.																								Advani is likely to ask Mufti tomorrow to strengthen the administration and ensure that terrorists are not handled with kid gloves. Senior government officials said the killing of Kashmiri Pundits, a day after pro-peace Hizb-ul Mujahideen commander Abdul Majid Dars, is a setback to the Centres peace push.

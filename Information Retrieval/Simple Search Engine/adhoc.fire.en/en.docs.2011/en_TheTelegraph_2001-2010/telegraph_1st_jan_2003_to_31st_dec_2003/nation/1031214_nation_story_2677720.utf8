		 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Buddha terror fire on Jaya
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bhattacharjee																								Chennai, Dec. 13: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today lashed out at Jayalalithaas repressive and anti-democratic policies.																								Winding up the five-day 11th all-India conference of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions at a huge rally in Maduravoyal, outside Chennai city, Bhattacharjee said: We will never touch black laws like Pota (Prevention of Terrorism Act), Tada [Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act] and Esma (Essential Services Maintenance Act).																								Dwelling on what he termed a very important issue in the light of Jayalalithaas dismissal of about 170,000 state government employees last July, Bhattacharjee said to lusty cheers from the crowd: I cannot even imagine declaring war against my own employees. In Bengal, our government thinks we and the employees belong to the same family. We share our joys and sorrows and we have no problem working with them, he said.																								Stating that the Left Front government had given the employees the right to strike, Bhattacharjee said: I also tell our employees leaders, let us work together. You should never give up the right to strike. That is your last weapon and they agree with us.																								However, during the last 26 years of Left Front rule, employees have never resorted to strike and that is our pride, Bhattacharjee added in a two-pronged response to Jayalalithaas July action and the August Supreme Court ban on strikes by government employees.																								Attacking the policies of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Bhattacharjee said the Centres disinvestment and privatisation moves had created serious problems for Bengal in particular.																								He added that the public sector Mining and Allied Machinery Corporation in Durgapur, several jute and textile mills and two fertiliser units were shut down recently. 																								We are trying our best to stop this closing down of factories. 																								Bhattacharjee, who was greeted by Citu comrades from Theni district with a garland made of elaichi, gently reminded union leaders that Bengals industrial sector had turned around thanks to new investments, including from abroad.

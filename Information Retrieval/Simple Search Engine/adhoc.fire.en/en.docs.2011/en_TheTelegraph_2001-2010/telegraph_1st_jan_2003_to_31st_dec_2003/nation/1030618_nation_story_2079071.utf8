		 Wednesday, June 18, 2003 				 Jogi takes lid off defame dossier 
																								Raipur, June 17 (PTI): Ajit Jogi today revealed the source of the document which led him to allege that the Intelligence Bureau was trying to tarnish his image and that of other Congress leaders.																								I told them (the CBI) that the documents were received by post. When I was convinced that it was a genuine document, I sent them to the Prime Minister, the Chhattisgarh chief minister said.																								He was speaking to reporters immediately after a CBI official met him for nearly two hours at his residence.																								The CBI registered a case on April 2 against unknown persons for forgery and cheating after Jogi wrote to Atal Bihari Vajpayee on March 31, alleging that the IB was being used by the Centre to harass political opponents. 																								He had also attached a list of his assets, allegedly compiled by the IBs special directorate.																								The chief minister said the directorate, through its Operation Black Sea, was targeting Opposition leaders in the run-up to Novembers Assembly elections.																								The CBI had written to Jogi last month, seeking time to question him about the source of the purported IB documents after being informed by the bureau that it had no special directorate and had not prepared any dossier on the chief minister. But it was not until today that deputy inspector-general Harbans Singh, who is with the special crimes division-II of the CBI, could question Jogi. Singh is also the information officer in this case.																								Speaking to reporters, Jogi said: The lone CBI officer sought biographical data from me, like where I was born and brought up, where I got married and to whom, and where my children were born.																								The chief minister said someone had given him a photocopy of documents on the operation launched against him, in which it was alleged that he and his wife Renu had bank accounts in Switzerland and that they possessed National Savings Certificates and Kisan Vikas Patra certificates worth more than Rs 1.67 crore.																								Todays proceedings were videographed and two close Jogi aides were present.																								The chief minister said he had asked Singh how the CBI would probe the activities of an organisation similar to itself. 																								He repeated his demand for a joint parliamentary committee probe into his allegation that the Centre was misutilising the IB for political ends.																								The chief minister said he had told Vajpayee that it was because of the misuse of the IB that we failed to protect Parliament or stop the Kargil war.

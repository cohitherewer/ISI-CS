The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Pollspeak from Delhi in Maithili
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Darbhanga, Dec. 24: With the Lok Sabhas official recognition of Maithili, the stage appears to have been set for the NDA to deal a language card against Laloo Prasad Yadavs caste card.																								Kirti Azad, the MP from Darbhanga in Mithila region, underlined the importance of Bihars north to the NDA when he thanked the Prime Minister and his deputy in the language on the floor of Parliament. The Lok Sabha on Monday unanimously passed the Constitution (100th Amendment) Bill, 2003, to include Maithili in the Eighth Schedule.																								We have been struggling for the last 60 years for it. The recognition has put the Maithili language on the cultural map of the country, the parliamentarian told The Telegraph from Delhi.																								In line with his stress on the importance of Mithila region, the NDA and its leader, the BJP, have organised special celebrations to mark the recognition.																								Contemporary Maithili poets will be feted and scholars of the language will explain its cultural legacy. This, however, will not conceal the political intrigue, wrong decisions and deliberate neglect of Maithili, said Professor Ratneswar Mishra, who is head of the history department at the .. Mishra Mithila University. 																								Emotionally this (the recognition) has recharged the people, added Mishra, who along with the Maithili intelligentsia hopes for the revival of the language.																								The optimism may help save the dilapidated so-called memorial of the legendary 14th century Maithili poet, Vidyapati, in Madhubani districts Bispi village, about 45 km from here. 																								The structure near an old cottage, whose compound serves as the local garbage bin, is hardly recognisable as the poets birthplace. But I tell you this is where he was born. Just go up into the cottage and look. This has been written on the wall of the cottage, says Ramesh Jha, a 55-year-old local school teacher.																								The long and tortuous history of neglect for one of the richest languages  according to Madheswar Mishra, the first vice-chancellor of Mithila University  looks set to change.																								The road to recovery started in June when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced his offer of official status to Maithili. In August, his deputy .K. Advani visited Darbhanga to inaugurate a local AIR programme in the language.																								Laloo Prasad had in 1990 dropped Maithili from school, college and public service examinations, depriving students from using it to write the papers.																								The last but the most significant decision of the BJP central leadership was to bring back to the party, Tarakant Jha, a noted advocate who has been spearheading the movement in Maithil region for statehood, a veteran BJP leader said.																								Jha, who is the chairman of the Mithilanchal Statehood Steering Committee, was welcomed back in October after being expelled in 1999 for anti-party activities.																								The Mithila region, which comprises Darbhanga, Tirhut, Purnia and Saharsa divisions, had returned NDA leaders from all nine of its Lok Sabha seats the last time.																								Any party that wants to make inroads into Bihar, either in the general polls next year or the state polls later, will have to do battle in this northern region, bordering Nepal. The reason is that central and south Bihar, including Magadh and Bhagalpur regions, are already embroiled in caste politics, with Laloo Prasad and his state ally, the Congress, having the edge.																								The north, once a bastion of the Rashtriya Janata Dal chiefs MY (Muslim-Yadav) brand of politics, has shown visible signs of unravelling since the 1999 parliamentary polls. Even the 2000 state polls had returned more BJP MLAs than earlier.																								The NDA, however, would find the going tough as evident from the complaints of Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, the veteran RJD MP from Vaishali district. He says Bhojpuri language is spoken by 20 crore people -- against the 3 crore who speak Maithili -- but is still facing deprivation. His party associates share his opinion.

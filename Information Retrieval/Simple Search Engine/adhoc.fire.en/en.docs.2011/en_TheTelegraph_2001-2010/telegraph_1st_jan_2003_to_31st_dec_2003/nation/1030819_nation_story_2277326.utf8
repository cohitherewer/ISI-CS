The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, August 19, 2003 				 Sonia comes between Basu amp; Biswas
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Basu  Biswas																								Calcutta, Aug. 18: CPM leader Jyoti Basu today said the politburo did discuss the partys support to Congress president Sonia Gandhi as prime ministerial candidate, apparently contesting state secretary Anil Biswas denial of any such discussion in the apex bodys meeting.																								We did discuss the partys support to Sonia in the politburo meeting and a further discussion will take place on this score next month. We consider Sonia an Indian citizen and there should not be any controversy if the party backs her after she is chosen as a prime ministerial candidate by the Congress, Basu told The Telegraph this afternoon.																								Biswas had yesterday denied reports about such a discussion at the politburo meeting. We have not yet discussed anything about extending support to Sonia Gandhi. Basu might have spoken about the partys support to the Congress in line with the discussion that took place at the CPMs Hyderabad congress last year, Biswas said of the former chief ministers comments about supporting Sonia.																								Basu iterated that the partys support to the Congress was a political necessity to ensure the defeat of communal forces in the forthcoming elections across the country. I dont understand why there is a controversy about the partys clear-cut stand vis--vis the Congress. I am emphasising the partys line and nothing else, he observed.																								Basu also resented the manner in which some Left Front constituents are crying themselves hoarse against providing support to the Congress president.																								We do differentiate between the communal BJP and the secular Congress party. Tell me, what will the Left do in the states where we are not formidable enough to counter the BJP? he asked. Do you allow a division in the secular votes to pave the way for the saffron partys electoral victory or work out a tactical arrangement to strengthen the anti-BJP forces?																								When told about the Forward Blocs decision to maintain equidistance from the Congress and the BJP as both are the parties of the bourgeois landlords, the veteran Marxist leader said he did not subscribe to the view.																								I am not bothered about what the Forward Bloc and RSP are saying about the Congress. We should not forget the political exigencies. We are committed to defeating the BJP at the national level, he said.																								That Basus observation about the Congress, particularly Sonia, has come as a major embarrassment for Left parties was evident from the manner in which Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas criticised Basu for his overtures to Sonia Gandhi during the day.																								The Left Front does not exist at the national level. We are not ready to toe Basus line in extending support to the Congress president, the Bloc leader told a news conference.																								Senior RSP leader Sunil Sengupta also felt that Basus observation about Sonia would tarnish the Lefts image at the national level. Why should we extend support to the Congress whose credentials are also questionable? he asked. He maintained that the Left should maintain equidistance from both the Congress and the BJP.

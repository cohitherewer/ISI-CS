		 Saturday, May 17, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Antony to shield Pepsi from CPM Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): Kerala chief  minister A.K. Antony on Friday said his government would  provide all possible legal protection to a Pepsi plant at  Kanjikode in Palakkad district whose licence has been cancelled  by the local panchayat controlled by the CPM.				 																																																	The decision of the Pudussery village panchayat to revoke the licence has not been received by the government, Antony said at a meet-the-chief minister programme, organised by the Thiruvananthapuram Press Club.				 																																																	Lashing out at the CPM for continuing with its agenda of boycotting multinational products in the state, the chief minister said the party should shed its double standards on the issue and be more truthful in its approach.				 																																																	Pepsico India Holdings Private Limited came to Kerala during the CPM-led Left Democratic Front regime and now they were opposing the company, Antony pointed out. 				 																																																	However, we are not going to do anything to push them away from the state, the chief minister said.				 																																																	In West Bengal, there were three Pepsi units and two Coca-Cola units. The CPM was boycotting the products of these companies in Kerala while allowing the same to operate in West Bengal, he said, adding that its attitude was against the development of the state.				 																																																	The main reason cited for cancellation of licence was over exploitation of water resources. The panchayat decision also forms part of the CPMs policy of boycotting the products of multinationals in the wake of the US-led war on Iraq.				 																Indian in Beijing hospital freed Beijing (PTI): An Indian who had to spend  over three weeks in isolation in a Sars-only hospital here  was discharged on Friday after recovering from typhoid fever.

Since my family in India would be horrified to know that I was admitted to a Sars-designated hospital, I dont want to be named, the man, who hails from a city near Delhi, said. I will return to Canada and then inform my parents on my experiences here in the isolation ward.				 																																																	After initially treating him as a suspected case of Sars, doctors later diagnosed that he was suffering from typhoid fever, a life-threatening illness caused by the bacterium salmonella typhi.

		 Friday, February 21, 2003 				 Student killed in parents rampage
																								Madhepura (Bihar), Feb. 20 (PTI): A student was killed today and several were injured, including a magistrate, when police opened fire on rampaging examinees and guardians who insisted on using unfair means in examination in a college here.																								Ranvijay Kumar Rana was injured in police firing following pitched battles between students, guardians on one side and the police, who resisted their attempts to use unfair means during the intermediate examination at C.M. Science College centre near Sonebarsa in adjoining Saharsa district.																								Rana died on way to Patna for treatment, police said. A woman, who was hit by a stray bullet while cutting grass, was reported to be out of danger.																								The trouble broke out when some guardians scaled the boundary wall of the college to force their way into the examination halls to hand over chits to their wards. When the police resisted, the guardians started brickbatting them. The police fired a few rounds to chase them away. 																								Angered over the firing, students and activists of the Janata Dal (U), the Indian Federal Democratic Party and the Samata Party took to streets, threw stones at the Madhepura police station and railway station and disrupted railway and road traffic between Madhepura and Saharsa, the sources said. 																								They also stormed the civil court premises and set fire to the chief judicial magistrates official car and a police motorbike.																								Tension gripped this north Bihar town where additional reinforcements were sent from the adjoining Saharsa and Supaul districts.																								In Sheikhpura, the police opened fire to disperse a rampaging crowd, which ransacked the Islamia School examination centre and vandalised the schools property. No one was injured in the firing.

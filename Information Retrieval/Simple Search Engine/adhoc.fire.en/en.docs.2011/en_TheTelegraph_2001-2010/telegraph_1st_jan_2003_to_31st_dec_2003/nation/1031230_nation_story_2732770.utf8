		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Reformed poacher fights losing battle 
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 				 	 Ali Hussain: Against all odds Begusarai, Dec. 29: Frail  Ali Hussain shades his eyes from the pale winter sun as  he looks up at the trees surrounding Kavar lake. A couple  of white-breasted kingfishers, locally known as tanki,  is hovering above. 																								The sinewy fingers of the 60-year-old dexterously smear pipul gum on two sticks which have formed a cross and tie a small insect between them. He places the trap in the foliage and retreats. Within a minute, one of the birds swoops down and picks the insect with its beak. But it cannot take off  its flapping wings are caught in the gum. 																								Soon Hussain runs back to the trap, releases the birds wings from the gum, wipes the gum clean from its wings and frees it. 																								The notorious bird-catcher of the sixties is a conservationist now, fighting a losing battle against a greedy generation of politicians, contractors and villagers to protect migratory birds at Kavar lake, about 22 km from this industrial town of north Bihar. 																								Hussain, who has been felicitated in the US, Britain and Japan for his extraordinary trapping skills and intimate knowledge of bird behaviour, is helpless against an organised racket of poaching at the lake. 																								This winter, there has hardly been any visitor from Siberia. Bird meat is a delicacy for a wide range of people, including politicians, and poaching is rampant here. So for the first time this year, migratory birds are not visible, Hussain said. 																								It is a pity as Kavar lake, spread over 27,000 acres, has been one of the more favoured destinations of the migrating birds. Located deep inside the forests of Manjhaul, the Kavar lake bird sanctuary was given national status by Rajiv Gandhi. 																								The direct impact of the poaching is a change in the behavioural pattern of the birds and their dwindling numbers in the sanctuary, said a senior forest officer. 																								He said that earlier, over 150 varieties of migratory birds used to visit the sanctuary. Last year, it came down to 50 varieties and this year, not a single is visible yet. 																								According to Hussain, the poachers now sprinkle insecticides on the white flowers, known as jalkumbhi, in the lake on which the birds settle down. The dead birds are then collected from the water. 																								The lake first made news when Selim Ali, Indias most famous ornithologist, began a campaign against the killing of migratory birds at the lake. When Hussain was trapping birds, along with 25 other families in a small colony at Mirsikaritola in Manjhaul, Ali met Hussain. 																								Ali transformed the bird trapper into a conservationist, took him to the Bombay Natural History Society and made him familiar with the birds and their English names. Hussain eventually began assisting in research on many dying species. He is also often called to the Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary to identify the latest birds coming to the park. 																								A well-known conservationist abroad, Hussains skills are unutilised in Kavar lake. He lives in the same colony which stopped poaching after Alis campaigning, but big traders with links in Patna, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur are encouraging people from other villages to take up trapping. 																								Hunted at Kavar, the migratory birds are now flocking to an ecological park at Begusarai maintained by the Indian Oil Corporation. 																								The park inside the town, where the noise level is high, has drawn quite a large number this year, too. But this artificial lake is a poor substitute for the expansive Kavar, rues Hussain.

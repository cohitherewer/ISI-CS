 IDREES BAKHTIAR 																								Islamabad, May 10: Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali denied that any formula for the division of Kashmir was being discussed and said there has been no change in Pakistans Kashmir policy. 																								There is no change in Pakistans principled stand on Kashmir, nor any formula for the division of Kashmir is currently being considered, he told reporters on Friday. 																								There were clear indications that the Kashmir issue would be resolved between the two countries, Jamali said, adding that he enjoyed the blessings of the Opposition parties for holding talks to resolve all issues peacefully. 																								I have met the Opposition leaders and taken them into confidence. I dont think I should also consult Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif who are not present in the country, Jamali said. 																								Asked to comment on Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees statement that Kashmir was an integral part of India, Jamali said: This is not the first time that any Indian leader has given such a statement. 																								On Delhis allegation of cross-border terrorism, Jamali said President Pervez Musharraf has made it clear that Pakistan would not allow anyone to use its soil for terrorism. I think I dont need to say anything after the Presidents comprehensive reply on this issue. 																								Jamali refuted US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitages statement that Kashmir was not the main issue between Pakistan and India. For Pakistan, it is the main issue, he said.

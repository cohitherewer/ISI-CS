																								Mumbai, Feb. 21: Mumbai police were agog with expectation that the Dubai extradition chain will lengthen today with the handover of another fugitive, Aftab Bhatki.																								Bhatki is said to have helped Dawood Ibrahim run a fake-currency racket in the city, reports our correspondent. The police were expecting Dubai to deport him close on the heels of Dawoods brother, Iqbal Sheikh, and aide Ejaz Pathan, who landed here on Wednesday night. 																								But the police later said Bhatki was not arriving today. They added that there is a likelihood that he would be deported soon.																								Bhatki is one of the 30 held in Dubai in connection with Dawood aide Sharad Shettys murder. 																								Two other brothers of Dawood  Noora and Mushtakeen  were also detained. Rumours were rife that Mushtakeen, too, would be deported.

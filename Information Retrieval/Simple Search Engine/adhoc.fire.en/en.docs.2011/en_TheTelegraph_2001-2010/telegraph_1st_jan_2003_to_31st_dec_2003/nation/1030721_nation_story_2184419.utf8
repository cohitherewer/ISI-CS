The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, July 21, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																UK scanner on Indian food 				 																																																	London (PTI): The British government has imposed tougher controls on passengers from the subcontinent, particularly from India, bringing meat and other food into the country, officials said here on Sunday.				 																																																										The government is investing 25 million over the next three years to tackle illegal third country imports, said John White, customs head at Heathrow airport.				 																																																										In an effort to raise awareness of meat control, UK customs officials, led by White, had a meeting with deputy high commissioner Satyabrata Pal at the Indian high commission here.				 																																																										We had a very positive meeting with Pal. Ensuring that passengers arriving from India are aware of what they can and cannot bring into the UK avoids any potential embarrassment when they arrive, White said.				 																																																										We appreciate that in many cases passengers are unaware of the fact that there are restrictions on bringing certain foodstuffs, particularly meat, to the UK and we look forward to working closely with our colleagues from India to make sure that the Indian public are fully informed, he said in a statement. 				 																																																										White said customs will be allocated 4 million to begin a rolling programme in tackling illegal imports of meat and animal products. 				 																Vivek will walk soon: doctor Mumbai (PTI): Actor Vivek Oberoi, recovering  at Hinduja Hospital from multiple fractures in his left  leg, was showing signs of improvement and would be able  to walk soon with the help of crutches.				 																																																										Viveks pain has reduced considerably and he will be able to stand within a few days, orthopaedic surgeon Dr Sanjay Agarwala, who operated on the actors fractured foot, said. 				 																																																										Vivek would, however, require at least three months for complete recovery, after which he can move freely, Agarwala said.				 																																																										Efforts were made on Sunday to make the actor stand with the help of crutches, Agarwala said, adding that Vivek suffered pain and asked for one more days rest before taking the strain.				 																																																										Once the actor is able to stand on his feet and move with support, he will be discharged from the hospital, the surgeon added.				 																																																										Vivek had suffered multiple fractures in the leg after a motorcycle rammed into him on the Vidyasagar Setu in Calcutta while shooting for a film directed by Mani Ratnam.				 																Youth Cong leader shot				 																																																	Varanasi (PTI): The secretary of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the Youth Congress, Mahesh Yadav, was shot dead on Sunday and his friend injured by unidentified gunmen here, police said. 				 																																																										The assailants fired on Yadav and his friend Sushil Dubey when they were standing outside a shop. The Congress leader was killed on the spot, police said.				 																																																										Dubey is in hospital.				 																																																										The killing has triggered protests by residents who blocked traffic at a crossing.

Indians held in Kiev				 																																																	Phagwara (PTI): Six persons from Punjabs Doaba region were arrested in the Ukrainian capital Kiev for allegedly travelling on forged documents, according to information at the regional passport office in Jalandhar. We have got this information from the embassy concerned and have informed the families to deposit the air fare for bringing them back, the regional passport officer said.

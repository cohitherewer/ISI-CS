 MUKHTAR AHMAD 																								Srinagar, Jan. 19: Militants today struck thrice in Kashmir, killing a man, his son and another boy, injuring 21 people in a powerful grenade explosion and attacking a security forces vehicle. 																								The dreaded Special Operations Group of the state police seemed to be the chief target in the spurt in violence, with extremists striking at the houses of two officials of the force. 																								Militants, disguised in burqa, entered the Gund-e-Kaiser residence of SOG assistant sub-inspector Mushtaq Ahmad in Bandipore this afternoon and opened fire on the residents, killing Ahmad and his son, Mudassir Mushtaq, on the spot. Ahmad, posted in Srinagar, was home on leave. 																								They then broke into the adjacent house of SOG head constable Ghulam Nabi and shot his son. Rameez Ahmed Bhat, who was critically wounded, was shifted to Srinagar for treatment. But he died on the way. 																								Security forces rushed to the spot and searched the area, but the killers had fled. No one claimed responsibility. 																								Militants struck again later in the afternoon at Kulgam in Anantnag district of south Kashmir, hurling a grenade at a police vehicle. 																								The missile missed the target and exploded near a passenger bus, injuring 21 civilians. They were shifted to hospital. 																								A security force vehicle was damaged in a blast at Sherabad Tral in Pulwama district this morning. No one was wounded. 																								A grenade was hurled on security personnel in the bus stand at Anantnag late yesterday, injuring three paramilitary troopers. They were hospitalised.

		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 South support shrinks to sole mate
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Dec. 29: The MDMKs exit has left the BJP with the Telugu Desam Party as its only major ally in the south.																								The Desam accounts for 130 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP had won 17 of them in 1999  four in Tamil Nadu as part of a DMK-nucleus alliance, seven in Karnataka with the Janata Dal (United) and six in Andhra with the Desam.																								The PMK  which is part of the DMK-led coalition in Tamil Nadu  has decided to stay in the NDA. However, its support will only be viable if the ADMK lends weight to it. And that, BJP sources admitted, is nowhere close to fructification. 																								The BJP feels the ADMK has usurped the Hindutva space in Tamil Nadu. So much so that state BJP leaders and members of RSS-affiliated organisations like the Hindu Munnani and the Bajrang Dal had professed admiration for ADMK chief Jayalalithaa for enacting a law against religious conversions and openly supporting her Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi when he came under attack after the Gujarat riots.																								Our state party was clear its natural choice was Jayalalithaa and not the DMK because every time she spoke in favour of a Hindutva-related issue, the DMK promptly abused her, a source said.																								Having emerged as a Hindutva votary, Jayalalithaa would find the BJP useful only after the Lok Sabha polls when the NDA might require her support for its next government and she, in turn, would need a friendly central government, sources said.																								However, many in the BJP are not quite warm to the prospect of propping up a government on Jayalalithaas support as she had pulled down the first NDA regime.																								The scene in neighbouring Karnataka is no more encouraging, said BJP sources. 																								Although the largest Opposition party in the state, the sources said, the BJP has not thrown up a charismatic leader who can capitalise on the anti-incumbency build-up against the Congress government. 																								The new state unit president of the BJP, Ananth Kumar, has revved up the party organisation but not many think he is chief minister material, the sources added.																								The BJPs ally, Ramakrishna Hegde of the Janata Dal (United), is ailing, said sources, but he still remains the partys only bet to improve its tally in the Lok Sabha polls. 																								In Kerala, the BJP is still in search of an ally and on the fringes of the states politics.

		 Monday, May 12, 2003 				 Mulayam eyes Kalyan tieup
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 11: Even as the BJP woos Kalyan Singh to bolster its social base in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party is discreetly working on tying up with his Rashtriya Kranti Party.																								Sources said Samajwadi strategists are considering the pros and cons of propping up a Kalyan Singh-led government if the BJP-BSP coalition falls under its own weight.																								Kalyan has a following not only in his Lodh community but also among other backward classes. This is why the BJP sent two emissaries to Lucknow last month to placate him.																								But indications are Kalyan is unlikely to return to the BJP as his equation with Atal Bihari Vajpayee is not good. He was forced to quit the party following his trenchant criticism of the Prime Minister, a Samajwadi source said.																								Though the BJP will never prop Mulayam up as chief minister, the Samajwadi hopes it may be forced to back Kalyan if he stood a chance. 																								For the Samajwadi, Kalyan is a lesser evil than Mayavati who is out to finish its leaders.																								However, Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh was non-committal. He declined to reveal anything on the party strategy in Uttar Pradesh. 																								Kalyan Singh is 100 per cent with us. He will not ditch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Some BJP leaders are desperate to get him, but he will not go back to them, he said.																								Speaking to reporters, Amar said the Samajwadi would definitely take advantage if there were differences in the BSP-BJP coalition. We are not running a Ramkrishna mission but a political party.																								The Congress stand towards his party in Uttar Pradesh was very positive, Amar said. Mayavati had spared none, even Priyanka Gandhi and Motilal Vohra were her targets.																								He said the 2004 Lok Sabha polls would be fought between the Samajwadi and the BSP as the BJP was finished in Uttar Pradesh, thanks to Mayavati.																								Amar accused the BJP of conniving with the BSP to foil its Lucknow rally on Monday. He feared there was a conspiracy to slap false cases against senior party leaders and arrest them.

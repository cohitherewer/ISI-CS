		 Thursday, October 09, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Bankers walk, police say rescue				 																																																	Hazaribagh: Mystery surrounds the release of the bank employees abducted by Maoist Communist Centre extremists during Tuesdays robbery at the State Bank of Indias Banaso branch.				 																																																										Police claim the Maoists, under pressure from a joint team of Hazaribagh and Bokaro police, were forced to release the employees late on Tuesday night after a fierce exchange of fire. But there are few takers for this account since there were no casualties nor any arrests and the employees returned to Banaso on their own.				 																																																										Indeed, the recovery of 25-30 kg of explosives in Bokaros Chatrochatti jungle and the presence of landmines along the route suggests that the extremists were working to a plan when they released cashier Tulsi Das Kamali after proceeding some distance towards Bokaro. The idea was that Kamali would tell police what route the Maoists had taken and the police would walk into a trap. They planned to blow up the vehicles carrying the policemen once they entered the jungle.				 																																																										This version appears most likely, going by the account of bank manager Rajkumar Maheshwari and probationary officer Rajesh Kumar Sinha. The employees said they were made to sit blindfolded in a vehicle with their hands tied behind their backs as the extremists fled the scene of robbery. After about an hour of driving, everyone alighted near a hill and the employees were made to walk along a forest path amid pouring rain.

He epitomises a perfect blend of offbeat and traditional films and he has graciously accepted, information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

The minister also said the government plans to review the guidelines of the Central Board of Film Certification, which were last reviewed in 1991. He did not lay down any time frame but said they would be done at the earliest. 				 																																																	bout increasing piracy in the audio visual media, Prasad said: Subhash Ghai... will give us suggestions within three weeks after which we will frame our terms of reference on how to check piracy.

				 	 Musharraf Islamabad, Dec. 14 (Reuters):  Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf narrowly escaped a terrorist  attack today after a bomb tore up a section of a road in  Rawalpindi a minute after his convoy passed, officials said.																								The Presidents motorcade passed a minute before the blast, military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan said. He is safe and sound.																								It is a terrorist act. Whether it was an assassination attempt or not cannot be said until after investigations, he said.																								Musharraf had just returned from Karachi and the blast occurred 2 km from Islamabad International Airport, near the outskirts of neighbouring Rawalpindi, at a bridge in the city where Pakistans military is headquartered, said witnesses.																								The President incensed militant groups by abandoning Pakistans support for neighbouring Afghanistans ousted Taliban rulers and backing the US-led war on terrorism after the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001. 																								Last month, he announced the banning of six militant groups following US complaints that they had re-emerged under new names after being outlawed a year ago.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 1: The mega-serial Karishma  The Miracles of Destiny was back in Calcutta High Court today after Sahara Media Entertainment Limited filed a contempt of court petition against Barbara Taylor Bradford, who had dragged the channel to court for copyright violation.																								The Manhattan-based author had, according to the television channel, violated the high court order to file an undertaking to bear costs and damages in the event she lost the suit in which she had alleged that Sahara Manoranjans blockbuster was based on her 1979 bestseller, A Woman of Substance.																								Bradford had submitted an affidavit undertaking to bear only the costs incurred by the Subrata Roy-owned Sahara. This discrepancy had been brought to light by a division bench of Calcutta High Court hearing the appeal in July. It had also pointed out that this error could leave the author open to contempt charges.																								In its petition, Sahara referred to Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghoses May 12 order in which he had asked Bradford to file the undertaking. After about two months of legal sparring that stretched from Calcutta to Delhi, the Supreme Court on August 4 threw out the authors appeal.																								Sahara claimed in its petition that it had suffered a great loss due to the delay in the broadcast of the serial in which Karisma Kapoor stars. The serial was scheduled to go on air from May 12. But, it could start only on August 25, the petition said.																								When contacted, a spokesperson for Bradfords solicitors said: We are not aware of any such move.

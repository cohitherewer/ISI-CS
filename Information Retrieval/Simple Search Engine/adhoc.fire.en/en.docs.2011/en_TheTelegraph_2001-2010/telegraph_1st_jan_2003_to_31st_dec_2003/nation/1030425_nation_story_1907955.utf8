		 Friday, April 25, 2003 				 BJP to contest polls alone
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, April 24: The BJP is unlikely to enter into a Mayavati-type alliance  pre- or post-poll  for Assembly elections in four states slated later this year. The party has decided to battle it alone in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Delhi.																								This was confirmed today by BJP national general secretary Pramod Mahajan. The BJP leader had come to the city to attend a BJP workers convention at the Sri Krishna Memorial Hall.																								The state polls happen to be the last and crucial trial of strength before the next general elections. We will go alone in all four states. We have substantial strength in all these states and there are very few ideological partners in all these states for the BJP to go in for any alliance, Mahajan said.																								The BJP general secretary pointed out that the party had been in power in all these states before Congress won the elections. Mayavati-type power-sharing process cannot be replicated elsewhere. It all depended on a situation that was unique of Uttar Pradesh only, said Rajnath Singh, another national general secretary of the party and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.																								In two of the four states that are going to polls, the Congress has been in power for the last 10 years. We would obviously take up development as a major issue in all these states, but the failure of the Congress in coming up to the expectations of the people would also be high on the agenda, he pointed out.																								Singh added that people in these states were longing for a change as the Congress governments had failed to meet even the most fundamental needs and demands of the voters.																								The BJP has a natural edge over its only rival  the Congress  in that it can cash in on the anti-incumbency factor. Besides, we will put on display the achievements of the first non-Congress government which completed five years, he said.

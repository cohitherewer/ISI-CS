		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Atals choice: raga or roar
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, Dec. 23: The first gift to come out of the BJPs newly-won Rajasthan for Atal Bihari Vajpayee is designed to please his ears on his birthday.																								Raga Atalvijayshree has been lined up to enthral the Prime Minister when he arrives in Jaipur on the evening of December 25 after formal birthday celebrations in Delhi.																								Though the composer, a cultural organisation in the state called Maand, has not been officially granted permission, its founder president Govind Kalla is hopeful.																								The piece commemorates the military victory at Kargil, said Kalla, a folk singer from Jodhpur who takes care to clarify that he is not a political worker.																								So why attach the Prime Ministers name? Because he led the nation during the trying times, says Kalla.																								The folk singer is as quick to dismiss any attempt to impute a motive of sycophancy to his musical effort.																								Raga is the name of colour and passion, Kalla says. The Kargil victory was a moment when the colour of bravery glowed in every Indians heart. The notes have been engraved on a copper plate for posterity.																								If the raga does not reach the Prime Ministers ears, the roar of the tiger may. Vajpayee is scheduled to take a chopper to Ranthambore on December 27 for a tryst with the wild cats at the tiger sanctuary at Sawai Madhopur. He will return the same day.																								Other tourists will be barred from the sanctuary that day.																								When the Prime Minister reaches Rajasthan, where he will holiday for three to four days, he will be greeted with a 1,000-metre-long banner bearing birthday messages.																								The Rambagh Palace Hotel in Jaipur has been put on alert and 25 of its rooms have been reserved for the Prime Minister, his relatives and guests. 																								Chief minister Vasundhara Raje today went to the hotel to review the arrangements.

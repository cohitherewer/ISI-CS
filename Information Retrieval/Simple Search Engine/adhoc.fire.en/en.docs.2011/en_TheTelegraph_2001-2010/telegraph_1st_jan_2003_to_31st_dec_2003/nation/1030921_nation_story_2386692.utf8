		 Sunday, September 21, 2003 				 RSS temple challenge to Cong
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Sept. 20: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today dared the Congress to take a public stand on whether it would rebuild the demolished Babri Masjid if it returns to power.																								Instead of shedding crocodile tears every time, they should make their stand clear. It would be appropriate, RSS spokesman Ram Madhav said here, a day after Sonia Gandhis party hailed the Rae Bareli courts ruling that charges would be framed against Union minister Murli Manohar Joshi and six others in the demolition case.																								The vicarious satisfaction of some of the Babri Masjid protagonists like the Congress party is quite amusing. The vicarious enthusiasm betrays its love for the disputed Babri structure, Madhav added.																								The RSS leader took potshots at Congress leaders, saying it was their party that had facilitated the demolition of the mosque. 																								The Congress, Madhav claimed, had all along helped the cause of the Ram temple at Ayodhya by opening the locks of the disputed structure in 1986, permitting shilanyas in 1989 and later allowing kar sevaks to go ahead and demolish the structure.																								He dismissed as baseless the Congress allegation that the BJP, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the RSS had conspired to demolish the mosque. Madhav said the real conspiracy was hatched by the Congress. 																								If at all we were to fix responsibility for that incident, it should be the insensitive political establishment, inordinately delayed judicial process and intemperate and provocative gestures of the pseudo-secular sections of the country, he said.																								The pulling down of the structure, he added, was a spontaneous outburst of the pent-up anger and frustration in the kar sevaks and not a premeditated act by any organisation or individual.																								The RSS leader said the excavation report of the Archaeological Survey of India had vindicated the parivars stand that mosque was constructed on a demolished temple plinth. The criticism of the ASI report is a result of the frustration of those who are anti-temple, if not anti-Hindu.

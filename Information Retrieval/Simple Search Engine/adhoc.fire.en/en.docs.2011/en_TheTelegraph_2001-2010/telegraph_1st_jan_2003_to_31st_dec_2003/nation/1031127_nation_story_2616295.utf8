		 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 Man weds two sisters
																								Lucknow, Nov. 26 (PTI): A young man working as a delivery boy married two sisters, one of them handicapped, simultaneously with the blessings of both the families.																								Amar Verma tied the knot with both Priti, 21, and Ragini, 18, daughters of a retired teacher, at a simple function last night.																								Amar had wanted to marry Ragini. But her father Sohan Lal Verma set a pre-condition that she could only marry the person who would also agree to marry Priti, confined to a wheelchair after losing both her legs to polio.																								We were shocked, but later realised the humanitarian aspect of the marriage, Amars sister Aruna Devi said.																								Eyebrows have been raised about the legality of the marriage as polygamy is not allowed by the Hindu Marriage Act. A city lawyer said prima facie the marriage is illegal. There, however, seems to be no legal hassles.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bhagalpur, Aug. 24: Police in Bhagalpur district are said to have turned kidnappers instead of checking the spate of abductions in the state.																								The district police superintendent has ordered an inquiry against five personnel of Pahalgaon police station, about 25 km from Bhagalpur, for allegedly abducting Mohammad Nizamuddin, a Jamalpur-based potato wholesaler. They allegedly confined him at the police station and demanded ransom by using the phone at the station.																								On the basis of Nizamuddins statement, I have directed the deputy superintendent of police Maheshwar Das to inquire into the matter and submit a report within three to four days, police superintendent K.S. Anupam said.																								According to Munger police superintendent M.R. Naik, Nizamuddin was kidnapped on the night of August 16. An FIR was drawn up at Jamalpur on the basis of his wifes complaint. She alleged the involvement of policemen.																								A joint team of Munger and Bhagalpur police set Nizamuddin free from Pahalgaon police station on the evening of August 22, almost a week after his abduction. The release had followed Anupams order to probe Nizamuddins disappearance.																								The trader today named officer-in-charge Shyam Bihari Rai and four constables as his abductors. Anupam said action would be taken against the policemen if they were found guilty.

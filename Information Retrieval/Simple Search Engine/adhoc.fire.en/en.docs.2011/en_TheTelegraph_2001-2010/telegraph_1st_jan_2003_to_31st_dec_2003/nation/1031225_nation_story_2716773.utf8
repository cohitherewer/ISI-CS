		 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 SC upholds birth date regulation
 R.VENKATARAMAN New Delhi, Dec. 24: The  Supreme Court has held that the three years citizens now  have to correct their date of birth on secondary school  certificates is a very reasonable period.																								The period provided under the Secondary Education Act is valid and not arbitrary, the apex court held.																								In an order last Friday, a division bench of Justices R.C. Lahoti and Ashok Bhan said the Higher Secondary Board was a statutory body and a student should notice if the birth date mentioned is correct.																								The three-year period provided under higher secondary regulations for changing the date of birth is a very reasonable period, the judges said.																								 On the very date of issuance of the certificate, the concerned student is put to notice as to the entries made in the certificate. Even if he failed to notice the error on the date of issuance of the certificate, he would come to know the same shortly thereafter, they said.																								Thus, the period of three years (for correcting the error) is quite reasonable. It is not something like prescribing a period of limitation for filing a suit, the court said.																								The order came on an appeal by the Board of Secondary Education of Assam, which was directed by Gauhati High Court to correct a students birth date. The Supreme Court struck down the order but said the Assam board had given the respondents a very fair concession in correcting the date of birth.																								The apex court clarified that the relief allowed in this case shall not have any effect or bearing on any other case as the three-year period provided was legal and not arbitrary.																								The prescription of three years is laying down of a dividing line before which the power of the (secondary) board to make correction ought to be invoked and beyond which it may not be invoked, added the judges. Belated applications, if allowed to be received, may open a pandoras box, the apex court said.

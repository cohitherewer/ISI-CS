																								Hyderabad, March 16: IT companies Infosys and Satyam have criticised the ill-treatment of Indian software workers in Malaysia, reports our special correspondent.																								Condemning the Malaysian police action, Infosys chairman N.R. Narayanamurthy said Nasscom has already told the Centre of the need to protect the interests of Indian workers.																								Satyam chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said: The incident in Brickfield in Kuala Lumpur will send a wrong signal and will be detrimental to the growth of the IT sector in Asia.																								Malaysias interim president Abdullah Ahmed Badwai has said he would send a detailed report on the incident to India. I have already received a report from the state police and after my perusal I will direct the Malaysian foreign affairs ministry to present the same to the Indian government, he added.																								The raids in Brickfield were not aimed at Indian software engineers, Badwai said.																								I wish there would be no criticism if the raids were diagnosed as per the Constitution and rule of the land, he said, adding he was concerned over how the incident had attracted international attention.

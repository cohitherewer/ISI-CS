																								Ahmedabad, Aug. 14: A police inspector was killed and over a dozen injured today when a group of farmers, on way to Vadodara to join a march against the new power tariff for the sector, turned violent at Kosamba near Surat, says our correspondent.																								Around 10 this morning, inspector .P. Sarvaiya rushed to the spot where the irate farmers were obstructing traffic on the national highway and tried to arrest the farmers. The farmers retaliated by throwing stones when the police used batons and lobbed tear gas shells to disperse the 4,000-strong protesters.																								One stone hit the 49-year-old inspector, who slumped to the ground. Bleeding profusely, Sarvaiya was taken to a hospital in Ankleshwar town where he was declared dead.																								Surat district superintendent of police D.J. Patel, however, said Sarvaiya died of cardiac arrest.

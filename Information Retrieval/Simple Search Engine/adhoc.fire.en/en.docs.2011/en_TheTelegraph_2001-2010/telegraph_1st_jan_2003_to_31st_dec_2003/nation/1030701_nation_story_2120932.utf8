The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, July 01, 2003 				 Cameras roll in classrooms
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 Men at work: Students  of Ryan International School prepare a shot. Telegraph  picture 																								Mumbai, June 30: The director, Vrinda, shouts for the three cameramen to take position.																								Camera I, I will have a long shot of the guests, she hollers as the floor is cleared and the cameras roll for the dry run of Splitting Views, a chat show that wont be available on your TV.																								The heated discussions on the hot topic of adult music videos will be available only on Ryan TV, the countrys first television broadcasting station run by children  all under 16.																								The director, production team, anchor, guests and audience are all students of the citys Ryan International School.																								The crew of 30 are yet to finish their media training  or for that matter, Class X  but have already braved night shifts, outdoor shoots, rain, and chasing people who are too busy or very rude.																								The school channel of chat shows, news bulletins, health and fashion magazines  with occasional frivolities such as music videos  was launched on June 25.																								All classrooms get to share the action in the fully air-conditioned and soundproof state-of-the-art studio with three cameras, two editing machines, and sound-mixers, and three outdoor units.																								If a confident Vrinda, of Class IX, is the director, then Shweta Parakh, also of Class IX, is the host of Shweta Manch, a current affairs programme in which she addresses burning issues of the day  first off the block will be the Conditional Access System.																								Vrinda, who also doubles as a news correspondent, has done a feature on the citys sewage, and Priya has done another on the rubble left by construction work.																								The one thing all of them find real tough is editing. But mass communications graduate Utkarsh Marwah, the creative head of the school, is there to help them.																								The daily programming of Ryan TV will include a 5-minute news capsule and 30 minutes of other programmes, all produced by the children who will take turns at the work. There is a zero period of 30 minutes every day, says Marwah, when Ryan TV will be broadcast.																								The idea is to make education TV-friendly, rather than the other way round  Its All About Children goes the channels catchline.																								The school has realised that films, media and entertainment are a staple for the children. So if television cant be beat, then why not use it  goes the schools logic.																								The students who missed classes for the workshop, which started on June 10, cant think or talk of anything else. When I watch TV now, I dont listen to what people are saying, but whether the frame is right, says Rudren, of Class VIII.																								Shweta is busy with her crew, grilling everyone around  from the housewife to the autowallah to the cablewallah, who is a very reluctant interviewee.																								The school plans to guide the children into making educational programmes later. They will be made to take in their stride the latest advancements in biology and chemistry along with the latest from Fashion Street.																								The students have found that working for the media is not all fun; its also tough. For instance, Shweta had a tough time forcing her reluctant cablewallah into an interview. Another crew member had to flash his reporter card to gatecrash into some place.																								But, in the process, they have gained first-hand experience of the enormous research and running around a good journalist has to do.																								So thats all right as all the students want to be television personalities  at least for now.

		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Air force left in Sukhoi lurch
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Indian Air Forces schedule to induct Su-30 MKis  claimed to be its most potent fighter aircraft  has been upset with deliveries from Russia falling way behind schedule. 																								The Su-30 MKi is the latest of fighters for the IAF, which says its multi-role capability and versatility can give the force a decisive edge in air defence and air attack.																								A public accounts committee of Parliament tabled a report today that says the ministry of defence has been lax in monitoring the programme to induct Su-30 MKis. The MKi, to which the IAF is also upgrading its Su-30s, is custom-made for India by the Russians. 																								The parliamentary committee said the ministry has not been able to chart an induction schedule that can be implemented because the aircraft were not being delivered on time. This was also upsetting the joint development programme that is to be carried at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. The committee has asked for a status report on the induction in three months.																								The ministry had told the panel that 10 upgraded Su-30 MKi were to be delivered between July and December and an additional 12 partly-upgraded aircraft were to be received by the IAF by June 2003.

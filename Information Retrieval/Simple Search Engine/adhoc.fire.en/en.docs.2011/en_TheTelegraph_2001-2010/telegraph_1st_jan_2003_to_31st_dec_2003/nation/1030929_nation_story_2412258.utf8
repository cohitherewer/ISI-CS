																								Vadodara, Sept. 28 (PTI): Yasmin, sister-in-law of key witness Zahira in the Best Bakery case, who had claimed that innocent persons were accused for the massacre, yesterday recorded her statement with police.																								Yasmin, who had earlier demanded that her name be included in the list of witnesses to tell the truth, said today that she had informed the police about non-involvement of 21 people who had been arrested in connection with the case.																								She reiterated her charge that both Zahira and her mother Sehrunissa were lying and that she is prepared to appear before any court of the CBI or the Supreme Court to tell the truth.																								Yasmin  who had undertaken renovation of the bakery, prompting her husband to allege that it was part of a conspiracy  started residing in the premises since yesterday along with her minor daughter Tanvir and mother Rashidabibi at Hanuman Tekri in Pratapnagar locality. Twelve people were burnt alive in the bakery during post-Godhra riots and 21 accused were acquitted due to lack of evidence.																								The recording of statement assumes significance as the Gujarat government has decided to file an amended plea in the high court before October 9 following a stricture passed by the Supreme Court asking chief minister Narendra Modi to follow raj dharma or quit.																								Chief secretary P.K. Laheri and director-general of police K. Chakraborthy had appeared before the apex court earlier this month in connection with the case and informed it about filing an amended plea in the high court.																								Yasmin claimed that she knew everybody staying around the bakery and that none of them were involved in the attack.

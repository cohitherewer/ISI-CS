		 Saturday, April 19, 2003 				 Car-lift charge on BSF wrestlers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 18: Delhi police were engaged in a different kind of wrestling and the action was not on mat, but on a north Delhi street.																								This is how cops rounded up two Border Security Force wrestlers, among four auto-lifters, after a brief encounter in the Sultanpuri area late last night.																								The two arrested BSF wrestlers have been identified as Narinder Singh and Virender Singh, while their associates are Sandeep and Vikram. Narinder and Virender are serving the BSF as head constable and constable and are currently on medical leave for several months, deputy commissioner of police (Crime) M.S. Upadhye said.																								We have busted an inter-state gang allegedly involved in a series of car robberies in Delhi and its adjoining areas, he said.																								Narinder has represented India at the Sub-Junior World Wrestling Championships in Chicago and Budapest, while Virender has competed at the All India Police Duty Meet, he said.																								The crime branch, acting on a tip-off, laid a trap in Punth Kalan village of Sultanpuri last night. Around 10.15 pm, two cars with Haryana registration numbers were intercepted and, after identification, the gangsters were asked to surrender, Upadhye said.																								The criminals instead fired at the police party, prompting retaliation. Vikram, one of the most-wanted criminals of Rohtaq district in Haryana, was injured. Five policemen donated blood to save Vikrams life, the deputy commissioner said.																								A total of six rounds were fired by the accused. A country-made pistol with two live cartridges and cars have been seized. Police are also on the lookout for the remaining gangsters who fled from the spot.																								Police said their Haryana counterparts would be informed of the arrest, expressing hope that their interrogation would help solve many auto-lifting cases.																								Smuggler held																								An international arms smuggler was arrested from a hotel in Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh while he was finalising a deal yesterday, reports PTI. Four others were also taken into custody by a Varanasi police team which raided the hotel and arrested Irshad Ahmed.

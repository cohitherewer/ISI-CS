		 Monday, April 21, 2003 				 Bristling DMK looks to court
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, April 20: The DMK appears to be laying the foundation for a realignment of political forces in the state with its public rally in Vellore last night.																								Party president M. Karunanidhi said he was ready to take the fight against the Jayalalithaa regimes jail threats right up to the Supreme Court without seeking help from either the Prime Minister or his deputy.																								Do not threaten us with cases and jail terms; whether it is the MDMK leader, Vaiko (arrested under the anti-terror law), or M.K. Stalin and other DMK MLAs arrested on a flimsy charge of trespassing into a womens college and subsequently (slapped with) attempt to murder charge, Karunanidhi said.																								We will fight it out through the courts, go up to New Delhi if need be, meaning going right up to the Supreme Court, but not knocking at the doors of Vajpayee or Advani to get justice.																								The veiled reference to the increasing strains between the National Democratic Alliance partners, the DMK and the BJP, was unmistakable.																								At the rally, Karunanidhi announced his partys invitation to the Congress, the CPM, the CPI, the MDMK, the PMK and two Muslim League factions to attend an all-party meeting, scheduled for April 24 in Chennai.																								The meeting is expected to discuss the ADMK governments continuing police repression of Opposition parties, the anti-terror law charges on Nakkeeran editor R.R. Gopal and its other anti-people measures.																								Karunanidhi emphasised the improbability of any interaction with the state BJP as the saffron party has not (been) accepting us. 																								A day earlier, he had openly said the state BJP was functioning like an ADMK ally.																								The attendance of the state Congress and the CPM at the all-party meeting, however, is uncertain as the DMK is still an NDA partner at the Centre.

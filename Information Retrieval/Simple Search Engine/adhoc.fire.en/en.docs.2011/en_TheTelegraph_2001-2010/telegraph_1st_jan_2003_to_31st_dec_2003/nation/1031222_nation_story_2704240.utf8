																								New Delhi, Dec. 21 (PTI): A dismissed army major has approached Delhi High Court for a judicial probe into the files to dig out the truth about the intrusion in Kargil, four years after the successful completion of Operation Vijay.																								Dismissed Major Manish Bhatnagar has filed the petition seeking a directive from the court to the government to inquire and investigate into the lapses committed by senior army officials, posted at Kargil and Leh, who never informed the army headquarters about the grave situation.																								Bhatnagar has claimed that he had been continuously informing his company commander Col A.K. Shrivastava, one of the respondents, from January 1999 on the intrusion by Pakistanis at Point 5770. During my posting in Siachen glacier, I had been sending situation reports to my commanding officer about building up of bunker and troop movements at Point 5770, he said.																								The 32-year-old major said that despite sending the situation reports to the commanding officer, the latter directed him to proceed on his annual leave of 60 days, which was to end on June 20, 1999. Bhatnagar, however, returned to the scene of action in Kargil before completing his holiday and sought permission to participate in Operation Vijay.																								Contending that he was court martialled on frivolous charges, Bhatnagar said that to begin with, he was charged with mutiny and disobedience for not launching an attack on Point 5203. 																								However, witnesses cited by the army authorities denied giving orders to me for carrying out the attack on Point 5203 and moreover, the feature was captured by the army on June 9, according to the official records, the dismissed major said.

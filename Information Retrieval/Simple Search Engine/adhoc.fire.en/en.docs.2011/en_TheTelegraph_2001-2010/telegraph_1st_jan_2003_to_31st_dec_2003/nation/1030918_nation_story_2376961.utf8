		 Thursday, September 18, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																CAS pushback under scanner				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has sought a reply from the government on an allegation by Zee-promoted Siticable Network that it deferred the implementation of the conditional access system (CAS) indefinitely in the capital for extraneous reasons.				 																																																										A bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice A.K. Sikri fixed September 24 for hearing the petition after additional solicitor-general K.K. Sud said he has to seek instruction from the government on this.				 																																																										Siticable has challenged the August 29 notification deferring the implementation of CAS indefinitely, contending that it was unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary and contrary to public interest.				 																																																										Senior advocates Harsh Salve and Pratibha Singh, appearing for Siticable, contended that the deferment was for extraneous reasons as the information and broadcasting minister had said CAS would be implemented in the capital only after the Assembly elections.				 																																																										The counsel quoted the statement where the minister had said CAS has unfortunately become an unnecessary political issue in Delhi and did not want any consumer- friendly initiative to become an issue for competing politics.

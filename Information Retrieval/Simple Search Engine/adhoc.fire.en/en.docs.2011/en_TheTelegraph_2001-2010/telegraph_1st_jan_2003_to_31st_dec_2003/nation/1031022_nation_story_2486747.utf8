		 Wednesday, October 22, 2003 				 Atal faces rape parade ire 
 MONOBINA GUPTA				 	 Vajpayee and Bharti at the Bhopal rally on Sunday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Oct. 21: Atal Bihari Vajpayee appears to be doing a Mamata Banerjee.																								The Trinamul Congress leader has in the past paraded a woman allegedly raped by CPM cadre to malign the party in the run-up to the panchayat elections, says Brinda Karat, general secretary of the All-India Democratic Womens Association.																								But there is a difference between the two incidents, Karat adds. Mamata Banerjee took the victim to local panchayat meetings unlike (the) Prime Minister who paraded a rape victim at a public rally.																								A rape victim was paraded at Vajpayees Sunday rally in Bhopal where the Prime Minister launched the BJPs election campaign. The partys chief ministerial candidate Uma Bharti called the victim onto the dais while attacking the Digvijay Singh regime for the increasing crimes against women in the state. She said more than 100,000 rapes had occurred during the 10 years Digvijay had been in power. 																								Bharti said the victim had been raped in 1994 and her husband killed by a sympathiser of the chief minister, whose photograph was found in the rapists house.																								The victim tried to touch Vajpayees feet when she appeared on stage, but the Prime Minister did not allow her to do so.																								The Congress has slammed Bharti for parading the victim, whose attacker was convicted years ago. It said the BJP was stooping to new lows in trying to nail the Digvijay regime.																								Purnima Sethi of the BJPs Mahila Morcha defended the incident on a television show, saying the victim was participating in the rally and had come on stage willingly.																								But womens organisations are outraged. By using the victim at a public rally, the Prime Minister has sent out a signal that victims of sexual violence can be used legitimately as part of an electoral campaign, Karat said.																								Political parties are using rape to settle electoral scores with each other. What however is really shocking about this incident is that the incident happened at the Prime Ministers rally, she added.																								What is worse is that the BJP has a woman  Uma Bharti  leading the partys election campaign in the state. How can she be so desensitised to the issue? Karat asked.																								The incident has shown that political parties have no concern about the future of the victim who has been thrown into full public glare, Jyotsna Chatterjee of the Joint Womens Programme said.																								Violence against women has never been on a political partys agenda till now. They (political parties) use incidents as and when it suits them to nail their political adversaries, mostly at election time, a woman activist says.

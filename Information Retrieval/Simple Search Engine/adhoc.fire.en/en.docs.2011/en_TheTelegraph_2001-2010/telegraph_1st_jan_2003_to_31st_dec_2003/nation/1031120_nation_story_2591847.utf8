Nataraj, who headed the hunt for bandit Veerappan, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Vijayakumar will now head the Special Task Force in Erode.				 																																																										The transfer came even as it was decided at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday that a modern, integrated police headquarters complex, housing the office of the DGP and all other wings of the state police, including its computer centre, would be built at Taramani here. It will be constructed on a 24-acre plot, part of the now defunct MGR Film City, at an estimated cost of Rs 30 crore.				 																																																										The complex which now houses the DGPs office is a heritage building. Besides its dilapidated state, the structure is not large enough to accommodate all the departments of the state police and some of them have been housed in various rented places across the city.

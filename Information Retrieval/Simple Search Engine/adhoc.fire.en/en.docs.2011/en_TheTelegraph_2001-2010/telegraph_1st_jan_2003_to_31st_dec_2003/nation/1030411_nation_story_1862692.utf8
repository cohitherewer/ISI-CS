		 Friday, April 11, 2003 				 SC breather for Karunakaran
																								New Delhi, April 10: The Supreme Court today stayed Kerala High Courts order that said no sanction from the Lok Sabha Speaker was needed to prosecute an MP, in this case former Kerala chief minister K. Karunakaran, reports our legal correspondent.																								While staying the order in the palm oil import scam, the court issued notice to the state to reply to the special leave petition filed by the Congress MP.																								The case was registered against Karunakaran under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The charge was he had benefited financially from a Singapore company in the import of palm oil when he was chief minister. The prosecution said the state had suffered a loss of Rs 2.8 crore.																								The Thiruvananthapuram special judge had refused to take cognisance of the alleged offence in the absence of sanction from the Speaker as Karunakaran was an MP when the prosecution was launched. But the high court on appeal ruled that no such sanction was required under Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

																								Patna, Feb. 6: Dacoits took away valuables worth Rs 2 lakh from passengers of the South Bihar Express bound for Tatanagar and Bilaspur, stabbing six passengers who tried to resist them, in a 40-minute looting spree near Barh station, reports our special correspondent.																								The 12 dacoits entered the S-3 coach when the train, which was running 10 hours late, reached Barh station around 8 am yesterday, according to railway police sources. The passengers woke up when the train came to a sudden halt about 7 km from the station, to the sight of masked men brandishing revolvers and knives.																								They might have disconnected the hose pipe of the train, forcing it to stop for a long time, before the looting began, said Madhukar Tiwari, a passenger.

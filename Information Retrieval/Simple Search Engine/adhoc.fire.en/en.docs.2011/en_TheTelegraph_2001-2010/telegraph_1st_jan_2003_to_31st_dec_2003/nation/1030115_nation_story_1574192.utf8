		 Wednesday, January 15, 2003 				 Army to showcase new arms
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan 14: Some of Indias newest war machines will be displayed for the first time tomorrow at the Army Day parade. 																								The parade and the Republic Day celebrations to follow later this month have been planned as big events this year. Last year, the armed forces could put in only a token presence because of the forward deployment under Operation Parakram.																								The armys prestigious infantry training school at Mhow will also be rechristened as Army War College from tomorrow. It has hitherto been known as the College of Combat.																								Among the machines on public view for the first time tomorrow will be T-90 tanks, the first batch of which was imported from Russia in the middle of 2002. The T-90 tanks were sent to units in forward locations almost immediately after the first lot arrived in India. 																								Also to be displayed for the first time by the army are the Hindustan Aeronautics-built Advanced Light Helicopters, Dhruva and Lancer. 																								Television news channels will telecast the event live. Photographers who wait to take rare pictures of military equipment are praying the weather will hold and the fog will be light.

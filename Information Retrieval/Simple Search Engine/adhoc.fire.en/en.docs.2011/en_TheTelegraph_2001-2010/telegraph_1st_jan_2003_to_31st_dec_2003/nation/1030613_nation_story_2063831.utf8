		 Friday, June 13, 2003 				 Babri shield for Sangh
																								New Delhi, June 12 (PTI): The Centre today came to the rescue of Sangh parivar organisations over their alleged role in the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya by asserting before the Liberhan Commission that it was an unplanned event.																								There is no evidence to suggest that there was a conspiracy and plan to demolish the structure, Centres counsel Lala Ram Gupta told the commission probing the demolition of the disputed structure on December 6, 1992.																								Gupta maintained that it was an unplanned incident and no organisation could be held responsible for the demolition. He asserted that it was also outside the scope of terms and reference of the commission to inquire into the relationship among several organisations on the issue.																								The question of inter-relationship between some organisations such as the VHP, the Bajrang Dal, the RSS or the BJP is wholly irrelevant before the commission, the Centre said.

		 Tuesday, June 03, 2003 				 Extortion charge on Dawood brother
				 	 Kaskar after his arrest. (AFP file picture)																								Mumbai, June 2 (PTI): Police today chargesheeted underworld don Dawood Ibrahims brother Iqbal Hassan Ibrahim Kaskar in a case of alleged extortion and land-grabbing.																								Even as Kaskar and two others  Abdul Sattar Haji Hiva Radhanpur alias Sattar Teli, 54, and Abdul Rehman Abdul Gafoor Shaikh alias Rehman Boss, 44  were chargesheeted, they challenged in Bombay High Court a trial court order attaching two shopping centres.																								They were accused of evicting a woman from her house, which obstructed Sara Shopping Centre in south Mumbai. On a plea by the police, designated judge A.P. Bhangale had attached Sara and Sahara shopping complexes, allegedly owned by Dawood.																								The three accused in the case are Dawoods frontmen, the police said. The underworld don had invested in real estate through them to channel the flow of black money.																								Dawood and gangsters Chhota Shakeel and Tarique Abdul Karim Parveen are also wanted in connection with the case.																								In a related development, 370 tenants of the shopping complexes and joint owners of the properties today moved the high court challenging the order of the special court to attach the properties.																								Justice S.S. Parkar directed the prosecution to file its reply and deferred the matter till June 10. The petitioners argued that the properties were jointly owned by them and did not belong to the accused alone. Therefore, the attachment order was per se illegal. 																								A court receiver today filed a list of moveable and immovable properties of the attached shopping centres. 																								The police claimed to have recorded telephonic conversations between Kaskar and the two other accused over the centres which, they said, indicated that they had indulged in extortion and land grabbing.																								The police informed the court that preparations were on to transcribe the text of these talks and cassettes of the alleged conversations had been sent for analysis. 																								Besides, the police had identified more properties that had been taken over by the underworld for financial benefits.																								The accused have been charged under various sections of the IPC for putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt to commit extortion, robbery, conspiracy and common intention. 																								They have also been charged under Sections 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Control for Organised Crime Act for offences related to a crime syndicate and possessing unaccounted wealth on behalf of such a syndicate.

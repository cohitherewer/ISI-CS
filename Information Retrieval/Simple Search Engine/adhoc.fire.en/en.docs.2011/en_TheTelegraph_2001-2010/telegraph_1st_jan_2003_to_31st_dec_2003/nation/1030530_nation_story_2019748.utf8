		 Friday, May 30, 2003 				 Probe into Ayodhya leak
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Ayodhya, May 29: Judicial observers appointed by Allahabad High Court to supervise the excavation at the disputed site here have started an inquiry to find out who provided the photograph of a stone inscription discovered in a recently dug-up trench to a magazine. 																								They have also asked the commissioner of Faizabad to clarify under whose authority the magazines managing editor was allowed to enter and watch the excavation. 																								The inquiries were initiated following complaints filed by Muslim applicants on the basis of the magazines report on Wednesday. 																								The Central Sunni Waqf Board and three other litigants have accused the ASI team of leaking information to the press in violation of the high courts directions and demanded that those responsible should be removed from the team. 																								The disclosure concerns the so called inscription of Trench No. J-3, which has not even been taken out of the trench so far and the photograph/facsimile/estampage of which could not be available to anyone except the members of the excavation team, board counsel Zafaryab Jilani said.

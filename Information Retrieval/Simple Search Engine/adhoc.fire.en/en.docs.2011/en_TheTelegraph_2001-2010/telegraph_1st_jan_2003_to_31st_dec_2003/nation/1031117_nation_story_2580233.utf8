The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, November 17, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Centre eases I-T refunds process				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Centre has simplified procedures for income-tax refunds in a bid to tone up tax administration and provide speedy relief to tax-payers.				 																																																										The Central Board of Direct Taxes has also decided to do away with the system of separate refund books for refunds up to Rs 9,999 and those of Rs 10,000 and above, official sources said.				 																																																										The board has decided to simplify the procedure for issue of refunds by discontinuing the system of sending advice note to the bank separately in cases of refunds up to Rs 9,999, a source said.				 																																																										Stressing that the procedure for issue of refunds up to Rs 9,999 would be identical to the existing system for refunds up to Rs 999, they said the revised refund order book would, besides the refund order, include advice of refund and the counterfoil of refund and advice.				 																																																										According to a statement issued by the board, in the non-micr category, the conventional refund order book will be replaced by a refund order format in cheque-book form for refunds of up to Rs 9,999 and that above Rs 10,000.				 																																																										It, however, stated that in cases where refunds were to be prepared on pre-printed continuous computer stationery, the procedure of issue of refunds would remain the same.				 																Cheetals a threat to Andamans				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): Environmentalists have urged the Centre to legalise hunting of cheetals (spotted deer) in Andaman and Nicobar Islands for a while, to check the quadrupeds population in order to protect the vanishing rainforests and preserve the pristine beauty of the island.				 																																																										Cheetal, an invasive species on the island (introduced sometime in the 1930s from mainland), is responsible for the dwindling rainforests at the island, according to experts at a three-day seminar titled A look at the threatened species here recently. The seminar was organised to mark the centenary of the Journal of Bombay Natural History Society.				 																																																										Cheetal population has grown to such an extent that the ground flora of the rainforests have almost disappeared which has lead to huge soil erosion in the island and dwindling of the rainforest cover, wildlife biologist Rauf Ali said.				 																																																										Although hunting of cheetal is not legal, it should be allowed, with some time frame, to check cheetals population and regeneration of precious native rain forest, Ali said.				 																																																										The population has grown so much, one can even see them eating garbage, he lamented, adding that usually, the navy is blamed for not feeding the cheetals as they cannot be hunted.				 																10 tourists die in road mishap				 																																																	Balasore (PTI): At least 10 persons were killed and 30 injured when a tourist bus overturned and fell into a ditch at Jayanagar early on Sunday morning.				 																																																										Police said the bus was on its way from Puri to Midnapore in West Bengal via Digha when the mishap occurred in Bhograi police station area, about 70 km from here. The injured have been admitted to a government hospital.				 																Petrol pump looted				 																																																	Lucknow (PTI): A petrol pump owned by a nephew of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the outskirts of the city was raided by assailants who fled with Rs 32,000 in cash. Police said some assailants, armed with country-made pistols and iron rods, raided the petrol pump belonging to Raj Mishra at Itaunja on Saturday night.				 																Death damages				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The National Human Rights Commission has issued a showcause notice to the Southern Power Distribution Company in Andhra Pradesh, suggesting an interim compensation of Rs 1 lakh to the widow of one Dirisam Lajer who died after being electrocuted in 1999.				 																Appointment rap				 																																																	Jammu (PTI): Jammu and Kashmir High Court has quashed the appointment of Owais Ahmad, son of former finance and education minister Shafi Uri of the National Conference, as assistant tourist officer in violation of rules. The court observed that the selection of Ahmad, appointed directly to the post by the Farooq Abdullah government in 1998, was not according to laid down criteria.				 																Lifer for murder				 																																																	Nashik (PTI): Four persons, including three women, were sentenced to life imprisonment by a court for burning a woman to death following a dispute. Maruti Ramesh Gunjal, 28, his wife Nirmala Gunjal, 24, his mother Malan, 65, and Sakhubai Shinde, 60, were convicted for setting ablaze Sangeeta Mahadu Devre on October 15 last year.				 																Explosives seized				 																																																	Gorakhpur (PTI): Uttar Pradesh police seized seven and half quintals of explosives being smuggled to Nepal for supply to Maoist rebels during a raid at a village on the Indo-Nepal border.																		Bangalore will from December have a theatre boasting a coffee shop, book store, art gallery and a modern thrust stage. The Ranga Shankara, a Rs 3.2-crore project, is the brainchild of the late Kannada actor Shankar Nag and his wife Arundhati.

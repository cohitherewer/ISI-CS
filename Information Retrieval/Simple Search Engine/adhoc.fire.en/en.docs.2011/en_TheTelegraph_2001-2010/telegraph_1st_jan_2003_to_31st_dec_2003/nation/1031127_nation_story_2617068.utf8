		 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 BJP raps Laloo
																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: Stung by Laloo Prasad Yadavs charge that the Centre was indifferent to the situation in Assam and was not providing sufficient paramilitary forces, the BJP today hit back at the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, saying law and order was a state subject, reports our special correspondent.																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu said the allegations by Laloo Prasad as well as Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi were strongly condemnable as the state had to deal with law and order problems and not the Centre.

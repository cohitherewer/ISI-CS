 Kuala Lumpur, Aug. 21 (PTI):  Nearly 40 Indian workers have taken refuge at a gurdwara  in Malaysia after their employer cancelled their work permits  and tried to deport them, according to a Malaysian legal  aid council.																								The legal aid centre of the Malacca bar council has asked the Malaysian and Indian governments to intervene immediately to help the 38 workers, mostly hailing from Punjab and Andhra Pradesh.																								The workers, who had to take refuge earlier this week, had three-year contracts and valid work permits. We have managed to get them shelter in a gurdwara Jaspal Singh, a lawyer for the workers, said. We want an urgent and high level government intervention, both from Malaysia and India,  to stop this exploitation.																								The workers were employed by Technointan Holding SDN BHD in Malacca. They got their jobs about six months ago through the Mumbai-based Gulf Exports, run by one Kamal Sharma, one of the workers, Dharminder Singh, said.																								Technointan terminated their contracts and put them on a bus to the airport to send them back to India. But the workers managed to escape to fight for their rights.

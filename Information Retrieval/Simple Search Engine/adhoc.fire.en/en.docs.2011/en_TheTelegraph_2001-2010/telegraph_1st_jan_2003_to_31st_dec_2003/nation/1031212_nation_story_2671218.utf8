		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Patna mourns soul of the slum
 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Dec. 11: Praveen Kumar was to act in a play here this Saturday. But today, his fellow actors and other artistes took out a massive rally in the city to protest his murder yesterday.																								About 200 prominent cultural figures of the city took to the streets to protest against the murder of the 22-year-old drama teacher and theatre activist. Five bullets were pumped into his head and chest near Saidpur Nahari, a slum where he lived and campaigned against association with criminal elements. 																								Praveens elder brother broke down today at the condolence meeting at Bhagat Singh Chowk. He would not harm even an ant. Why did he have to die? Indradeep asked. Yesterday, he said the local crime lords resented Praveens campaign and could have had a hand in the murder.																								Praveens parents, too shocked to step out of home, stayed away from the meeting. 																								Shyam Sharma, a painter and former principal of Patna Arts College, drew a parallel with Safdar Hashmi in his tribute to the Delhi Public School teacher whose brothers and sisters are also into theatre. It is a Safdar Hashmi repeated, another blot on humanity, he said. Hashmi, a theatre activist and CPM member, was fatally attacked while performing a street play in Sahibabad, near Delhi, in 1989.																								Ramchand Khan, a former IPS officer, said Praveen was a great visionary. Praveen dreamt of a dignified life in a cultured society for his slum colony. He grew up seeing crime, drinking, prostitution and similar evils all around. He had a vision to raise the level of his people, for which he was punished, said Khan, the recently retired director-general of the Sports Authority of Bihar.																								His wife, Usha Kiran Khan, who is the president of the Nirman Kala Manch, said: A great soul of the slum wholeheartedly committed to uplifting his society through cultural action was Praveen, who gave a lot of importance to the education and health of children. 																								Praveen was receiving a monthly stipend of Rs 3,000 from the human resource development ministry on his selection as one of the three best professional theatre artistes in Bihar.																								About 15 cultural troupes from the city joined the protest march. 																								Later, they submitted a memorandum to district magistrate Deepak Prasad, demanding the immediate arrest of the assailants, an investigation into the cause and a Rs 10-lakh compensation for Praveens family.

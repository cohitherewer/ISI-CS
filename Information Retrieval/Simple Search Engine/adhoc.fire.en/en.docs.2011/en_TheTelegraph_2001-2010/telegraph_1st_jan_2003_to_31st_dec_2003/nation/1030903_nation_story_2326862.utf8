																								New Delhi, Sept. 2: BSP leaders say the BJP has threatened to use the CBI against Mayavati if she aligns with the Congress in the four major states that face Assembly elections, reports our special correspondent. 																								Polls are due by the end of the year in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Delhi.																								Rashid Alvi, BSP leader in the Lok Sabha, today said senior BJP leaders were making threatening calls to the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister to dissuade her from allying with other parties.																								Alvi said the BJP was trying to trap Mayavati since it had realised it would lose in the four states where it could have won had it joined hands with the BSP.																								The BSP leader admitted his party had erred in allying with the BJP in Uttar Pradesh.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT			ShahabuddinPatna, Aug. 20: A CBI investigator  confirmed while deposing before a court here that Mohammad  Shahabuddin had indeed been involved in the murder of former  JNU president Chandrasekhar in Siwan in 1997.																								Y. Harikumar, the investigating officer of the case, told Patna additional district and sessions judge E.J. Sharma yesterday that the Rashtriya Janata Dal MP was the key conspirator in the case.																								Harikumar said he was told by Chandrasekhars mother Kaushilya Devi that the MPs associates had threatened the deceased two days before the incident. Chandrasekhar was allegedly told to leave Siwan or it would prove to be costly for him.																								The court was further told that the main accused in the case, Dhrub K. Jaiswal, was arrested by police from Shahabuddins house. Jaiswal used to visit Shahabuddin in jail to seek his instructions, the court was told.																								Harikumar is also the 20th witness of the murder case now being heard.																								Chandrasekhar, a student leader who joined the CPI (ML) and launched his political career from Siwan, was killed at Jaiprakash Chowk in the city by unidentified assailants on March 31 when he was addressing a gathering. The meeting had been called in support of a bandh in Siwan on April 2, 1997, to protest against Shahabuddins terror.																								Harikumar said the motive behind the murder was Shahabuddins sense of insecurity over the growing popularity of Chandrasekhar.

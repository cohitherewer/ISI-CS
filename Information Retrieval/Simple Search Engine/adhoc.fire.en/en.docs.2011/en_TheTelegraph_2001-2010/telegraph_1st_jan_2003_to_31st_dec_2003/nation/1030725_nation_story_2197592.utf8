		 Friday, July 25, 2003 				 Minister nephew kidnapped
																								Patna, July 24 (PTI): As kidnappers struck again in Bihar today, doctors in private practice across the state struck work to protest a colleagues murder on Sunday.																								The latest abduction victim was Siddhanta Parmar, the eight-year-old nephew of state minister Raghavendra Pratap Singh. A student of a private school near Saguna More on Bailey Road, Siddhanta was abducted by three armed motorcycle-borne goons while he was waiting for the schoolbus, police sources said.																								His brother, Shantanu, and grandfather K.P. Singh were there, too, sources said. The kidnappers, they said, discarded their motorcycle for a car parked a few kilometres from the site.																								The incident rocked the Assembly with members demanding Siddhantas immediate release and action against the kidnappers.																								Angry residents of Ashiana Nagar gathered at the Jagdeo Path roundabout and blocked Patna-Danapur Road linking Patna to Varanasi. They shouted anti-administration and anti-police slogans and set ablaze tyres.																								As senior district police officers camped at the site, thousands of doctors in other parts of Patna marched under the Indian Medical Associations banner.																								Their protest was part of the daylong strike at clinics and private nursing homes against Dr Om Prakash Vermas murder on Sunday night. 																								Verma, the owner of a nursing home, was gunned down at Danapurs Takiapar locality for refusing to yield to extortion demands. The association was also protesting the frequent attacks on the medical fraternity for extortion money. 																								Government hospitals functioned as usual because they were kept out of the purview of the dawn-to-dusk strike.																								The strike was decided on at the associations meeting late last evening after a 48-hour deadline it had set on Monday for the killers arrest expired.																								According to reports from Samastipur, Sitamarhi, Saran, Muzaffarpur and some other districts, the strike had a widespread impact.

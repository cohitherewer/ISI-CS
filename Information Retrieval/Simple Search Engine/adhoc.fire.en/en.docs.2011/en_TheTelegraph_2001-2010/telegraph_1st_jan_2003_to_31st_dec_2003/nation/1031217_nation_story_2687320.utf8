 K.C. PHILIP Patna, Dec. 16: Artistes  here are up in arms over a police attempt to tarnish the  reputation of theatre activist Praveen Kumar, murdered a  week ago in the heart of the city.																								Senior superintendent of police Sunil Kumar yesterday said Praveen was gunned down because he was involved romantically with a girl closely related to one of his murderers.																								Praveen, a 22-year-old drama teacher at Delhi Public School here, was gunned down near Saidpur Naharis Nand Nagar colony early on December 10 as he set out to catch the school bus.																								The teacher had been running a campaign to get his Nand Nagar slum mates to distance themselves from criminal elements and join the mainstream. Crime lords resented Praveens drive and may have been behind the murder.																								The police had said last week that they were exploring all angles and had not yet established the murder motive.																								But yesterday, they decided to get one of the accused, Sonu Kumar, to repeat before the media the confession he had made about the murder.																								Most newspapers here duly reproduced the same version today: Praveen was murdered because of his obsession with a girl.																								A senior police officer of Patna, Rakesh Dubey, said the mystery had been solved and the case was over.																								But the theatre activists family and local artistes are not ready to accept this version. Is loving a girl a crime for a young artiste like Praveen? asked Sanjay Upadhyaya, the secretary of Nirman Kala Manch and a director and playwright himself.																								Praveens elder brother Indradeep, who filed an FIR in the case, was incredulous. If at all there was an affair with that girl, it is an old story. Her father is a family friend of ours. She, too, used to visit us. In fact he (the father) even helped me when I was contesting the municipal council ward seat, he added.																								The issue for us is not just a Praveen or his love affair, added Sanjay. We are concerned about the growing crime in the capital and the police nexus with the criminal world.																								Artistes here believe the police are hushing up the case and trying to discredit them by portraying the crime as a murder sparked by a love affair, Tanwir Akthar, secretary of the Indian Peoples Theatre Association, said.

		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Naidu defends southern flock, pats former ally
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 A. Raja (left) and T.R. Baalu after submitting their resignations. (PTI)																								Chennai, Dec. 21: As the DMKs Union ministers sent in their resignation today, the BJP shunned a blame game while defending its Tamil Nadu unit, which had long had strained relations with the former southern ally.																								Hours after environment minister T.R. Baalu and junior health and family welfare minister A. Raja submitted their resignation to the Prime Minister in Delhi, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu said his party was saddened at the development.																								The DMK had yesterday announced the pullout from the NDA at the Centre but decided to continue issue-based support from outside.																								On the way to Delhi from his hometown of Nellore, near Chennai, Naidu admitted this evening that the BJP, busy with governance in New Delhi and its anxieties to deliver to the people, failed to adequately attend to the prolonged impasse between its state unit and the DMK. But he added: I do not find fault with my state unit.																								There were misunderstandings, but the BJP unit was asked to issue clarifications now and then, Naidu said. The NDA was not functioning at the state level, he added, referring to the widening rift since March 2002.																								Naidu emphasised that his state party found unpalatable DMK chief M. Karunanidhis sharing (of) a platform with the Congress and the Left parties on certain issues. We are opposing the Congress and the Left parties at the national level.																								But the BJP chief was quick to note that the party had been comfortable working with the DMK at the Centre and acknowledged the contributions of its ministers, including late Murasoli Marans at the World Trade Organisation meeting in Doha.																								Naidu clarified that his remark about the DMKs anti-terror law agitation was a general statement on what coalition dharma entailed.																								Declining comment whether he thought the Jayalalithaa-led ADMK was a more natural ally of his party, Naidu said alliances would crystallise only when we come close to the (general) elections.																								If they (DMK) come back, we will be happy, Naidu said, adding he would discuss with NDA convenor George Fernandes his last nights conversation with Karunanidhi. DMK sources, however, said this evening that it was too late for the party to retrace its steps.																								The BJP, they added, went all out to defend its allies in Uttar Pradesh  like when Independent MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh was slapped with anti-terror law charges  and in Punjab for Parkash Singh Badal.																								But it failed to show the same commitment to the DMK and the MDMK. We have been insulted, the sources said.																								Naidu, however, said: We have been sincere to our allies, including the DMK.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 11: The Centre is thinking of an exclusive legislation for maintaining and managing the countrys historic shrines and religious centres, encouraged by the successful management of the Vaishno Devi temple through a trust.																								Culture and tourism minister Jagmohan has called a meeting of state culture ministers on Tuesday to discuss the importance of such a legislation.																								According to ministry sources, there is a general feeling that several old shrines and religious centres  which are important pilgrim and tourist spots  are in pathetic condition as these are not being properly maintained.																								Jagmohan has already written to the chief ministers emphasising the need to enact a separate legislation for better upkeep of the historic religious centres.																								The objective of the legislation, sources said, is to ensure proper use of the funds received by these shrines  visited by a large number of pilgrims  and make the management accountable for the expenditure.																								The Centre is also keen on reorganising the Archaeological Survey of India by creating a separate all-India service for the maintenance of historic monuments and archaeologically crucial projects.																								According to sources, the issue has already been broached with the personnel department; rules and regulations are now being formulated.																								Under the all-India service, likely to be called Indian Archaeological Service, a class I officer would be posted in each district to ensure preservation and conservation of important monuments, the sources said.																								As a first step, Jagmohan, they said, has called a meeting tomorrow to review archaeological projects across the country.

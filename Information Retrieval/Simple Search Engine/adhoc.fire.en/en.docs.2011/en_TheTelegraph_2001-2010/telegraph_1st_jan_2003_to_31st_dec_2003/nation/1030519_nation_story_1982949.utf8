The Bihar unit of the Indian Medical Association, which held an emergency meeting today, has served a 48-hour ultimatum for his rescue, failing which it has threatened to go on a ceasework across the state.																								The doctors in Patna had struck work about three months ago when Dr Bharat Singh was kidnapped, bringing medical services in the capital to a halt.																								Chandra was abducted when he was returning to his Ashiana Nagar residence after attending a dinner hosted by the former state president of the medical body, Ajay Kumar. Neurosurgeons from eight states are in Patna to attend a conference, which has been postponed following the abduction. Kumar said Chandra left for home around 10.45 pm in his Tata Indica.																								His car was stopped near a bridge near Ashiana Nagar. Broken pieces of his spectacles found inside the car indicated a scuffle between the doctor and his abductors.																								The abductors called up his family this morning to inform that the car was lying at the Mithapur agriculture farm near Patna Bypass Road.																								He has been abducted, a stern voice told his family and added that the doctor would talk to them in the evening. It was learnt that the abductors have asked for a hefty ransom.																								After the news reached the police headquarters, a special task force swung into action. 																								Stating that chief minister Rabri Devi had given a free hand to police to launch a manhunt, director-general of police D.P. Ojha said a meeting of superintendents of police of Patna, Nalanda, Vaishali and Jehanabad had been convened to chalk out strategies for smashing the dens of kidnappers.																								Ojha said the police had already identified the gang and raids were on to secure the release of Chandra. The police suspected that a gang, some of whose key members have already been rounded up, was responsible for the incident. 																								It also kidnapped a jeweller, Sanjay Dayal, from Patna yesterday, the police said.																								Union minister for smallscale industries C.P. Thakur today met their families.

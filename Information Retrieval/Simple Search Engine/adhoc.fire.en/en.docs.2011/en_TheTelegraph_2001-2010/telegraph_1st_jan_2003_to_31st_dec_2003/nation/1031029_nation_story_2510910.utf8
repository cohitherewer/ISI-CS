		 Wednesday, October 29, 2003 				 Sonia in Amethi
																								Lucknow, Oct. 28: Sonia Gandhi skirted political issues during her brief visit to Amethi today and her supporters chose not to worry about Mulayam Singh Yadavs recent bid to distance his party from the Congress, reports our special correspondent.																								The party is on a comeback trail in Uttar Pradesh and there is a growing realisation among the people that Sonia is the only answer to communal and casteist parties that have been the bane of the state, said Sanjay Singh, the former BJP MP who recently joined the Congress.																								The former ruler of Amethi and his wife Amita Singh, a BJP MLA and a former state minister, were present when Sonia launched the Rajiv Gandhi Lifeline Express here. It will provide mobile medical facilities to Sonias Parliamentary constituency.																								My husband and I always considered serving the people of India more important than winning elections, and people of India have now started realising that the Congress alone can save the country at this critical juncture, Sonia said.																								Other speakers at the function such as state minister Jangbahadur Singh, too, kept away from political issues.																								Yet the growing tension between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party was palpable when some Congress workers later said they suspected chief minister Mulayam Singh of playing the BJPs game.																								Mulayam Singh has accepted support from the BJP in the past and this time also he is trying to sail on two boats, state Youth Congress chief Jayasi said. 																								Like in the past, villagers shouted slogans of Bring Priyanka into politics, but Sonia simply said: She can take her own decisions.

		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Joshi sends funds plea to Atal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: Human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi has knocked on the doors of the Prime Minister, seeking more funds from the finance ministry for the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan.																								The Planning Commission had said a sum of Rs 32,000 crore was required during the 10th Plan period for implementing the Abhiyan, aimed at putting children in the 6-14 age group in school by this year. The finance ministry, however, allocated only Rs 17,000 crore.																								Joshi, who has been upset with the finance ministry for starving the programme of funds, has sought Atal Bihari Vajpayees intervention in the matter.																								In his letter to the Prime Minister, Joshi has underlined that the right to education is a fundamental right and said the programme was laid down under Vajpayees guidance.																								The Centre, Joshi pointed out, would invite criticism in case it failed to implement the programme. He has asked the Prime Minister to give necessary directions to the finance ministry and the Planning Commission to ensure more funds for the programme.																								Tussles between the HRD ministry and the finance ministry are not new.																								Every year, a couple of months before the budget session begins in February, the HRD ministry starts petitioning the finance ministry for funds. Usually, funds sanctioned for education, health, women and children fall far below the requirements.																								Although the last budget brought cheers to the health ministry, the HRD ministry was left out in the cold. Pushed to the wall, Joshi did an about-turn and asked international agencies for funds.																								With the finance ministry now appearing to have capped the total requirement for the programme at Rs 17,000 crore, Joshi will have to raise the additional Rs 15,000 crore from foreign organisations.																								Earlier in this session, Joshi had announced in Parliament that the European Commission was giving 200 million euros. The World Bank and the British Overseas Development Agency were also interested in pitching in.

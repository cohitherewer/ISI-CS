		 Saturday, May 17, 2003 				 Madhumita sister does a U-turn
 Lucknow, May 16 (PTI):  As a political storm raged over the alleged role of Uttar  Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathi in the murder of poet  Madhumita Shukla, her sister today backtracked in her charges  against him. 																								Madhumitas sister Nidhi told reporters in Lakhimpur Kheri: I have been misquoted by a section of the media which went ahead and said I blamed Amarmani Tripathi and his wife, Madhurmani, for the murder of my sister. 																								Nidhi said Madhumita had no personal relationship with the minister and might have met him in connection with kavi sammelans that she used to frequent.																								She also denied Madhumita was pregnant when she was murdered. However, director-general of police Hakim Singh said Madhumita was six months pregnant at the time of the murder. 																								Asked why the police were not interrogating some suspects, the DGP said: Police investigate on the basis of suspicion and not on the basis of rumours.																								Madhumitas sister also raised doubts over the role of Lucknow police but said her family had not demanded a CBI inquiry into the killing.																								She said she feared that evidences could be destroyed or new evidences planted at Madhumitas Lucknow residence.																								The lock at the flat had been broken and we are not aware who all have an access to that house or what is being done with the evidences lying there, she added.																								According to the police, Madhumita was murdered in her Paper Colony flat last Friday by two young men.

 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Dec. 29: Pakistan has ruled out a revision of the Saarc charter at the summit beginning here on January 4.																								Pakistan has often called for amendments to the charter to enable the member states to discuss bilateral disputes.																								However, most of the member states of the South Asian forum showed lukewarm attitude while India openly opposed the proposal, fearing Kashmir would then be raised at the forum.																								Neither is the issue on the summits agenda nor has there been any proposal made by any of the member states in this regard, foreign office spokesman Masood Khan said after a meeting of the programming committee, which consists of joint secretaries from the seven Saarc nations.																								Pakistan promised not to raise the Kashmir issue. I dont think that this issue (Kashmir) would be raised, discussed or debated at the Saarc summit, Khan said.																								He said the programming committee reviewed cooperation among the member states in forestry, science and technology, human resource development, trade and industry and the summit calendar.																								We must make the Saarc summit calendar more predictable and this is what the programming committee is focussing on, he said.																								On security arrangements for the summit, the spokesman asserted: I can assure you that there will be foolproof security of Saarc leaders.																								Foreign secretary Riaz H. Khokhar had on Saturday said that security arrangements for the summit were comprehensive and none of the member countries had approached Pakistan for extra security measures. 																								All heads of state or government of the member states, including Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, will attend the summit. Musharraf-Atal meet																								About the possibility of Vajpayees meetings with President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, the foreign office spokesman said though no request has officially been made, we are prepared to encourage such interactions.																								The Saarc summit provides a historic opportunity and the leadership of the two countries should utilise it for bilateral engagement to resolve outstanding issues, Khan said.																								We are prepared for a meeting between the Prime Minister of India and our Prime Minister if there is a willingness to meet each other, he said. 																								We are prepared to meet Vajpayee and we would encourage meetings at the highest level and a meeting between the leaders of the two countries, said the foreign office spokesman.																								But Khan made it clear that whatever gestures Pakistan had made so far did not mean compromise on the Kashmir dispute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, October 13, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Meet on fugitive tracking in Delhi				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): India will host the third international conference on fugitives, jointly organised by the CBI and the Interpol, even as Pakistan is likely to stay away from the meet.				 																																																										The three-day conference, to be inaugurated by deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani on October 15, would have participants from nearly 50 nations.				 																																																										The countries will discuss setting up special fugitive units, their structure and functioning, besides issues of extradition, deportation and the legal value of red-corner notices, a CBI spokesman said.				 																																																										CBI director P.C. Sharma has been the pioneer in campaigning for easing of deportation and extradition laws so that little scope is left for fugitives to escape from one country to another.				 																																																										The issue of fugitives has been drawing global attention in view of the increasing terrorist activities and organised crimes but still some countries were giving unofficial political patronage to criminals.				 																																																										Pakistan, which has been a glaring example of a country that provides shelter to several wanted criminals, including underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, has yet to confirm its participation.				 																Don brother visits fathers grave Mumbai (PTI): Iqbal Kaskar, the younger  brother of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and an accused  in a land grabbing case, visited his fathers grave at Bada  Kabrasthan in Marine Lines on Saturday on the occasion of  Shab-e-Barat, police sources said.				 																																																										Iqbal is facing trial under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act. 				 																																																										Designated judge A.P. Bhangale ordered Iqbal to deposit Rs 8,500 to pay the expenses of his police escort.				 																																																										The court also allowed similar benefits to Iqbals associates and co-accused Abdul Sattar Teli and Abdul Rehman Abdul Gafoor Shaikh. 				 																																																										Iqbals lawyer Rizwan Merchant had pleaded that his client desired to pay homage to his father on Shab-e-Barat, an occasion when Muslims pray for their elders at their graves. 				 																Centre in MBBS extension plea				 																																																	New delhi (PTI): The Centre has gone back on its advice and sought a two-month extension for admission to the MBBS course despite the Supreme Court iterating September 30 as the last date.				 																																																										The health and family welfare ministry wrote to the Medical Council of India on September 25, asking it to extend the deadline to November 30 only for the current session of 2003-04. Four days later, the council replied that in view of the apex courts repeated orders, it was neither open nor permissible for it or any other authority to recommend the extension.				 																Pak prisoners 				 																																																	Alwar (PTI): Eleven Pakistani prisoners who went on hunger strike demanding repatriation ended their fast following a talk with district authorities on Saturday. The prisoners, in a transit camp in the central jail here, were awaiting clearance from the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi for returning home. 				 																Guru articles back				 																																																	Moga (PTI): The articles belonging to 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh, which had been lying with a family in Faridkot and were taken secretly to Canada, were recently brought back. Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee chief G.S. Tohra said the Sodhi family had 14 such articles. Two other articles, a chola and a dastar, lying with the family, were also taken to Canada by a family member.				 																Warrant rap 				 																																																	Ballia (PTI): A court has issued non-bailable warrants against Uttar Pradesh minister of state for cooperatives Shardanand Anchal and 44 others in two cases of robbery and attempted murder. Samajwadi Party legislator Mohammad Rizvi and former district unit chief Shankar Yadav were among those against whom the warrants are issued on Saturday after the accused failed to appear in court despite several notices. 				 																Manisha film plans				 																																																	Kathmandu (PTI): Manisha Koirala plans to direct Nepalese movies and set up a studio here to take the film industry of her native land to international standards. I am interested to make and direct Nepali films. I want to contribute in taking the level of the Nepalese film industry up to international level, Manisha said.

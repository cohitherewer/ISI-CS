		 Saturday, September 20, 2003 				 Katiyar sees Ayodhya comeback
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Sept. 19: Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Vinay Katiyar today welcomed the Rae Bareli courts decision in the Babri Masjid demolition case, saying it would help bring Ayodhya back on to the centrestage of politics.																								Katiyar, one of the seven accused against whom the court will now frame charges on October 10, said he also welcomed the courts discharge of deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani. 																								As for the rest of us, we welcome the chance given by the court to put forward our case on the temple issue. We are confident that we will not only be able to prove that we committed no crime, but also expose the pseudo-secularists who have been politicising the issue with an eye on the Muslim votebank, he said.																								VHP leader Ashok Singhal, another accused, was unruffled by the court order. He said on the phone from Ayodhya that the judicial process would have no effect on his organisations proposed Ayodhya march on October 6. We take orders from the sadhus and sants alone and do not accept the courts role in the resolution of the Ayodhya dispute, he said.																								Samajwadi Party state chief Ram Saran Das welcomed the decision on behalf of his party as chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was touring the flood-affected areas of Uttar Pradesh. However, we would have been happier if the court had not let off Advani, he added.

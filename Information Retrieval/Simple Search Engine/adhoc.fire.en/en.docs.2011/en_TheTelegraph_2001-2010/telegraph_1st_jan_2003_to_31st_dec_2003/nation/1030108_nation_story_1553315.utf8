																								Hyderabad, Jan. 7 (PTI): A 12-year-old boy was allegedly pushed out of a train last night by two Railway Protection Force constables, following which passengers went on the rampage at Cherlapally railway station.																								The boy fell on the tracks and lost his left arm and right leg, police sources said today. 																								The victim, Vikram, was selling samosas on the Hyderabad-Warangal train. When it reached Cherlapally station, he changed compartments, where the police asked for his ticket. 																								When he failed to produce a ticket, the cops forced him to get off the train which had started moving by then. He fell on the tracks and lost his left arm and right leg. The passengers stopped the train and went on rampage. 																								In a similar incident last year, jawans had pushed a passenger off a train in Bihar, citing unauthorised entry.																								The injured boy was immediately shifted to the railway hospital at Secunderabad where his two limbs were amputated, the police said.																								Hospital sources described his condition as stable.

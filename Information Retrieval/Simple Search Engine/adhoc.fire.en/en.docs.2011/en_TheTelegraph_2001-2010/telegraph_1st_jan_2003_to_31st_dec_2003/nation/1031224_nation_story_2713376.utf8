		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 PM firm despite dip in infiltration
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Islamabad, Dec. 23: Cross-border infiltration has declined after the recent ceasefire, Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee said on the eve of his visit to Islamabad for the Saarc summit.																								However, Vajpayee told the BJP parliamentary party at a meeting today that India could not have a meaningful dialogue with Pakistan till Islamabad takes effective and visible steps to end cross-border terrorism. The Prime Minister said there will be no meaningful dialogue till Pakistan ended cross-border terrorism and dismantled the camps training terrorists, BJP spokesman V.K. Malhotra said. 																								Vajpayees tough-talk does not necessarily rule out a meeting with President Pervez Musharraf or Pakistan Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali during his Islamabad visit. Instead, his remarks appear aimed at placating hardliners within the Sangh parivar. Pak for plebiscite																								In Islamabad, Pakistan has said a UN-mandated plebiscite in Kashmir was necessary. Foreign office spokesman Masood Khan said: (The) importance of UN resolutions cannot be ignored when we talk of certain possibilities to promote result-oriented dialogue on outstanding issues.

																								Srinagar, Aug. 4 (PTI): A Kashmiri youth, who was arrested allegedly because he is a namesake of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Mohammad Yaseen Malik, has sought the Prime Ministers intervention to end his agony.																								Malik  a resident of Zandfaran village of Baramullah district and out on bail  was arrested by Punjab police on his way to Pakistan to meet his uncle in 1999. 																								The case is pending before the court of the chief judicial magistrate in Amritsar.																								In his letter, Malik said he was arrested despite having valid travel documents as he refused to grease the palm of policemen at the Atari border on his way to Bahawalpore in Pakistan.																								After waiting for justice for over five years, Malik said he was amused to see a message from the Punjab police advising me to visit the state as the Punjab Human Rights Commission is holding a fresh inquiry into the case.																								Claiming that they have already inquired the case and found me innocent, he alleged that the fresh inquiry was ordered just to prolong the case.																								Hoping to meet his uncle in Pakistan one day, Malik appealed to the Prime Minister that a serious effort should be made to allow members of broken families on both sides of the border to meet each other.

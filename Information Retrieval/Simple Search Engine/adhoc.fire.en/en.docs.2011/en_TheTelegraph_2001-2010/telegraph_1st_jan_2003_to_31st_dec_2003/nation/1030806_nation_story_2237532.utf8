																								Bhubaneswar, Aug. 5: Two primary school teachers in Raygada district were arrested today on charges of sexual assault on students, reports our correspondent. 																								Police have lodged cases against Gour Chandra Satpathy, the headmaster of Kandhamaligan Primary Sevashram, and teacher Ghenu Sethi under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and the SC/ST Atrocities Act.																								Satpathy had allegedly forced two boys of the school into a physical relationship and Sethi was alleged to have made some students boil his urine and then apply it on his body. 																								Prima facie it appears to be a case of sexual perversion. It is a serious allegation, Raygada collector P.K. Meherda said. He has recommended the state school and mass education department to suspend the teachers after the additional district magistrate and the tehsildar conducted an on-the-spot probe and found the allegations to be true. The students, who stayed in a hostel with 38 others, on Saturday complained to the collector that the teachers were ill-treating them.																								 They had also alleged that the hostel rooms were dark and they were not given food on time. 																								The students, most of whom had left the hostel after the harassment, have returned. 																								The two teachers will appear in court tomorrow.

 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, April 21: Uttar Pradesh chief minister showed no signs of backing down in her fight against Mulayam Singh Yadav even as the Samajwadi Party chief and six others got a reprieve from immediate arrest in the case involving the use of the chief ministers discretionary fund.																								After expanding her ministry to include two defectors from the Apna Dal, the Bahujan Samaj Party chief made it clear that she would continue her war against the Samajwadi chief come what may.																								Main rajnaitik dawab mein ane wali nahin. Doshi kisi bhi halat mein bakhsha nahin jayega (I will not succumb to political pressure and the guilty will not be spared at any cost), the Uttar Pradesh chief minister said, while reacting to the furore in Parliament on the issue today.																								These MPs and political parties did not utter a word when then chief minister Kalyan Singh had lodged an FIR against me, alleging that I had made money from the purchase of float pumps when I was the BSP MP and the case was totally false, Mayavati said.																								But when the same daughter of a Dalit acts against anyone based on existing legal norms, these MPs are howling in protest. This exposes the double standards and I will expose the manuwadi mentality in Parliament also, she added.																								Mayavati claimed that the action her government was taking against the misuse of the discretionary fund was transparent and not the result of a political vendetta. 																								There could not be a more unbiased action than the inquiry into the use of the fund as I have also included my tenures as chief minister within the ambit of the probe, she pointed out.																								The Samajwadi has a history of making a mockery of the law. Its leaders were hoping to cash in on any illegal step on the part of the government, but this did not happen, she said.																								The chief minister pointed out that the probe into the use of the fund would continue and the instructions of the high court would also be followed. I will not spare anyone who has misused government funds, but all action will be taken within the framework of the law, she said.

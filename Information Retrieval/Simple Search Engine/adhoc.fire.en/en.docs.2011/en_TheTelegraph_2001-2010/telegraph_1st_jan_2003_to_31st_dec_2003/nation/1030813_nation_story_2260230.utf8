		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Basu seeks state say on cow bill
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The CPM is likely to oppose the proposed central bill imposing a countrywide ban on cow slaughter.																								The matter should be left to the states, said former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu, who is here to attend a politburo meeting.																								Politburo leaders have not spelt out how the CPM will respond when the bill is introduced in Parliament, but have made it clear that the party sees little reason to support the bill.																								Hum danda bajate rahenge is bill ke khilaaf (We will raise a storm against the bill), CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet said.																								We will keep opposing the bill, said senior politburo member Sitaram Yechury. Muslims and Christians eat beef. What happens to them? asked Basu.																								Bengal is one of eight states that have not banned cow slaughter. Asked how the state will respond if the bill is passed, Basu said: First let them bring the bill.																								The CPM is tightlipped on the Centres proposal to introduce a bill granting reservation to the economically poor sections among the upper castes. It may support the bill because the party has all along said reservation should be based on economic criteria.																								However, the party may not want to allow the BJP to pass the legislation on election-eve and derive electoral advantage from it.																								The BJP is waiting for the Left parties to refuse to support the cow slaughter bill so that it can accuse it of hurting Hindu sentiments. The Left thinks the BJP is using the cow slaughter and economic reservations legislations to reap dividends during Novembers Assembly elections.																								We have nothing against protecting cows. What are the Centres plans? Are they going to have gaushalas? asked Atul Anjaan, a CPI leader. What we sense is that the BJP is trying to gain political mileage out of this.																								The CPM politburo will announce its stand on the bills after a meeting tomorrow. The politburo is also expected to formalise its support to the Congress in the five states that head to elections in November.

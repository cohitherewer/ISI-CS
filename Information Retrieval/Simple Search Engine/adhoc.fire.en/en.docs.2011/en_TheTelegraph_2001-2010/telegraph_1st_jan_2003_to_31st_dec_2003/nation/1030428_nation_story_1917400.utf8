		 Monday, April 28, 2003 				 PM to attend BJP-RSS conclave
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 27: Atal Bihari Vajpayee will attend a three-day BJP-RSS conclave likely to iron out the problems cropping up in the Sangh parivar after Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh ideologue Dattopant Thengadi recently likened the Prime Minster to Jaichand and Mir Jafar.																								Government sources said Vajpayee will be present for the inaugural and concluding sessions but he is not expected to address the meeting, to be held from May 1 to 3. The meeting, they said, would be interactive and not meant to be very structured.																								The decision to host such a conclave emanated from the BJPs last national executive in Indore that proposed the Sangh parivar and more so BJP and RSS leaders meet every three months to keep alive their channel of communication.																								The entire RSS brass is expected to show up, including sarsanghachalak K.S. Sudarshan and general secretaries Mohanrao Bhagwat and Madan Das Devi.																								However, Sangh sources said it was not clear whether leaders of its affiliates like the VHP and the BMS would be around.																								Thengadis allegation came days after the BJP resolved to re-establish its old ties with the Sangh and many felt it would confuse the cadre and reinforce their perception that the quot;real quot; opposition to the NDA government came not so much from the Congress and the Left as the parivar itself.

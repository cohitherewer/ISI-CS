		 Saturday, July 05, 2003 				 Cellphone on Lahore bus
																								New Delhi, July 4: Passengers of the buses to Lahore, set to roll once again next week, can stay in touch with the people they leave behind, reports our special correspondent.																								The second phase of the service will start from July 11 and will have two mobile phones. I cannot comment on who the service provider will be, said a spokesperson of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), which is running the service.																								However, sources in DTC confirmed that AirTel has undertaken the pilot project for the last few weeks and has successfully completed it.																								The project has confirmed that wireless connectivity can be provided to the bus passengers. We have tentatively decided to charge Rs 10 per minute for calls made from the mobile phones. We will retain Rs 6, while the service provider will get the rest, but the revenue sharing may change depending on the negotiations, a DTC source said.

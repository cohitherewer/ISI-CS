		 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 VHP now claims Jama Masjid 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 17: Giving an ominous twist to the ongoing excavation at Ayodhya, VHP vice-president Giriraj Kishore today said digging around the disputed site has reinforced their claim that most mosques were built after destroying Hindu places of worship.																								Kishore claimed that a Jamuna mandir once existed where the Jama Masjid (in Delhi) now stands.																								This was in reply to a question whether the VHP would demand excavation near the Jama Masjid.																								Addressing a press conference, Kishore said the diggers have found sadhu dhuni, a platform, and an ancient (some 800-900 years old) brick pillar. 																								These, he claimed, were good indications that supported their charge that most of the mosques were built after destroying Hindu places of worship.																								Asked if he would demand excavation near the Jama Masjid, the VHP leader corrected journalists saying it was a Jamuna mandir.																								About the excavation work at Ayodhya, he said evidence in favour of Hindus was emerging and it is causing a scare in Muslim society.																								The Uttar Pradesh unit of the BJP also claimed that recoveries during the excavation were proof of Hindu culture.																								The state unit today asked Muslims to honour the sentiments of the majority community and think positively to resolve the long-standing dispute.																								The evidences recovered from the excavations being carried out at the disputed site on the directives of the high court are proofs of Hindu culture and hopefully Muslims would adopt a positive attitude over the issue, party spokesman Hriday Narain Dixit said.																								He also criticised the demand for deploying Muslim labourers for the excavation. 																								Extreme views like these will serve no purpose. Labourers are merely carrying out their work under the supervision of senior officials and have nothing to do with religion, he said.

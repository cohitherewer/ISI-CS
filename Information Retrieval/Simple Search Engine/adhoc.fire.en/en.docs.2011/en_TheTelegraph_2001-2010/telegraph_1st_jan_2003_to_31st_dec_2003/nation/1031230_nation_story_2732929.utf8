																								Bhubaneswar, Dec. 29: Two Patnaiks are spoiling the poll preparations for the Congress in Orissa, reports our correspondent.																								The main Opposition party is caught between state unit chief Sarat Patnaik and former chief minister J.B. Patnaik.																								The clarification by AICC secretary K.K. Sharma yesterday that there is no question of a change of guard in the state unit does not appear to have cleared the confusion surrounding the state Congress chief.																								Sharma, who reviewed the state units organisational network on the occasion of the partys 118th foundation day, said: Sarats leadership is working fine in Orissa. He stressed on unity among party workers.																								 in the run-up to the polls.																								But unity is what is lacking. While the former chief minister is lying low after being told there will be no change of guard, it is unlikely that he would accept Sarat as his leader.																								For the better part of this year, most of the dissidents leaders travelled to Delhi and back to convince the high command about the futility of retaining Sarat, whose leadership has hardly been inspirational. His Sankalp Yatra turned out to be a damp squib.																								However, despite the faction rivalry, the party did put up a fight in this years civic polls. Although it lost three Assembly bypolls on the trot, the party came a close second in the civic elections, finishing just behind the BJD. It secured a majority in 19 urban local bodies and performed well in western and southern districts.

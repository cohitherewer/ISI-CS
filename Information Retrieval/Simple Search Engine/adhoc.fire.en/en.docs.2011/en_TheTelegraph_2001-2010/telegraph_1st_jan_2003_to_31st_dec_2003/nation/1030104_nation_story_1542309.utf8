		 Saturday, January 04, 2003 				 Terror law invoked
																								Mumbai, Jan. 3 (PTI): Four persons, alleged to have masterminded the Ghatkopar bus blast, were today charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.																								But a special court further remanded them in police custody till January 17. They were initially charged under the IPC.																								This is the second time that Mumbai police have invoked the anti-terrorism Act. Earlier, it was slapped on Mohammed Afroz for suspected links with al Qaida. But the charges had to be dropped leaving the police and the state government red-faced.																								A blast had ripped through a bus in Ghatkopar in northeast Mumbai on December 2, killing two persons and injuring 31.																								Extending the remand of the accused, sessions court judge A.P. Bhangale said their custody was necessary as their interrogation was likely to lead to further collection of important material so as to unravel the case.																								The accused, including a government medical college lecturer, were brought in burqa to the court amid tight security.

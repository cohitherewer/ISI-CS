		 Thursday, February 27, 2003 				 Midnight swoop nets Bihar and Nepal Maoists
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Feb. 26: A team of Central Intelligence Bureau and Special Task Force officials snapped up eight Naxalites, including four Nepal Maoists, in a late-night swoop on an Internet parlour in the heart of Bihars capital. 																								The rounding up of four Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) leaders  Kamal Nayan, son of Bihar MCC chief Promod Mishra, and Jeetan Marandi, most wanted in Jharkhand, among them  along with the four Nepali Maoists, re-affirmed the growing links between the Left militants of Bihar and Nepal. 																								The Nepalis, all in their early twenties, have been identified as Binod Thapa, Amar Karki, Amit Tamang and Rohit Kumar alias Dipak Karki.																								The IB sleuths, who arrived as a five-member team from Delhi yesterday, had kept Patna police in the dark about the raid in the Patrakarnagar area. After landing in the afternoon, the team was keeping watch on two Internet-cum-telephone booths. 																								Around 11.30 pm, the sleuths confirmed their suspicion and gave the go-ahead for storming one. Armed jawans surrounded the booth as the team moved in and quickly overpowered the eight persons inside.																								The booth, Pioneer Communication Centre, had turned into a Maoist hub but the police at the Patrakarnagar police station, not far from the booth, had no inkling. The sleuths said the MCC and its Nepali counterparts were using the centre as a transit point. They used to share information and exchange weapons at the centre, one of them said. 																								The sleuths immediately shifted the eight persons and began a gruelling session of interrogation. Police are expecting to uncover the level of cooperation between the MCC and the Nepal Maoists. 																								Confirming the raids, Bihar additional director-general of police (operation) Neelmani said the mopping up operations by the police on the links of the arrested leaders were still on. We have been aware of the constant flow of Nepal Maoists here for shelter. The raid has reaffirmed the links, he said.

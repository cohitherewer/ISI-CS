																								New Delhi, Nov. 12 (PTI): Had Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf not gone for a change of clothes at Agra, the joint declaration between the two countries would have been signed, Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed said today.																								As I know the facts, President Musharraf went to his room only to change as both countries had agreed to the joint declaration...When he came back, the Indian mood had changed, he said.																								Mein jhoot nahi bol raha hun aur na hi President Musharraf ko jhoot bolne ki adat hai (Neither I am lying nor President Musharraf has the habit of lying), he added.																								Musharraf had gone to change so that he looked good in the photographs. But next time, I think no Pakistani ruler will dare to change his clothes when such an important issue is taking place.

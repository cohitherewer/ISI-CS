		 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 SC upholds terror law
 R. VENKATARAMAN New Delhi, Dec. 16: The  Supreme Court today upheld the validity of the anti-terror  law, six months after reserving judgment on a batch of petitions  challenging it.																								All controversial provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act have also been upheld, including its stringent bail conditions and punishment for making speeches in support of a banned outfit and not disclosing information on terrorist activity.																								The division bench of Justices S. Rajendra Babu and G.P. Mathur, however, left the decision on MDMK leader Vaiko to the special court in Chennai.																								Vaiko has been in jail for a year and a half for speaking in public in favour of the banned Tamil Tigers who are warring for a separate homeland in Sri Lanka.																								The court overruled the objections of journalists and lawyers to mandatory disclosure of information about a terrorist or terrorist activity to police. Under Section 14 of the law, any journalist who interviews a terrorist or a lawyer who defends one should disclose the information to the police.																								The judges found no merit in the argument that journalists and lawyers should not be bound by this provision. 																								They said the main purpose of Section 14 is only to allow the investigating officers to procure information that is necessary to proceed with the further investigation.																								But they added: In the process of obtaining information, if any right of (a) citizen is violated, nothing prevents him from resorting to other legal remedies.																								On Section 21  punishment for a speech in support of a banned outfit  the court said it was constitutionally valid as support either verbal or monetary, with a view to nurture terrorism and terrorist activities is causing new challenges.																								Therefore, Parliament finds that such support to terrorist organisations or terrorist activities needs to be made punishable, the court said.																								Viewing the legislation in its totality, it cannot be said that these provisions are obnoxious, it added.																								However, the judges clarified that a person who professes or invites support or arranges, manages or assists in arranging or managing a meeting or addresses a meeting was not an offender if he does not have an intention or design to further the activities of any terrorist organisation or the commission of terrorist acts.																								They said the offence needs a positive inference that a person has acted with intent of furthering or encouraging terrorist activity or facilitating its commission.																								The judges declined to express their views in Vaikos case because a criminal case had already been lodged and was pending before a special court. We are sure that the special court will decide the matter in the light of (todays) decision.																								They said stringent bail conditions were necessary as terrorism was spreading its tentacles and the more than normal period of detention of a person for questioning was only to facilitate the probe.																								But the stringent conditions would apply only for the first year of arrest and after its expiry the normal bail provisions under the CrPC would apply.

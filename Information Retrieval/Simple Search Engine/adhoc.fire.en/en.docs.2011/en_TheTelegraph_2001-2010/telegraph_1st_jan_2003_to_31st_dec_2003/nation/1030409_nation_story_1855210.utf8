		 Wednesday, April 09, 2003 				 CBI on Jogi trail for spy slur on govt
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jogi: Tables turned																								New Delhi, April 8: Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogis attempt to derive political mileage from his allegations against the Intelligence Bureau appears to have backfired.																								He had alleged the Centre was misusing the bureau by getting it to spy on Opposition politicians in an exercise code-named Operation Black Sea. He had even produced a document, allegedly issued by the bureaus Special Directorate, containing details of his assets.																								After registering a case late last week, the CBI wrote to Jogi, seeking some time  at his convenience  to question him.																								CBI sources said they want to ask Jogi where he got the document from as he was the first to come up with it. The contents, allegedly listing Jogis movable and immovable properties, may also come under the CBI scanner.																								Jogi had sent the document to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, seeking his intervention in the matter.																								The CBI has also written to the Intelligence Bureau, seeking details on the case. CBI officials, however, said in an inquiry at the government level, it has been found that there is no Special Directorate in the IB and the document in question was forged.																								On April 2, the investigative bureau had registered a case against unknown persons on complaints of forgery of documents in the name of the Special Directorate.																								Various sections of the Indian Penal Code  including 417 on punishment for cheating, 465 on punishment for forgery, 468 on forgery for the purpose of cheating, 469 on forgery for the purpose of harming reputation and 471 on using a forged document as genuine  have been brought into play.																								According to the CBI, the document alleges that Jogi and his wife Renu have acquired immovable properties and own bank accounts in Switzerland. Further, they also allegedly own National Saving Certificates and Kisan Vikas Patra worth over Rs 1.67 crore.																								Renu is also alleged to have signed a memorandum of understanding with a Malaysian company, in which she is said to have acquired 50 per cent share. The company allegedly runs a software business in Bangalore. 																								Jogi yesterday told reporters in Bilaspur that Vajpayees silence on the Intelligence Bureaus alleged surveillance of politicians was baffling. This, he said, gave credence to his allegation of misuse of the intelligence machinery.

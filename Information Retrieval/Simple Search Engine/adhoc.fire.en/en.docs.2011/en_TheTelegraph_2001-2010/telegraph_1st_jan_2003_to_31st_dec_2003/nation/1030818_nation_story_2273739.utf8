 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, Aug. 17: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati may have forced her states bureaucrats to dance to her tune but in neighbouring Uttaranchal, they still call the shots.																								Their refusal to toe the line of the political executive yesterday forced Uttaranchal chief minister Narain Dutt Tiwari to warn them that if they did not behave, he would resign.																								A veteran political administrator who has been the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and a Union minister several times, Tiwari was incensed at the forest departments failure to provide him the information he wanted. This is not a threat, but I am stating the truth. If the development works in the state are not speeded up, I will take retirement from politics, Tiwari said at the inauguration of a horticulture centre in Dehradun yesterday.																								Tiwari had asked the recently-appointed forest conservator, S.K. Chandola, for a list of villages involved in horticulture programmes run by the state government. Chandola told him that as head of the forest department, he had nothing to do with horticulture. 																								An enraged Tiwari reminded Chandola that he had been asked to get the list prepared well in advance. I do not want to be known as inauguration chief minister. It is a pity that there is no co-ordination between various departments, he said.

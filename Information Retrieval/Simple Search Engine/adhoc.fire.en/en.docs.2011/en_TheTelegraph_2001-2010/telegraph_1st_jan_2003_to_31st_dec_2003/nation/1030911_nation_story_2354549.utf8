		 Thursday, September 11, 2003 				 Mayavati mark wiped out
 YOGESH VAJPEYI				 	 Mayavati																								Lucknow, Sept. 10: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has cancelled all promotions, appointments and land allotments sanctioned by his predecessor Mayavati last month.																								While senior IAS officer T. George Joseph has started a high-level probe into land allotments to Mayavatis family members in Noida and Greater Noida, special secretary, urban development, Diwakar Tripathi has been asked to probe similar allotments in Lucknow, Ghaziabad and Saharanpur districts.																								According to the official spokesman, some bureaucrats who carried out Mayavatis orders will be hauled up. 																								While those who were simply obeying the orders of superior authorities have nothing to fear, those who indulged in manipulation and corruption and helped politicians derive undue benefits in violation of the law will have to pay the price, he said.																								The governments move has created a panic among the states IAS and IPS officers. 																								While justifying the decision to punish those guilty of corruption, a spokesman of the state IAS association expressed hope that Mulayam Singh will not resort to bureaucrat bashing as Mayavati had done when the Bahujan Samaj Party-BJP coalition was in power.																								During her 15-month rule, Mayavati had ordered over 300 vigilance inquiries against IAS, IPS and other government officials, the spokesman pointed out.																								She created a record of sorts by recommending as many as 188 vigilance inquiries during the last 120 days of her regime, said an IAS officer. 																								About a dozen IAS and IPS officers were among those against whom inquiries were ordered by the BSP leader.																								Prominent among IPS officers who were targeted were Y.K. Mishra, director-general of the homeguard, Amitabh Thakur and M.K. Mishra. 																								Among the IAS officers were secretary, central IAS Association, V.S. Pandey, R.K. Bhatnagar, V.K. Varshney and Mahesh Gupta.																								An inquiry was ordered against director-general Mishra for violating government orders and exploiting employees of his department. Thakur faced a probe for running an NGO in the name of his wife. The vigilance department was directed to probe then Meerut SP Mishras links with the mafia and terrorists. 																								Pandey earned Mayavatis wrath for taking up the cause of the state IAS association. An old file relating to the Uttar Pradesh Spinning Mills Federation was reopened after Mayavati gave the go-ahead to the vigilance probe against him on July 10. Bhatnagar refused to oblige her on Group C recruitment as DM, Mahamayanagar.																								Mayavati ordered probes even a day or two before she recommended dissolution of the Assembly on August 25. Special secretary, higher education, H.S. Pandey, who was earlier posted as staff officer to the chairman, revenue board, became her last victim on August 23. The charge against him was he had tampered with government documents.																								Pandey paid the price for taking up the case regarding a prime land in Rana Pratap Marg. The Mayavati government was forced to stay its order when renewal of lease in favour of a builder kicked up a row. This annoyed a senior IAS officer in her secretariat, who was pursuing the builders case. The result was Pandey landed in the vigilance net.																								But some of these inquiries were used for other purposes, too, sources said. During her tenure, she exonerated over two dozen IAS, IPS and other officials who were facing inquiry. The current chief secretary, A.P. Singh, who replaced D.S. Bagga after Mulayam Singh took over, is one of them.

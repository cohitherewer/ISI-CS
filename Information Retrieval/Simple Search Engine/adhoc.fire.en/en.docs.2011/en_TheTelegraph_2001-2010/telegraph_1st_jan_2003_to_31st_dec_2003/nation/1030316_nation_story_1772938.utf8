The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, March 16, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Congress lobs canal threat				 																																																	 chandigarh: Haryana Congress legislature party leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Saturday threatened to block all routes from Delhi to north India to pressure the Centre to construct Punjabs portion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal as directed by the Supreme Court last year, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	The Indian National Lok Dal government headed by Om Prakash Chautala is not interested in getting the canal constructed. Otherwise, how can one explain the governments failure to file a contempt petition against Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh for not complying with the apex courts order? Hooda asked.				 																																																	tating that early completion of the canal was a question of life and death for Haryana, Hooda said: If despite the Supreme Courts order for completion of the canal it is not constructed, Haryana will never be able to get its share of the (Ravi-Beas) waters. I believe all state parties must arrive at a consensus and resign en masse from the Assembly and Parliament to show solidarity with the people of the state.				 																SC cancels MLA election				 																																																	 new delhi: The Supreme Court has set aside the election of a Rashtriya Janata Dal candidate  the sitting MLA from Sitamarhi constituency in Bihar  and declared the BJP candidate from the constituency elected to the Assembly in the February 2000 elections.				 																																																	A division bench of Justices R.C. Lahoti and Brijesh Kumar, in its judgment delivered on March 13, said votes polled in favour of the BJP candidate had been wrongly rejected by the returning officer, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	RJD legislator Sahid Ali Khan had been declared elected in the 2000 elections with a slender margin of 35 votes against his nearest BJP rival Hari Shankar Prasad. 				 																																																	However, the apex court found that 90 votes cast in favour of Prasad, which were rejected by the returning officer, were valid. Now Prasad has been judicially declared elected by a margin of 55 votes.				 																																																	We find that the wrong stamp was made available to the voters by the polling officer. That being the position... ballot papers marked by the stamp supplied have been wrongly rejected by the returning officer and they are to be counted in favour of Prasad as per the direction of the Election Commission.				 																Court breather to Sunjay Dutt				 																																																	 mumbai (PTI): A special court has allowed Sunjay Dutt, accused in the 1993 bomb blasts case, to visit Hyderabad for the shooting of Rudraksha till April 1.

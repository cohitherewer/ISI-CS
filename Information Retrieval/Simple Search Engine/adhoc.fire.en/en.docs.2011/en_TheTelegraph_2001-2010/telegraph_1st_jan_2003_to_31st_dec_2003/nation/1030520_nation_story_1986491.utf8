Acting on a Mumbai police petition, the court attached the Sara Shopping Centre and Sahara Shopping Complex near Crawford market in south Mumbai.				 																																																	Police said the two shopping arcades were illegally constructed in connivance with civic body officials. They said the registered owners of the property  Abdul Sattar and Abdul Radhanpur  were working for Dawood. The duo were reportedly planning to acquire more plots to turn them into shopping complexes and business establishments.				 																																																	The Sara Shopping Centre took off in 2000 after certain Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials allegedly fudged municipality records to give the arcade the green light.				 																																																	The BMC has submitted the names of six civic officials alleged to have helped Dawood. The corporation said the officials helped the don construct the shopping centre on land belonging to the Central Public Works Department.				 																																																	The court appointed a senior inspector of the Azad Maidan police station as receiver and asked him to make a list of moveable and immoveable properties. He is to submit his report to the court on June 2.				 																																																	The action comes in the wake of complaints that three of Dawoods henchmen, Iqbal Hassan Ibrahim Shaikh, Abdul Rehman Abdul Gafoor Shaikh and Abdul Sattar Haji Hiva Radhanpur, had evicted some people whose huts obstructed the arcade entrance.				 																																																	Iqbal had been deported from Dubai last month. He was then arrested in a murder case and let off on bail. This is the second case in which he has been arrested.				 																																																	Stepping up the attack on Dawood, the BMC has also moved court, demanding that the complexes be demolished. But the police are not in favour of the move. They say valuable evidence will be lost if this is done.				 																																																	Meanwhile, crime branch police officers have said Dawood was planning to build another mall adjacent to the shopping complex.

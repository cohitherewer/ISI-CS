 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Jaipur, Nov. 12: Two parties, same problem.																								Locked in a bitter battle for supremacy, both the Congress and the BJP units in Rajasthan are facing largescale dissidence over ticket distribution for the December 1 Assembly elections.																								Senior leaders of both parties are now engaged in quelling the rebellion on the one hand and underplaying it for public consumption on the other.																								Many leaders on both sides have either crossed over to other parties or are planning to do so. A possibility of a large number of rebels entering the fray cannot be ruled out. 																								In fact, many Congress legislators who have been denied tickets have indicated that they would contest as rebels.																								To prevent such a situation, the Congress high command, which had earlier given indications of denying tickets to a large number of sitting legislators and ministers in the Ashok Gehlot government, preferred to retain 80 per cent of them.																								Some of the big names angry with the party are state unit vice-presidents Dula Ram and Dinesh Joshi. Ram, a former minister, has resigned from the party after being denied nomination. He has joined the Indian National Lok Dal. Joshi, son of former chief minister Harideo Joshi, has expressed annoyance and has indicated that he would contest as a rebel.

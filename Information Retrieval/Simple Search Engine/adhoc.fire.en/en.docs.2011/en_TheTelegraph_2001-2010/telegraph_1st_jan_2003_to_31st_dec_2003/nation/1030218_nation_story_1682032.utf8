		 Tuesday, February 18, 2003 				 George for outlay hike
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 17: Defence minister George Fernandes today said he would ask for a substantial hike in the allocations for the armed forces and to procure military equipment in the budget for 2003-2004.																								Last week, service chiefs had told the defence minister that a pruning of the defence budget at a time when demands on the military were increasing was not justified. 																								The finance ministry had intimated that a cut in the defence budget was inevitable because, in any case, the ministry was not being able to utilise funds allocated to it year after year. 																								However, the finance ministry had also made it clear that there will be funds available when required.																								It is not only our hope, but our wish that the armed forces budget increase continues to upward, Fernandes said today.																								Estimates in the defence ministry put the expenditure this year at around Rs 55,000 crore March 31, still Rs 10,000 crore less than the allocated sum of Rs 65,000 crore.																								The chief reason for the this is the inability of the Cabinet to take decisions on big-ticket purchases such as Advanced Jet Trainers for the Indian Air Force and Scorpene submarines for the navy. 																								Fernandes indicated that time has not yet run out to take a decision in the current fiscal on these projects.

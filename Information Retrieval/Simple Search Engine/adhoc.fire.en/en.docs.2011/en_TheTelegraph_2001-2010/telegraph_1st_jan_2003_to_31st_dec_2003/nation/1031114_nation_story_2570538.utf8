		 Friday, November 14, 2003 				 SC puts duty before dress for nurses
																								New Delhi, Nov. 13 (PTI): The Supreme Court today told nurses in the military not to bother about their uniform and carry on the good work like a Florence Nightingale.																								The bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and B.. Srikrishna thus dismissed several petitions filed by the nurses against wearing a white coat over their olive-green uniform while on duty. 																								The judges said the petitions were without merit, but took the opportunity to praise the services rendered by the Indian Military Nursing Service. 																								Recalling the dedication of Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War, the bench said it had no doubt the nurses would carry on their yeoman service by following her example.																								The nurses went to court after the military authorities asked them to wear a white coat over their uniform for easy identification at base hospitals. 																								The nurses dubbed the move discriminatory as the order did not apply to other medical staff.																								The decision was taken after relatives of patients  mainly jawans, junior commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers  hesitated in seeking the nurses help as they thought them to be seniors because of the olive-green uniform.

		 Tuesday, October 28, 2003 				 Ramazan ceasefire ruled out
																								Baramulla, Oct. 27 (PTI): The Jammu and Kashmir governor today rejected suggestions for a unilateral Ramazan ceasefire.																								Lt General (Retd) S.K. Sinha said it was not feasible as Pakistan was continuing cross-border infiltration into the state.																								Unilateral ceasefire during the Muslim fasting month of Ramazan is not feasible as we have experienced in the past. The militants will use the opportunity to strengthen their position, he told reporters after addressing jawans on Infantry Day.																								Sinha took the opportunity to welcome the Prime Ministers latest peace proposals to Pakistan. One-sided efforts to normalise ties between the two neighbours would bear no fruit, he said and hoped that Islamabad would respond positively.																								The governor asserted that any ceasefire must be bilateral. If there are no infiltrators from the neighbouring country, we will have no need to open fire.																								National Conference chief Omar Abdullah had on October 24 demanded a Ramazan ceasefire while urging the Centre to invite all separatist organisations for talks to resolve the Kashmir problem. He had also advocated a graded dialogue with Pakistan.																								Sinha said there was no let-up in infiltration. We are fighting infiltration. Everyday, media reports killing of 10-12 persons, including six to seven militants, while trying to sneak into our territory.... This has become a routine.

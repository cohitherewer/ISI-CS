The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, January 17, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Centre to postpone number-plate plan				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Centre may postpone the introduction of high-security number plates for transport vehicles as the majority of states have sought an extension of six to 12 months to implement this. Most of them are yet to frame any comprehensive guideline on the issue, including tender norms.				 																																																	We will consider the request for extending the introduction of high-security number plates as the majority of states would not be able to streamline registration systems before February 28, minister of state for transport and highways B.C. Khanduri said.				 																																																	As per the new directives, all new vehicles registered after February 28, 2003, should have the high-security number plates and all old vehicles should have such plates by 2005.				 																																																	The majority of states and Union Territories had sought the extension for down-the-line introduction of the new number plates, Khanduri said. Delhi and states like Maharashtra are yet to come out with final tenders for such plates.				 																																																	Unless all the states and Union Territories are ready for the same, the said date may need to be postponed, he said, adding that the transport ministry has taken note of the difficulty of each state in introducing such plates.				 																																																	The majority of the states also said they are waiting for the Supreme Courts judgment on February 20 on the issue of high-security registration plates. They would frame the comprehensive guidelines once the verdict is given, Khanduri said. 				 																Rights panel push for disabled				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): Concerned with the problems of people with disability, the National Human Rights Commission has asked the Central and state governments to amend rules and regulations to help such people enjoy the full range of human rights.				 																																																	In a letter to all chief ministers and concerned Central departments, commission chairman Justice J.S. Verma said disability being a rights issue, the governments needed to bring human rights of the disabled to the centrestage of the developmental agenda.				 																																																	The commissions endeavour in these areas has been to bring a paradigm shift in the approach motivated by charity towards the disabled to one based on rights, he said.				 																																																	Justice Verma said a recent review by the panel has revealed that the implementation of various legislations and programmes for the disabled has been inadequate.				 																																																	The commission has also asked authorities to constitute a taskforce to frame a national policy for creating barrier-free infrastructure for the disabled in accordance with the provisions of the Disabilities Act.				 																10 fishermen in Pak navy net				 																																																	Islamabad (PTI): Ten Indian fishermen from Gujarat have been arrested by Pakistani naval officials for allegedly attempting to fish in the countrys territorial waters off the southern Karachi coast, police said.

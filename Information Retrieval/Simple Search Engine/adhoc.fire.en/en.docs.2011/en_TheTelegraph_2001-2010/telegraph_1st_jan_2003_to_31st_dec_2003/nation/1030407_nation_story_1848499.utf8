		 Monday, April 07, 2003 				 Munda spends Rs 50 lakh on house
 															- CM seeks to exorcise Marandi imprints with renovation ANUPAM SHESHANK				 	 Labourers renovate the floor of Mundas bedroom. Picture by Prashant Mitra																								Ranchi, April 6: Chief minister Arjun Munda is spending a fortune to re-do the interiors of the already plush CM house. 																								Munda seems to be in a hurry to shift to his new address, but only after exorcising his predecessor Babulal Marandis imprints from the sprawling bungalow.																								The lavish renovation is expected to cost over Rs 50 lakh. 																								This is in addition to over Rs 2.5 crore already spent on the house after the divisional commissioners bungalow was converted into the chief ministers official residence in early 2001.																								The replacements include new wall-to-wall carpets, curtains, upholstery, flooring and items of personal use, which are barely two-years-old.																								Marandi had replaced the fireproof Burma teak floor tiles with marble and rubber mats along with wall-to-wall carpets.																								Munda has ordered ceramic tiles worth Rs 40 each to do up the 10,000-square feet house built during the British regime. 																								The chief minister has personally selected the new carpets and the curtains from a upmarket home-decoration shop, supposed to be the most expensive in Ranchi. 																								Besides the wall-to-wall carpets, there will be at least 20 centre carpets of Mundas choice, sources said. 																								A new fountain is coming up on the backyard garden of the chief ministers house, whose staircase has been done up with teakwood on the ground floor and extended to face the portico. Three teak steps and a 6-feet landing platform have been added to the staircase.																								The cost of the wood alone is over Rs 60,000. The house is also being given fresh coats of Asian Paints waterproof emulsions, which cost Rs 140 a litre. 																								The landscapings of Marandis choice have also been dismantled. The building construction department is leaving no stones unturned to pump in the requisite funds. 																								The department has also jumped norms for its new master and released the work order to contractor Bhrigunath Singh without preparing the cost estimate or floating tenders. 																								Under the supervision of senior officials, contractors and labourers are working round-the-clock to enable the chief minister to shift to his new address by Friday.

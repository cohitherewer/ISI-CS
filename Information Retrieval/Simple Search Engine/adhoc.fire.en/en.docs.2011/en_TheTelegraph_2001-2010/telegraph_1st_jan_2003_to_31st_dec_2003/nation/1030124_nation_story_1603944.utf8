		 Friday, January 24, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																Apex court upholds consumer Act				 																																																	 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of the Consumer Protection Act, saying it was enacted to protect the common consumer and enhance the quality of service, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																	A three-judge bench of Chief Justice V.N. Khare and Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and S.B. Sinha dismissed all challenges to the validity of the Act and the legislative competence of Parliament and state legislatures.				 																																																	In view of the constitutional scheme relating to legislative competence of Parliament and state legislature, there cannot be any doubt or dispute that Parliament (and state legislative Assemblies) has the requisite legislative competence to enact the said Act, the judges said.				 																																																	The constitutional validity of the legislation was questioned because of the lack of a provision for the transfer of a case from one consumer court to another. Legislative competence was questioned because Parliament and state legislatures had created a parallel hierarchy of courts when the judicial system already existed.				 																																																	The apex court rejected these arguments and held that absence of a provision in the Act to transfer a case from one consumer court to another would not render it unconstitutional.				 																																																	Moreover, consumer courts did not amount to creating a parallel judicial system, the court said.				 																Pizza Hut in non-veg soup				 																																																	 Jaipur (PTI): Noida police are investigating whether Pizza Hut had served non-vegetarian food to a customer, who claims to have been a vegetarian all his life.				 																																																	Acting on a complaint from a Noida company executive, Shailesh Mishra, a sub-inspector has been asked to find out whether he had been served non-vegetarian pizza by the multinational food chain outlet located at sector 18 as against his order for a vegetarian pizza, police sources said.				 																																																	We will visit the outlet and check out the facts, station house officer of sector 20 police station R.D. Tyagi said.				 																																																	According to Mishra, he, along with his brother Nilesh Mishra and friend Amit Vats, had ordered for a vegetarian and non-vegetarian pizzas, respectively. It was only after I took two slices, I realised that the packet labelled vegetarian actually contained a non-vegetarian pizza, he said.				 																																																	ishra said: I have never had non-vegetarian food in my life. By serving us non-vegetarian food in place of vegetarian food, Pizza Hut has hurt our religious sentiments.				 																																																	Contacted twice, outlet shift manager Pradyumn was evasive and promised to call back, which he never did. 				 																																																	Mishra said he would seek damages from Pizza Hut.

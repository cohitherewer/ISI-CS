 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, Dec. 7: The CAT scam found an echo in Jammu and Kashmir today when the state vigilance organisation busted what appeared to be a medical question-paper racket.																								Coming two weeks after the leak of the combined admission test papers and the subsequent countrywide crackdown, the latest episode unfolded while candidates were taking the entrance exam.																								The raid by vigilance sleuths turned up, among other documents, a complete set of question papers for todays exam, government sources said. The investigations so far point to a leakage of examination papers, vigilance commissioner . Raju said.																								The sleuths found that the seized question papers matched the real ones. During inspection, they also found one question paper missing from the lot distributed at an exam centre, the sources said.																								Shahnawaz Khan, the son of a senior police officer, was arrested for allegedly being a conduit for the racket. Khan, sources alleged, was luring candidates to buy the question papers at exorbitant rates.																								The sleuths seized a Rs 3-lakh bank draft made out in Khans favour in what is believed to be the payment by a candidate.																								The crackdown followed a tip-off when sleuths, led by senior police superintendent Ghulam Hassan Bhat, raided a house in the posh Rajbagh locality around midnight, sources said.																								The raiding teams also seized cash worth nearly Rs 2 million from the house said to belong to college teacher Abdul Hamid Dar, who is the alleged kingpin of the racket, sources said. Dar, however, managed to escape.																								The racket involves the sale of question papers for admission to various post-graduate courses in the states medical colleges. The related exams are conducted by an autonomous body, entrusted with the responsibility of holding the various competitive tests for professional courses. Raids are continuing and more arrests are likely soon, said an officer who refused to be named.																								The fate of the examination conducted today was not immediately known in view of the likelihood of a paper leak.

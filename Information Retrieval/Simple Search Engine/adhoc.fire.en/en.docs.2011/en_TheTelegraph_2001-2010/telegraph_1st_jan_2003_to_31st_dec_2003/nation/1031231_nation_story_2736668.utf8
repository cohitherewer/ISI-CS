		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 CBI question time for Judeo scandal duo
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Dec. 30: The CBI has served notices on Bhupender Singh Patel alias Rahul and Arvind Vishwa Mohan, accused in the cash-on-camera scandal, to appear for questioning. 																								Apart from the two, the CBI has booked former minister of state for environment Dilip Singh Judeo and his additional private secretary, Natwar Rateria, in an FIR registered on December 19. 																								The former minister was charged with accepting a bribe from Patel, who had introduced himself as Rahul, a representative of an Australian firm. 																								Sources said Patel and Mohan were supposed to come to the CBI headquarters in the CGO Complex of south Delhi yesterday for questioning, but did not as they are apprehensive of facing the sleuths.																								The CBI officials have convinced their families and they are likely to appear before the officials tomorrow or the day after, the sources said. 																								The sleuths are keen to find out the real identity of Manish, another player in the scandal, from the two, apart from verifying the facts available on the conspiracy aspect of the video. 																								Manish was present along with Patel in room 822 of Hotel Taj Man Singh on November 5, when Judeo and Rateria were captured on camera allegedly accepting Rs 9 lakh. Rahul had offered them the cash in lieu of getting lease rights for mining in Chhattisgarh and Orissa. 																								The sources said the investigators have a fair idea of who Manish is, but they would like to get his identity confirmed by Patel and Mohan. 																								In the FIR, the CBI alleged that Mohan had arranged to secretly record Judeo accepting the bribe. 																								Mohan was frequently calling up a particular mobile phone number registered in the name of Ajit Jogi, who was then the Chhattisgarh chief minister. The phone was, however, being used by his son Amit. 																								The CBI officials claim they have collected evidence linking the sting operation to Amit. The sources said after Mohan and Patel, they would summon the junior Jogi. 																								In another development, the CBI has received a copy of the report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Hyderabad on the controversial videotape, accessed first by The Sunday Express to run the cash-on-camera story.																								We have sent the report through a special messenger deputed by (the) CBI, which is investigating into the case, four days ago, laboratory director K.P.C. Gandhi said today.																								We have submitted a conclusive report after going through all technical aspects and its revelation may hamper the investigation, he said while refusing to go into details of the findings. Gandhi, however, stressed that the report would provide extra clues to the bureau. 																								The CBI officials maintained that the report said the tape was genuine. 																								There is continuity in the tape and lip synchronisation (of all characters in the tape) is also perfect, CBI sources said. 																								According to the report, no picture has been super-imposed, but some editing was done to hide certain faces. The video aired by news channels had Rahuls face fudged to hide his real identity. 																								All four accused have been charged under two sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act  section 7 (taking gratification as a public servant) and section 13(2) read with section 13(1)(d) (criminal misconduct by a public servant)  and section 120b (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.

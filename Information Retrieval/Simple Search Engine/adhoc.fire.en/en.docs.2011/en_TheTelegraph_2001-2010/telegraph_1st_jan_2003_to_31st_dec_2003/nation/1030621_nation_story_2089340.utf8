				 	 Surendra Shetty																								Surat, June 20 (PTI): Shilpa Shettys father Surendra Shetty, an accused in a case of extortion, today surrendered before police and was immediately taken into custody.																								Gujarat High Court had indicated two days ago that it would reject his bail plea.																								Surendra surrendered at Umra police station where a case had been registered against him, his wife Sunanda and two gangsters on charges of extorting money from the owner of Prafful Sarees, Pankaj Agarwal. 																								They had demanded that Agarwal pay Rs 80 lakh that was due to Shilpa for appearing in an advertisement.																								On June 18, Gujarat High Court asked the actress father to surrender after withdrawing his anticipatory bail petition. The court had indicated that it would reject the plea but gave him an opportunity to withdraw his petition. 																								The police claim to possess tapes on which telephone conversations between Shilpas parents and Agarwal have been recorded, which allegedly indicate that the latter was threatened. 																								Surendra and Sunanda had obtained transit bail from a Mumbai court, which asked them to move court in Surat for regular bail. Surendras bail was rejected by both the Surat court and Gujarat High Court. Sunandas bail will be heard by the Surat court tomorrow.

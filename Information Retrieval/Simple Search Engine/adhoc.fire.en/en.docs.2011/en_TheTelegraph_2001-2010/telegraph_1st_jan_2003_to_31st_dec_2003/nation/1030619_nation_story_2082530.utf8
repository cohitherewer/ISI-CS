 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 18: Union home ministry officials say the police-militant nexus in Jammu and Kashmir is nothing new. What has surprised them is that a senior official has publicly spoken about police involvement in last years murder of a former state law minister and a fidayeen attack earlier this month.																								Director-general of police Gopal Sharma said early this week four Kupwara district policemen were involved in the assassination of Mushtaq Ahmed Lone at a rally last year as well as the recent attack on CRPF personnel in the same district.																								Shrugging off this revelation, a senior ministry official said: Everyone in the state as well as the Centre is aware of this (the nexus). It happened in Punjab and Assam earlier and could be true of any state which has had a long period of civil strife. In such situations, local police can get involved with militants.																								A section in North Block believes that Sharma had another motive in making a public announcement. An official said: The Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government has established its credibility with the people and knows that the ordinary citizen is not interested in militancy. Thus, there will be no reaction to the governments taking action against militants. But the wider idea may be to warn those in the police force whose loyalties are divided to stop helping terrorists, or else action will be taken against them.

 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, July 6: A member of the consultative committee of the Union textile ministry has been arrested along with his wife for using a fake identity card for railway travel. The card, belonging to a Lok Sabha MP, was lost four years ago.																								Kailash Modi and his wife Aruna were arrested yesterday while travelling in a second class air-conditioned coach of the Ranakpur Express.																								Ticket checking officials headed by a railway magistrate questioned the couple, who tried to pass off as BJP Jaipur MP Girdhari Lal Bhargava and his wife.																								But they later confessed to the fraud and were arrested.																								Lok Sabha member Bhargavas identity card went missing from his Delhi residence four years ago. The loss was reported to the North Avenue police station there.																								Bhargava was issued another card but Modi, an acquaintance of the MP, benefited tremendously from the BJP members loss. 																								Modi removed Bhargavas photograph from the card and replaced it with his. 																								He used the card to obtain coupons from the railway meant for use by MPs.																								This guaranteed Modi VIP treatment from railway staff and innumerable free train rides.																								Railway authorities in Jodhpur came to know about the deception recently and laid a trap to arrest Modi when he reserved his train tickets five months ago. But Modi was tipped off about this and cancelled his journey instead.																								Modi has been identified as a resident of Jodhpurs Sardarpura Road which falls under chief minister Ashok Gehlots Assembly constituency of Sardarpura.																								Bhargava said in Jaipur that Modi used to visit his residence. 																								It is not clear who recommended Modis name for the consultative committee.

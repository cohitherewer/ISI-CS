		 Tuesday, October 07, 2003 				 Jindal races ahead in Louisiana
																								Washington, Oct. 6 (PTI): Republican Bobby Jindal inched closer to becoming governor of Louisiana after finishing first in the open primary, becoming the first Indian-American to reach this far.																								The 32-year-old Rhodes scholar, whose Indian descent was cited as a major disadvantage, polled 33 per cent votes yesterday, way ahead of his nearest rival, Democrat lieutenant governor Kathleen B. Blanco, who won only 18 per cent votes.																								After counting in 4,141 out of 4,143 precincts, Jindal polled 441,951 votes while Blanco had garnered 249,152, according to results posted on the Louisiana secretary of states website.																								Tonight, voters in Louisiana decided they did not want to go down the same road we have gone down in the past. Voters said they didnt want a career politician but a problem solver, Jindal reportedly said through a spokesman.																								Jindal and Blanco will go in for the final lap of the gubernatorial race on Novem- ber 15 to replace outgoing two-term Republican governor Mike Foster.

		 Friday, August 22, 2003 				 Apang in talks with BJP to gift govt
 OUR BUREAU																								Guwahati/Itanagar, Aug. 21: Barring a last-minute hitch, the BJP is poised to get its first taste of power independently in the Northeast with the United Democratic Front (UDF) government in Arunachal Pradesh deciding to go saffron.																								Chief minister Gegong Apang and 37 of the 38 Congress (D) legislators who are part of the ruling coalition have committed to join the BJP.																								The UDF was formed on July 27 by a breakaway group of Congress legislators, who deserted ousted chief minister Mukut Mithi to side with Apang.																								The Congress (D) and the Arunachal Congress, of which Apang is the lone representative in the 60-member Assembly, had announced immediately after forming the new government that they would be joining the National Democratic Alliance.																								Sources said the two Independent MLAs and one expelled Congress member who are part of Apangs government had assured to support the BJP from outside. The lone voice of dissent was that of fisheries minister J.P. Takam, who has refused to bite the BJP bait and resolved to remain in the UDF, even if alone.																								If the merger comes about, the BJP will find itself in power despite not having a single MLA at present. Power minister Lijum Ronya was the lone BJP legislator in the state in the Eighties before he switched to the Congress.																								BJP leaders were tightlipped about the developments, but a party source said a formal announcement was likely in a day or two.																								The latest development took shape after hectic backroom parleys between the BJP leader in charge of its Northeast affairs, V. Satish, and UDF leaders. Satish, camping in the state since Tuesday, held a series of marathon meetings with Apang and his deputy Kameng Dolo to finalise the merger modalities.																								Apang had visited New Delhi on Tuesday and met senior BJP leaders. He returned to Itanagar today after offering prayers at a temple at Sualkuchi yesterday along with Dolo, probably to seek divine blessings before assuming their new avatars as the regions first saffron chief minister and his deputy.																								The seeds of the development were, however, sown much earlier, if the Congress is to be believed. Mithi has been accusing the BJP of engineering the split in the Congress to oust him from power. The Congress has accused the NSCN (I-M), too, of helping Apang.																								Another source said Apang, once the second longest-serving chief minister after Jyoti Basu of Bengal, was keeping his cards close to his chest and could go in for hard bargaining with the BJP.

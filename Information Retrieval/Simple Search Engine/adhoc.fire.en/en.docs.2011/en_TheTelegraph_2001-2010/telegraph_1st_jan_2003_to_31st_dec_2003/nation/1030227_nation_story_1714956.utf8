		 Thursday, February 27, 2003 				 Arundhati joins Kerala battle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Sultan Bathery, (North Kerala), Feb. 26: Writer and social activist Arundhati Roy today described the relentless police action against the tribals of Wayanad district as a blot on Keralas history of commitment to human development.																								The Booker Prize-winning author spent almost a full day with the tribals after arriving in this hill district in the morning, mainly to make a personal investigation into the standoff between the Adivasis and the state government.																								The landless Adivasis, who had illegally occupied the Muthanga wildlife sanctuary for the past one-and-a-half months, had clashed with law enforcement agencies on February 19 following efforts to evict them. The clashes resulted in several casualties. Police have since kept up their raids on tribal colonies in and around the district.

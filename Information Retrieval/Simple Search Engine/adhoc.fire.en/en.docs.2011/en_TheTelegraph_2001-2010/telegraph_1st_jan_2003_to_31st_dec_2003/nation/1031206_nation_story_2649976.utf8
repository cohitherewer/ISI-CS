		 Saturday, December 06, 2003 				 Contempt notice in Karishma case
																								Calcutta, Dec. 5: Calcutta High Court today issued a contempt notice against US based novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford, the author of Woman of Substance, for failing to pay damages to Sahara Media Entertainment Limited, says our legal reporter.																								Bradford, in an undertaking, had promised before the court that she would pay the damage and cost to the company if she lost the case.																								Justice Pinaki Ghosh in his order said that help of the US consulate may be taken in sending the notice to the author. The court fixed the matter for hearing after 10 weeks.  The directive followed a petition  by Sahara Media Entertainment Limited alleging that Bradford  had deliberately failed to carry out the court order.

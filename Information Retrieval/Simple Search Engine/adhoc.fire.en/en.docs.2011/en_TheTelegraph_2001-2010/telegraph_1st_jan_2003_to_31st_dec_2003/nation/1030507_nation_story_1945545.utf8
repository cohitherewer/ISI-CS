 Joshi orders review on Premchand
  MONOBINA GUPTA A portrait of Premchand Joshi: Corrective step? New Delhi, May 6: Human resources development minister Murli Manohar Joshi has directed the Central Board of Secondary Education to hold a meeting and review its decision to scrap a Munshi Premchand novel from the Class XII Hindi syllabus.The CBSE had replaced the novel with another authored by Mridula Sinha, a BJP functionary and president of the Central Social Welfare Board.

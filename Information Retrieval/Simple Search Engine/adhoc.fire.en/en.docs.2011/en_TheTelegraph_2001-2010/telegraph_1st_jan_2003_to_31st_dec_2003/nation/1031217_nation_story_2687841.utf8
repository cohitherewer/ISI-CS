 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 16: The National Democratic Alliance today emerged unscathed from a crucial terror law test in the Lok Sabha.																								There were no surprises when Speaker Manohar Joshi announced the House division result on the terror law amendment bill: 257 members in favour and 10 against.																								Despite serious reservations, the DMK, MDMK and PMK  the three NDA partners from Tamil Nadu  went along with the government. All 10 votes against the amendment came from the rival ADMK, which insisted on a House division soon after members of Opposition parties staged a noisy walkout.																								The amendment seeks to validate the Centres October 27 ordinance providing for the establishment of central and state level review committees.																								Moving the bill, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani said the amendment was needed to clear doubts on the status of the review committee recommendations  whether they were advisory in nature or binding on the executive. The recommendations would be binding on the executive and the central review committee recommendations would prevail over those of the state committees, he said.																								With the issue of MDMK leader Vaikos detention under the terror law looming large, the position of the BJPs Tamil Nadu allies was curiously awaited. 																								More so because the DMK, which is fighting the ADMK over Vaikos arrest, has been asking the Prime Minister to scrap the terror law as it was used against political opponents.																								Union environment minister T.R. Baalu, the DMK representative in the Vajpayee ministry, steered clear of controversy.

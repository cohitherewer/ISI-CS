		 Tuesday, October 14, 2003 				 Aiyar attacked
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Oct. 13: Congress MP Mani Shankar Aiyar was attacked and his clothes torn, allegedly by ADMK volunteers, near Nagapattinam after he reportedly criticised the implementation of welfare programmes by the ADMK regime.																								Aiyar, who was invited to the government function at Nagapattinam as the local area MP, had faulted the implementation of the schemes by the state, according to reports reaching Chennai tonight.																								Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa strongly rebutted Aiyars remarks and advised him to show restraint.																								The ADMK chief, however, said she was not afraid of airing her views against anyone. As far as I am concerned, I never indulge in doublespeak. Whatever I had said about his leader (Congress chief Sonia Gandhi), I will say it even now, if she is present here, Jayalalithaa said, referring to her criticism of Sonias foreign origin.																								The disagreement spilled on to the streets with men, allegedly of the ADMK, reportedly chasing the MP when he left the venue. Aiyars car was stoned near Karaikal, an enclave of Pondicherry. He was also allegedly manhandled. Aiyars office in his Mayiladuthurai constituency was also attacked, police sources said.																								The MP later reached Karaikal where the Congress is in power, the reports said.																								Congress sources said state party leader E.V.K.S. Elangovan has apprised Sonia of the attack.

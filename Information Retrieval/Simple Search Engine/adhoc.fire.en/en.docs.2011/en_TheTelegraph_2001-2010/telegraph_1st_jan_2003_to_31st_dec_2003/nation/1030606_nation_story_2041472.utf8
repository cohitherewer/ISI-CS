		 Friday, June 06, 2003  Nation at a Glance				 																HC frames car-loan recovery guidelines				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has warned finance companies against predatory practices, including the use of muscle power, in taking back vehicles financed by them in case of default in repayment of loan and framed guidelines on the recovery process.				 																																																										Following complaints against these companies towing away the defaulters vehicles by force, a two-judge bench of Justices Usha Mehra and Pradeep Nandrajog framed guidelines for repossessing the vehicles.				 																																																										The court observed that contracts for repayment of loans mostly involved issuance of post-dated cheques and said where a cheque is dishonoured for the first time, the borrower should be notified immediately through registered post. Seven days should be given for servicing the notice and repayment.				 																																																										If the cheque is dishonoured for a second time, another notice should be given to the borrower regarding the lenders right to recall the loan according to the terms of contract, it said.				 																																																										If the notice is not complied with in seven days, the company may recall the loan but even this would not entitle it to track the vehicle while plying on the road, the bench observed, confirming RBI guidelines against undue harassment of borrowers.				 																																																										If a borrower refuses to sign the papers when the vehicle is repossessed, the company should immediately bring it to the notice of local police intimating them about the time and place when it was repossessed, the court added. 				 																Israel bid wins Skipper house				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): Israel has informed the Supreme Court, through its embassy in India, that it has deposited the full amount it had bid for the Skipper property in New Delhi the court had allowed it to buy.

The lone bid of Rs 25.01 crore for the house, on Aurangzeb Road, was received from Israel through its embassy and the court had allowed the country to buy the property for the amount as no other bids were received despite sufficient time being given for this.				 																																																										Israel had earlier deposited a quarter of its bid with the court and the remaining amount of about Rs 18 crore was deposited a few days ago. Counsel for Israel embassy told a vacation bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and Shivaraj V. Patil that the money had been deposited with the Supreme Court registry.

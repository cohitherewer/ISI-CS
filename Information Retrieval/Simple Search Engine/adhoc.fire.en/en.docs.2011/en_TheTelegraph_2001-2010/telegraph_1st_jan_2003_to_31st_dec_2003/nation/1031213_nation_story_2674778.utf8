 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 12: Another Murli Manohar Joshi junior is sulking in seclusion. Minister of state for human resource development Sanjay Paswan, who last hit the headlines when he went around Patna with a snake around his neck, has not been attending office for the past three months. 																								Earlier, Uma Bharti, when she was the junior minister in the human resource development ministry, kept away from office for months following a spat with Joshi. She took her files home and worked out of her bungalow. 																								Sumitra Mahajan, one of Paswans predecessors, had also suffered the same fate  of being taken lightly, not being given any work and, importantly, Joshi hogging the limelight. 																								Paswan is the minister of state for literacy and elementary education and holds charge of the administrative work for the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan  Joshis pet project  and adult literacy programme. But all this is on the official records. In reality, he has not been given a single file in the last seven months even after he asked for them and gave his request in writing. His main work had boiled down to signing on the dotted lines. Paswan routinely put his signature on 20 unstarred parliamentary questions and 50 papers listed against his name to be tabled in the House. 																								Rubbing salt into Paswans wound, Joshi is least perturbed about his juniors continuing absence in Shastri Bhavan. 																								In a sense, he has been a social outcast in the ministry. The minister of state was not invited to most official lunches or dinners. Sources claimed Paswan is a victim of caste bias and the upper caste bureaucracys stranglehold on the ministry. They said Joshi and his bureaucrats are working in tandem to reduce the Bihar MP to a cipher.																								Paswan did not help his cause by embarrassing his seniors in Delhi by walking around Patna propagating tantra. Joshi and the ministry washed their hands of the incident without bothering to defend the minister. 																								Paswans notions of adult literacy also ran counter to the ministrys ideas. He believes adult literacy centres should be wound up along with state resource centres. He also advocated that the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan should lay special focus on Bihar, Bengal, Orissa and in eastern Uttar Pradesh. 																								Not just Paswan, but several other ministers of state believe they can easily be dispensed with. They say the post of junior minister continues only as a way of accommodating a region or a caste. Chhattisgarh ministry																								Chief minister Raman Singh tried to strike a balance while expanding the Chhattisgarh cabinet today. He inducted 17 ministers from the three regions of the state, giving maximum representation to the tribal community. Seven ministers were inducted from Bilaspur, the home region of former chief minister Ajit Jogi.

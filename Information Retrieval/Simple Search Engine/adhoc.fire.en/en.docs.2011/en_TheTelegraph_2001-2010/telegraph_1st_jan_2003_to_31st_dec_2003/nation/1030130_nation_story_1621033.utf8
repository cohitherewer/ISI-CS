 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, Jan. 29: The Congress is playing the caste card in Rajasthan to take on its high-on-Hindutva rival, but many of Ashok Gehlots colleagues are hardly impressed.																								The chief minister was seen trying hard to convince newsmen after a mini Cabinet expansion last week how much thought the Congress high command had put in to piece together a package for the state. Bahut soch samajh ke high command ne nirnay liya hai he was heard saying.																								At the same gathering some distance away, one of Gehlots senior Cabinet colleagues was chatting with friends and party workers. 																								Scarcely hiding his disdain for the package, he could be heard saying: If things are allowed to continue as they are, the party will face its Waterloo in the polls.																								The Congress  rattled by the BJP sweep in Gujarat and its vow to convert Rajasthan into the next Hindutva laboratory  had recently unleashed a caste package in the state. 																								Two deputy chief ministers and a tainted minister  Ram Singh Vishnoi had to quit from the ministry earlier after his son was found involved in drug trafficking  were appointed in Gehlots government based purely on caste considerations.																								But none  in spite of the efforts of the high command and its closest cronies  seems to have been taken in. A former chief minister and a Congress veteran told reporters that unless the quality of Gehlots governance changed, the package would not even serve cosmetic purposes.																								The benefits of government programmes and schemes have not percolated down to the targeted cross-section of the population, he said.																								Another said the deputy chief minister experiment had been tried by the former Bhairon Singh Shekhawat regime as well. Hari Shankar Bhabhra had then been inducted as Shekhawats deputy but the BJP had gone on to perform miserably in the elections.																								Yet another said deputy chief ministers Kamla and Banwari Lal Bairva were ill qualified to be potential representatives of their castes. 																								Kamla, a Jat, had recently dropped her surname  Beniwal  and could hardly have much appeal among her community members, he said.																								And Lal had lost the Lok Sabha bypoll from Tonk reserved constituency though he was a minister in Gehlots team, he added.																								The chief minister is also trying to win back the loyalties of state employees by clearing dearness allowance instalments that had been kept on hold because of a funds crunch. Twice in the past week, he has hinted that they will be cleared.																								Bhim Raj Bhati, one of the Congress candidates who lost the recent bypoll, had said that one reason for his defeat from Bali was the anger of employees who had been denied DA and bonus.

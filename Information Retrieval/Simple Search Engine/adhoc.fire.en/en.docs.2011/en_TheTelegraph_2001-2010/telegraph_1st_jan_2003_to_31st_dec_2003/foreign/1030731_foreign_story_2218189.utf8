 Thursday, July 31, 2003 				 Democrats again flee Texas
																								Albuquerque (New Mexico), July 30 (Reuters): Flanked by police on the lookout for bounty hunters, Texas Democrats who fled their home state vowed today to stay in neighbouring New Mexico as long as it takes to stop a Republican grab for more seats in the US Congress.																								In a showdown with national implications, 11 Democrats from the Texas Senate accused Republicans of trying to ram through a congressional redistricting plan that could get them seven more seats and add to their narrow majority in the US House of Representatives.																								It is wrong and we are prepared to fight as long as we can stand on our feet, said state senator John Whitmire of Houston.																								The departure prevented the Senate from getting a quorum needed to conduct business. The Republican-controlled legislature cannot pass the redistricting bill as long as they do not return. 																								The senators left the state capital Austin on Monday for New Mexico in a replay of a May walkout by Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives, who fled to Oklahoma. The House belatedly passed it yesterday. Redistricting is being pushed by US House of Representatives Majority leader Tom DeLay of Houston with help from the White House.

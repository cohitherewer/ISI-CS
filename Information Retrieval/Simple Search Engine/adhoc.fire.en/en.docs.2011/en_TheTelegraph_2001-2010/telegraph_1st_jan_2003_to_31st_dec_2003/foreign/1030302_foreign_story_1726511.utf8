 DEBORAH ZABARENKO				 	 Kalpana Chawla on the flight deck of the space shuttle Columbia during re-entry over the Pacific Ocean. (AFP)																								Washington, March 1 (Reuters): Astronaut-made video of shuttle Columbias last normal moments shows relaxed crew-members donning pressure gloves, feeling the build-up of gravity and marvelling at the glow of super-hot gas seen through the doomed crafts window.																								Its really neat, its a bright orange-yellow all over the nose, one astronaut is heard saying on the 13-minute videotape, released yesterday by Nasa.																								The astronaut was referring to plasma, or super-heated gas, that normally envelops space shuttles as they re-enter Earths atmosphere. The video broke off about 11 minutes before mission controllers in Houston lost contact with the craft on February 1.																								I want to get my gloves on before the Gs build, said another, referring to the return to gravity after a flight of near-weightlessness. Were getting some Gs  let go of the card and it falls, said a third.																								The astronauts were in their orange space suits and in various stages of putting on their gloves as the shuttle streaked toward Cape Canaveral at an altitude of about 152,400 metres.																								They wore their helmets with the visors up, so that their faces could be seen, and were paging through checklist booklets and performing routine tasks of re-entry. 																								Its like a lot of the footage you see for every other flight and thats the part thats most emotional about it, said NASA chief Sean OKeefe.																								There is not even a hint of concern, anxiety, nothing ... Its a very emotional piece because of what you already know, and that they dont, OKeefe told reporters at Nasa headquarters before public release of the video.																								The tape, which was shown earlier to the astronauts families, was recovered near Palestine, Texas, on February 6. As OKeefe noted, such cabin videos are normally made on shuttle flights.																								The astronauts appreciation of the plasma outside the orbiter took on a certain weight, because independent investigators have said the extreme heat observed on Columbias left side during its fatal re-entry might have been caused by hot plasma penetrating the crafts wheel well.																								The video was shot by a small onboard camera mounted to the right of pilot Willie McCool, who at one point removed the camera and handed it to Laura Clark. McCool, Clark, shuttle commander Rick Husband and Kalpana Chawla are the only ones visible on the tape, which was made in the ships flight deck. The three other astronauts  Mike Anderson, Dave Brown and Ilan Ramon  were in Columbias mid-deck during re-entry, Nasa said.																								OKeefe bridled at the notion there was nothing Nasa could have done if officials had been able to identify a possible problem during Columbias flight, before re-entry.

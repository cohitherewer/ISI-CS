The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, November 01, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Flushed mobile																																	 New York, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Cellphone users have been known to complain about poor service, but one New York mans mobile literary went down the toilet.																																	The man was on a suburban train from Grand Central Station on Wednesday night when he went to the bathroom to make a phone call, dropped the phone into the toilet bowl and then his hand and arm became stuck trying to retrieve it.																																	Metro-North Railroad staff could not help the man, so they stopped the train and called police officers and firefighters to extricate him, a process that took 90 minutes using jaws of life rescue equipment. The toilets are made of aluminum so I imagine he was down on hands and knees with his shirt rolled up and hand and arm down inside, trying to flush out his cell phone, said Jim Cameron of the Connecticut Metro-North commuter council.																																	He said that because of the design of the train toilet, the mobile probably ended up in a chemical holding tank. The track was closed and thousands of commuters were delayed during the evening rush hour. 																													 																Abba silence																																	 Stockholm (Reuters): Agnetha Faltskog, the blonde singer in 1970s Swedish pop phenomenon Abba, will break an 18-year silence with a new record out in March next year.

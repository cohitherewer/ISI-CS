 Friday, September 19, 2003 				 US gunman killed in shootout
																								Nashville, Sept. 18 (Reuters): A gunman who took a college class hostage yesterday with a plan to shoot someone and then himself was shot dead by police after he wounded two of the hostages, authorities said.																								Neither of the hostages suffered life-threatening injuries in the violent conclusion to the nine-hour standoff at Dyersburg Community College in western Tennessee. Upon hearing gunshots, police broke into the classroom and killed Harold Kilpatrick, Jr., 26.																								Police earlier dismissed Kilpatricks assertion that he was a member of al Qaida, the group led by Osama bin Laden that is blamed for the September 11 attacks.																								Kilpatrick, who had no connection to the school, had been due to appear in court yesterday in Memphis, 120 km southwest of Dyersburg, for an assault on his girlfriend. Police said he had a history of violence and had written a note saying he planned to shoot someone and then himself.

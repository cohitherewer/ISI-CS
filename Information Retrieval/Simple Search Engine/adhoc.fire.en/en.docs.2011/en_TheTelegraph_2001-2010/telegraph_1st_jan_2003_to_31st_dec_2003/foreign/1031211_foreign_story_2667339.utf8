				 	 Sean Connery Los Angeles, Dec. 10 (Reuters):  Sean Connery has plans to star in The Picaresque Revenge,  a movie about convicts in the spirit of The Sting.																								The New Line project centres on a former FBI agent who spends 15 years in prison for a crime he didnt commit. Desiring to target those he believes put him behind bars and to re-obtain his $360,000 pension, the man pulls a series of brilliant crimes and ultimately gets his revenge.																								New Line, which acquired the project last year as a pitch titled Leavenworth from scribe Jason Keller, is seeking a director to develop the concept.																								Connery most recently appeared in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which bombed domestically, but did well overseas.

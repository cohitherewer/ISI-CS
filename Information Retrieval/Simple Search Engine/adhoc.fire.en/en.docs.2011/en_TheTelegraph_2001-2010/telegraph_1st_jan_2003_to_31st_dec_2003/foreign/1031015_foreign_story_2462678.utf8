				 	 Nicole Kidman																								London, Oct. 14: Actress Nicole Kidman has accepted undisclosed libel damages in the high court over a newspaper article alleging she had an adulterous affair with actor Jude Law.																								Her solicitor Keith Schilling told a judge in London that a story published in the Sun in March meant and was understood to mean that the claimant (Kidman) had had an adulterous affair with Jude Law, who was at the time married with young children. The article implied that the claimant led Jude Law to cheat on his wife Sadie Frost and by her behaviour caused the breakdown of their marriage.																								The defendants, News Group Newspapers, publishers of the Sun, its editor Rebekah Wade and journalist Victoria Newton now accepted that the allegations complained of were untrue, he said.																								Schilling told Justice Eady: The publication of the article caused damage to the claimants personal and professional reputation and she has suffered considerable embarrassment and distress.																								Kidman, 37, who starred with Law in Cold Mountain, said in a statement: I am glad that this has finally been resolved. She is to donate the balance of the damages received from todays case and an earlier legal action to Fara, a charity which helps Romanias abandoned children. It is understood that a five-figure sum will go to charity.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Italian food giant in Enron-type bankruptcy
																								Milan, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Parmalat revealed a four-billion-euro ($4.9 billion) hole in its accounts yesterday and its credit rating was cut to rock-bottom default grade, stoking fears that Italys biggest food firm could go bankrupt.																								The missing four billion euros dwarf a one-billion-euro accounting scandal at Dutch retailer Ahold this year which was compared to Enrons plunge into bankruptcy two years ago.																								In a statement that wiped two thirds off of its already battered share price and hit its bonds, Parmalat said a document showing 3.95 billion euros in investments and cash held by a Cayman Islands unit had been declared false by Bank of America.																								Enrico Bondi, a turnaround expert named as Parmalat chairman and CEO this week, held an extraordinary board meeting last evening after which the group said he would ask justice authorities to consider legal, possibly criminal, action.																								Parmalats new management team also said it would seek the plan of action most suited to the current situation while in the meantime assuring continuity of Parmalats ongoing business. A source familiar with the matter said a decision on how to proceed would be taken in the next few days. 																								Parmalat executives were believed to have mulled bankruptcy options, two financial sources told Reuters earlier.																								It is difficult to see how Parmalat can keep going after this clear indication of extensive financial irregularity, said ABN AMRO credit analyst Claire McGuckin in a note to clients.																								To say something smells fishy would be the understatement of the year, Commerzbank analysts said.																								Parmalats balance sheet shows 4.2 billion euros in liquidity. But last week it repaid a 150 million-euro bond four days late and only with help from banks and the government. It then missed a first payment on a required $400 million buyout of minority investors in a Brazilian unit, which it has tried to reschedule. The second payment is due on December 22. Credit rating agency Standard amp; Poors yesterday cut Parmalats rating two notches to its lowest D grade.

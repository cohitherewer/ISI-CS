The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, February 05, 2003 				 Maharishis raam wins
																								Amsterdam, Feb. 4 (Reuters): The Dutch Central Bank said today an organisation founded by Beatles guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi had not violated the law by issuing and using its own currency in the Netherlands.																								The Global Country of World Peace organisation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an Indian mystic living in the small southern Dutch village of Vlodrop, issued brightly coloured notes of one, five and 10 raam last October. The bank said it had received no indications that any laws were violated.																								It is within the boundaries of the law... as long as the Maharishi doesnt suggest that this is legal tender and it doesnt resemble the euro, a central bank spokesman said.

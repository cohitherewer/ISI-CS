 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Survival prompts Tripoli shift
 ROBIN WRIGHT AND GLENN KESSLER		 A Libyan soldier during a military parade  in Tripoli. (AFP)Washington, Dec. 20: Libyas stunning decision yesterday to surrender its weapons of mass destruction followed two decades of international isolation and some of the worlds most punishing economic sanctions. 																								In the end, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was under so much pressure that he was forced to seek an end to the economic and political isolation threatening his government  and his own survival, according to US and British officials and outside experts.																								The turning point in Gaddafis undoing may have been the US intelligence investigation that eventually tracked a tiny piece of the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, back to two Libyan intelligence agents, US and British officials say. The evidence mobilised the world and produced an international effort that may now peacefully disarm Libya.																								What forced Gaddafi to act was a combination of things  UN sanctions after the Lockerbie bombing, his international isolation after the Soviet Unions collapse... and internal economic problems that led to domestic unrest by Islamists and forces within the military, said Ray Takeyh, a Libya expert at the National Defence University.																								Whether by coincidence or fear that Libya might be targeted, Gaddafis envoys approached Britain on the eve of the Iraq war to discuss a deal, US officials said. The invasion of Iraq sent a strong message to governments around the world that if the US feels threatened by weapons of mass destruction, we are prepared to act against regimes not prepared to change their behaviour, said a senior state department official who requested anonymity.																								In a strange reversal of status, Libya is now being touted by the US and Britain as the new example of how to succeed in ridding a nation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles. 																								It provides the model, they said, for how to move forward with Iran, North Korea, Syria and potentially others.																								Leaders who abandon the pursuit of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them will find an open path to better relations with the US and other free nations, President Bush said in his surprise announcement. When leaders make the wise and responsible choice, when they renounce terror and weapons of mass destruction, as Gaddafi has now done, they serve the interest of their own people, and they add to the security of all nations.																								Reflecting the dramatic shift, Gaddafi, in a statement carried by the official Jana news agency, said Libyas wise decision showed his country plays an international role in building a world free of weapons of mass destruction and all sorts of terrorism. Another senior official in Libya went as far as to demand that all countries in West Asia and Africa eliminate equipment, products and programmes involved in producing weapons of mass destruction.																								Although the US has exerted the most pressure and imposed the most punitive actions against Libya, Britain took the lead in the initial negotiations. The two nations divided the roles of good cop and bad cop, US and British officials said. All the negotiations were in London and involved a Libyan diplomat in Europe and Libyan intelligence agents. 																								Despite Libyas long history of prevarication and procrastination, Tripoli has provided so much access to facilities and so much specific data on its programmes that Bush and Blair agreed they had confidence that Gaddafi was sincere.																								The Libyans were quite open. They provided access to facilities. They provided substantial documentation about their programs. And we were able to take samples and photographs and other evidence, said a senior administration official in a White House briefing after Bushs announcement.																								A British official added: Libyas admission of its activities is of clear political significance and encourages confidence. For all the Bush administrations focus on deadly arms, however, the US may have missed an opportunity to act earlier because of its preoccupation with Afghanistan and then Iraq, said US officials familiar with earlier overtures.																								Within months after September 11th, we had the Libyans, the Syrians and the Iranians all coming to us saying: What can we do [to better relations]? We didnt really engage any of them, because we decided to do Iraq. We really squandered two years of capital that will make it harder to apply this model to the hard cases like Iran and Syria, said Flynt Leverett, a former Bush administration National Security Council staff member now at the Brookings Institution.																								The Clinton administration tried a similar strategy  offering Libyas needy government a diplomatic carrot if it agreed to accept responsibility for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Gaddafi did turn over the two intelligence agents, after lengthy negotiations, for a trial under Scottish law at The Hague, where one Libyan was convicted and one acquitted in 2001.

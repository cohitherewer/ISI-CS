 Thursday, August 28, 2003 				 Baghdad plastered with Saddam
																								Baghdad, Aug. 27 (Reuters): Iraqs US occupiers had banned Saddam Husseins image from public display but today they began plastering pictures of him all over central Baghdad.																								Instead of the giant portraits on almost every street corner during his rule, this time Saddam features on wanted posters advertising the $25 million reward offered by Washington for information leading to his capture or proving he is dead.																								They show Saddam in black and white on a deep red background above pictures of his sons Uday and Qusay with a cross over their faces. The brothers, Saddams top henchmen, were killed in a shootout with US troops last month.																								Its unlikely anyone in Iraq has forgotten what Saddam looks like. 																								But officials said the campaign was intended to spread the word about the reward and emphasise that the hunt for the fugitive ex-dictator will go on until he is captured.																								I hope theyll catch him sooner or later, said Haider Ali, a 23-year-old dentist, as US soldiers and Iraqi policemen put up posters and handed out fliers in a bustling neighbourhood. 																								Some people do not know anything about the reward.

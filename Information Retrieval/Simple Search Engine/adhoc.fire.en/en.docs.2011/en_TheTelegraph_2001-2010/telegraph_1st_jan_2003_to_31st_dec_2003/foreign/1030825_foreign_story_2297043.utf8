 Monday, August 25, 2003 				 BBC to get rid of Gilligan
 CHARLOTTE EDWARDES				 	 Andrew Gilligan																								London, Aug. 24: Andrew Gilligan is likely to lose his job at the BBC as his position has become untenable after the revelation that he e-mailed a member of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, senior executives at the corporation said yesterday.																								BBC managers were extremely surprised when the contents of the e-mail were disclosed to the Hutton inquiry last week and furious that Gilligan had not submitted the document to the BBC legal team. One manager described the incident as an obvious sacking offence.																								In the e-mail of July 14, Gilligan provided six specific questions to an aide of David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat MP who served on the committee, for use against David Kelly over the sexed up dossier claims.																								BBC officials indicated that the fall-out from the e-mail might be so great that it would not just affect Gilligan but his immediate boss, the Today editor Kevin Marsh, and the head of news, Richard Sambrook.																								Last night, BBC officials close to the Today programme said they expected Gilligan either to be sacked or resign by mutual consent. One said: Even before the inquiry, common sense said he was never going to turn up here at 10 to six in the morning and continue on the programme as before. Back then it was thought he may be relocated, perhaps to the news-gathering department. But the e-mail came as a total shock to management. It would be unthinkable for him to return to the corporation at any level now.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

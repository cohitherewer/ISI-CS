The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, April 14, 2003 				 Marines turn cops, PROs
				 	 Iraqi police officers give themselves up to US troops in Baghdad on Saturday and offer their services to restore and maintain order in the city. (AFP)																								Baghdad, April 13 (Reuters): For just a few moments, the US Marine was Michael Jackson  king of pop. 																								Taking backwards moon walk steps, Lance-Corporal Manuel Perez drew chants of Michael, Michael from dozens of children laughing on the Baghdad pavement. They want me to do Michael Jackson, they like the way I dance, said Perez, 21, a member of Alpha Company. Ive got fans.																								Another Marine cut him short. If you guys cant keep these guys off the sidewalk, youre going to have to tone the showbiz down, barked Corporal Adam Malik, 23, stalking the line of Marines to search for any troublemakers behind the giggling children.																								US forces patrolling Baghdad face a dilemma  how to win over a population whose lives they have turned upside down while ensuring they are not killed by Saddam Hussein loyalists. A Marine was shot dead in yesterday when a gunman dressed in civilian clothes crept up on him while he was guarding a hospital. 																								Unless Marines want to remain encased in tanks and armoured personnel carriers drawing fear and suspicion from residents they must inevitably run risks. 																								A few metres down the dusty street in the New Baghdad suburb, Captain Doug Schaffer, 36, was mobbed by a group of men bombarding him with questions, many in English. The number one concern was security. Residents are scared that looters will smash their way into their homes and gardens.																								We need guns, said Danny Salan, cradling a two-year-old son on his arm. If any of these savages come to me and hold a gun to my face, what can I do?																								Schaffer searched for answers, knowing that his Marines cannot be in all places at all times. 																								You could volunteer to be a police officer, he said to a middle-aged man. Yes, no problem, replied the man, a former member of the Iraqi army, but a sidelong glance said differently.																								Queries came thick and fast  when is the electricity coming back? What will Iraq use for currency? Is Saddam dead? Who will defuse the bomb on my balcony? 																								What are you doing over here? asked a male voice from the press of bodies, his voice edged with a hint of hostility.																								Trying to help you, replied Schaffer, remaining calm despite the hubbub of chatter and jostle of limbs around him. What about water, electricity. Is there any fresh news on that? asked an old man in a blue shirt. Were working on that, we dont know when, Schaffer said.																								For Marines, who see themselves as a combat force, work as a policeman and public relations officer rolled into one is tiring.

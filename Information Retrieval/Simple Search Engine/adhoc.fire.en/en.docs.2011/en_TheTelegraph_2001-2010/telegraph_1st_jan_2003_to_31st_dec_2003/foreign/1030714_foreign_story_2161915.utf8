				 	 Liz Hurley and Arun Nayar 																								London, July 13 (PTI): British actress Liz Hurley and her Indian millionaire companion Arun Nayar will marry in February after his wife agreed to a quickie divorce, a leading London tabloid reported today. 																								The couple will host two spectacular wedding celebrations  one a star-studded bash in the UK, and the other in Mumbai, News of the World, claimed. 																								The 36-year-old Liz and 37-year-old Arun had thought they would have to wait for years to marry because his Italian-born wife Valentina initially refused to grant a divorce. Under Italian law, couples must be separated for three years before proceedings can begin. 																								But Valentina has now agreed to divorce him on mutual and amicable terms, the report said. Quoting a family friend, the report said: Money is changing hands. Valentina has been compensated. 																								Actress and model Liz, who is planning to buy a stake in a 10-seater jet for her travel, has begun discussing wedding dresses and bridesmaids outfits and started searching for a honeymoon destination. 																								According to the report, she has asked aides to check the climate in the Maldives in February. When told the weather would be better a few months later, Lizs assistant said: I dont know if she can wait that long. 																								Liz and Arun have been pressing ahead with final improvements to their 2.7 million country mansion in Barnsley, Gloucestershire.

 Wednesday, October 29, 2003 				 Key Qaida suspect not in Pak custody 
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Oct 28: Neither of the two al Qaida suspects arrested in Pakistan last week are wanted by the US, a news report said today.																								Pakistan interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat was quoted by the Daily Times as saying that alleged al Qaida financier Ahmed Said al-Kadr was not among the two Yemeni nationals arrested in Faisalabad.																								They were arrested, along with a Pakistani collaborator, during a routine check in the city. Their car was stopped at a checkpost for violating a ban on darkened windows. A search yielded a pistol, according to the Urdu-language daily Jang.																								Al-Kadr was wanted by the US for running a Canada-based Muslim charity in Afghanistan. He was arrested in Pakistan in 1995 for allegedly providing money for the bombing of the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad, but was freed on the intervention of the Canadian government, according to the Daily Times.																								In a surprise move, the US commission probing the September 11 attacks visited Islamabad today and held talks with officials and non-government personalities.

																								Karbala, Iraq, Dec. 27 (Reuters): Guerrillas killed six coalition soldiers and at least seven Iraqis in southern Iraq today in a coordinated assault on nations that answered US calls for troops to stabilise the country it invaded.																								The attacks in Karbala, a town holy to Shiites, also wounded 37 soldiers including five Americans, and at least 80 Iraqis, US military officials and local hospitals said.																								The head of the multi-national force in the region, General Andrzej Tyszkiewicz, said attackers used four suicide car bombs, mortars and machineguns against two foreign military bases and a town council building housing local police.																								Thailands foreign ministry said two of the dead soldiers were Thais posted to Karbala. Bulgarias defence ministry said four of its troops had been killed by one of several car bombs that ripped through the town.																								This was a planned, coordinated and massed attack, the Polish PAP news agency quoted Tyszkiewicz as saying of the Karbala raids.																								In all cases, the suicide drivers were shot dead before they could strike their targets.																								The attacks, part of a wave of guerrilla raids in Baghdad and deadly bombings to the north, dealt yet another blow to hopes the December 13 capture of former President Saddam Hussein would soon rein in violence in Iraq that Washington blames on Saddam loyalist and Muslim militants.																								A spokesman for the Polish-led force said 25 troops had been wounded, five seriously, in the attacks on the bases, where Poles were also stationed. US military spokesman Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt put the number of wounded troops at 37.																								Iraqis said a fuel truck tried to smash its way into a Polish base before bursting into flame, killing several Iraqis.																								We were having lunch...when an explosion shook the place. The kids playing outside were hurt, some were killed, said Ali Abdul Zahra, whose 15-year-old nephew and his nephews friend were killed in the blast.																								The fuel truck didnt manage to penetrate the base, it exploded at the entrance.																								I collected the body of my uncle. I could not tell his head from his feet, said Hassan Shaker, one of many Iraqis who gathered at the main hospital to collect the injured and dead.																								People in the city pointed the finger at the followers of the ousted Iraqi leader, who US military officials believe have played a main role in attacks on occupying troops, Iraqis working with them and international agencies in Iraq.																								Those who carried out this operation are followers of Saddam...We are 100 per cent sure, said 35-year-old Sattar Abdel Ghali in downtown Karbala.																								Witnesses said military helicopters evacuated the military casualties to a nearby base before many were taken to field hospitals.

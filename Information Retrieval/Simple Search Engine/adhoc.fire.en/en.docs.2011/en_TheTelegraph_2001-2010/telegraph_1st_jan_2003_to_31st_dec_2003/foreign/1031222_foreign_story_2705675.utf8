 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Perfect gift ideas float in outer space
 New York, Dec. 21 (Reuters):  For those still searching for the perfect holiday gift,  hows this for an out-of-this world idea: Space burials.																								Celestis Inc, a Houston-based firm that in 1997 arranged the launch of 1960s drug culture icon Timothy Learys remains, is planning an April send-off in Russia for as many as 150 ash-filled capsules as part of the cargo on a Kosmos 1 satellite.																								The containers, filled with customers choices of one or seven grams of remains, will share space with data transmission equipment and will orbit the earth for as long as 156 years before re-entering the atmosphere as a shooting star. Costs are from $995 to $5,300, depending on capsule size.																								Cant make the April launch? Reservations are being taken for later flights.																								If that doesnt send your sweeties heart racing, Celestis can arrange for a deep space radio message to be sent to a star youve previously named, for only $24.95. 																								The cosmic call is very popular, said Celestis president and co-founder Chan Tysor. We do 50 per cent of our annual sales in December.																								For $12,500, Celestis offers moon burials, in which capsules are carried on lunar mission spacecraft. In 1998, the NASA Lunar Prospector transported a portion of the remains of scientist and comet discoverer Eugene Shoemaker in its strut, which disintegrated upon landing.																								The packages are becoming more popular with those who are searching for a one-of-a-kind gift, for space enthusiasts or for those eager for an alternative to conventional earth-bound interments. 																								Think Dad would rather have a tie or be immortalised as a space pioneer? The Celestis website asks gift givers at http://www.celestis.com.																								Celestis plans to send its capsules on two or three satellites in 2004, up from one each in 1998 through 2001. The rockets, which have included Pegasus and Taurus, usually take off from Vandenberg air force base in Santa Barbara, California, though they have also been sent from the Canary Islands and Russia.																								Instantly, I knew this was it, said Susan Young, a mother of four whose husband Peter Smith died in a crash in his own plane eight years ago. This puts him where he wanted to be  its the only choice that makes sense for him.																								The family, who paid $995 for a symbolic one-gram capsule, plans to travel to Kazakhstan to see the April launch of the Dnepr rocket carrying Kosmos satellites from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, known for launching Sputnik 1, the first man-made satellite.																								Clients can have their capsules inscribed with the deceaseds name and a personal message. Some have included With our love, go in peace and One more big adventure.																								Fay Chandler of Pasadena, California, is planning ahead for herself and her husband, Claude, who died of Alzheimers disease complications 18 months ago. Claude worked at California Institute of Technologys jet propulsion laboratory, developing instruments for manned moon landings. We have to wait until I die and then well both go to the moon, she said. I was comforted by this thought during the last terrible months of his illness.																								The couple had hoped space technology would have allowed them to fly to the moon during their lifetime, but the capsule will have to do. Chandler said she will send a small portion of her husbands remains with a satellite launch in 2004, but the moon trip is the ultimate plan.																								Theres still room on the Baikonur launch for those seeking last-minute gifts. Pet lovers need not apply, however. We do get the pet request, but we havent done it yet, said Tysor.

 Friday, July 04, 2003 				 Blow to economy class cases
																								London, July 3 (Reuters): A British court delivered a severe setback today to 24 victims of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the so-called economy class syndrome, by barring them from suing some of the worlds largest airlines.																								We dismiss the appeal, said Lord Justice Phillips when pronouncing his judgment. 																								The claimants had appealed against a High Court decision last December that struck down an attempt to sue more than 25 airlines for DVT, the sometimes fatal blood clots which they blame on long flights and cramped seats. How many times can they turn the knife? asked Ruth Christoffersen during the judges lengthy explanation. Christoffersen, whose daughter, Emma, 28, died of DVT after a flight from Australia, has been leading the effort to hold the airlines liable for the condition. Her solicitor Desmond Collins said they would appeal to the House of Lords.

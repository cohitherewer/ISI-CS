 Thursday, February 27, 2003 				 Streep peace pin for Oscars
				 	 Meryl Streep																								Hollywood, Feb. 26: Actress Meryl Streep has already committed to wearing one, but whether other Oscar nominees join the crusade remains to be seen. 																								When the 75th annual Academy Awards bows on March 23, Streep will be wearing a specially designed peace pin inspired by Pablo Picassos Dove of Peace. The pin is the brainchild of Los Angeles-based designer-developer Xorin Balbes and journalist Cliff Rothman, who have organised a philanthropic group called Global Vision for Peace in hopes of sending a message to the Oscars global television audience that many Americans want peace.																								The peace pin is the work of New York jewellery designer Henry Dunay. Rothman stressed that it is not meant to protest either President Bush or the threat of war in Iraq.

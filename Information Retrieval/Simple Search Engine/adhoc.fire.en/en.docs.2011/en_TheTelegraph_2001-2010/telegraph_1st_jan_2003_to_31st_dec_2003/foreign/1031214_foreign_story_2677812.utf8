 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 EU fails to bridge gap on voting rights
				 	 Silvio Berlusconi at a press conference in Brussels. (AFP)																								Brussels, Dec. 13 (Reuters): A landmark summit meant to agree to a first constitution for a European Union expanding beyond the former Iron Curtain collapsed today when leaders failed to bridge wide differences over members voting rights.																								Spain and Poland blocked plans to give big countries, led by Germany and France, more voting power in a system that would take greater account of population size. The impasse plunged the wealthy 15-nation bloc into crisis, five months before it is due to admit 10 new members  mainly formerly communist states  in the biggest expansion in its history.																								Sadly the disagreement was total when we moved to the voting system, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi told a news conference after cutting short two days of tough wrangling when he saw no compromise was acceptable.																								French President Jacques Chirac called for smaller pioneer groups of countries to forge ahead with closer integration in defence, economic policy and justice, but denied this would lead to segregation.																								This will provide an engine, an example that will allow Europe to go faster, further, better, Chirac said. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, his closest partner, took a similar line: If we dont manage in the forseeable future to reach a consensus, then there will emerge a Europe of two speeds.																								The breakdown capped a year in which Europeans were bitterly split over war in Iraq, EU budget rules were bent, Sweden voted against joining the euro and Britain delayed indefinitely a referendum on the same issue.																								But Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony Blair sought to play down the impasse. To look at this in apocalyptic terms is rather misguided, Blair said. I think, ultimately, it will be resolved. The leaders avoided open recrimination in the aftermath of the breakdown, but that truce seemed unlikely to last. Berlusconi declined to blame Spain and Poland, pointing instead at the tough positions of Germany, France and Belgium.																								Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who will step down next March, and Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller, who attended the talks in a wheelchair after fracturing his spine in a helicopter crash last week, were unrepentant at having defended their national interests.																								Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who takes over the rotating EU presidency next month, said he would hold consultations and propose a way forward at the next regular summit in March.																								Refusing to be downcast, Berlusconi said virtually all the constitutional treaty had been agreed and negotiations would not have to resume from square one. The existing Nice treaty will continue to apply with its complex weighted voting system, but many governments fear growing gridlock once the bloc expands into Eastern Europe.

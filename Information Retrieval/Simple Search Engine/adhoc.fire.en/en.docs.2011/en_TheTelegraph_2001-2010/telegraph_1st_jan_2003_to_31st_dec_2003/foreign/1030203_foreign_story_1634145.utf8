 DAN WILLIAMS				 	 Ilan Ramons wife Rona and their five-year-old daughter Nora. (AP/PTI)																								Jerusalem, Feb. 2 (Reuters): Roaring up as rear guard for his F-16 formation and exposed to anti-aircraft fire as Iraqs nuclear reactor went up in flames below  that is how a select few in Israels top brass will remember astronaut Ilan Ramon.																								Long before the air force colonel flew into space on the ill-fated Columbia shuttle that broke up over Texas yesterday, Ramon was the youngest pilot to take part in the June 7, 1981, Israeli air strike on the Osirak nuclear reactors core. The man who would become Israels first astronaut was 26 at the time.																								The attack drew international condemnation but some strategic analysts have since said it set back by years an alleged Iraqi nuclear weapons programme.																								Ilan was only a captain, but we knew he was the right choice for the job, Major-General Amos Yadlin, a veteran of the mission, said today. He was cool-headed, modest, sort of a humble hero  not like most macho top-gun flyers.																								The eight F-16 fighter jets struck towards evening, dropping two one-tonne bombs on the reactor and speeding off into the blinding sunset. Ramon was in charge of planning fuel consumption for the four-hour round trip over hostile territory.																								There was no option for refuelling in mid-flight, Yadlin said. Logistically, he achieved what was thought impossible.																								According to Yadlin, Ramon volunteered to bring up the vulnerable rear in the formation. It was simple for Ilan. He said, Im not married, I dont have kids, why not? In a photograph taken after the raid, his comrades are grinning widely at the camera, and one is flashing the V-for-Victory sign. Ramon is standing in the rear in a military at-ease pose, with only a hint of a smile on his face.																								Iraqis rejoice																								Iraqis expressed regret today at the US space shuttle disaster, but thanked God Almighty that the dead included the Israeli astronaut, AFP adds. I thank God Almighty for avenging my country, said primary school teacher Ata Ahmad, looking up and raising his two forefingers in the air. I still remember the day when he bombed our country in a hateful crime against Iraq and the Arabs, said Ahmad, a pensioner sitting at the 120-year-old Al-zahawi Cafe in central Baghdad.

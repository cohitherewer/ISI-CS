No one was hurt in the crash, but police are hunting the owner of the underpants for failing to stop at the scene.																													 																Green Santa  Copenhagen (Reuters): Its official:  Santa is from Greenland, according to an edict from the  worlds top Father Christmases at their annual summit in  Denmark. Sweating it out in the summer heat in white beards  and red hats and robes, 130 Father and Mother Christmases  and Santas helpers from 12 countries including Japan, Canada,  Britain and Spain put an end to debate about which Nordic  nation was their real home. Its a fact: he comes from  Greenland, said Kurt Flemming, chairman of the 40th annual  Father Christmas World Congress. Greenlands delegate quashed  rival claims to the title with the argument: We have lots  and lots of reindeer in Greenland. Didnt you know that?

After their  debate, the delegates paraded through Copenhagen to the  strains of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. They cooled  their feet on a beach and enjoyed Danish pastries and beer.

 RANDY LEWIS 				 	 Natalie Maines																								Los Angeles, Sept. 28: The Dixie Chicks are in hot water again. 																								Group member Martie Maguire is quoted in the September 20 issue of Germanys Der Spiegel magazine saying the group no longer considers itself part of the country music community following the often hostile response from country radio and fans to Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines comment in March criticising President Bush over his Iraq stance. 																								Maguire said the trio feels more affinity with the rock  roll family now in the wake of supportive statements from Bruce Springsteen and other rockers. Fans are responding strongly again, pro and con, prompting Maines to post a largely whimsical response on the Chicks website: Country radio called and wants to know if its true (were) leaving country music?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, February 22, 2003 				 Suu Kyi sentenced to 7-day jail for domestic spat
 AUNG HLA TUN																								Yangon, Feb. 21 (Reuters): A Myanmar court sentenced pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi today to one week in jail or a 500 kyat fine over a domestic dispute but the sentence was later suspended.																								The Opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) said the dispute between the Suu Kyi and her cousin was being used by the ruling military as a political weapon.																								Suu Kyis lawyer, Nyan Win, said the Opposition leader and Nobel peace prize winner refused to accept the sentence, which a higher district court later suspended pending a review.																								Leaving the Bahan township court in the area of Yangon where she lives, Suu Kyi, with a trademark bouquet of white flowers in her hair, was critical of Myanmars legal system.																								Now we know what the law means in Myanmar, she told reporters gathered outside the court, along with about 200 supporters and bystanders.																								The official exchange rate in Myanmar is six kyat to the US dollar, making the fine around $83. However, it takes around 1,000 kyat to buy a dollar on the widely used black market.																								Announcing the sentencing at a news conference earlier, NLD chairman Aung Shwe said that the ruling and conduct of the trial showed political interference.

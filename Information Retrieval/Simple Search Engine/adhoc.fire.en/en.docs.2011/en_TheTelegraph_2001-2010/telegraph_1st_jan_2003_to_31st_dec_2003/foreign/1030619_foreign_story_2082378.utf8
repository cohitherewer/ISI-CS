The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, June 19, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Woman on top																																	Berlin, June 18 (Reuters): The modern western woman is now almost as likely to cheat on her partner as a man, according to a new survey carried out for a German womens magazine.																																	 an online survey of 1,427 men and women aged between 25 and 35 by the Hamburg-based GEWIS institute for social research for Woman magazine, 53 per cent of women said they had been unfaithful to their partner, compared with 59 per cent of men.																																	 recent years, numbers of unfaithful men and women have evened out a lot, GEWIS head Werner Habermehl said yesterday. The survey revealed that non-sexual desires, such as the need for reassurance and understanding, were a primary motive among women for infidelity. 																													 																Proxy vow San Antonio (Texas), (Reuters): Two  Texas prisoners who have never met were married by proxy  on Tuesday in a San Antonio courtroom and can now look forward  to their honeymoon  in 2036 at the earliest. State district  judge Johnny Gabriel married Diane Zamora, 25, and Steven  Mora, 27, using her mother and Moras friend as stand-ins,  Bexar county clerk Gerry Rickhoff said. The husband and  wife have not met, but began writing letters to each other  after Mora saw Zamora on television, his family said. They  are in prisons 208 km apart. Zamora is a former US naval  academy midshipman who, along with then-boyfriend David  Graham, an air force academy cadet, was sentenced to life  in prison in a 1996 trial for the murder of a 16-year-old  girl who was her romantic rival. She must serve at least  40 years in prison and will not be eligible for parole until  2036.																													 																Mary vision																																	 Boston (Reuters): A Massachusetts hospital has asked the Catholic Church for help after being swamped by thousands of pilgrims seeking a glimpse of what they claim is a shimmering image of the Virgin Mary, officials said on Tuesday. Some 25,000 people flocked to Milton Hospital over the weekend to gaze up at a window in a medical office building where believers say the mother of Jesus Christ has appeared, hospital spokeswoman Susan Schepici said. The Boston-area hospital, which is bracing for another flood of visitors this weekend, has asked pilgrims to limit their viewing hours to between 5.30 pm and 8.30 pm for the sake of patients and neighbours, Schepici said. She confirmed that hospital officials had asked the Roman Catholic Archdiocese Boston for guidance on how to deal with the apparition and the ensuing crowds. The church has not yet responded to the request, she said.

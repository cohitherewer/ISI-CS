 Thursday, August 07, 2003 				 Benazir party rejects Swiss ruling
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Islamabad, Aug. 6: A day after Swiss judge Daneal Devoud handed a six month suspended prison sentence and a fine of $11 million on Benazir Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari on graft charges, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) rejected the ruling as politically motivated. 																								It is a classic example of a witch-hunt being carried out against a popular party and its leader, PPP president Makhdoom Amin Fehim said.																								It is an illegal, fraudulent and maliciously motivated attempt to browbeat our party, he said. Fehim added that the party will fight this ruling and petition the Swiss attorney general to review the judgment.																								Devoud found Bhutto, Zardari and their Swiss lawyer guilty of money laundering and receving bribes from two Swiss firms in return for contracts.																								But Bhutto, currently living in self-exile in Dubai and London, rejected the decision.																								 Benazir Bhutto has not yet decided whether to appeal the matter as the conformation letter from the Swiss law officers says that the disputed account does not belong to her nor does she live in Switzerland, Bhuttos lawyer Farooq H. Naek said while reacting to the Swiss court decision.

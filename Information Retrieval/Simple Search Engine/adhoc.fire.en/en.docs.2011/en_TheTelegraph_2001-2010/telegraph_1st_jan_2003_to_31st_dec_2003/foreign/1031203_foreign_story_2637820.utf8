																								Oslo, Dec. 2 (Reuters): A Norwegian who defeated Hollywood on piracy charges pleaded not guilty today in a landmark appeal hearing that the movie industry is anxious to win to protect its lucrative DVD business.																								Prosecutors, on behalf of major US film studios, will try to prove that 20-year-old Jon Johansen broke Norwegian law when he developed and distributed a computer programme that enables consumers to make personal copies of their DVDs. The industry hopes to send a message to hackers that it will fight on any turf those who crack into their copy-protection systems in a global crackdown on piracy.																								The plaintiffs, the Motion Picture Association of America  representing Hollywood studios like Walt Disney Co, Universal Studios and Warner Bros  estimate that piracy costs the US motion picture industry $3 billion annually in lost sales.																								The case in the Oslo Appeals Court is set to end on December 12 with a verdict expected in early 2004. Johansen was dubbed DVD-Jon by the Internet community after he devised a computer programme  DeCSS  in the late 1990s that enabled consumers to circumvent copy-protection technology embedded in ordinary DVDs.																								Johansen was cleared of piracy charges in an Oslo court in January after a six-day trial, billed as a fight between a cyber David and corporate Goliaths. The court ruled that Johansen could do whatever he wanted to DVDs he had legally purchased. The court also said prosecutors had failed to give evidence that Johansens programme had been used by others to copy and distribute pirated copies.																								The prosecution this time intends to establish that Johansen broke the law when he cracked the copy-protection code on DVDs.																								State prosecutor Inger Marie Sunde, who lodged the appeal objecting to the courts application of the law and the presentation of evidence, said: The core of this case is the use of DeCSS in connection with legally purchased films...not on pirated copies.																								Johansen, who developed the programme when he was 15, has become a hero for hackers worldwide who say making software like DeCSS is an act of intellectual freedom.

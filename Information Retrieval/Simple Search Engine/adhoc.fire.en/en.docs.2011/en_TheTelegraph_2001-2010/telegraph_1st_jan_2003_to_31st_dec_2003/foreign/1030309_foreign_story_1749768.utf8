 Sunday, March 09, 2003 				 Cat Stevens speaks out against war 
																								London, March 8 (AP): Yusuf Islam  the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens  has raided his back catalogue to speak out against war with Iraq.																								Islam, who renounced his music career after becoming a Muslim in the late 1970s, has recorded two songs to express opposition to a US-led war.																								One, Angel of War, reworks Stevens melancholy love song Lady DArbanville. The other is a re-recording of his 1970s staple Peace Train.																								In a statement posted on his website, Islam said he wanted to reclaim this anthem of my evolutionary Cat Stevens period.																								As a member of humanity and as a Muslim, this is my contribution to the call for a peaceful solution to the dangerous path some world leaders today seem to be taking, he said.																								Born Stephen Georgiou in London, Stevens had a string of hits in the Sixties and Seventies, including Wild World, Morning Has Broken and Peace Train.																								Islam helped set up Britains first state-funded Muslim school and runs several Islamic charities. 																								Since his conversion he has rarely performed or recorded secular material.

				 	 Geri Halliwell																								Canberra, Jan. 30 (Reuters): The latest high-protein Hollywood diet that has helped shape actress Jennifer Aniston and former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell has won the approval of Australian scientists over conventional diets.																								A study by Australias key scientific research group, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), found the controversial diet prompted faster weight loss than traditional diets high in carbohydrates.																								The study of 100 overweight women, mostly aged in their late 40s, found those on a high-protein, low-fat diet lost six kg of body fat over a 12-week period while those on a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet only lost three kg of body fat.																								The high-protein, low-fat diet is an effective and perfectly valid and safe weight loss alternative, CSIRO senior research dietician Dr Manny Noakes said in a statement seen by Reuters today.																								This study is significant because so little research has been done in the area... the high-protein, low-fat approach to weight loss certainly offers an edge to conventional diets.																								In the CSIRO study, women on the high protein diet ate 200 grams of lean red meat in the evening and 100 grams of chicken or fish at lunchtime as well as low-fat dairy products. The diet still included some carbohydrates such as fruit and bread. 																								Overall the high-protein diet comprised of 34 per cent protein, 20 per cent fat and 46 per cent carbohydrates.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, September 03, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																SMS at your peril																																	 Singapore, Sept. 2 (AP): Singaporeans who send text messages on their mobile phones while driving face a fine of up to S$1,000 and six months in jail, police said today.																																	Police issued a statement about text messaging behind the wheel after a letter appeared in the Straits Times newspaper asking whether it was legal for a bus driver to send messages with one hand while steering his vehicle with the other.																																	Using a hand phone while driving distracts drivers and reduces their ability to control their vehicles and to react to changes in the road, the police statement said. It is an irresponsible driving attitude.																																	Mobile phone text messages  also known as short message service, or SMS  are extremely popular in Singapore. About 80 per cent of Singapores four million inhabitants have mobile phones.																													 																Mcslogan Frankfurt (AP): McDonalds Corp launched  a new global advertising campaign on Tuesday, seeking to  boost business with a younger image and a new slogan  Im  lovin it. The ads are part of a turnaround push by the  US-based burger giant that has seen McDonalds bring in  a new chief executive and close hundreds of restaurants.  Germany was chosen as the launch venue as the slogan was  dreamed up by a German ad agency, Heye amp; Partner. The  new tag line  it replaces We love to see you smile   will appear in German television ads on Tuesday evening,  around the time the company unveils the new concept in Munich.  By the end of the month, the campaign will start in more  than 100 countries. 																													 																Best beauty																																	 Brasilia (Reuters): Brazilian women care more about their appearance than any other women in the world, with half prepared to undergo plastic surgery to keep their looks, a recent study shows. In Brazil, where being called vain is often a compliment suggesting self-respect, 86 per cent of women said they tried extremely hard to improve their looks compared with an average of 67 per cent world-wide, according to the 2003 global womens survey by cosmetics company Avon. Ninety per cent of Brazilian women classified beauty products as an essential rather than a luxury, compared with an average of 77 per cent world-wide, Avon said, citing its survey of 21,000 women in 24 countries. Avons official explanation for Brazilian womens beauty consciousness was their struggle to enter a job market where they are still well under-represented. Its important to look good and feel good if you want to confront the male-dominated executive world, said Marcia Gonsales, planning and marketing director at Avon Brazil.

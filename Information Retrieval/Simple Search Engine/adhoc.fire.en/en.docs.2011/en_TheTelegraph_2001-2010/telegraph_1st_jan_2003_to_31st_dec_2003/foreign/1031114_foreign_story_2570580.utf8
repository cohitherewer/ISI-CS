 Friday, November 14, 2003 				 Hawaii hard work gives a tan
				 	 Arnold Schwarzenegger																								San Francisco, Nov. 12 (Reuters): Where was Arnold?																								For many days, aides have portrayed California governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger as immersed in meetings on his new administration which takes office on Monday. But they never said where exactly that immersion was taking place.																								It turns out that the actor and his wife Maria Shriver have been vacationing in Hawaii with their four children, a person close to the family said. They took the children off to Hawaii, he said yesterday, adding that the couples kids missed some school as a result of the pre-inaugural travels. At his first public appearance since last week, Schwarzenegger yesterday hula-ed away from the media at a large, sombre public memorial for a fireman who died in the recent wildfires in the southern part of the state.																								Wearing a dark suit, he looked tanned as he entered a back door to a San Rafael auditorium. His aides said the topic of Hawaii was off limits.																								We are not going to discuss his private time and what he chooses to do in his private time, spokeswoman Karen Hanretty said. On a daily basis he continues to work on establishing a new administration, regardless of where he is. The source who knew of the Hawaii trip joked: Maybe he has no roaming charges on his cell phone.																								In communications to the media, his transition office has sought to project the image of a man hard at work.																								He will hold private transition meetings and discussions with members of his transition team, his office has said in a routine statement put out daily in recent days. Under Californias constitution, Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat who ran against Schwarzenegger in the October 7 recall vote, acts as governor when an incumbent is out of the state.																								It is a different situation once he is sworn in but he is not yet sworn into office, Hanretty said. During his election campaign, the actor pledged to set new standards of openness.

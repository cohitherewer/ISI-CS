 Friday, October 31, 2003 				 Paul is a father again
																								London, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Former Beatle Paul McCartney celebrated a double dose of good news today  he is a father again at the age of 61 and his earnings have now topped 40 million ($68 million) a year.																								He leads a battalion of wrinkly rockers who have shown young pop pretenders a clean pair of heels by touring the world and charging their old, affluent and nostalgic fans a fortune for concert tickets. McCartney tops the latest Sunday Times Pay List as Britains most affluent pop star.																								A statement from the couple after the birth of seven-pound Beatrice Milly said: Both she and mum are doing well. Paul and Heather are ecstatic with the news. She is a little beauty and we couldnt be prouder. The one-legged model turned charity campaigner, who married the former Beatle in June last year, gave birth on Tuesday at a London hospital near the Abbey Road studios where the worlds most famous pop group recorded their immortal albums.

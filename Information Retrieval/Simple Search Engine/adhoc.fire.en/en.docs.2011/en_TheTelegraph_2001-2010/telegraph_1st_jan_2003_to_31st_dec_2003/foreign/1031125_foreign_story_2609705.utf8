																								Tbilisi, Nov. 24 (Reuters): Georgias new leaders took charge today, its interim President meeting influential security chiefs and telling a key minister to quit, after their self-styled velvet revolution toppled Eduard Shevardnadze.

The US-educated lawyer has been tipped as a probable candidate to replace Shevardnadze, whose 11-year rule ended yesterday after three weeks of turbulence in the Caucasus state.																								Interim President Nino Burdzhanadze called a meeting of the outgoing parliament tomorrow to set a new date for a presidential election that must be held by early January. She will act as head of state until then.																								The steely-eyed 39-year-old lawyer summoned military, police and state security officials to get a fix on security issues  vital in a volatile state reeling from secessionist upheaval.

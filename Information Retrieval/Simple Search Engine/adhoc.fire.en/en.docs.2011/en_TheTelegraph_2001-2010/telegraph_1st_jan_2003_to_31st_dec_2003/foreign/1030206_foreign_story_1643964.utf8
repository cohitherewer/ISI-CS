 Thursday, February 06, 2003 				 Mrs, not Miss, Brazil dethroned
 TONY SMITH				 	 Joseane de Oliveira: Miss-ed out (AP/PTI)																								Sao Paulo, Feb. 5: It was one thing when the last Miss Brazil admitted she had shaped her perfect figure under the plastic surgeons knife, but this years incumbent lost her crown and sash yesterday after confessing that she was, in fact, Mrs Brazil.																								Pageant organisers dethroned Joseane de Oliveira, 21, after she confirmed weekend newspaper reports that she had been married before winning last years contest.																								The 21-year-old model from the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul had already upset organisers by agreeing to appear in a prime-time reality show and posing seminude for a steamy photo website.																								The revelation that she had walked down the aisle in 1998 before taking to the catwalk was the final straw. Joseane has passed on her crown and sash for the simple reason that she is a married woman, said Nayla Micheris, contest organiser and herself a former Miss Brazil. Our contract is quite explicit. Contestants cannot be married or have ever been married. Oliveira insisted on television on Sunday night that organisers had known she had been married, but recanted publicly at a news conference Monday in Rio de Janeiro.																								The faith of some pageant aficionados was shaken in 2001 when that years winner, Juliana Borges, confessed to having had 19 surgical procedures, including silicon implants in her breasts, cheeks and chin and collagen injections in her lips. Back then, the organisers kept mum. About 400,000 Brazilians got tucks, implants or some sort of lifting done in 2000, making them second only to Americans in vanity procedures.																								I think Juliana exaggerated as to the number of operations she had, but she did it with the intention of improving herself, Micheris said. We all know that contestants from Venezuela or Puerto Rico also have operations, otherwise they know they wont reach the final. Oliveira passed the title on to last years runner-up, Taiza Thomsen, who will reign just three months.					 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Hand of an Iraqi in endgame 
				 	 An Iraqi points to the site where Saddam Hussein was captured. (AFP) 																								Washington, Dec. 14 (Reuters): One Iraqi captured in recent days gave US authorities information during interrogation that led to the capture of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, ending an intense manhunt since the fall of Baghdad in April, an American official said.																								The most recent final endgame was from one captured person who provided a lead which led them to that location, the official said on condition of anonymity. The captured Iraqi was not identified.																								Over the past week or two there has been an increased effort to try to identify people who might be enabling him to keep hidden, the official said.																								US intelligence agencies and the military launched an analytic effort devoted to trying to find who from former bodyguards and other supporters might be in a position to help him hide out, the official said.																								US forces including Task Force 121 was sent out to search for those supporters who had been identified. These are not big time names, the official said.																								Some of them couldnt be found but they could find people who were related to them, or knew them, and as they would scoop up some of these people they would interrogate them and ask them about the whereabouts of the other people they were looking for, the official said. 																								And so they kept moving closer and closer to the inner circle, the official said.																								In recent days, they picked up a person who in interrogation gave them new sites, which led them to new information that led them to new people, which led them to new sites, which led them to the site they went to last night where they thought that Saddam and or one of his top enablers would be, and it turns out he was, the official said.																								Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a Georgia Republican and member of the Senate intelligence committee, said that Saddam had been nearly caught two previous times.																								I know we have been very, very close to capturing him on two previous occasions, Chambliss said in a telephone interview. 																								We had tips and we just missed him.																								The size of the force  about 600 soldiers  sent to capture Saddam showed how confident US forces were that he might be at that site, Chambliss said.																								He said it was possible that insurgent attacks on US troops and Iraqi civilians could increase in the short term and that US troops were going to be on high alert for the near future.																								But longer term, the symbolic psychological issue of Saddam Hussein has been removed, and will hopefully lead to a drop in violence from his supporters, Chambliss said.																								Rep. Jane Harman of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who is on an official trip overseas said through her spokeswoman: This is huge. The world should be glad.

Passengers aboard a May 3 chartered flight from Miami to Cancun, Mexico, dubbed Naked-Air, will be free to drop their pants, shed their bras and underwear and move about the cabin au naturel.																																	Castaways Travel, a Houston-area travel agency that specialises in clothing-optional trips, is offering what it bills as the worlds first all-nude flight for $499, round-trip.																						Once the aircraft reaches cruising altitude, you will be free to enjoy the flight clothes-free, the agencys web site says.																													 																Bart pack																																	 New York (AP): Perpetual 10-year-old Bart, his clueless dad Homer and the rest of the Simpsons clan are about to go into TV history as stars of the longest-running sitcom ever. Fox announced a deal yesterday to renew the cartoon for two more seasons, taking it at least through May 2005. That will push The Simpsons past The Adventures of Ozzie amp; Harriet, which aired on ABC from 1952 to 1966, as the all-time longest-running situation comedy. The Simpsons premiered as a series on December 17, 1989.

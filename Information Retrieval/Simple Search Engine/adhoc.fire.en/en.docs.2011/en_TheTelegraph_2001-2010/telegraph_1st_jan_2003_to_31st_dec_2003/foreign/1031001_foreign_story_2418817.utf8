 Wednesday, October 01, 2003 				 Writing Roses was liberating: Madonna
				 	 Madonna New York, Sept. 30 (Reuters):  Madonna, who built her fame with catchy songs, sexy outfits,  steamy videos and a raunchy persona, said yesterday that  producing her new childrens book was a liberating experience.																								Madonna said writing The English Roses, was tremendously liberating. I never felt the pressure of having to impress anybody, she said at a book signing in mid-town Manhattan.																								Nevertheless, Madonnas magic touch, and media magnetism, is at work again as the book is expected to enter The New York Times childrens books bestseller list in the number one position on Sunday, her US publisher Callaway said last week. The first of a planned series of five unrelated books, The English Roses, a tale about envy and jealousy, was launched in 30 languages in more than 100 countries earlier this month. In the first book, the lesson is about how destructive feelings of envy and jealousy are. And everybody feels it, not just little girls, said Madonna.																								Madonna, who in 1992 created a publishing stir with Sex, a coffee table book comprised of erotic photographs, said people should not be surprised that she has tackled childrens books as a project. I have children and I read to them every night, so its a perfect extension of who I am, Madonna said, who has two children.

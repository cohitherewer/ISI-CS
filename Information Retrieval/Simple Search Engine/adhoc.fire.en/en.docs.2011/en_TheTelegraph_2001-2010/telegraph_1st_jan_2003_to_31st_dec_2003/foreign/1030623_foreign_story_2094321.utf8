The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, June 23, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Billy the brave																																	London, June 22 (AFP): A homing pigeon who took a wrong turn on his return to Britain from France, ending up in the US, is to be flown home by British Airways, the airline said today. 																																	We promise Billys trip home will be more comfortable than his trip out, an airline spokesperson said. Billy, from the town of Bootle in north-west England, had been expected to arrive home seven hours after being released from Fougeres in France, on June 6. 																																	The two-year-olds owners, John and Maria Warren, thought Billy had died after failing to return but they received a call earlier this week to say he had turned up in New York. Birds often hit power lines so we thought the worst. Hes a youngster and this was his first channel race, Maria said. She added Billy had become a star in America and had been renamed Tony Blair, after the British Prime Minister, for his guts and determination. City of Lights Paris (Reuters): Thousands  of new bulbs made the enduring symbol of the City of Lights  twinkle again in Paris on Saturday almost two years after  wear-and-tear darkened the Eiffel Towers lighting  system. The 20,000 new lights on the tower recreate a glittering  display originally meant to show off one of the worlds  most visited tourist sites on the night of the millennium. 																					 																																													 																Lords gift				 Rome (Reuters): Praise the Lord for sexy girls! An Italian  priest on Sunday prepared to celebrate his parishs patron  saint by presiding over a beauty pageant to choose the towns  candidate for the upcoming Miss Italy competition, Italian  news agency ANSA reported. If you look at the girls  in an innocent way its not a sin but a way of thanking  the Lord, Carlo Crucianelli, a priest in the central  Italian town of Civita Castellana, told ANSA. Beauty  is never embarrassing for it is a gift from the Lord.  The beauty queens of the parish will take to the catwalk on  Sunday in front of the parish church of San Luigi Gonzaga.

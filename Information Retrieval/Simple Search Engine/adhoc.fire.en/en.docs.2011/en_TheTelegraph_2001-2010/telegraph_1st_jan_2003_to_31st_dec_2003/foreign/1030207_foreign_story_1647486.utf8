 Friday, February 07, 2003 				 Virgin, Love make up after sorry
 MATTHEW JONES																								London, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Courtney Love, the American rock singer cautioned by British police earlier this week for throwing a tantrum on a trans-Atlantic flight, is welcome to fly back to Los Angeles with the same airline after saying sorry. 																								Virgin Atlantic said Love, the 38-year-old widow of Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain, had apologised to the airlines boss Sir Richard Branson at a glitzy charity concert.																								Over cocktails and canapes last night, Love told Branson  who made his fortune by creating Virgin Records  that she was sorry for misbehaving.																								Branson said he appreciated the apology and she was welcome to fly with his airline again.																								Virgin Atlantic was built thanks to the rock industry and I like to think we are a bit more understanding than most airlines, he said in a statement.																								Loves outburst on Mondays flight to Britain was triggered when cabin crew refused to allow a travelling companion from economy to sit with her in first class.																								After her release from police custody Love told reporters: I cussed (swore) at a lady (flight attendant). My daughter is always saying I had a potty (foul) mouth.																								Love, who fronts rock band Hole, said she had called the woman abitch.																								During the altercation Love refused to sit down, prompting the captain to radio ahead for police shortly before landing.																								Entrepreneur Branson, known for his publicity stunts, joked the airline might opt for a new slogan following the incident.																								Perhaps Virgins new slogan should be that Rock stars swear by us, he said.																								Love, who could not be contacted for comment on her future travel arrangements, stole the show at Wednesdays benefit concert for Londons Old Vic theatre. 																								She appeared on stage in pink satin knickers and fishnet stockings alongside Sir Elton John and while draped across a grand piano sang:The Bitch Is Back.																								A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said the companys policy was not to tolerate disruptive behaviour from passengers and that economy ticket-holders are expected to sit in economy seats.

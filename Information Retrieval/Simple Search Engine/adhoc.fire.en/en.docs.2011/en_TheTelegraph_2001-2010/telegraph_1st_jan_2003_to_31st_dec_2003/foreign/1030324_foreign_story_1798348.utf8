 Monday, March 24, 2003 				 Question that dogs US: where are Iraqs weapons? 
																								Washington, March 23: Bush administration officials were peppered yesterday with questions about why allied forces in Iraq have not found any of the chemical or biological weapons that were President Bushs central justification for forcibly disarming Iraqi President Saddam Husseins government.																								Officials said they are certain such weapons of mass destruction will be located, but they warned that the weapons may have been dispersed in small batches and could be hard to find. The Iraqi government has not used gas or germs to try to repel invading forces, or loaded such weapons of mass destruction onto missiles that have been fired into Kuwait, raising questions about the size and functionality of Saddams arsenal.																								Gen. Tommy Franks, the wars commander, opened yesterdays news conference in Qatar by saying that the location and destruction of weapons of mass destruction, and the collection of information about them, were among the administrations eight objectives in Iraq. But during questioning, Franks acknowledged that finding them is work that lies in front of us rather than work we have already accomplished.																								There is no doubt that the regime of Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction, Franks said. As this operation continues, those weapons will be identified, found, along with the people who have produced them and who guard them. He added that the amount of time that will take remains to be seen, very candidly.																								White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said Friday there is no question that weapons of mass destruction will be found, and said documenting the discoveries is one of the reasons that there are so many reporters present with the military.																								A scarcity of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons in Iraq could create both relief and concern for the administration. 																								Though it is unmitigated good news that such weapons have not been used against US troops, their absence raises questions about the rationale for war. Bush, in his weekly radio address yesterday, again mentioned Iraqs weapons of mass destruction as justification for war and listed their removal as the primary mission. Our mission is clear: to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Husseins support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people, he said.																								A senior US defence official said it is vital to Bushs political objectives to find and make a credible display of evidence of forbidden weapons programmes very, very fast. At the same time, career disarmament specialists and outside experts said it is far too soon to expect results from such a hunt when the assault to take control of the country has just begun.																								Some specialists, particularly in Europe, argue Iraq has little remaining capability to use such weapons. The weapons also might be disassembled, in hiding from UN inspectors. Or Saddams Republican Guard or other elite forces ringing Baghdad might be waiting to use weapons that other parts of the military were afraid or unable to use.																								Kenneth Adelman, a former Reagan arms-control official who is close to top Bush military officials and serves on a Pentagon advisory panel, said these weapons are likeliest to be found near Tikrit and Baghdad, because theyre the most protected places with the best troops.																								Victoria Clarke, assistant secretary of defence for public affairs, said during a televised briefing yesterday at the Pentagon that the administration knows about a number of sites where Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. Clarke refused to provide any estimate of how many sites the US knows of, even when asked. 																								I have no doubt were going to find big stores of weapons of mass destruction, Adelman said, though he acknowledged some surprise that they havent been used yet. One thing we may find is Saddam Hussein ordered them to be used and soldiers didnt follow the orders. The threat of use goes down every day because adherence to orders goes down.

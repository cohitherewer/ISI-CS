The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, July 20, 2003 				 Bond bowled over by honour
				 	 Pierce Brosnan with the OBE in Dublin. (Reuters)																								Dublin, July 19 (Reuters): Irish actor Pierce Brosnan said he was bowled over today to be honoured by Queen Elizabeth for portraying her most famous and unflappable spy, James Bond.																								Im sure Im very humbled by an honour like this, the 50-year-old Brosnan said as he was made an honorary officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)  honorary because he is not a British subject.																								On screen Brosnan has saved the world from annihilation several times over, but he said receiving the honour in his native Ireland, with his mother, stepfather, three children and granddaughter by his side, had touched him deeply.																								Im completely bowled over by it, really, he said after the medal was presented by Britains ambassador to Ireland, Stewart Eldon.																								Brosnan has made his fortune portraying the debonair and indestructible 007 in the most recent four of the 20 Bond films.																								He declined to be drawn on who he saw succeeding him in a role that virtually guarantees an actor will become one of the 10 sexiest men alive.																								I have no idea whos going to play the next Bond but Im sure hes waiting in the wings there, unknown but ready.																								As for how many more Bond films he would do, he ruled out going for the lucky record of seven set by Roger Moore.																								Just one more for now, he said, delivering the line coolly but authoritatively, just like Bond, James Bond.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, June 27, 2003 				 BBC challenge
 London, June 26 (Reuters)  : The British government, locked in a battle with the BBC  over a claim officials doctored intelligence on Iraq, challenged  the state broadcaster today to answer questions on its reporting  standards.																								Alastair Campbell, Prime Minister Tony Blairs communications supremo, has been accused by the BBC of sexing up a dossier on Iraqs weapons that helped build the case for war.																								But Campbell, who in turn has accused the BBC of biased reporting on Iraq and of slandering his name, gave the BBC until the end of today to respond to more than a dozen questions about the allegation and its general working practices. Blairs office has weighed in on Campbells side but refuses to say what action it will take if the BBC fails, in its words, to set the record straight. 																								The spat  by no means the first between British governments and the state broadcaster  erupted after the BBC, citing an anonymous intelligence source, said Campbell had pressed the security services to include a claim in a September dossier that Iraqs weapons could be deployed within 45 minutes.																								 Iraqs alleged weapons of mass destruction were the main Anglo-American justification for war but the failure to discover such arms has damaged the British governments credibility.																								An indignant Campbell yesterday accused the BBC of lying and demanded an apology.																								The BBC had accused him of inducing Blair to lie to parliament over the premise for war, Campbell said. But the corporation denied levelling such a weighty charge and is standing by its report and its anonymous source.																								Does the BBC still stand by the allegation that both we and the intelligence agencies knew the 45-minute claim to be wrong? Campbell asked in his letter.Why did BBC journalists not check the story with us before broadcast? Is this now normal BBC practice? he went on.																								Blairs spokesman denied the exchange was aboutpetty manoeuvring. Earlier, at a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Blair did not offer the BBC a question, a highly rare occurrence.																								British governments and opposition parties have often blamed the BBC for being biased against them.

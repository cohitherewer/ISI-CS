 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 DVD Jon cleared of charges
																								Oslo, Dec. 22 (Reuters): An Oslo appeal court cleared a 20-year-old Norwegian man of DVD piracy charges today in a new setback for Hollywood studios which say unauthorised copying costs them billions of dollars a year.																								Upholding a verdict by a lower court in January, the court said that Jon Johansen had broken no laws by helping to unlock a code and distribute a computer programme on the Internet enabling unauthorised copying of DVD movies.																								The US movie industry, which says that piracy costs $3.0 billion a year in lost sales, had accused Johansen of theft in cracking the copy-protection code when he was 15 and appealed against the January acquittal.																								Johansen, called DVD Jon, had pleaded not guilty to charges that he broke Norwegian law by helping break the code on commercial DVDs. The original court said he was free to do what he wanted with DVDs he bought legally. Prosecutors, who appealed against the original verdict, had urged a suspended 90-day jail term for Johansen. The appeal is rejected, Judge Wenche Skjeggestad told the court.

 Thursday, October 30, 2003 				 11 trapped miners rescued
																								Novoshakhtinsk (Russia), Oct. 29 (Reuters): Eleven Russian miners, trapped for nearly a week after a giant underground lake burst into their shaft in southern Russia, have been found alive and brought to the surface, local officials said today.																								But a twelfth miner was dead and another was still missing in the coal mine. A Reuters reporter saw 11 exhausted miners, their faces pitch black and hair covered in grime, emerged from the shaft man after man  some wrapped in blankets, some on stretchers, and some smiling broadly and squinting in weak sunlight. Some walked unaided and waved as relatives cried out their names.																								Its a mystery. They are actually in better shape than the ones we rescued days ago, said Viktor Mogilevsky, a doctor with the rescue team. Thirty-three other miners were rescued on Saturday.

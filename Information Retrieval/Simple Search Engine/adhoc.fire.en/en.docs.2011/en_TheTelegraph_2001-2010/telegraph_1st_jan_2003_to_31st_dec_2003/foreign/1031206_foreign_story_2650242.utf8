The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, December 06, 2003 				 Good time to be Samurai Cruise
				 	 Tom Cruise  Los Angeles, Dec. 5 (Reuters):  Its good being Tom Cruise right now as his new movie, Oscar  hopeful The Last Samurai, readied for a North American  debut today.																								The actor is among Hollywoods top paid leading men who can earn over $20 million a movie if he wants, but who often commands even more if he can stake a claim to a percentage of the films box office receipts as a film producer. And since his 2001 divorce from Nicole Kidman, the 41-year-old father of two has taken up with Spanish beauty Penelope Cruz.																								You know, when you start out ... youre thinking: Will you ever work again and whats going to happen, and (now) Im having a blast, Cruise said about his career at a recent news conference. Im really having a blast. And he laughs.																								There was a time that Cruise, like many a young Hollywood actor, struggled to find work. But those days are long gone after box office and critical hits that began with 1983s Risky Business and include Top Gun, Rain Man, Jerry Maguire and Mission: Impossible. Samurai, about a US Civil War veteran who travels to Japan in 1876 to train the emperors army in modern war, may be the next Cruise movie to make that list. Earlier this week, the US National Board of Review picked it as one of 2003s top movies and gave its best director honour to the films Ed Zwick.																								The 95 year-old non-profit groups best actor award went to Sean Penn for Mystic River and 21 Grams, but dont count Cruise out for US filmmakings top award, the Oscar, in February.																								Early lists like the National Board of Reviews have mixed success at foreshadowing Oscar wins, and Oscar voters at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences like sweeping sagas such as Samurai. Cruise is the first to admit his other award hopeful films like Maguire lacked the scope of Samurai. 																								Here I am, and I havent really found, or made, an epic film, Cruise said. This movie is going to take you to a different place and a different time.

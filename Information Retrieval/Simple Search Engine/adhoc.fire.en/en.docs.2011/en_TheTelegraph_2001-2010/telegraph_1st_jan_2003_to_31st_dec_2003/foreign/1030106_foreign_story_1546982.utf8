 ANDREW ALDERSON																								London, Jan. 5: Mark Bolland, the media consultant credited with turning around the public image of the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles, has severed his links with St Jam-ess Palace.																								Bolland, the royal familys first spin doctor, resigned from his role for Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry on Friday. He intends to concentrate on his new business that he launched last April.																								Bolland stood down as the Princes deputy private secretary last February after five years at St Jamess Palace but he has continued to act as a paid and influential public relations consultant. He now runs Mark Bolland Associates, which has picked up some prestigious and lucrative contracts in its first year, including one to act as a consultant to Camelot, the National Lottery operator.																								Bolland and Sir Michael Peat, Prince Charless private secretary, said that he was leaving by mutual agreement and that it was a natural progression. The decision had been taken because of Bollands growing workload and because he and St Jamess Palace want to avoid a potential conflict of interest.																								There have, however, been tensions between the two since Sir Michael arrived from Buckingham Palace in August.																								Some observers will interpret Bollands departure as a victory for Sir Michael in an internal struggle. Bolland said: My time with the Prince of Wales and Parker Bowles has been one of huge excitement and challenge  as well as one marked by moments of great sadness (a reference to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales and other members of the Royal Family).																								It has been a privilege to serve both of them and Princes William and Harry. I shall always look back on my time there with great affection. Bolland will continue to offer Parker Bowles occasional unpaid advice.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

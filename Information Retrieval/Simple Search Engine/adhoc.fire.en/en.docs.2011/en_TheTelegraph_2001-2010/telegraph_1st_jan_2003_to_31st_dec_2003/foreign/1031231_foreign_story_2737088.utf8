 Wednesday, December 31, 2003  Hunt for a word bigger than disaster  Quake toll to touch 50,000
				 	 A woman grieves at a funeral for a quake victim in Bam on Tuesday. (AFP) 																								Bam, Dec. 30 (Reuters): The death toll in Irans earthquake could jump to 50,000, officials said today, as relief workers pleaded for more aid for survivors of one of the deadliest natural disasters of modern times.																								If we consider that, on average, five people lived in each house we can say the death toll will reach 50,000, a senior interior ministry official said, sharply raising the projected tally from the nearly 30,000 already buried.																								Residents in Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, said some children who survived Fridays quake had died in the bitterly cold nights. With 90 per cent of Bams buildings damaged, according to UN estimates, tens of thousands are now sleeping in the open.																								Two children from my family, 12 and 13 years old, survived the earthquake, but they died from exposure while out on the street some time on Friday night, one middle-aged woman said. 																								Half my family is still under the debris. We buried 14 family members yesterday, she added. Writers and poets should try to find a word bigger than disaster.																								Another senior official confirmed the forecast of 50,000 deaths, though President Mohammad Khatami called it premature. We should wait until the rescue work and all the activities in Bam are finished, Khatami said in nearby Kerman, saying the present toll was definitely not 50,000.																								Such a figure could make the earthquake the most lethal since one at Tangshan in China that killed at least five times that many in 1976. Fridays tremor, which measured 6.3 on the Richter scale, struck just before dawn, killing entire families as they slept. Instead of Bam, we now have ruins and deep sorrow, Khatami said, adding he had instructed the housing ministry to produce a report in 10 days on Bams seismological faults and plans for rebuilding the ancient Silk Road city. 																								State television said the government had earmaked around $410 million for reconstruction.																								Aid agencies say around 100,000 people are homeless and are appealing for warm clothing and blankets.																								Around 30,000 people were injured. Television broadcasts showed one girl, aged about six, lying in a hospital bed with tubes attached to her nose and a bandaged head. I want to show my dolls to my mummy and tell her what has happened to us. But I cant find my mummy, she said.																								Experts said Bams mud-brick buildings did not leave the air pockets that occur when modern concrete structures collapse and their dust would have suffocated survivors.																								Khatami said he had ordered an investigation into why government buildings, including hospitals, had also crumbled. Those who are to blame will be severely punished, he said, without elaborating.

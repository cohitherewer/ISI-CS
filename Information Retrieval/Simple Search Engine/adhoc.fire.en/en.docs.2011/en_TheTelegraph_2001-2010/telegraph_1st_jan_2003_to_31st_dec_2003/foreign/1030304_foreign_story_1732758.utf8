 Tuesday, March 04, 2003 				 UN health warning on Iraq
																								Baghdad, March 3 (Reuters): With many Iraqis still dying from the effects of the 1991 Gulf War, the country faces a major health disaster if a new war erupts, a top UN health official said today.																								If there is war, it will be catastrophic for the people of Iraq. We have a very fragile health system with a very vulnerable population, Ghulam R. Popal, World Health Organisation (WHO) representative in Iraq said. 																								The health system is stretched to the limit. It cannot tolerate any further damage or any further expansion of its services. We believe that if there is war it will have dire humanitarian consequences, he said in an interview.

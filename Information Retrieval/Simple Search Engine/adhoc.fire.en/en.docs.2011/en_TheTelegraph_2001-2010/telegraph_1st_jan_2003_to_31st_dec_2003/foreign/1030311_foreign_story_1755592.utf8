 Tuesday, March 11, 2003 				 Parties shun talks in Nepal
																								Kathmandu, March 10 (AFP): Several major political parties in Nepal boycotted an all-party meeting today held by Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand to discuss talks with Maoist rebels.																								None of the leaders of the major political parties participated in the all-party meeting called by Prime Minister Chand, saying the government was formed unconstitutionally and undemocratically by the king, an official at the Prime Ministers secretariat said. 																								Chand called the meeting to discuss a code of conduct for peace talks with rebels following a cease-fire announced in January. Those who boycotted the meeting included the Nepali Congress, the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist, the Nepal Peasants and Workers Party and the Peoples Front of Nepal.																								But the president of the rightist National Democratic Party, Pashupati Rana, and some senior leaders of the pro-India Nepal Sadbhawana party and Samata Party attended the meeting.

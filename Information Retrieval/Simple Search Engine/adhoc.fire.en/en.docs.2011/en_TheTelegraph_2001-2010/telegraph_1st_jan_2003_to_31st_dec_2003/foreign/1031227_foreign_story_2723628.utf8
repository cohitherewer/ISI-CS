 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 US-France flight row
 DAVID RENNIE 																								Washington, Dec. 26: American and French officials yesterday traded mutual recriminations over the failure to snare any terrorists in the security operation that grounded six Air France flights in and out of Los Angeles.																								Bush administration officials expressed frustration that al Qaida operatives might have escaped capture after word leaked, early this week, of US concerns on flights from France over the Christmas period.																								One official said Washington had been hoping to keep the US-French negotiations confidential, adding that the hope was that we would be able to lure some of these people in.																								However, a French interior ministry spokesman said little evidence of a terrorist plot had been found. French authorities released seven men  one French, one American and several Algerians  whose names were found to be on US watch-lists. The seven were all due to board a flight on Wednesday. French authorities found nothing to suggest the men had terrorist links.																								A spokesperson for the French Prime Minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, said the decision to cancel the flights came early on Christmas Eve after American authorities notified France that two or three suspicious people, possibly Tunisian nationals, were on the manifests of three Los Angeles-bound flights. Raffarins spokesperson added the US had threatened to refuse the planes permission to land if they took off.																								A French judicial official said the name of a Tunisian national with a pilots licence had appeared on the American list of suspicious people who might attempt to board a flight. But French intelligence officials determined that the man was in Tunisia and had no plans to leave the country. The official added the Tunisian had no criminal record and did not belong to any Islamic radical group. 																								US sources hit back at French scepticism, saying American intelligence agencies had intercepted e-mails from the al Qaida terrorist group suggesting another September 11-style attack was being plotted for the Christmas holiday.

 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 I am not anti-US, says Madonna
				 	 Madonna																								Los Angeles, Feb. 15 (Reuters): Madonna may be anti-war, but dont call her anti-American.																								The Michigan-born Material Girl, who made headlines with reports that a music video for her latest song: American Life, carries a strong anti-war message, said it should not be interpreted as critical of her homeland or US President George W. Bush.																								I feel lucky to be an American citizen for many reasons, one of which is the right to express myself freely, Madonna said in a statement on her website (www.madonna.com).																								I am not anti-Bush. I am not pro-Iraq, she said. I am pro-peace. I have written a song and created a video which expresses my feelings about our culture and values and illusions of what many people believe is the American dream  the perfect life.																								The 44-year-old entertainer added that she hopes the video will provoke thought and dialogue and does not expect everyone to agree with her point of view.																								I am grateful to have the freedom to express these feelings and thats how I honour my country, she said.																								According to Madonnas spokeswoman, Liz Rosenberg, the video opens at a fashion show then escalates into a mad frenzy depicting the catastrophic repercussions and horror of war.																								Hollywood celebrities have lined up to oppose a threatened war with Iraq and many of them, including actors George Clooney, Ed Harris and Dustin Hoffman as well as director Spike Lee, have slammed Bush.

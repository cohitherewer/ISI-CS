Thai trauma Bangkok (Reuters) : Thai human rights  activists today lambasted a beauty contest for girls as  young as three, charging organisers with exploiting children  and reinforcing Thailands negative image as a popular destination  for sex tourists. Organisers of the Miss and Mister International  Kids Contest, which feature boys and girls between 3-12  wearing national dress and swimsuits  said the event  was meant to boost childrens confidence when appearing  in public. But rights advocate Montri Sintawichai said parents  should think twice before registering their children for  the contest, which he said eroded the innocence of children.  I will never send my kids to this kind of beauty pageant,  said Montri. Swimsuits are associated with sex. Wallop  Tangkananuruk, chairman of the Thai senates children and  women affairs committee, said swimwear should only be worn  at the swimming pool. This event will emphasise Thailands  image as a sex land full of child prostitutes, he said.

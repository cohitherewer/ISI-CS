 Saturday, October 25, 2003 				 Spy series relives fall of German chancellor 
 															- Son  cast as fathers nemesis 				 	 File picture of former West German chancellor Willy Brandt (left) with then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow. 																								Germany is reliving its biggest post-war political scandal with a television drama about the East German spy who brought down Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1974.																								In an unusual casting move that has helped fan public interest in the drama, Brandts son Matthias, a professional actor, plays Guenter Guillaume, an unassuming, grey bureaucrat.																								Guillaume, a sleeper agent planted in West Germany in 1956, rose through the ranks of the Social Democrat party to become an aide in Brandts Chancellery in the early 1970s in an unprecedented coup for his communist spymasters in East Berlin.																								He had access to secret papers and heard confidential conversations at a crucial time for Bonn as Brandt pursued Ostpolitik of detente with Moscow. The strategy was viewed with mixed feelings by East Berlin which feared Bonn would try use ties with Moscow to undermine its standing with the Kremlin.																								The film, In The Shadow of Power, is being screened this month. Interest in the scandal is not confined to Germany. A play by British playwright Michael Frayn on the affair, called Democracy, is being staged at a London theatre.																								Brandt was reluctant to take responsibility for stunning intelligence gaffes that permitted Guillaumes ascent. But the prospect that the case would expose Brandts extramarital affairs at a time when his government was weakened by an economic slump forced him to resign.																								Brandt wasnt someone who clung to power, said Hermann Schreiber, a former journalist for Der Spiegel magazine who covered the scandal and helped research the film. Guillaume wasnt a 007 type at all. He was a conventional, petit-bourgeois man who tended to make himself useful, said Schreiber, who has written a book on the affair. Brandt never liked him, he found him boring.																								Brandts fall shocked millions of Germans for whom the Nobel Peace Prize winner and former mayor of West Berlin was an icon. As chancellor, he came to symbolise Germanys quest for forgiveness for the Holocaust, famously falling to his knees before a monument to the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising during a groundbreaking 1970 state visit to Poland.

 Tuesday, March 04, 2003 				 In Dublin, better own a taxi
																								Dublin, March 3 (Reuters): Michael OLeary, head of Irish-based budget airline Ryanair, has come up with a novel way to beat Dublins notorious traffic jams  his own taxi licence.																								 Tired of crawling through the Irish capitals frequent gridlocks, multi-millionaire OLeary has bought a taxi licence which allows him to drive his luxury Mercedes saloon in restricted bus lanes, Irish newspapers reported today. The licence, which cost 6,000 euros ($6,480), also gives OLeary access to city centre streets closed off to normal motorists.																								Traffic in Dublin has almost ground to a standstill after more than half a decade of so-called Celtic Tiger boom times swelled the population and flooded roads with new vehicles. Since deregulation of the taxi industry three years ago, the number of licences in circulation in the city has tripled to around 11,000.																								A spokeswoman for Ryanair  Europes second-biggest budget carrier  confirmed the move by OLeary. To the best of my knowledge its true and what is reported in the papers is correct, she said.																								While it is not illegal to use the licence, OLeary would be obliged to pick up customers if hailed while driving without a passenger in his car, the papers said. Irelands Taxi Drivers Union has accused OLeary of abusing the licensing system and of making a mockery of the rules of the road.

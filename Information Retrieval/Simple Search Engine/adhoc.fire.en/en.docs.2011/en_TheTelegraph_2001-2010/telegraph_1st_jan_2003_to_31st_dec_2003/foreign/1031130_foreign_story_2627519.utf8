The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, November 30, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Tipsy judge																						 Helsinki, Nov. 29 (Reuters): A Finnish judge who heard four criminal cases while drunk insisted the breath test was flawed because she was too busy to brush her teeth that morning.																																	During a hearing in March, Judge Leena Pettinens blood alcohol content was three times the legal driving limit, Finlands attorney general said. 																																	The judge said she hosted a party the night before, drinking several glasses of vodka punch, cognac, wine and beer. Pettinen did not deny being under the influence of alcohol at work, but said she had felt capable of doing her job.																																	The breathalyser test result was affected by the alcohol that was left in my mouth and which I did not have time to remove in the morning rush by brushing my teeth, Pettinen said. 																																	Pettinen could face a fine or a jail sentence of up to one year for professional misconduct.																													 																Croc chase Hong Kong (Reuters): Chinas answer  to Crocodile Dundee joined the chase for a baby croc on  the loose in Hong Kong on Saturday as an Australian hunter  threw in the towel. He Zhanzhao, nicknamed Crocodile Zhao  in an echo of the film character who wrestles crocodiles  bare-handed in Australias outback, searched in vain for  the 1.2 metre salt water reptile hiding in a muddy river  in rural Yuen Long district. The arrival of the stout, baseball-capped  30-year-old crocodile farmer from southern China came as  Australian hunter John Lever bade farewell to a city better  known for its skyscrapers than its swamps.

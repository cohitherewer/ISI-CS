The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, November 13, 2003 				 Hype fails to boost Lynch book sales
				 	 Jessica Lynch																								New York, Nov. 12 (Reuters): Despite a media blitz, the biography of Americas best-known soldier from the Iraq war, Jessica Lynch, appeared unlikely yesterday to translate into big cash as the first day of sales fell short of expectations.																								After days of magazine covers, TV movies, tabloid tales and television interviews, first-day sales of her authorised biography, I Am a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story, fell well short of other high-profile books like Senator Hillary Rodham Clintons memoir, which had buyers lining up around the block.																								Not a copy had been sold by midday yesterday, Veterans Day, at a Barnes amp; Noble store on Chicagos North Side, said an employee who declined to be identified. The store would not disclose how many of the books sold. Ive yet to have anyone ask about it, the employee said.																								At a Manhattan Barnes amp; Noble, an employee described interest as moderate. It certainly has not been exceptional. Another nearby store sold one copy by lunchtime.																								On online bookseller Amazon.com, the book ranked 21st in sales, well short of top-selling novel The Da Vinci Code and the latest get-slim-quick fad, The South Beach Diet. A spokesman for the Lynch family could not be reached for comment, while her publicist at publisher Alfred A. Knopf did not return calls.

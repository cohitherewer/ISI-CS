 Thursday, September 11, 2003 				 Survivor cannot shake off dust
 MERLE ENGLISH  Marcy Borders coated  in dust after the twin towers collapsed on September  11. (AFP)  Marcy Borders as  she looks now in her Bayonne, New Jersey, apartment.  (AFP)																								New York, Sept. 10: Marcy Borders, whose dust-caked face became a symbol of the World Trade Center tragedy after she struggled down 81 flights of stairs to escape the conflagration, has pretty much given up on getting the help she needs to recover from her trauma. 																								My life has been in a rut since 9/11, she said dolefully, speaking curled up on a sofa in her subsidised apartment in Bayonne, New Jersey. 																								Two years ago, a photograph that captured her covered with dust in a frozen stance appeared in newspapers, magazines and on television programmes around the world. 																								Borders, who had been on welfare but had started a new job as a $40,000 technical assistant at the Bank of America a month before September 11, was at the copy machine in her 81st-floor office in Tower One when the first plane hit. 																								In her rush to get out of the building, she left behind her pocketbook with all the money she had  $500 from her first pay check  her drivers license, Social Security card, and birth certificate. A building pass was her only identification. 																								But she has lost much more than that. Now, she has a fear of tall buildings, crossing bridges and going through tunnels, and a feeling of being abandoned by agencies that should be helping. 																								On Monday, Borders started what she said was a free pre-school, teaching the basics to two 3-year-olds from her neighbourhood. This may be my turning point. Maybe this is what God wants me to do for the rest of my life, she said. She is holding classes from 10 am to 3 pm in her apartment. I feel safer in my own house, she said. 																								Although she filled out forms provided by various agencies she contacted for help, Borders said she has not received adequate counselling or substantial financial support. She said she received about $300 from the Red Cross and donations totalling about $1,000, from individuals responding to her plight. 																								Nancy Rutherford, a Red Cross spokeswoman, said the organisation gave substantially more money to Borders, and sent case workers to interview her. She said the Red Cross is working with different agencies to help her. Borders, 29, the single mother of a 9-year-old daughter, has not smiled much since the attacks. Nor has she regained much of the weight she lost from her slender frame. Tiny bumps she attributes to stress recently appeared on her stomach. 																								Anne Hosansky, author of Turning Toward Tomorrow, which gives suggestions for those who are coping with loss, offered some advice. Write a daily journal, whatever she feels, whether shes angry or grief-stricken, and the good things we let go past us, like the first time we smiled. 																								Manhattan poet Sir Abdullah Smith-Ford, moved by her story, composed a poem: The Forgotten, dedicated to those who feel left out of the outreach government and private agencies are making to other survivors.  It starts: Ignored. Misplaced.  Shunned. Forgotten.  Where are they now?  Hundreds covered, soaked, dazed  By this countrys worst nightmare  Where are they now ...?

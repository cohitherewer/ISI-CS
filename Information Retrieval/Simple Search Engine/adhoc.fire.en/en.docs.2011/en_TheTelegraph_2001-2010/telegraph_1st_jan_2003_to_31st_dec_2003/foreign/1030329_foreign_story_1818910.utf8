 Saturday, March 29, 2003 				 In rain of bombs, Iraqis pray
																								Baghdad, March 28 (Reuters): Defiant residents of Baghdad converged on mosques for Friday prayers, enraged rather than cowered by US bombs raining down on the capital in the second week of the US-led war to oust President Saddam Hussein.																								You can see and hear the missiles and bombs raining down on us and yet Muslims are coming to the house of God to pray, said the preacher at the Mother of All Battles Mosque.																								Your relationship with God gets stronger and stronger with every missile and every bomb your enemy drops on you.																								While he spoke, the mosque compound shook as some 15 bombs and missiles crashed into an area northwest of Baghdad. The rumble of explosions compounded the rage of worshippers but did not stop them from pursuing their service.

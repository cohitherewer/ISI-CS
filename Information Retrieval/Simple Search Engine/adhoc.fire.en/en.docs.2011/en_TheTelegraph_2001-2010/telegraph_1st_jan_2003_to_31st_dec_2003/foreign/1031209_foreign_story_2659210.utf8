 Tuesday, December 09, 2003 				 Zimbabwe quits, blames it on Britain
				 	 Australian Prime Minister John Howard in Abuja. (Reuters)																								Harare/Abuja, Dec. 8 (Reuters): President Robert Mugabes ruling party railed at Britain and its white allies today, saying they had forced Zimbabwe into a no-win situation which had left it with no choice but to pull out of the Commonwealth.																								Whatever our detractors and critics are saying, for us this is like an escape from hell because Britain and its white allies have turned the Commonwealth into a Zimbabwe lynching club, Didymus Mutasa, external affairs secretary of Mugabes Zanu-PF party said. 																								The group of 54 mostly former British colonies renewed Zimbabwes suspension yesterday, demanding that Harare seek reconciliation with the Opposition and respect human rights, prompting a furious Mugabe to carry out a threat to withdraw.																								Zimbabwe was suspended early last year on the grounds that Mugabe, 79, who has ruled the country since independence in 1980, rigged his re-election in 2002 and persecuted his opponents.																								Commonwealth leaders said they regretted Mugabes response, with British foreign secretary Jack Straw warning it would hurt Zimbabwes people the most.																								Its entirely in character, sadly, with President Mugabe, Straw said. I think its a decision which he, and particularly the Zimbabwean people, will come to regret, he added.																								Membership in the Commonwealth confers political prestige on an international stage for poor nations and some modest trade and aid benefits. Members see exclusion from the gentlemans club, which highly values cordial diplomacy, as an insult. But Zanu-PFs Mutasa was nonplussed by what he saw as the Commonwealths hypocrisy. We withdraw our membership and they say we are wrong and we should stay, but stay suspended so that they can demonise our government, he said.																								Australian Prime Minister John Howard noted, however, that it was not the first withdrawal from the Commonwealth nor was it irreversible. Nothing is permanent, said Howard, who took a hard line against Mugabe. You have to have consistent standards in these matters.																								Talks on Zimbabwe dominated a four-day Commonwealth summit in the Nigerian capital Abuja which closed today, causing the worst split since South Africas apartheid policies in the 1970s and 1980s and dividing members roughly on colour lines.																								Commonwealth leaders spent three days carefully crafting a face-saving declaration, which did not mention the word suspension. 																								It only talked of the hope for Zimbabwes return on condition that it engage in political reconciliation and stick to Commonwealth principles including respect for human rights.																								Most of Zimbabwes backers, including South Africa, declined to comment on its decision to withdraw, but one key ally, Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano, told reporters on entering the summits final meeting: We are upset.

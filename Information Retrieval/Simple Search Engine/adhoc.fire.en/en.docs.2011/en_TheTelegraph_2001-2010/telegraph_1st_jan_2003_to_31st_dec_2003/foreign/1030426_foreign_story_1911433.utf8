 Turner terms Murdoch a warmonger
 Ted Turner Rupert Murdoch San Francisco, April 25 (Reuters): Ted Turner said yesterday too few people owned too many media organisations and called rival media baron Rupert Murdoch a warmonger for what he said was Murdochs promotion of the US war in Iraq.Hes a warmonger, Turner said in an evening speech to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco of Murdoch, whose News Corp. Ltd. owns the fast-growing Fox News Channel. He promoted it.Fox News Channel has been the most popular US cable news network during the conflict, trumping AOL Time Warner Inc.s CNN, which Turner started two decades ago and came to prominence with its blanket coverage of the 1991 Gulf War.Asked by an audience member for his thoughts on Foxs larger ratings share than CNNs, Turner said: Just because your ratings are bigger doesnt mean youre better. Its not how big you are, its how good you are that really counts, Turner said. Turner, who has pledged to give $1 billion to the UN and is a vocal proponent of population control and nuclear-arms elimination, criticised the concentration of ownership of the vast majority of US television networks, radio and TV stations and newspapers in a few corporations. The media is too concentrated, too few people own too much, Turner said.Asked whether he would again try to launch a new network, Turner, who is the vice-chairman of AOL Time Warner and has been critical of the merger of AOL and Time Warner, said: No. I think the space is filled with the people already there. Theres really five companies that control 90 per cent of what we read, see and hear. Its not healthy. Earlier yesterday, BBC director general Greg Dyke said US broadcasters coverage of the Iraq war was so unquestioningly patriotic and so lacking in impartiality that it threatened the credibility of Americas electronic media.Dyke singled out for criticism Fox News Channel and Clear Channel Communications Inc., the largest operator of radio stations in the US.Personally, I was shocked while in the US by how unquestioning the broadcast news media was during this war, Dyke said in a speech in London.After Turners initial remarks, the moderator for the question and answer session noted that Turner would not be able to comment on the ongoing federal investigations into AOL Time Warner.The moderator had scarcely finished her statement when he leaned into the microphone and said: I can say one thing. As the largest shareholder and the biggest shareholder (of the company), its been brutal. Turner said he also liked bison. I got 35,000 of them, Turner said in response to a question about bison.I do eat them. Youve got to eat.The final question of the evening to Turner: What will be his epitaph.I have nothing more to say, Turner said.And thats what it is.  Copyright

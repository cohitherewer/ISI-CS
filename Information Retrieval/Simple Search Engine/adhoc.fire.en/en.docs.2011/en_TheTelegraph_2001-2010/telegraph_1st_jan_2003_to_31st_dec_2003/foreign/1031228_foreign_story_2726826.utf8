 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 New face in Blair Xmas party team
																								London, Dec. 27: Tony Blair and his family embarked on their annual Christmas holiday to Egypt yesterday with a new addition to the party: Euans girlfriend, Katie Sanders.																								The 10-strong group, which also included Mrs Blairs mother Gayle Booth, caught a 205 charter flight from Gatwick airport to the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh.																								None of the 200 holidaymakers on board the Thomas Cook flight, number TCX 916K, knew of the VIP party until minutes before take-off, when a fleet of cars, flanked by security, delivered them to the steps of the Boeing 757.																								The Blairs trip, their third in as many years, has been criticised by the family of three Britons jailed in Egypt for supporting an outlawed Islamic group. They claim the holiday adds legitimacy to a regime that abuses human rights.																								Miss Sanders, 19, the daughter of a Somerset millionaire garden centre owner, has become a regular feature on the arm of Euan, also 19, in the past few months.																								It is believed that they met at the University of Bristol.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

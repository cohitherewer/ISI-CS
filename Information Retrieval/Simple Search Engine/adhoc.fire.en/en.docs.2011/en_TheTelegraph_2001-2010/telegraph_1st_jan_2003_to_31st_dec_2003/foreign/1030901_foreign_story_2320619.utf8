 Monday, September 01, 2003 				 Fresh life for US gripes against French
 Paris, Aug. 31 (Reuters):  Whats an American in Paris to do when he finds himself  agreeing with the anti-French rhetoric of some compatriots  back home?																								Help is now at hand in the shape of a French reprint of a booklet handed out to American GIs stationed in post-war France more than half a century ago to help them get to grips with the customs and history of the host country.																								French women are loose, Every time we go to a night club, these cursed French swindle us and All the French want is to have a good time, are just some of the moans dealt with in the book designed to improve relations.																								Discovered by chance by a history buff, the tract has been translated into French and turned into a surprise best seller thanks to the uncanny resemblance between some of the complaints from the World War Two era and those heard this year during the Iraq dispute.																								Its very funny and our readers find it amusing. They are also surprised and always ask if it really was given to American GIs, they first think its a joke, said Pierre Coutelle, 27, a Parisian bookseller who read the book.																								But it doesnt change their opinion on the current Francophobia, its a fun historical document.																								The original tract was printed because once the euphoria of the liberation of Paris and other parts of France in 1944 had worn off, relations between American GIs and locals began to sour.																								In 1945 the US army found a lot of problems in France. The American soldiers didnt understand the attitudes of the French people and this bred Francophobia, which was very embarrassing, explained Balbino Katz, who found the text in an attic sale of old books in a small French village.																								Intrigued, he picked up the tract for one euro (dollar) and printed a few extracts in French magazine, Historys Adventures, which he co-edits. There they caught the eye of publishers Le Cherche Midi, who issued the entire text, word for word.																								Our friends, the French (112 Gripes about the French in its original incarnation) hit the book shelves in June and has already sold some 15,000 copies  three times the initial print run.																								Its a very droll book and we can see that the Francophobia of 1945 was not that different from the Francophobia we have seen this year, Katz said.																								Some of the grumbles were echoed this year after France refused to back the US-led war on Iraq.																								In 25 years we have come twice to Europe to save the French and We spend our whole time getting the French out of a pickle. And they, have they ever done anything for us?, are two of the complaints listed.																								In defence of the French, the books original compilers note Frances role in the American Revolution and clarify Washingtons reasons for joining World War Two.																								We came because we, the Americans, were threatened by a power that was hostile, aggressive and dangerous. If France fell in June 1940, we didnt land until June 1944... There was Pearl Harbour and Germanys declaration of war against America.																								The row over Iraq prompted some American cafes to rebrand French fries as freedom fries, while others refused to serve French wine and US President George W. Bushs Air Force One plane put freedom toast on its breakfast menu.																								Katz said the books message was still resonant today, when chilly transatlantic relations have sparked a slump in the number of US visitors to France.																								Its not the French who are defending France in this book, its the Americans. Thats why we joke that the French government should pay for the text to be reprinted in English and distribute it in the US, he said.																								The book explains customs that bewildered the soldiers, from the ingrained cafe culture to kissing on the cheeks as the traditional greeting, and answers the gripe: What have these cursed frog-eaters ever done for the world? with a three-page list of renowned French intellectuals.																								On the one hand, its embarrassing for the French because it shows what the US soldiers thought of them. On the other hand, its embarrassing for the Americans because most of their complaints turn out to be false and xenophobic, Katz said.																								However the book does agree with some of the gripes, admitting that life changes slowly in France and that certainly the French dont wash themselves often enough.																								No one is asking you to love the French, it concedes. But you wont gain anything from hating them either.

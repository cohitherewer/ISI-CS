Actor weds London (Reuters): British actor Kenneth  Branagh has married his girlfriend Lindsay Brunnock in a  private ceremony, his publicist said on Wednesday. The couple  tied the knot at a small ceremony at the weekend and are  now on honeymoon at an undisclosed location. No other details  were released.

Drunk down																																	 Canberra (Reuters): Drivers on roads Down Under have a new animal to steer clear of  the drunken Australian male. New research shows that two out of three road deaths among male pedestrians aged between 15 to 54 are to be blamed on alcohol or other drugs. The report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found that around 85 per cent of the fatal accidents happened between 6 pm and dawn, particularly on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. In more than 30 per cent of cases the male victim had simply been standing or lying on the road when hit, rather than actually attempting to cross it. Five out of six victims had a blood alcohol concentration over three times a drivers legal limit.																																	Pedestrians must get the message that they need to be as conscious as drivers of the dangers of mixing road use with alcohol, Australias Transport Parliamentary Secretary Ron Boswell said in a statement.																																	The report found only eight percent of the deaths could be blamed on risky road use by the vehicles driver. 																																	WASHINGTON, May 27 (Reuters) - Almost all American motorists admit to bad driving habits from speeding to eating behind the wheel or chatting on cell phones, according to a survey released on Tuesday.																																	A whopping 91 percent of respondents said they engaged in at least one risky activity while driving, said the survey commissioned by Drive for Life: The National Safe Driving Test and Initiative, a group that promotes driver education.																																	The national poll of more than 1,100 licensed drivers found that 56 percent identified inattentive drivers as the greatest threat to driving safety.																																	Speeding topped the list of bad habits -- seven in 10 respondents said they drove a little above the speed limit now and then.																																	Other risky practices drivers admitted to included crossing on a red or yellow light (35 percent), not using turn signals (26 percent) and aggressive driving (13 percent).																																	The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 NBC programme to unmask Jackson
				 	 Michael Jackson																								Los Angeles, Jan. 18 (Reuters): NBC News is ready to give singer Michael Jackson his prime-time close-up, novel nose and all, but the self-proclaimed King of Pop is not happy about it.																								A special edition of NBCs news magazine Dateline next month will focus on Jacksons face and how the reclusive singers appearance has dramatically changed over the years along with the highs and lows of his career, network executives said yesterday.																								Jacksons publicist in Los Angeles expressed outrage at the concept.																								I think its horrible that NBC is planning on doing a special on Michael Jacksons face, and the network should focus on more important issues in the world, she said.																								Promotional material released yesterday for NBCs winter showcase of upcoming programmes described the Dateline special, titled Michael Jackson Unmasked, as the inside story of the performer as told by some of the people who knew him best.																								But comments from network executives made it clear the Dateline segment, slated to air during ratings sweeps on February 17, would spotlight the Gloved Ones looks.																								In his opening remarks to TV critics gathered for the event, NBC entertainment president Jeff Zucker described it as a special edition on Michael Jacksons face.																								I just hope the folks at Sony Music dont complain, Zucker joked in a reference to Jacksons label, where ex-NBC president Andrew Lack assumed his new post as CEO last week.																								An NBC news publicist later said the Dateline special would trace the rise and fall of Michael Jackson using the transformation of his looks as a metaphor for his career. 																								The performer ignited worldwide speculation about his face when he was photographed and shown on television during a rare courtroom appearance in November that left many with the impression he had undergone one nose-job too many.

 Tuesday, July 15, 2003 				 Travel firms urged to pull out of Myanmar
																								London, July 14 (AFP): A British foreign office minister today urged travel firms that arrange trips to Myanmar to consider pulling out because of the countrys human rights record. 																								The strongly-worded warning by Mike Brien steps up the pressure on British firms doing business with the southeast Asian country following recent calls by both Brien and Prime Minister Tony Blair for tobacco firm BAT to withdraw. 																								Myanmars rights record has been put under the spotlight since Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was put in custody after vicious clashes between her followers and pro-regime elements at the end of May. 																								The military regime government says four people were killed in the clashes but dissident groups say dozens died, and blamed the violence on government-backed mobs. 																								In a statement released by the foreign office, Brien said he had written to the head of the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) to discuss the current situation in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. 																								In the light of the recent dreadful developments in Burma, I have today written to ABTA to ask tour operators to stop arranging holidays there, quot; Brien said. There were compelling reasons not to take a holiday in the country, including the economic and political benefits the regime gained from foreign visits, he said.

 Friday, June 06, 2003 				 German hardliner falls to death
																								Berlin, June 5 (Reuters): One of Germanys most controversial politicians, former deputy chancellor Juergen Moellemann who enraged German Jews by criticising Israel, fell to his death today in a parachute jump.																								Police said they were investigating whether Moellemann, an experienced skydiver who had served as a paratrooper in the German armed forces, committed suicide or died in an accident.																								Moellemanns stunts  he often parachuted into campaign events  had helped propel him to the top of the liberal Free Democrat Party, but he quit in March in disgrace over charges of anti-Semitism and irregular party funding.																								His death coincided with a search of his home in Muenster, western Germany, by prosecutors probing allegations he violated party funding rules.

 Wednesday, March 12, 2003 				 Victoria settles slander suit 
				 	 Victoria Beckham																								London, March 11 (Reuters): Spice Girl Victoria Beckham has apologised and agreed to pay 55,000 in damages to two shop-owners after accusing them of selling a fake autographed photo of her footballing husband David. 																								Beckhams lawyer, Justin Rushbrooke, told the High Court today that the singer had agreed to settle a slander suit brought by Timothy and Glynis McManus and their son Anthony after a confrontation at their memorabilia shop two years ago.																								Beckham had spotted a signed photo of her husband, the England football captain, in the shop  GTs Recollections in Bluewater mall, southern England  and loudly accused the owners of selling a fake autograph.																								Her accusations, heard by several customers in the shop, later found their way into the newspapers, with the McManuses claiming their business was almost ruined by the coverage.																								My client apologises for the hurt and damage which the claimants have suffered. Victoria Beckham happily accepts that the McManuses are honest and reputable traders and seek to obtain their memorabilia from respected sources, Rushbrooke said. 																								But he added that press reports claiming Beckham had been rude to the point of using offensive language were not true.																								The Beckhams, who were not in court, have long been Britains most prominent celebrity couple, with the combination of glamorous Posh Spice and her style-conscious husband ensuring they are rarely out of the media spotlight.																								The McManuses lawyer, Michael Skrein, said the family was very pleased with the outcome, which had ended up being settled in a good-natured fashion.																								Skrein said Victoria Beckham had apologised for any hurt and damage caused and would be providing the McManuses with a set of official merchandise  signed by her husband.

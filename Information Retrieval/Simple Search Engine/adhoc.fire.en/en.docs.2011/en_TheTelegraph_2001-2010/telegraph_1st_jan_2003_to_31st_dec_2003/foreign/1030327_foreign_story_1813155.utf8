The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, March 27, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Bouquets amp; brickbats for media																																	 Los Angeles, March 26 (Reuters): A majority of Americans who favour the war with Iraq believe media coverage of the conflict has been excellent, while most critics of the war disagree, according to a poll.																																	A joint weekend survey conducted by CNN, USA Today and the Gallup organisation found that 57 per cent of Americans who support the US-led invasion of Iraq believe media coverage was excellent, while 33 per cent rated it good. Just 10 per cent of pro-war respondents thought media coverage of the war was only fair/poor.																						Respondents opposed to the war were more divided, with only 38 per cent agreeing that war coverage was excellent and just 23 per cent rating it as good. The remaining 39 per cent of anti-war Americans found coverage fair to poor.																													 																Blasts in Italy																																	 Rome (Reuters): Two cars belonging to US military personnel from a base in northern Italy were blown up overnight by rudimentary bombs, police said. The cars, owned by military people working at the Southern European Task Force in Vicenza, were destroyed while parked on streets near the base. There were no injuries. The police said they believed the attacks, which occurred some 30 minutes apart, were a protest against the war in Iraq.																													 																Freedom toast																																	 Macdill Air Force base (Reuters): On US President George W. Bushs Air Force One flight to Florida on Wednesday it was au revoir French toast, hello Freedom toast. Stuffed Freedom Toast topped the breakfast menu, in a subtle slap at the French for helping to confound US attempts to get the UN Security Council to authorise military force against Iraq.																																	The name change for the venerable breakfast dish  in this case stuffed with cream cheese  followed similar moves by the US Congress and some restaurants across the country to change French fries to Freedom fries.																													 																Pope plea																																	 Vatican City (Reuters): Pope John Paul II on Wednesday made a fresh appeal for peace in Iraq and said his heart was oppressed by the news of battles. Speaking to pilgrims and tourists in St Peters Square, the Pope asked Catholics around the world to continue praying for peace. The Pope, who headed the Vaticans diplomatic campaign to avert war, said when he prayed he did so with a heart that is oppressed by news that reaches us from an Iraq in war.																													 																Help from India																																	 Mumbai: Five men from three Islamic organisations in the city plan to leave for Iraq on Sunday to form part of the human shields to defend their religion, reports our special correspondent. Denied visas by Iraq, they applied for Jordanian visas, which they have just been granted. They will travel to Jordan by air, from where they will take the road to Iraq. Their journey is being coordinated by some Indian students in a Baghdad university, who are also in touch with other activists in Iraq to form human shields against US targets. The three organisations  Raza Academy, All India Sunni Jamiyat Ul Ulema and Sunni Tableeghi Jammat  also got together to protest against the killings of Kashmiri Pundits in Nadigram. At a demonstration by more than 100 members from their community, speakers said that Islam stands for peace.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, November 26, 2003 				 Ruptured House sets date for Georgia polls
				 	 Georgias acting President Nino Burdzhanadze. (AFP)																								Tbilisi, Nov. 25 (Reuters): Georgias new leaders scored an early success today by getting a fractious parliament to set a January 4 date for fresh presidential polls, but warned the country faced economic crisis without western aid.																								Deputies voted 155 to zero in favour of the date, turning out in force to answer an appeal by Mikhail Saakashvili, leader of the resistance to ousted President Eduard Shevardnadze, who warned a boycott could destabilise the volatile Caucasus state. Each of us carries a huge responsibility but I hope we will begin a new era of our countrys development, interim President Nino Burdzhanadze told the session before the vote was taken.																								The Supreme Court, meanwhile, cleared the way for a separate new parliamentary election by quashing the results of most of this months disputed ballot. A new date for that must be set.																								Fixing a new date for a Presidential contest is a key step in ensuring stability in Georgia after three weeks of protests culminated in Shevardnadzes resignation on Sunday.																								Earlier, Georgias new leaders claimed a fresh scalp from among Shevardnadzes old allies  forcing the resignation of state minister Avtandil Dzhorbenadze. His departure had been on the cards since Burdzhanadze denounced him for Georgias economic plight and for staging the disputed poll that set off protests and Shevardnadzes demise.																								Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov, who helped mediate an end to the three-week standoff, said it was clear in Georgia and other ex-Soviet states there had been attempts to interfere into internal affairs by certain countries and separate states.																								Unfortunately, this is no exception. We face similar facts also in other cases, he said in Ukraine, without elaborating.																								Parliaments session took place as a separatist leader said he would meet the heads of two other like-minded regions of Georgia to form a common stance after Shevardnadzes downfall.																								The gathering in the Russian capital of officials from Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Adzhara was a reminder for Georgias new leaders of separatist passions pent up in the country. Burdzhanadze warned Georgia stood on the brink of economic collapse after the bloodless ousting of Shevardnadze and said drastic steps had to be taken to reverse the situation. She told officials in a televised broadcast the legacy of decline from his administration was even worse than we thought. The situation is very difficult. Yesterdays data shows that we are facing economic collapse, she said.																								She called for radical measures, but offered few details beyond urging state enterprises to work at full capacity. Her warning clearly prefaced fresh appeals to the West to help the ex-Soviet country where the average monthly income is about $40.																								We have to ask our foreign colleagues to help us in this situation, she said.																								The 11-year rule of Shevardnadze, praised in the West as Soviet foreign minister for helping end the Cold War, was marked by rising poverty, chronic corruption and separatist rebellions.																								Georgias new leaders, including Saakashvili, a US-educated lawyer tipped as a possible future President, face an uphill battle to right the country.

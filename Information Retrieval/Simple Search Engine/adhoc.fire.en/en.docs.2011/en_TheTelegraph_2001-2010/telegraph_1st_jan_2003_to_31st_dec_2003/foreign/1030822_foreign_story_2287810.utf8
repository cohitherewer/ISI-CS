The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, August 22, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Cadillac craving																																	Washington, Aug. 21 (AP): The Cadillac Escalade, a $55,000 sport utility vehicle, is the car most likely to be targeted by thieves in the US, according to a report today by a research group funded by auto insurers.																																	The report, which reviewed theft claims for 2000-2002 model year vehicles, found that five of the top 10 vehicles stolen or broken into are SUVs.																																	The Dodge Stratus, ranked second on the list, was the four-door car most likely to be targeted, according to the insurance institute for highway safety. The organisation compared insurance claims with the overall number of insured vehicles to get a percentage of likelihood that a vehicle will be targeted. 																													 																Elvis record																																	Oslo (Reuters): A Norwegian Elvis impersonator set a record on Wednesday by singing the Kings hits non-stop for a voice-wrecking 26 hours, four minutes and 40 seconds. This is just fantastic, I cant find words for it, a hoarse Kjell Henning Bjoernestad, 35, told NRK radio after his marathon. Dubbed Kjell Elvis, Bjoernestad had aimed to sing 100 of Elvis songs, ranging from Hound Dog to Jailhouse Rock over and over again for 30 hours to win a place in the Guinness Book of Records. But the performer, who once won an award as the Nordic regions best Elvis lookalike, gave up shortly after beating the previous record of 25 hours, 33 minutes and 30 seconds, set by Briton Gary Jay. 																													 																Last laugh																																	 Bangkok (AP): An ice-cream truck driver in Thailand died while laughing in his sleep, a newspaper reported. Damnoen Saen-Um, 52, laughed for about two minutes on Wednesday and then stopped breathing, The Nation said. The newspaper said Damnoens wife tried to wake him up but he kept laughing. An autopsy suggested that he might have had a heart attack. I have never seen a case like this. But it is possible a person could have heart seizure while laughing or crying too hard in their sleep, Dr. Somchai Chakrabhand, deputy director-general of the mental health department, told The Nation. 																													 																Love child																																	Williamsport (Pennsylvania) (AP): A New York gangster who smuggled his semen out of federal prison to impregnate his wife was sentenced to an additional 16 months in jail. Kevin Granato, a convicted hit man for the Colombo crime family, and his wife, Regina, pleaded guilty in May to charges they used a cryogenic sperm kit to sneak his sperm from Allenwood federal prison to a New York fertility clinic. 																													 																Panda pain																																	 Los Angeles (Reuters): A giant panda at the San Diego Zoo shows no sign of giving birth to the second of two cubs she was carrying nearly a day after the first cub was born, zoo officials said on Wednesday. This is not the normal course of events for the species, zoo veterinarian Don Lundberg said. We are simply letting nature take its course. Bai Yuns first cub was born on Tuesday. Zoo officials said it is common for twin panda births to occur up to 12 hours apart. But more than 24 hours later, the signs that Bai Yun was in active labour began to diminish, Lundberg said. Tests performed 10 days ago indicated that both cubs were alive, zoo officials said.

 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 This Christmas, beware of intexicated messages 
 BECKY BARROW				 	 A woman sends an SMS on her mobile phone in Singapore. (Reuters) London, Dec. 20: Text messages  sent drunkenly to former lovers and attractive bosses have  replaced kisses with colleagues at the photocopier as one  of the most dangerous side effects of the Christmas party  season.
 The phenomenon of sending text messages which you regret  the next morning was described yesterday as the condition  of being intexicated.
 Around 60 million text messages are sent every day in December,  of which 25 per cent are sent when the person has drunk  too much. 
 The research, published by Virgin Mobile, found that two  thirds of women who are struck down by the condition decide  to text a former lover which seems like a good idea only  after drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.
 An equal number of women send guilt texts to  their boyfriend or husband who are at home because they  feel bad that they are enjoying themselves at a party.
 Many are also sent to the wrong person when drunk, such  as Lucy Freebourne, 29, a public relations executive from  London.
 She sent a sexually explicit text message to her father  due to the similarity and close proximity of Dad  and Dan, the name of her boyfriend, on her mobile  phones address book.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

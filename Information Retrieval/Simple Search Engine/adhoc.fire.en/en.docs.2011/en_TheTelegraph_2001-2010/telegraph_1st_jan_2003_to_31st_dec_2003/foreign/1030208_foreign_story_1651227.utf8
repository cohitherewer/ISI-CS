 Saturday, February 08, 2003 				 Naomi takes privacy suit to top court
				 	 Naomi Campbell																								London, Feb. 7 (Reuters): British supermodel Naomi Campbell has taken a privacy battle to the UKs highest court in a bid to win back damages awarded against a tabloid newspaper which revealed her struggle against drugs.																								Last October, the appeal court stripped Campbell of 3,500 ($5,700), along with thousands of pounds in court costs, awarded to her after she sued the Daily Mirror for breaching her privacy by reporting, correctly, that she visited a drug clinic.																								Campbell is seeking to challenge this decision in the House of Lords, Britains most senior court.																								Today the three judges considering the appeal, headed by Lord Bingham, the countrys most senior law lord, said they had put their decision on hold to allow Mirror bosses a chance to object to the latest legal moves.																								Campbell was originally awarded damages after the High Court backed the 31-year-old models claims that the paper had breached her confidence, privacy and the Data Protection Act. But that verdict was then overturned by a three-judge appeals court panel which said the newspapers reporting was justifiable in the public interest.

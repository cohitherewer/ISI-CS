 Tuesday, September 02, 2003 				 Brosnan wins legal battle for website
				 	 Pierce Brosnan Geneva, Sept. 1 (Reuters):  James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan has won a legal battle to  claim the Internet website bearing his name, international  arbitrators ruled today.																								The Irish star brought the case against a company which was a front for the now infamous cybersquatter Jeff Burgar, who redirected piercebrosnan.com to a commercial web site. Burgar has been involved in several other disputes over celebrity websites and has lost cases against singer Celine Dion and Pamela Anderson.																								The World Intellectual Property Organisation said Burgars behaviour constitutes a pattern of conduct intended to capitalise on the goodwill associated with others fame for its own illegitimate purposes.																								It declared Burgar had used the domain name in bad faith. He has 10 days to appeal against the ruling, after which time the site will be transferred back to Brosnan.																								The United Nations copyright agency has dealt with 91 cases involving famous people and has ruled in favour of the celebrity on 77 occasions.

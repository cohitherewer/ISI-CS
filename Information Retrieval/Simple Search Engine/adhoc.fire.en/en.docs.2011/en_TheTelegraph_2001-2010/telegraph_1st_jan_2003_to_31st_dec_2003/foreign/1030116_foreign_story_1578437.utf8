Pam pact																																	 Los Angeles (AP): Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson have agreed to end their bitter custody battle over their two sons, a lawyer for the actress said. Lees lawyer, Lance Spiegel, did not immediately return calls for comment. Suzanne Harris, Andersons attorney, said on Tuesday that the couple signed an agreement and submitted it to the court, where it is expected to be signed by the Superior Court judge. Harris said Anderson, 35, now has the option of moving Brandon, 6, and Dylan, 4, to Michigan, the home state of her fiance, rap-rocker Kid Rock.																													 																Blues band																																	 New York: Goodness gracious, its only a hobby. 																																	Dennis Quaid, who fronts a Hollywood rock-and-blues band called the Sharks, says he loves performing live  but dont look for any record releases from the quintet, reports the Newsday paper. Im a dad, said Quaid, who embodied rocker Jerry Lee Lewis in 1989s Great Balls of Fire. I dont want to get into the music business. Theres too much work. Quaid put together the Sharks two years ago, inspired by seeing friend Harry Dean Stanton play guitar in Los Angeles. The band  Quaid on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Jamie James on guitar, Tom Slik on bass, Ken Stange on keyboards and Tom Walsh on drums  performs a mixture of original music and rock classics. They perform around Los Angeles on an almost weekly basis. The Sharks have nabbed some big gigs  headlining both the Aladdin and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas  but Quaid is limiting his musical aspirations. We had another offer to perform in Vegas this New Years Eve, 																						but I decided to go to Montana and spend time with my son, instead, he said.

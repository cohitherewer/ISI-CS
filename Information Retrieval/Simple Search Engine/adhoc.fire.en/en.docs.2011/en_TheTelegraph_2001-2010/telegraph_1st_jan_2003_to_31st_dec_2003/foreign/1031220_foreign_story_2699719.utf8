 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Top US arms hunter to quit
 DAVID RENNIE 				 	 Former UN weapons inspector David Kay																								Washington, Dec. 19: The head of the US-led hunt for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction plans to resign early, it was reported yesterday.																								David Kay, the former UN weapons inspector placed in charge of the 1,400-strong Iraqi Survey Group, has had to watch in recent weeks as some of his linguists and intelligence experts were re-assigned to the fight against Iraqi insurgents.																								The senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Jane Harman, said: They took away a lot of his folks, some critical people. She added that Dr Kays departure would be a big loss. Kay has told the Bush administration that he intends leaving his post for family and personal reasons. One administration official said Kay could leave before February, when his next interim report is due.																								Intelligence officials confirmed yesterday that Kay was in Washington on holiday and to discuss what comes next with George Tenet, the CIA chief.																								Intelligence officials insist that the search for weapons continues, and remains a vital mission, but the loss of the experienced and committed head of the ISG is undoubtedly a blow. There is no suggestion that Kay has lost faith in his long-standing belief that Saddam Hussein was hiding WMDs.																								The mission to track the weapons has had a troubled history. In a preliminary report in October, Kay said he had only found evidence that Saddam was working to acquire chemical and biological weapons, was developing missile programmes and had hidden the bare bones of a nuclear research programme. 																								He said there was evidence of efforts to conceal banned research, and to fool UN inspectors led by Hans Blix. He asked for patience, saying it would take months to reach a definitive conclusion. 					 LOS ANGELES TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

				 	 Sean Connery																								Los Angeles, Oct. 30 (AFP): Superstar Sean Connery has agreed to an amicable resolution of a $17-million fraud lawsuit he brought against the producers of his movie Endgame, both sides said.																								The 73-year-old Scot actor and the original James Bond screen spy withdrew his suit against Mandalay Pictures and its chairman, Hollywood mogul Peter Guber, both sides announced yesterday. According to a joint statement, the settlement includes a dismissal of Connerys lawsuit, as well as Mandalays countersuit and withdrawal of all allegations of fraud.																								The actor sued a year ago, alleging that Mandalay fraudulently purported to be in a position to finance the action thriller which he had agreed to star in for a $17-million fee.																								He accused Mandalay of stringing him along for two years in an attempt to hold themselves out to the entertainment industry as a viable production company, and claimed that Guber cut off all communication with him as production was due to begin, leaving him in the dark.

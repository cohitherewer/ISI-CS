 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Gibb family questions treatment
																								Miami, Jan. 13 (Reuters): The family of singer Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees, who died after abdominal surgery at the age of 53, is questioning the hospitals treatment at the time of his death.																								Brother Barry Gibb, 55, told the BBC late yesterday the family would fight to discover the truth about Maurices death.																								The fact that they had to operate on Maurice during the shock of cardiac arrest, is very questionable, and we will pursue every factor, every element, every second of the timeline of the final hours of Maurices life, Barry Gibb told the BBC.																								We will pursue that relentlessly. That will be our quest from now on, he said.																								Authorities at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, where he was treated, could not be reached for comment.																								Gibb, whose harmonies with his twin, Robin, and older brother Barry helped create one of the best-selling groups of the rock n roll era, collapsed on Thursday at his Miami home after suffering intense stomach pain and was rushed to Mount Sinai Medical Center.																								He experienced cardiac arrest before his surgery on an intestinal blockage, the hospital said.

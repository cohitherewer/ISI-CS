 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Palestine apology
																								Ramallah, Dec. 23 (AFP): Palestinian official media sought today to smooth over the embarrassing assault on Egypts foreign minister Ahmed Maher at Jerusalems al-Aqsa mosque compound, offering profound apologies.																								The cowardly aggression against the foreign minister from our sister country Egypt represents an aggression against the Palestinian people and the al-Aqsa mosque, wrote Hafez al-Barghuthi, editor-in-chief of al-Hayat al-Jadida. Barghuthi, in an editorial headlined Sorry Egypt, praised Cairos role in the peace process and said he hoped it would continue to support our people, who are not ungrateful even if a small handful dare to take it out on their big brother.																								 Maher was taken to hospital yesterday after suffering breathing difficulties as crowds denounced him as a traitor and hurled shoes while he was rounding off a visit to Israel during which he met Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

																								Lohrasb (Iran), July 12 (AFP): Thousands of Iranians turned out to pay their last respects at the funeral of Siamese twins Laleh and Ladan Bijani here today. 																								The twins, joined at the head for the entire 29 years of their lives, died on the operating table in Singapore in a failed attempt to separate them. 																								They were buried in the native village of Lohrasb, where the massive turnout underlined how much the couple had captured the hearts of their compatriots and millions of others worldwide who had followed their plight on television. 																								The funeral cortege left from the mortuary in Firuzabad, 100 km south of Chiraz, and well-wishers lined the roadside all along the 10 km route leading to their native village. 																								People had come from miles around creating a huge bottleneck at the entrance to the village.

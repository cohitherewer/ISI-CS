The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, November 30, 2003 				 Bush moving too fast, says Hillary
																								Mubarak Air Base (Kuwait), Nov. 29 (Reuters): US Senator Hillary Clinton said today President George W. Bushs administration was moving too fast in a planned transfer of power to the Iraqis by July.																								Its going to take more time than has been allotted for the process to take hold, the New York Democrat said during a brief stopover to visit US troops in Kuwait. I dont think we should be setting artificial timelines as this is a very challenging undertaking and we need to work with our Iraqi counterparts and make sure that the steps that are being taken are going to work.																								Washingtons plan for handing power back to Iraqis has been criticised by the top cleric among Iraqs Shia majority for paying too little heed to Islam and including too little Iraqi involvement.

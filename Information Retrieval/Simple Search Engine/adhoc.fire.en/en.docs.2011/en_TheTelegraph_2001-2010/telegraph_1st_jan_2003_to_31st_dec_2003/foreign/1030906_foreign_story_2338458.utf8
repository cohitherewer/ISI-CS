 Saturday, September 06, 2003 				 Islamabad F-16 hunt
 Islamabad, Sept. 5 (Reuters):  Pakistan, worried by Indias plans to acquire a strategic  radar system from Israel, today said it is seeking second-hand  F-16 fighters from Belgium and will also request a similar  US radar system.																								Air Commodore Sarfraz Ahmed Khan, spokesperson for the Pakistan air force, said an Airborne Early Warning System would be on Pakistans shopping list when the US-Pakistani defence consultative group meets in Washington. Khan said Pakistan would also repeat its request for the supply of an initial 28 F-16 aircraft the US refused to deliver in the 1990s due to concerns about Islamabads nuclear programme.

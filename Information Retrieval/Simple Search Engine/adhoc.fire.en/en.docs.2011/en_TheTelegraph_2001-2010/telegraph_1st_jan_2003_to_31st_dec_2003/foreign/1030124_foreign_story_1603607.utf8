 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 Sophie Dahl covers up Sophie Dahl
																								London, Jan. 23: Sophie Dahl, who posed naked to advertise perfume, has been signed as the face of Pringle, the traditional sweater brand beloved of golfers.																								Yves Saint Laurents poster for Opium was the most complained about advertisement in the past five years. But as befits a 188-year-old company famed for inventing the twinset, the model is dressed more modestly for her latest campaign. A Pringle spokesman said: She exudes British glamour from every pore. The 1950s-style adverts will be released in March.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

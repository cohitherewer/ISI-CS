 Sunday, April 20, 2003 				 Bush kin to tell-all in new book
																								Washington, April 19: The fiercely private Bush dynasty is facing its first tell-all book, written by the estranged wife of Neil Bush, the Presidents brother.																								Sharon Bush, a former teacher from New Hampshire, has met Manhattan publishers to tout a book that promises to show the dark side of the presidential family. She accuses it of being a calculating political machine, dominated by Barbara Bush, the former First Lady. Sharon Bush, who is embroiled in bitter divorce proceedings after 23 years of marriage, has also discussed a possible collaboration with Kitty Kelley, the notoriously acidic celebrity biographer, her spokesman told the New York Observer.																								The Bush code of loyalty is legend, with even distant members of the dynasty refusing to discuss any details of a family that has produced two Presidents, as well as the present governor of Florida, Jeb Bush.																								Billy Bush, a television host and presidential cousin, has included a clause in his employment contract forbidding any mention of his connections with the first family. The White House enforces the Bush familys privacy with great rigour, berating reporters for such infractions as disclosing the secret service codenames of the Presidents twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara.																								Neil Bush, a businessman, was fined several million dollars for his role in the 1980s collapse of a savings and loan institution. The couple have three children: Lauren, who is a model, Pierce and Ashley.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

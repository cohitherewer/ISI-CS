 Friday, July 11, 2003 				 Separated in death, Bijani twins arrive home
																								Tehran, July 10 (Reuters): Iranian twins Ladan and Laleh Bijani, joined in life, arrived in their homeland in two coffins today, achieving their dream of separation only in death.																								Only around a dozen close friends and neither their natural nor adoptive parents were at the airport to meet the coffins, which were draped in a traditional Iranian nomadic red-patterned cloth with a bouquet of white flowers tied with a black ribbon.																								They were tired of being joined together, said Nooshin Mehran, who described herself as the twins best friend. Now they are dead their biggest wish has come true. I dont regret not trying to change their minds.																								A cleric said prayers over the coffins. A police band played a funeral march as the bodies were taken by ambulance to the coroners office for a death certificate before being flown to southern Iran for burial. The funeral will take place tomorrow in the village where the sisters were born near the city of Shiraz.																								We didnt want to welcome them home this way, said Maryam Nofarsti with her twin sister Leyla, childhood friends of Laleh and Ladan. It was very difficult for them, thats why they chose between life and death.

 Thursday, September 04, 2003 				 Blair to curb spin to wrest trust
																								London, Sept. 3 (Reuters): Days after the resignation of his powerful media aide Alastair Campbell, British Prime Minister Tony Blair today said he would curb the role of his spin doctors in an effort to win back voters trust.																								Blair, under fire for his perceived obsession with media manipulation, also suggested televised, US-style media briefings to tackle a breakdown in trust between the public, politicians and journalists.																								Blair faces a crisis of credibility and the toughest test of his six-year rule over the suicide of a British weapons expert who cut his wrist after being exposed as the source of a report saying Blairs government hyped the case for war with Iraq. 																								A poll published last week showed public trust in Blair plunging  just 22 per cent of those asked said they thought the government had been honest and trustworthy.

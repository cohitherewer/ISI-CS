 Monday, September 01, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Stella weds in secret																																	Isle of Bute (Scotland), Aug. 31 (Reuters): British fashion designer Stella McCartney has married her publisher boyfriend in a private ceremony in the remote Scottish countryside, newspapers reported. The 31-year-old daughter of former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney drew a veil of secrecy over yesterdays celebrity-packed service, attended by Madonna, Liv Tyler and Kate Moss.																																	Papers said she married Alasdhair Willis, also 31, in a secluded chapel at Mount Stuart, a Gothic mansion on the Island of Bute in western Scotland. But there was no official confirmation from the couple for the worlds media who had camped outside the grounds all week for a glimpse of the celebrity wedding of the year. The tabloid Mail on Sunday said the bride arrived in a horse-drawn carriage, wearing a dress she designed with Tom Ford, her boss at the Gucci fashion group.																																	The isolated Scottish location is loaded with memories for the McCartneys. Bute is a short helicopter ride from the Mull of Kintyre, the inspiration for the Beatles song The Long and Winding Road, and the Wings hit Mull of Kintyre. Stellas mother Linda, who died from cancer in 1998, described Kintyre as her favourite place and the family had a house there.																													 																Mummy mess Cairo (Reuters): The mummy a British  Egyptologist says could be the ancient Egyptian queen Nefertiti,  renowned for her beauty, is much more likely to be a man,  Egypts antiquities chief Zahi Hawass said on Saturday.  Nefertiti, wife and co-ruler with the pharaoh Akhenaten  and stepmother of legendary boy King Tutankhamun, has long  been considered one of the most powerful women of ancient  Egypt. Joann Fletcher, a mummification specialist from the  University of York in England, said in June there was a  strong possibility her team had unearthed Nefertiti from  a tomb in Egypts Valley of the Kings in Luxor. But secretary-general  of Egypts Supreme Council of Antiquities, Hawass, expressed  doubts about the find and said there were questions over  the gender of the mummy.

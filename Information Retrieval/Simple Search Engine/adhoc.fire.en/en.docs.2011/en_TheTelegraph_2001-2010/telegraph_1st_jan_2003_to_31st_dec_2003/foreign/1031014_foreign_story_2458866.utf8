																								Washington, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Sperm in men who smoke marijuana regularly lose stamina and burn out which may prevent conception, said a study released today.																								The study by the State University of New York in Buffalo, New York, is the first to focus on the swimming patterns of sperm in men who smoke marijuana, the authors say. 																								The sperm from marijuana smokers were moving too fast too early, said Lani Burkman, lead author of the study, in a statement.																								To attach itself to the egg, the sperm has to swim like mad  thats hyper activation  and they have to be vigorous at the right time, Burkman said. Smoking marijuana messes up the natural regulatory system.

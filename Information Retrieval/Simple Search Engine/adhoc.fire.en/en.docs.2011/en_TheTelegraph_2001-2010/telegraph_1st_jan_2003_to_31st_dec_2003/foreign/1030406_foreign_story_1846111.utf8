 Sunday, April 06, 2003 				 McCartney puts credits record straight
																								London, April 5 (Reuters): Former Beatle Paul McCartney hit back at critics today, saying a decision to reverse the traditional Lennon-McCartney songwriting credit on his new album was not a slur on his band mate but a chance to put the record straight.																								In an interview with Britains Daily Mirror newspaper, 60-year-old McCartney  currently on the European leg of his Back in the World tour  said he was simply letting people know that the songs I sing today are my own.																								And he added that he had no doubts that John Lennon  killed by a lone gunman in New York 23 years ago  would understand the decision. 																								The bottom line is I know what I wrote and so did John, McCartney told the paper. Im doing nothing wrong. There was an agreement between (us) that if we ever wanted to, we could switch the Lennon and McCartney thing.																								And he dismissed claims from die-hard Beatles fans that he was tarnishing the legend of Lennon. 																								It has come out like Im trying to dance on Johns grave which is a pity because I am his biggest fan, he said.																								Im the guy who knew him best... Id hate people to think Im trying to do him down.																								McCartney has been performing 22 Beatles songs at each of his world tour dates.

 Wednesday, June 18, 2003 				 Bill Clinton lends the famous hand
				 	 Hillary and Bill Clinton at a New York restaurant on Monday (AP).  New York, June 17 (AP):  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was so mobbed at her New  York book party that it seemed shed never get around to  signing all the books. Luckily, husband Bill was helping.																								The former President, who until now has let his wife enjoy the spotlight as her memoir, Living History, sells like hot cakes, smiled and signed away, his own autograph on the volume apparently in as much demand as hers.																								Publisher Simon amp; Schuster, which threw the latest Manhattan bash yesterday, declared Living History to be the top-selling adult non-fiction book ever, based on first-week sales of 600,000 copies. The party at the Four Seasons restaurant drew the elite in the worlds of television, publishing and politics.																								Among those on hand to sample the hors doeuvres: TV personalities Walter Cronkite, Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose; former White House aide and now TV host George Stephanopoulos; actor Chevy Chase; and singer Judy Collins.																								The former President introduced his wife with the observation that it was interesting enough being married to a US senator. Its even more interesting being married to a best-selling author.																								People keep asking to see my hands, he quipped  a reference to his wifes praise of his hands in the book.

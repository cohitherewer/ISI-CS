 Monday, August 11, 2003 				 Israel hits back at Hizbollah shell strike
																								Beirut, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Israeli warplanes and troops blasted the outskirts of a south Lebanon village today after Hizbollah guerrillas fired an anti-aircraft shell that killed an Israeli, witnesses and Hizbollah television said.																								Zionist planes attacked the outskirts of the village of Tair Harfa in south Lebanon, al-Manar television said in a news flash. The station later reported a second strike in the nearby Tellat al-Kharba area.																								Witnesses said they heard the sound of several explosions in the area and that Israeli troops had also shot five shells from a disputed border zone into the outskirts of the southern Kfar Shouba town, prompting residents to flee their homes in fear.																								They said Israeli planes and helicopters had been flying over south Lebanon all morning and continued their overflights into Lebanese territory after the air strikes.																								The death was the first in northern Israel by Hizbollah fire since Israeli forces withdrew from south Lebanon in 2000 after a 22-year occupation.																								Hizbollah was the driving force in helping push Israel from south Lebanon. The two sides have clashed sporadically since the pullout, and Hizbollah often fires anti-aircraft rounds at Israeli jets over Lebanon.																								A spokesperson for the UN peacekeeping force UNIFIL said he was investigating the exchange of fire from both sides of the border.

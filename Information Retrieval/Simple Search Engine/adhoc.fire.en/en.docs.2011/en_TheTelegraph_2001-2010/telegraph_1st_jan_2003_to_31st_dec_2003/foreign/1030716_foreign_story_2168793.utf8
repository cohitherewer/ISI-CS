Comic Arnie Los Angeles, July 15 (AFP): US movie icon and would-be politician Arnold Schwarzenegger looks poised to take on a new comic screen role even as he mulls whether to run for office as governor of California, reports said. Daily Variety said yesterday the Terminator star, who is currently promoting his latest action blockbuster Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines in Europe, was in talks to star in a family comedy dubbed Big Sir.

Corrected maps that include all of Canadas 10 provinces and three territories will be sent out in the autumn/winter issue, the government spokeswoman said.Guns on gum Dublin (AFP): Ireland is planning to bring in clean-up taxes on chewing gum, polystyrene fast food wrappers and bank cash machine receipts that have all become major environmental problems, the government announced on Tuesday.

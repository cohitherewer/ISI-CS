 Tuesday, November 18, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Fresh Tyler																																	 Paris, Nov. 17 (AFP): US actress Liv Tyler, already the face of Givenchys fragrance Very Irresistible, will star in a new ad campaign for the French houses ready-to-wear and accessories lines, the company announced today.																																	Photographer Mario Testino shot the advertisements featuring Tyler in Givenchys spring-summer 2004 collection created by Welsh designer Julien Macdonald, the fashion house said.																																	Givenchy said it chose the 26-year-old Tyler who stars in the upcoming Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King because she represents elegance, freshness and audacity.																																	Tylers star turn for Givenchy is the latest in a series of fashion advertisements featuring A-list performers from Hollywood and the music industry. 																																	Jennifer Lopez modelled for Louis Vuitton, Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett posed for Donna Karan, pop diva Christina Aguilera is the new face of Versace and Oscar-winning actor Adrien Brody appears in ads for Ermenegildo Zegna. 																																	Another Oscar winner, Australian actress Nicole Kidman, will be the new face of the iconic fragrance Chanel No. 5 in an advertising campaign created by her Moulin Rouge director Baz Luhrmann, due to be launched in autumn 2004.																													 																Panda pair																																	Tokyo (Reuters): A Mexican female panda is set for a romantic rendezvous in Tokyo next month with the male panda whose three past attempts to impregnate female pandas in Mexico ended in failure. Keepers at Tokyos Ueno Zoo said they have high hopes for the meeting between 16-year-old Shuan Shuan, from the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City, and Ling Ling, the Ueno Zoos last living panda. It is the first time a female panda has come to Tokyo, although 18-year-old Ling Ling has made three trips to Mexico in a quest for the patter of tiny paws. Beijing-born Ling Lings sperm was used to artificially inseminate Shuan Shuan and another female in Mexico City earlier this year on his third visit, but neither that nor more conventional attempts at reproduction bore fruit. 																													 																Body blow																																	 Budapest (Reuters): Police on Friday removed the corpse of a man believed to have hanged himself at least a year ago after builders and students at Budapests University of Arts had initially mistaken it for a modern sculpture. The body hung for a whole day in a garden building that had been re-opened for repairs before onlookers realised what it was and called the police.

 HUGH DAVIES				 	 Scott Stapp: Fans fury																								London, April 25: A rock band is being sued for 1.3 million damages by fans unhappy with the concert performance of its lead singer.																								Creed, the Christian rock trio, faced a potentially disastrous law suit yesterday, with the damages being demanded by disgruntled members of the audience after a concert in which lead singer Scott Stapp allegedly was unable to complete even one of his hit songs.																								The legal move, claiming the 29-year-old Stapp appeared either medicated or drunk, is unprecedented in rock music where critics have always been left to hold groups accountable for poor shows. 																								Started by four fans, who want their money back, the suit at a court in Illinois is expected to snowball into a class action to cover the 18,500 audience, including viewers in 48 boxes, at a stadium in the state in December. 																								Creed is alleged to have failed to substantially perform on the stage. Court papers claim Stapp was so intoxicated or medicated that he was unable to sing a single Creed song.																								He was said to have left the stage on several occasions during songs for long periods of time, rolled around the floors in apparent pain or distress and at one point appeared to pass out.																								Jeff Hanson, Creeds manager, was said in the suit to have issued a statement saying the group was sorry for its performance.																								The message to fans said: The band has heard you are unhappy with the quality of the recent Creed show in Chicago. We apologise if you didnt feel that the show was up to the very high standards set by our previous shows in Chicago.																								For now, we hope that you can take some solace in the fact that you definitely experienced the most unique of all Creed shows and may have become part of rock n roll history.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

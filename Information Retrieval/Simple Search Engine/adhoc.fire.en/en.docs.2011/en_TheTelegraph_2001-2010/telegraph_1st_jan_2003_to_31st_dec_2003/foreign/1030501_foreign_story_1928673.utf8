 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 New W. Asia peace plan
																								Jerusalem, April 30 (Reuters): The US ambassador to Israel presented today a new plan for West Asia peacemaking to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, to be followed by its delivery to Palestinian leaders, a diplomatic source said.																								The release of the road map for an end to Israeli-Palestinian violence and a Palestinian state by 2005 was made possible after a new Palestinian Cabinet led by reformist Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas was sworn in on today. The plan is the most significant effort to end the bloodshed since Israels army reoccupied most of the Palestinian cities in the West Bank last summer following a wave of suicide bombings.

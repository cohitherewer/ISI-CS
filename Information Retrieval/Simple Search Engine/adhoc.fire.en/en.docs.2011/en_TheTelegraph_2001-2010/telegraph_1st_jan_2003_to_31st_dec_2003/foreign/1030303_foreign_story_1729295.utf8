 Monday, March 03, 2003 				 Royal charity under cloud
				 	 Prince Charles																								London, March 2 (AP): Royal officials today said they would investigate reports that Prince Charles met with and accepted money from a Turkish media mogul who is facing serious fraud charges in the US.																								The Sunday Times and The Mail reported that Cem Uzan, who is accused of swindling mobile phone giants Motorola and Nokia out of $2.8 billion, met Charles on three occasions  including a June 2000 dinner hosted by Charles and his companion, Camilla Parker Bowles  after pledging gifts to the Princes foundation.																								Uzan made donations of 400,000 to the charity from October 2000 in the hope of meeting members of Britains business and social elite, the paper said, describing the affair as a cash-for-access row.																								A spokeswoman for Charles office at St. James Palace said the Princes private secretary, Sir Michael Peat, would look into evidence of wrongdoing. 																								Uzan, 42, is one of Turkeys most controversial businessmen. The Uzan family holds a controlling stake in the Istanbul-based Telekomunikasyon Hizmetlei, or Telsim Mobil, one of Turkeys largest telecom companies, and owns newspapers, television and radio stations. Uzan also heads a political party, the Youth Party.																								Peat is currently investigating reports of palace wrongdoing, including claims the royals passed expensive but unwanted presents to their servants or tried to sell them for cash.

(AP)																								Bute Island (Scotland), Aug. 30: Either the rumours that Stella McCartneys wedding will be held this weekend in Scotland have been spot on, or a whole galaxy of stars have just received the same wrong invitation.																								Madonna, Kate Moss and Liv Tyler were among the rock stars, supermodels and Hollywood sensations who arrived by ferry on a Scottish island yesterday, where dozens of paparazzi have camped to wait for the 31-year-old fashion designer to tie the knot.																								The daughter of former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney is due to marry her publisher boyfriend Alasdhair Willis, also 31. The precise time and place have been a closely guarded secret, but the word on the street is that it will be this weekend, somewhere in the western Scottish countryside immortalised in song by her father. Fresh from her show-stopping stage smooch with Britney Spears at the MTV video awards, Madonna drove off the ferry onto Bute Island in a black Range Rover. But as the vehicle sped away, she was hidden behind blacked-out windows with filmmaker husband Guy Ritchie. Reporters spotted supermodel Kate Moss, Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde and Coldplay star Chris Martin arriving by coach. Actress Liv Tyler arrived earlier.																								The celebrities drove off in the direction of Mount Stuart, a red Victorian Gothic stone mansion with a private chapel, where journalists are betting the wedding  or at least the reception  will take place.																								Some have speculated the service may take place in the Mull of Kintyre. That remote area, a short helicopter flight from Bute Island, was the title of one of Sir Pauls songs and a favourite place of Stellas late mother Linda.																								Sir Paul, 61, and his wife, Heather Mills-McCartney, 34, arrived in London from New York on Wednesday and flew to the island by helicopter yesterday. In the islands slightly down-at-heel resort of Rothesay the best hotels were booked months in advance. Forty security guards hired for the event were posted at every road, footpath and gate leading into the grounds					 REUTERS AND DAILY TELEGRAPH

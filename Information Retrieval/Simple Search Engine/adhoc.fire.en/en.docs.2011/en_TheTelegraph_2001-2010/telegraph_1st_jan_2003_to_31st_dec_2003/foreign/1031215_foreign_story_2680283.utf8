 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Saddam street-smart, but Osama smarter
				 	 Saddam Hussein 																								Baghdad, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Saddam Husseins capture ends a US hunt for the man who ruled the oil state with an iron fist and launched two regional wars before being ousted by US-led forces in April.																								US forces found Saddam, dirty and sporting a greying beard and hiding in a cellar yesterday near his hometown of Tikrit. 																								Until then he had been as elusive as al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Omar.																								The US launched the Iraq war with a March 20 air raid intended to kill Saddam, 66, and decapitate the Baathist state he had forged in blood, iron and oil money.																								But he escaped and disappeared from public view after US forces stormed into Baghdad on April 9. 																								From hiding, he kept up a flow of defiant taped messages, aired by Arab media, urging Iraqis to fight US-led occupation forces.																								One passionate Saddam message surfaced after his sons Uday and Qusay were killed by US forces on July 22.																								The US justified its war by saying Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and had defied UN Security Council resolutions ordering him to disarm after his defeat in the 1991 Gulf war. Washington said he sponsored global terrorism.																								Troops occupying Iraq have yet to prove those charges, but many of the brutalities of his rule have been exposed, such as mass graves holding thousands of his murdered foes, especially rebellious Kurds and Shias.																								After using his skills as a street fighter and conspirator to get his Baath party into power in a 1968 coup, Saddam built a terrifying grip on Iraq despite wars, uprisings, coup plots and assassination attempts.																								In pursuit of regional dominance, he launched two disastrous invasions. In 1980, he attacked Iran, setting off an eight-year war that took a vast human and financial toll. 																								A decade later his troops occupied Kuwait, only to be expelled after seven months by a US-led coalition in 1991.																								He was eventually demonised by Washington, even though the US, along with the former Soviet Union and several European nations, had armed and supported Saddam in the 1980s as a bulwark against the Islamic revolution in Iran. 																								In those days, Western governments failed to penalise Saddam for his crimes against Iraqis, such as his brutal suppression of the Kurds, including the 1988 poison gas attack on Halabja.																								Once a hero to some Arabs for his defiance of the US and Israel, Saddam disappointed his admirers by failing to mount a serious defence of Baghdad in the war this year.																								His vaunted military proved to be a paper tiger in the face of overwhelming US military might and, despite concerns by US commanders, he used no chemical arms against the invaders.																								For some years, US policy had focused on containing Saddam but after the September 11, 2001, suicide hijack attacks on US cities, President George W. Bush and his advisers chose Baghdad as the next target after Afghanistan in their war on terror.																								In their perspective, Saddams removal would eliminate a threat and allow freedom, democracy and open markets to flourish in Iraq, with effects that would reshape all of West Asia.																								Saddam was born on April 28, 1937, in the village of al-Awja, near the poor and violent town of Tikrit, 150 km north of Baghdad.																								Known to admire former Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, he was no ideologue, but readily appealed to Arab nationalism, Islam or Iraqi patriotism to cement his leadership.																								When Saddam ignored a US-British deadline for him and his family to leave Iraq this year, the die was cast for an invasion that ended his rule  but has yet to resolve its bitter legacy.

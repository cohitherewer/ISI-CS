Fish freaks Francisco (Reuters): Two  students at the University of California at Santa Cruz are  facing expulsion and up to a year in prison after stealing  an 18-inch koi fish from a campus pond, a university spokesperson  said on Saturday. Elizabeth Irwin said Matthew Cox and Casey  Loop had been charged with theft and malicious mischief  after confessing to taking the koi  Midas, also known as  Goldie  in the early hours of May 20. The fate of the fish  was not known but Irwin said it was rumoured to have been  cooked and eaten as a student prank. In general the campus  has felt a lot of disgust, she said. Cox and Loop paid  several hundred dollars for a fish to replace Midas, believed  to have been dragged out of the pond with a rake. At the  time of the theft, the fraternity was being filmed for an  MTV reality show on campus life.

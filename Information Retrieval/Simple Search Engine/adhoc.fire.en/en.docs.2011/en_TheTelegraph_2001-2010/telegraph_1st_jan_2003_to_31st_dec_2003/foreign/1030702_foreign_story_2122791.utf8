																								London, July 1: An armed robber serving a six-year sentence has confessed to three other crimes so he can stay longer and complete a catering course.																								Gary Cowan, a career criminal with 184 previous convictions for theft, burglary and shoplifting, went back before a judge, seeking to have his jail time extended in order to get qualifications to run his fathers restaurant in Scotland.																								Cowan, 35, even took police officers to the scenes of two armed robberies and a burglary in Cambridge so they had evidence for the court. Roger Wakeham, his lawyer, told Cambridge Crown Court: He believes in prison he will receive the training to conduct the business. His wish was granted with Judge Isobel Plumstead jailing him for a further three years, plenty of time to become a restaurateur.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Saturday, September 06, 2003 				 Zeta-Jones not on the prowl
				 	 Catherine Zeta-Jones Venice, Sept. 5 (Reuters):  Catherine Zeta-Jones may make a marvellous husband hunter  in the new screwball comedy Intolerable Cruelty,  but the dark-haired actress says its not a job she would  warm to in real life.																								I dont want to be a serial divorcee. I dont want that job, she said in Venice. In Intolerable Cruelty, Zeta-Jones portrays Marylin, a Beverly Hills socialite on the prowl for a rich spouse while George Clooney is the high-powered divorce attorney who has thwarted her. Im not getting divorced, never, never, said Zeta-Jones, who is married to Michael Douglas.

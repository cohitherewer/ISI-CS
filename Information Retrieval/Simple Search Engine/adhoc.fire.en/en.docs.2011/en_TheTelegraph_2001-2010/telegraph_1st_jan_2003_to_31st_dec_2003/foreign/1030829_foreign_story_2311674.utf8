 Friday, August 29, 2003 				 Fired worker shoots six in Chicago
																								Chicago, Aug. 28 (Reuters): A fired worker hunted down and shot to death six employees of an auto parts supply warehouse yesterday, then refused to surrender and was killed by police, authorities said.																								From the scene, it appears he went throughout the supply warehouse shooting them, acting Chicago police superintendent Philip Cline said.They all suffered fatal gunshot wounds.																								The gunman, identified by authorities as 36-year-old Salvador Tapia, had been fired six months ago for poor performance at Windy City Core Supply Inc.																								When officers arrived yesterday morning in answer to a call of shots fired, an employee with his hands tied behind his back, who had escaped, told them Tapia was inside and had shot several employees. Another worker who was caught in rush hour traffic also escaped the carnage.																								Tapia may have arrived before some employees, then fired at arriving officers in two separate confrontations outside.

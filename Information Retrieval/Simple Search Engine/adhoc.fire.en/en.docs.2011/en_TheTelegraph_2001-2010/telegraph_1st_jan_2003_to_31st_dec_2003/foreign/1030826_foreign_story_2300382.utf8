Hollywood royalty like Nicole Kidman, Sean Penn, Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones were set to tread the red carpet that runs from the five-star Excelsior hotel on the shores of the Lido to its traditional Art Deco cinema.																																	Twenty feature films will vie for the coveted Golden Lion top prize to be awarded on September 6 and another 18 will face off in the more experimental upstream section. A total of more than 140 movies, many of them world premieres, will be screened.																																	Never before has the festival received so many film offers to evaluate, Moritz de Hadeln, director of the Venice competition for the second year running, said of the line-up.																						The show will kick off with Woody Allens new comedy Anything Else.																																	The Manhattan-set film, starring Christina Ricci and Jason Biggs, has been kept under wraps but according to media reports Allen hands over his traditional leading man role to Biggs  who is better known as the star of teen flick American Pie. 																													 																Melody men Rabat (Reuters): An orchestra in which  young Israeli and Palestinian musicians play side-by-side  gave a concert in the Moroccan capital on Sunday, its first  performance in an Arab country. Security was tight as Moroccan  government ministers, members of the diplomatic community  and a sprinkling of tourists came to hear the orchestra,  which is led by conductor Daniel Barenboim, an Argentine-born  Israeli citizen. Most of the capitals population was oblivious  of the event. A 32-year-old teacher, asking to be named  only as Driss, said he had heard about the concert on the  television news.																													 																Picky panda 																																	Tokyo (Reuters): Japans ageing stud panda has failed in his latest attempt to impregnate two female pandas in Mexico, but zoo keepers are pinning their hopes on a romantic rendezvous in Tokyo later this year. Beijing-born Ling Lings sperm was used to artificially inseminate two female pandas during his third visit to Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City earlier this year, after their efforts at reproduction the conventional way bore no fruit. But neither 15-year-old Xin Xin nor 12-year-old Shuan Shuan are expecting the patter of tiny paws, Tokyos Ueno Zoo said in a statement on Monday. One of the two lady bears will be invited to Tokyo to get intimate with Ling Ling later in the year.

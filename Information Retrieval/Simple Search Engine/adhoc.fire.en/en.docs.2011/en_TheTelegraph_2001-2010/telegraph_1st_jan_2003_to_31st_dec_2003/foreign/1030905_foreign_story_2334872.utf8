 Friday, September 05, 2003 				 Baywatch blonde at fashion fest
 HILARY ALEXANDER AND NICOLA WOOLCOCK		 Pamela AndersonLondon, Sept. 4: Pamela Anderson, the busty actress, has been chosen to host one of Britains most prestigious fashion events of the year.																								The Baywatch blonde is a controversial choice for presenting the Lycra British Style Awards 2003 in London later this month. She seemingly has only two rules of dress  as little and as loud as possible. Never subtle, and consistently eyecatching, her wardrobe is based on a staple of rubber, lycra and skin-tight denim. She normally exposes as much of her considerable cleavage as possible. 																								Classics include the fluorescent-pink dress she wore to a party thrown by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals two years ago. Formed from a tiny skirt and straining bandeau top, held together by pieces of string, it resembled two crocheted handkerchiefs.																								At last years MTV Europe music awards in Barcelona, her outfit was a skin-tight, see-through, split-to-the-thigh dress. She later appeared at the same event, bursting out of a mostly-unbuttoned peasant blouse and low-cut jeans.																								Earlier this year she posed in a cabbage-leaf bikini in an advertisement for vegetarianism.																								It is fortunate perhaps that the gala evening in London on September 25 is being sponsored by Lycra. Its dual powers of support and elasticity will definitely be required. The event, known as the fashion Oscars, will be the climax of London Fashion Week for Spring/ Summer 2004.																								This year the awards ceremony has been extended to include an award for the Fashion Photographer of the Year as well as awards for the most stylish men and women in the worlds of television, film, music and sport.																								But the key prize is the Designer of the Year, whose previous winners include John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Hussein Chalayan. One of the hot favourites is Roland Mouret, whose customers include Cate Blanchett and Kylie Minogue. He is nominated for three awards  British designer of the year, glamour designer of the year and new generation designer of the year. 																								Among award presenters will be Renee Zellweger, the actress.																								Andersons appearance was approved by the British Fashion Council, whose chief executive, John Wilson, said: Pamela is an internationally-recognised personality with experience of hosting live shows. We believe she is well placed to promote this event. One of the conditions of her appearance  is that she wears British fashion. Speculation is rife as  to which of Londons design superstars will take on the  style challenge of turning the Hollywood super bust  into a style icon for the night.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

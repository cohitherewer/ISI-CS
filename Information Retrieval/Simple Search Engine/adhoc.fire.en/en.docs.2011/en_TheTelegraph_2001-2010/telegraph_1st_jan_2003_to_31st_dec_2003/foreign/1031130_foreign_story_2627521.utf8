																								London, Nov 29 (Reuters): British police quizzed a suspected would-be suicide bomber for a third day today and searched houses in central and western England as part of a series of anti-terrorism operations.																								Home secretary David Blunkett came under pressure for linking the arrested man to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network  even though the suspect has not been charged with any offence. One of the countrys leading lawyers described Blunketts comments as very regrettable and said they could wreck any subsequent trial.																								The suspect, a 24-year-old British Muslim who has not been identified by the police though he has been identified in several newspapers, was being questioned at a high security police station in London.

 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Suicide blast shatters West Asia calm
																								Petah Tikva (Israel)/Gaza, Dec. 25 (Reuters): A Palestinian suicide bomber killed three people at a bus stop near Tel Aviv today minutes after Israeli helicopters killed a top Islamic militant and at least four people in Gaza.																								The attacks shattered well over two months of relative calm that had spurred efforts to revive talks between Israelis and Palestinians on a US-led plan for ending more than three years of conflict. The militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility.																								This is the first operation in a series of retaliations. We swear to make an earthquake in the Zionist entity, a PFLP statement said, referring to a deadly Israeli raid on the West Bank city of Nablus last week.																								Israels police chief said the bomber killed three other people and wounded 16 in the blast at the bus stop near Petah Tikva, on a highway leading out of Israels coastal metropolis of Tel Aviv. 																								A suicide bomber came to the bus stop and blew himself up, Shlomo Aharonishky said.																								Two bodies lay under blankets and blood spattered the ground. The explosion reduced the bus stop to a skeletal frame and brought rush hour traffic on one of Israels busiest roads to a stop.

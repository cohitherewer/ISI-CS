 A century of Hope passes away
 Los Angeles, July 28 (Reuters): Bob Hope, who combined perfect timing with classic, self-mocking one-line gags to become Americas most beloved comedian, died peacefully at age 100 with his family at his side.Meeting reporters just hours after the announcement of the death on Sunday night at his Los Angeles home, Hopes daughter Linda said: You could not have asked for a more peaceful ... death.

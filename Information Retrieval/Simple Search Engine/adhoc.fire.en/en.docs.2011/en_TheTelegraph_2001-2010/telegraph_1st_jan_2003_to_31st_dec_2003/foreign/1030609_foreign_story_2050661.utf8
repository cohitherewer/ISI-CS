																								Yangon, June 8 (Reuters): A UN envoy visiting Myanmar to secure the release of Aung Saan Suu Kyi could leave the country tomorrow without seeing the detained Nobel peace laureate, a source close to the envoy Razali Ismail said today.																								The situation is still very fluid, said a source close to Razali, who had earlier said the envoy will go back to Kuala Lumpur tomorrow. Razali was expected to leave Myanmar at 0600 GMT, he said. 																								The envoy had been due to meet junta chief Senior General Than Shwe tomorrow to find out if he would be allowed meet Suu Kyi, but official media, which normally announces his return to Yangon, had not done so by tonight.

Only a trickle of people showed up for yesterdays gnome return day at the police station in Saint-Die-des-Vosges, near the eastern city of Strasbourg, and only one person was reunited with their stolen gnome, police said.																																	Some 75 kidnapped gnomes were recovered in 2001 after a group called the Garden Gnome Liberation Front released them, leaving them on the steps of the Saint-Die-des-Vosges cathedral. Police are yet to reunite 43 of the gnomes with their owners.																																	 wanting to set them free, the Liberation Front has virtually imprisoned them, policeman Sylvain Brucker said, adding that the local prosecutor could decide to sell the kitsch garden ornaments in a police auction.

More than 600 people, some  dressed as hobbits, elves or magicians, had lined up outside  the Colosseum cinema for tickets to Lord of the Rings:  Return of the Ring. Some had set up tents outside the  cinema despite temperatures that dropped as low as freezing.  Now Im going to go home and take the longest bath  ever taken, 19-year-old Camilla Welde, who with three friends  got the first tickets that went on sale, told daily Aftenposten.

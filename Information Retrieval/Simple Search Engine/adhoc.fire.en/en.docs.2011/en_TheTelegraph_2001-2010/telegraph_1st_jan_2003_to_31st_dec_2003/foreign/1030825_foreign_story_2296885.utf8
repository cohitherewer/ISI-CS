 Monday, August 25, 2003 				 Pervez pacifies US
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Aug. 24: President Pervez Musharraf yesterday told a six-member US delegation that he would not allow any terrorist activity across Pakistans borders. 																								The delegation led by Republican Senator John McCain had asked Pakistan to do more to stop escalating cross-border terror attacks on Afghan troops and bases of US and allied forces. Afghanistan claims that the increasing number of attacks in that country are being carried out by remnants of the Taliban militia from their bases inside Pakistan.																								Musharraf told the Congressional delegates that he had asked Kabul to regularly share intelligence which would not only curb insurgency but also eliminate misunderstandings between the two countries. The President emphasised the need for timely exchange of intelligence between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) agency said.																								The US senators, who left today, appreciated Pakistans support for the international coalition against terror and offered cooperation in advancing the multi-year assistance programme for Pakistan announced by President George W. Bush during his meeting with Musharraf at Camp David in June. The $3-billion programme, due to begin next October, includes a billion-dollar loan write off and support for acquisition of defence hard-ware.																								Pakistan has so far received almost $850 million in return for providing logistic and intelligence support to US forces. It received five state-of-the-art helicopters last September for better surveillance of the more than 2,000-km Pak-Afghan border and is scheduled to get six C-130 military cargo aircraft. Pak prisoners																								Pakistan has asked the US to allow the Afghan government to send home over 600 Pakistanis arrested by the US-led coalition for fighting alongside the Taliban, its foreign minister said today. The transfer of Pakistani prisoners languishing in Afghan jails is a top priority for the government, Mian Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said.

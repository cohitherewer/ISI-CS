 Tuesday, May 27, 2003 				 Cheriegate returns to haunt Blairs
 															- Adviser  plans to quit no 10 				 	 Aide agony: Cherie Blair																								Downing Street rejected claims last night of a new court feud at No 10 over the role of Cherie Blairs lifestyle guru Carole Caplin after it emerged that an adviser to the Prime Ministers wife is to quit her job.																								Fiona Millar, girlfriend of Alastair Campbell, Prime Minister Tony Blairs director of communications, has told friends she intends to leave her post with the Prime Ministers wife later this year. Millar, who has worked for Cherie Blair since 1995, is known to have a strained relationship with Caplin who advises on health, fitness and style issues. Weekend reports suggested Millars decision to quit in the autumn was related to Blairs continuing friendship with Caplin.																								When the so-called Cheriegate scandal involving Caplins boyfriend, Peter Foster, erupted last year, there were even rumours of a fall-out between Millar and her boss. 																								Campbells relations with the Blairs were also placed under strain.																								Many Downing Street officials had hoped the Cheriegate episode  in which Cherie Blair received help from Foster, a convicted fraudster, when buying two flats in Bristol  would persuade her to end her links with Caplin. But the friendship remained strong. Ever since there has been talk of a power struggle between Millar and Caplin.A spokesperson rejected suggestions of tension in the Downing Street inner circle. Fiona Millar continues to do an important job for Cherie. She gets on extremely well with both Mr and Mrs Blair. Talk of a power struggle is an absurd joke.																								News of Millars departure follows an announcement last week by Godric Smith, the Prime Ministers official spokesman, that he will also go this year.																								Smith was left to deal with the media at the time of Cheriegate, a thankless task given the way Cherie Blair changed her story during the controversy. Smith however insists the scandal did not affect his decision to go.																								Millar, a former journalist, has said that she wants to spend more time with her three children and to return to writing. Some in Downing Street fear her departure will remove a restraining influence on Caplin and allow her to increase her influence over the Blairs.																								According to a recent poll conducted by the BBC, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair is the person Britons most wanted to be kicked out of the country after her links to a convicted conman were exposed in the recent Cheriegate affair. 																								In a tongue-in-cheek BBC survey drawing 15,000 votes, Cherie Blair topped the hall of shame with 31 per cent after damaging revelations last month about her property dealings with a convicted fraudster dominated headlines and embarrassed the government. Cherie Blair, a high profile barrister, saw her public support tumble in December as the media focused relentlessly on details of how Peter Foster helped her buy two flats in Bristol, southwest England. 																								The BBC radio current affairs programme Today, which carried out the poll, said in a statement: It has not been a good year-end for the Prime Ministers wife. In a parallel vote on who they wanted to see named honorary Britons, 51 per cent went for Myanmars pro-democracy opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released from 19 months of house arrest in May. 																								Former US President Bill Clinton came second with 18 per cent. Saddam Hussein  recently deposed in a US-led war with active British participation  came fifth on the list of favourites for British citizenship with 7 per cent of the vote. 																								On the deportation vote, Cherie Blair narrowly beat the London-based radical Muslim cleric Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri  accused by the US government of being linked to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network.

 Friday, March 07, 2003 				 Pak attack suspect tried to be martyr
																								Karachi, March 6 (Reuters) - A man accused of killing two Pakistani policemen outside the US consulate in Karachi last week was jobless, frustrated because of a broken engagement and hoped to become a martyr, authorities said today.																								Investigators believed the suspect, Zulfikar Ali, acted on his own, said deputy inspector general Fayyaz Leghari, the chief of the police investigation in Karachi. No links could be established with any militant group, Leghari said.																								Investigators said Ali was an unemployed Pakistani who was not a practising Muslim and was fond of reading crime stories.																								Police say Ali shot and wounded a policeman with a pistol on Friday before snatching the officers sub-machine gun and using it to open fire at a police post outside the consulate. Two policemen were killed and six people were wounded.																								Ali was arrested when he ran out of ammunition. 																								At the time, police said he could be an Afghan or be linked to a local group of Islamic radicals.																								He thought he would die in the attack, earning a name for himself, said another investigator, who asked not be named.																								He is a frustrated, angry man whose engagement had been broken off because of his inability to find work.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, October 22, 2003 				 Onassis gave gems, heiress cow
				 	 Worlds richest teenager Athina Roussel. (AFP)																								Rio de Janeiro, Oct. 21 (Reuters): The gift that the heiress of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis chose for her Brazilian boyfriend may not match in elegance the flawless gems her grandfather poured on Jacqueline Kennedy.																								But the price is quite high, for a cow.																								The worlds richest teenager, Athina Roussel, 18, paid $320,000 for a prize cow called Esperanca (Hope) at a cattle auction in Sao Paulo last night as a gift for her boyfriend  Olympic horseman Alvaro Affonso de Miranda Neto, known as Doda, auction organisers said today. Doda, 30, who was also at the auction, has a cattle farm.																								Local media said it was Roussels first major deal in Brazil although she had visited the country several times earlier to see Doda. Tabloid newspapers say she also underwent liposuction in Brazil, famous for the cult of body-beautiful, earlier this year.																								On her 18th birthday, Roussel inherited an estimated $2.7 billion worth of cash, property, jewels, and other assets from the Onassis estate, to become the worlds richest teenager.																								By comparison, a 40-carat diamond ring that was Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis engagement gift from Aristotle Onassis and valued at up to $600,000, sold for a whopping $2.6 million at an auction of the former US First Ladys belongings in 1996.

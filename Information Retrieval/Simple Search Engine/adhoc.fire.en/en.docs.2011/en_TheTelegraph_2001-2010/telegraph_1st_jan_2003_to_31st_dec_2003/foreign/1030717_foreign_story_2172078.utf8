The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, July 17, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Sex, lies amp; women																																	 New York, July 16 (AFP): Women are more likely to lie about their sex lives than men, according to a new US study involving a fake lie detector test.																																	The study by psychologists Terri Fisher at Ohio State University and Michele Alexander at Maine University offers a new solution to a paradox that has puzzled sex experts for decades.																																	 survey after survey, heterosexual men average more sexual partners than women  a statistically impossible situation.																																	Conventional wisdom had dictated that a mans desire to significantly exaggerate his sexual promiscuity was responsible for the anomaly, but the latest study  published in the Journal of Sex Research  suggests it is the women who are being economical with the truth. Women change their answers depending  on whether or not they believe their responses will remain  anonymous or they will be caught lying, the researchers  found. The number of sexual partners a woman reported nearly  doubled when women thought they were hooked up to a lie  detector machine.  Madonna ad  New York (AP): Madonna will be the new  face for Gaps fall multi-million dollar ad campaign. Gap  spokeswoman Claudia Hawkins would give few details on the  campaign, set to break on July 28, other than to say the  campaign also features rap star Missy Elliott. Over the  past several years, gap has enlisted a diverse group of  celebrities for its advertising, including actors Christina  Ricci, Anjelica Houston and Dennis Hopper. But experts believe  signing the pop icon is the biggest coup yet for the retailer,  which needs additional buzz to continue its turnaround.  This is the coolest idea. Madonna has kept her image fresh,  said Mike Toth, president and chief creative director for  Toth Brand Imaging, a brand and advertising company with  offices in New York and Concord, Massachusetts. 																													 																Meowlingual Tokyo (Reuters): Now that you can interpret  what your dog is saying, how about your cat? Takara Co,  a major Japanese toy maker, said on Wednesday it would launch  in November a device called the Meowlingual that can interpret  a cats meow, hoping to repeat its success with the Bowlingual,  a dog translation device. Takara said the Meowlingual, a  palm-sized electronic console that displays the interpreted  phrase on a screen, will be priced at 8,800 yen ($74.62).  Takara has sold about 300,000 dog translation devices in  Japan since last year and plans to launch an English-language  product in the US market in August.

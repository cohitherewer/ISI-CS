 Tuesday, July 15, 2003 				 Kabul in Pak blast denial
																								Kabul, July 14 (AFP): Afghanistan today denied that it had any links to the recent bombing of a mosque in Quetta, Pakistan in which 48 people were killed. 																								The denial was prompted by comments from Pakistani government leaders who said after the attack that they were concerned there are Indian consulates in Kandahar and Herat in Afghanistan. 																								The attack on the mosque in southwestern Pakistan occurred on July 4 and also injured 52 people. 																								Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali has said Pakistan could not overlook the fact that Indian missions were operating near the Pakistan border in Afghanistan and his interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat said Islamabad had conveyed its concern to Kabul over the matter. Kabul vehemently denied the allegations. 																								Any act of terrorism or sectarian violence in neighbouring Pakistan has always been condemned by Afghanistan as it negatively impacts the common goal of fighting terrorism and extremism, a foreign ministry statement issued in Kabul said. 																								To allege that this act of violence... has Afghan connections is unjustified, misunderstood or a distortion of the truth. 																								Our policy towards neighbouring Pakistan continues to seek to build new bridges of cooperation and friendship beneficial to both nations... with respect toward each others territorial and sovereign rights. 																								Afghanistan will not allow any group to undermine such policy though terrorist-like actions, it added. 																								Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have become uneasy in recent weeks after Pakistani troops deployed in the border area sparked skirmishes with Afghan militia on the other side.

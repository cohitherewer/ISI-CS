 Sunday, August 31, 2003 				 Teen held for making Net worm
																								Seattle/San Francisco, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Seeking to deliver a blunt warning to hackers everywhere, US officials yesterday arrested a teenager who admitted to making a copycat version of the Blaster Internet worm that infected computers around the world.																								Jeffrey Lee Parson, 18, was arrested in his hometown, the Minneapolis suburb of Hopkins, and charged with one count of intentionally causing or attempting to cause damage to a computer. He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison.																								With this arrest we want to deliver a message to hackers around the world, John McKay, US attorney for the western district of Washington, said.																								The handcuffs were not cyber-handcuffs, they were real handcuffs, McKay said, speaking of Parsons arrest, which was the result of a joint investigation by the Secret Service and the FBI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, February 22, 2003 				 War protests rule Brit awards
 PAUL MAJENDIE				 	 Kylie Minogue at the British Music Awards in London. (Reuters)																								London, Feb. 21 (Reuters): R amp;B sensation Ms Dynamite had the night of her life yesterday, landing two coveted Brit music awards and leading a pop protest against war in Iraq.																								I dont want to see the children die no more so I gotta make a stand, she sang in an impassioned duet with George Michael, the veteran pop superstar who gave the Londoner permission to re-work his great hit song Faith.																								From fashion designers to church leaders, the British have risen in protest against looming war in Iraq.																								Yesterday, it was the turn of the pop world to protest against the hawkish stance taken by Prime Minister Tony Blair in support of US President George W. Bush.																								In fervent mood, Ms Dynamite sang: A wise man wars with words, my daddy says. A wise man lives to fight another day.																								Ms Dynamite, who spoke against the war at Londons weekend peace demonstration that attracted close to one million protesters, took to the stage live in London to wild acclaim.																								George Michael sang along in a pre-recorded video backdrop to her electrifying performance.																								The anti-war theme was taken up by another dual award winner, the British group Cold Play.																								In accepting the award for Best British album, lead singer Chris Martin said: All awards are essentially nonsense and we are all going to die when George Bush has his way. So lets go out with a bang.																								The British record industrys big night of the year is normally marked by drunken publicity stunts but the great and good of the pop world were on their best behaviour this year.																								Even the raunchy singer Pink was subdued in accepting her Best International Female Award.I normally say something stupid on these occasions, she told 5,000 cheering fans.																								But I am completely sober tonight.																								Robbie Williams, currently trying to break into the notoriously difficult American market with his new album Escapology, landed the 14th Brit of his career when winning the British Male Solo Award.																								It capped an astounding year for the outlandish singer who memorably yelled that he was rich beyond my wildest dreams after landing an 80 million pound record deal.

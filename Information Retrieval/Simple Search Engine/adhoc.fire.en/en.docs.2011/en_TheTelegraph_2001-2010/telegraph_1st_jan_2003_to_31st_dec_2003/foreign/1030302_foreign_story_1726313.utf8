 Sunday, March 02, 2003 				 George Michael to record anti-war song
				 	 George Michael																								London, March 1 (Reuters): British pop star George Michael, who angered Americans last year with a single lampooning President George W. Bush, is to record an anti-war song that will be broadcast to over 100 million homes across Europe.																								The singer is recording a cover version of Don McLeans The Grave as a hard-hitting and provocative personal statement about the issue of war, MTV Europe said in a statement.																								It will be aired by MTV across Europe on Monday.																								McLean penned The Grave in 1971 and it was included in his acclaimed American Pie album. The lyrics will remain largely unchanged in the Michael version, MTV said.																								George Michael has a history of expressing strong, personal views, with inimitable creativity and conviction that resonates with MTV Europe audiences, the television station said, adding that it had no political standpoint.																								Last month Michael allowed Brit award winner Ms Dynamite to rework his hit Faith and include an anti-war rap during her performance of the song at the Brits, the annual Oscar ceremony for the British music industry.																								The Grave is the second protest song Michael has released since Shoot the Dog, his infamous satire on Bush and the US Presidents War on Terror.

 Sunday, August 17, 2003 				 New Elvis song unearthed 
		 Elvis PresleyLos Angeles, Aug. 16 (Reuters)  - More than a quarter-century after his death, Elvis Presley  has something new to get his fans all shook up.																								A never-before-released song recorded by Presley nearly 40 years ago was recently unearthed and will be issued this autumn by RCA Records as part of a new collection of favourites from the King of Rock  Roll. 																								The song, Im a Roustabout, originally was written for the 1964 Presley film Roustabout, co-starring Barbara Stanwyck, and was even recorded by Presley, but the song was rejected by producers and never used.																								A recording of the original Im a Roustabout sat for decades, undiscovered in the private collection of songwriter Winfield Scott, who composed it with longtime partner Otis Blackwell.

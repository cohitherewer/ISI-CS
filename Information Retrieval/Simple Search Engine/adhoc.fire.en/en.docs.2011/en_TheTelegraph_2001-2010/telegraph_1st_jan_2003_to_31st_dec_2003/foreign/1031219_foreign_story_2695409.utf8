 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Low-budget boost for Baldwin
																								Los Angeles, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Chalk it up to the vagaries of Hollywood.																								The odds were that Alec Baldwin would see his career boosted by the big-budget studio film Dr Seuss The Cat in the Hat, but it is the low-budget casino drama The Cooler, which shows throughout the US tomorrow, that has made the actor red hot.																								The surprise is that Cat in the Hat is a special effects-filled extravaganza from major studio Universal Pictures that opened in more than 3,000 cinemas, packing the promotional punch of comedian Mike Myers. Yet it fell flat with critics.																								Cooler has no effects, comes from independent studio Lions Gate Films and opened in November in just 10 cinemas. Its pre-release heat came from the movies star, William H. Macy, an award-winning actor but by no means a major box office draw. Yet critics are raving.																								In an interview with Reuters, Baldwin called the movie, a nice little film made out of nothing. It is better than they had any right to make, he said, better than you could have ever expected. 																								Macy portrays casino worker Bernie Lootz, whose luck is so bad he is hired by Baldwins Shelly to be a cooler at the fictional Shangri-La casino in Las Vegas. Bernie walks by a hot player and turns the gambler cold with a mere touch. Bernie sits down to play black jack, and winners see their hands go bust  and the casino rakes it in. As the movie progresses, audiences learn Bernie is working at the Shangri-La to pay an old gambling debt to Shelly, and he is close to paying that debt in full when cocktail waitress Natalie (Maria Bello) serves him a drink.																								Eventually, Bernie and Natalie strike up a romance and love becomes the charm that turns Bernies life around. Suddenly, hes a winner. But that means Shellys casino is a loser. Shelly cant let that happen, so in a twist he does something so cruel audiences find it despicable. Baldwin calls this pivotal point in the script the kill page because it killed his desire to be in the film when he first read it. Indeed, his initial reaction was to opt out of taking the Shelly role.																								But, as luck would have it, Baldwin said his manager encouraged him to read on, and as in any good story, the best for Bernie, Natalie and Shelly was yet to come. When you look at films, so many of the more interesting roles seem to be in the independent films. The scripts are generally a little riskier, Baldwin said.																								Baldwin said before making The Cooler he had worked in three projects that billed him as the main actor, whose face and name were expected to sell tickets and bring in audiences. With Macy in the lead role and Baldwin in the supporting part, Baldwin said he had more freedom to explore the Shelly character. Its very relaxing to go in and have fun with a film where you dont have to carry the flag, he said.

 Thursday, January 23, 2003 				 Lopez to be freed from Judd for Affleck
				 	 Jennifer Lopez																								Los Angeles, Jan. 22 (AFP): US diva Jennifer Lopezs divorce from dancer Chris Judd will become final next weekend, leaving her free to marry sweetheart Ben Affleck, court documents has showed.																								Papers filed in Los Angeles showed that the 32-year-old superstars short-lived union with Judd would officially be dissolved on Sunday, seven months after she filed for divorce. Judd, who met Lopez while working as a dancer on the video to her song Love Dont Cost a Thing, will receive around $15 million from Lopez under the settlement that ends their nine-month marriage, reports have said.																								Court papers indicated that Lopez and Judd would each pay their own attorneys fees and that Judd would not request spousal support in exchange for the settlement payoff.																								Lawyers for Lopez and Judd were, however, not immediately available for comment on the filing. Singer and actress Lopezs September 29, 2001, marriage to Judd was her second and followed a one-year union to Cuban-born waiter Ojani Noa, from whom she was divorced in 1997.																								In November, Lopez confirmed Hollywoods hottest rumour by announcing during a television interview that she and screen heartthrob Affleck would tie the knot when she became free of her last marriage.																								Lopez and the 30-year-old star of Pearl Harbor and Changing Lanes met in December 2001 while filming the gangster movie Gigli, in which Lopez plays a lesbian hit woman, and the pair quickly became Hollywoods hottest item.

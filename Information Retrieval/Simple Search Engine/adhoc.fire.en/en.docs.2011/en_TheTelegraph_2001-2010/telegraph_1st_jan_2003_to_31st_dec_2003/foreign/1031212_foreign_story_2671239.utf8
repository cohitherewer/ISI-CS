 London, Dec. 11 (Reuters):  It is polling day in the US and George W. Bush has gathered  together his friends and family at the White House to celebrate  his imminent re-election.																								But the party is gate-crashed by a sinister UN weapons inspector, just back from 18 fruitless months wandering Iraq in search of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). He has a devastating report to deliver to the US Congress and a few tough questions to ask Bush and his friends.																								That, in short, is the plot of a new play by director Justin Butcher, whose first political farce, The Madness of George Dubya, took Londons theatreland by storm a year ago when it was staged during the build-up to the Iraq war.																								A Weapons Inspector Calls is a similar offering  slapstick, vulgar, brash entertainment, according to Butcher.																								It mercilessly pours scorn on Bush, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and their increasingly desperate efforts to justify the decision to invade Iraq. I was quite reluctant to write a sequel because theyre often worse than the originals, Butcher said after the play opened at a small fringe theatre on Tuesday. But as the pretext for the war crumbled to ashes and it became obvious that no WMDs would be found, the idea slowly started to take shape in my head.																								The play, which takes its title from the classic stage thriller An Inspector Calls by British playwright J.B. Priestley, depicts Bush as a tongue-tied fool who refuses to believe there are no banned weapons in Iraq. We know theyre there because Donalds got the invoices, he tells the inspector, to the despair of his shrewd, irascible defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Bush, dressed in a leather bomber jacket, rails against tourists  a play on his Texan pronunciation of the word terrorists  and warns of the danger posed by prisoners interned in Guacamole Bay (Guantanamo Bay).																								His would-be Vice-President is Arnie Schwarzenegger, clad in a black leather jacket and dark sunglasses, a Terminator-style pistol stuffed down the front of his trousers.																								Schwarzenegger spends much of the play flirting with Blairs wife Cherie, a new-age mystic. At one point, weapons inspector Dan Styx (Hans Blix), describes how he saw US troops open fire on a farmer and his family in rural Iraq, mistakenly thinking they posed a threat.																								The play ends darkly, with Styx struck down in the Oval Office by Rumsfeld, clad in a white Ku Klux Klan-style hood.																								It ends badly and Im thinking about a third play in the trilogy, in the Star Wars mould, Butcher said. Maybe part three will be Escape from Guacamole Bay, modelled on The Great Escape.

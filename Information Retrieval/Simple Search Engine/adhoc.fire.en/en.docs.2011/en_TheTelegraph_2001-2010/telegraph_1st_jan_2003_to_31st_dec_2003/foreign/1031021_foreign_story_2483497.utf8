 Tuesday, October 21, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Boring TV trashed																																	 Berlin, Oct. 20 (Reuters): A 25-year-old German woman enraged over another Saturday night of boring television programmes and dull re-runs hurled her TV set out the window of her fifth floor apartment window, police said today.

She later calmed down and watched another television with her children. 																													 																Base jumper snared in chute Berlin (Reuters): A parachutist jumping  from a 145-metre skyscraper escaped death when his chute  failed to open properly but got snared on a crane next to  the building leaving him hanging, German police said on  Monday. He got lucky after his initial misfortune, said  a spokesperson for police in the Bavarian capital Munich.  Fire services took an hour to rescue the 32-year-old Austrian  extreme sports enthusiast after his base jump from the 35th  floor left him hanging 45 metres up. Police released the  man, under investigation for making an illegal parachute  jump, on bail of 450 euros.																													 																Toilet trauma in airliner																																	 Blantyre, Malawi (Reuters): A Malawi court fined a foreign journalist today for breaching security rules by trying to use a business class toilet on a state airliner carrying vice-president Justin Malewezi. Your Worship... I did not know that it was an offence on Air Malawi to visit the toilet in the business class, Peter Chilambwe told presiding magistrate Arthur Mtalimanja. After being fined 50 kwacha (47 US cents) on a charge of conduct likely to cause a breach of public peace, the Zambian journalist said he would never travel with Air Malawi again. They should make these rules clear when one is booking, he said. Regional police prosecutor Paul Jeremani said Chilambwe was not armed or violent, but police had treated the case seriously because the security of the vice-president  who was sitting in the business class section  had been at stake.

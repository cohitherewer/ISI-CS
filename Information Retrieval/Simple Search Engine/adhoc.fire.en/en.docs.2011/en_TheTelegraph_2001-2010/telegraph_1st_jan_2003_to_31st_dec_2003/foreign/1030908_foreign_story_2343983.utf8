The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, September 08, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Bovine bullies																																	Jerusalem, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Stud bulls are turning to their own in Israel, causing mounting frustration for cattlemen. 																																	A seasonal shortage of cows to impregnate and a Jewish ritual law that bans castration of animals means the studs have become bullish on other males, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported today.																																	The problem is, they lose so much weight  and have less meat  because of their repeated attempts to mate that we are losing money, Haim Dayan, head of the Israeli ranchers assocation, told the newspaper. Yedioth Ahronoth, Israels largest-circulation daily, illustrated the item with a photo of two bulls sharing a close encounter at a northern ranch. 																													 																Canine cause Berlin (Reuters): More than 3,000 dogs  were paraded through central Berlin in a demonstration by  owners for more rights and public tolerance. A number of  the dogs in the parade that snarled traffic throughout the  centre of the German capital were wearing costumes. Accompanied  by police escort, the dogs and their owners marched some  five km from the Victory Column to the west Berlin shopping  district through the Schoeneberg district before returning  to the starting point. Speakers at the second annual Fiffi  Parade called on the local government to set aside larger  areas where dogs can roam free without leashes. We need  pro-dog rules and not anti-dog laws, said Gisela Duellberg,  an organiser.

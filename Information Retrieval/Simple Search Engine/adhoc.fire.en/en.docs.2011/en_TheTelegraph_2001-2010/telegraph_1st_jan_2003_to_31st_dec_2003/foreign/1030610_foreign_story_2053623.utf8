The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, June 10, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Fat is not fine																																	Sydney, June 9 (Reuters): Increasingly portly Australians may be slapped with a fat tax on chips, hamburgers and soft drinks as obesity balloons to record levels. A recent national survey of over 11,000 people by the Australian Medical Association (AMA) showed almost 60 per cent of Australians were overweight or obese, more than double the rate 20 years ago.																						AMA vice-president Mukesh Haikerwal today said the fat tax would be one of several fat-fighting ideas put to health ministers next month.																																	Under the proposal, foods with a high fat or sugar content would attract an extra tax.																																	Its not about money, he told the Australian Associated Press. Its part of a strategy to make people more aware of the content of food thats bought.																																	Australia has one of the highest rates of the disease in the world.																													 																Pharaoh  Cairo (Reuters): Egypt unveiled the design  on Sunday of a new museum in the desert near the ancient  pyramids at Giza to house its wealth of pharaonic treasures,  including those of the boy-king Tutankhamun. The design  showed an angular building half-buried in a desert hillside  with triangular panels on the front and roof, mirroring  the shape of the pyramids which stand just two km from the  site. Culture minister Farouk Hosni said an international  jury chose the design by Irish firm Heneghan Peng Architects,  which would cost an estimated $350 million to build.																													 																All for art																																	 Barcelona (Reuters): Spencer Tunick, famous for his photographs of huge groups of naked people, beat his own record on Sunday when some 7,000 people posed nude for him in the Spanish city of Barcelona. From about 0200 GMT on Sunday thousands of volunteers gathered in central Barcelona to strip off and be photographed lying down and kneeling in rows. The Barcelona photos beat Tunicks last record of 4,500 snapped in Australia and while some 7,000 posed, more than twice that number initially signed up, the project manager said. The New York-based artist has shot naked throngs around the world but his work has got him into trouble in the US where he has been arrested several times, though not charged, for lewd conduct and blocking pedestrian traffic.																													 																Spider scare																																	 Berlin (Reuters): Trembling teachers at a German pre-school called in police to confront a giant spider crawling in a sandbox but it turned out to be a rubber toy, police in the western town of Heilbronn said on Sunday. They were all highly agitated and trembling with fear, a police spokesperson said. Two officers closed off the sandbox and surrounded the spider before discovering it was an imitation toy.

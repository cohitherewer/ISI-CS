 Tuesday, December 09, 2003 				 UK surcharge on migrants
																								London, Dec. 8 (PTI): Britain plans to impose a 500 surcharge on each of the 90,000 migrants entering the country every year to work, study or join family members.																								The surcharge is expected to raise 450 million a year, a quarter of the 1.8 billion annual cost of Britains immigrant and asylum system, The Guardian reported today. Home office officials have justified the move to surcharge migrants saying that they make a windfall gain through being granted access to the UK labour market.																								Economic migrants benefit in many ways working in the UK, over and above a higher salary expectation, and it is appropriate to pass on some of the costs of these benefits on to migrants through a further one-off charge upon application, a home office background document said.

 Monday, July 28, 2003 				 Niger asks Blair for proof 
 DAVID HARRISON 																								Niamey (Niger), July 27: The Prime Minister of Niger has challenged Tony Blair to produce the evidence that he claims proves Saddam Hussein sought to buy uranium from the impoverished African country.																								In his first interview since the row erupted over Britain and Americas alleged distortion of the case for war in Iraq, Hama Hamadou accused London and Washington of mistreating an ally, given that Niger sent 500 troops to fight against Saddam in the 1991 Gulf war.																								Is this how Britain and America treat their allies? he asked. If Britain has evidence to support its claim then it has only to produce it for everybody to see. Our conscience is clear. We are innocent. America admitted its original claim that Saddam Hussein sought to buy uranium from Niger as part of his nuclear weapons programme was based on forged documents.

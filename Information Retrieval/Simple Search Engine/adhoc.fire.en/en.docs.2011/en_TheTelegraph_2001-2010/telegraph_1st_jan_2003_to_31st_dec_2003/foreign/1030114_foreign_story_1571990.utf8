				 	 Queen Elizabeth																								London, Jan. 13 (Reuters): Britains 76-year-old Queen Elizabeth underwent a successful operation at a London hospital today to remove a torn cartilage after a minor accident last month.																								The 45-minute operation, which was performed by the Queens orthopaedic surgeon Roger Vickers, went very well and Her Majesty is expected to leave hospital tomorrow morning, a statement from Buckingham palace said.																								The Queen, who has enjoyed robust health for most of her life, hurt her right knee and had to use a walking stick after stumbling when she walked over uneven ground in December.																								After todays operation, she was expected to rest for two weeks at her Sandringham country estate and will then resume a limited programme of engagements until she has made a full recovery, the Buckingham Palace statement added.																								The Queen had a gruelling 2002 with the loss of two close relatives and near-constant tours round the nation for the Jubilee celebrations of her half century on the throne.

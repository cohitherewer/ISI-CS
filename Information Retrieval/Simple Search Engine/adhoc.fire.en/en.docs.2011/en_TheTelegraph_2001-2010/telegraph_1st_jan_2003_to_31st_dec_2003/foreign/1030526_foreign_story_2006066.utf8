 Monday, May 26, 2003 				 Weapon doubt surfaces in US
																								Washington, May 25 (Reuters): Top Senate Democrats today said they believed the Bush administration either exaggerated the threat posed by Iraq, or may have had faulty intelligence on its alleged weapons of mass destruction.																								Joe Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration hyped Iraqs potential for developing nuclear arms and for using other weapons of mass destruction, but said he expected such weapons will be found.																								Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the Senate Intelligence Committees senior Democrat, said he was beginning to believe that the intelligence the administration claimed to have on Iraqs weapons program before the US-led war to oust Saddam Hussein was not as sound as he had been led to believe.																								Appearing on NBCs Meet the Press, the lawmakers gave voice to growing concerns in Congress over the failure so far to find Iraqs alleged biological, chemical and possibly nuclear weapons that President George W. Bush used to justify the war.																								I do think that we hyped nuclear, we hyped al Qaida, we hyped the ability to disperse and use these weapons. I think that tends to be done by all presidents when they are trying to accomplish a goal that they want to get broad national support for, Biden said.																								Rockefeller said Congress must determine whether the administration intentionally overestimated Iraqs weapons program, or just misread it. ... In either case its a very bad outcome.																								Republican senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, the Intelligence Committee chairman, said he expected weapons to be found, and that the US must make certain they have not fallen into the hands of terrorists or rogue nations. If the weapons are not found, Roberts said on Meet the Press, Basically, you have a real credibility problem.																								Theres not any doubt that he had weapons of mass destruction. The question is, where are they? senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said on CNNs Late Edition.																								Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who led opposition in the Senate to the Iraq war, last week delivered a blistering speech accusing Bush of constructing a house of cards, built on deceit to justify the war.

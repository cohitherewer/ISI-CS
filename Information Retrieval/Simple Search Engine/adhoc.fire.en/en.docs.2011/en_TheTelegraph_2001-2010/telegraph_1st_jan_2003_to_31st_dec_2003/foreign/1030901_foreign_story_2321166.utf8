 New York, Aug. 31 (PTI):  An al Qaida operative now in US custody has made startling  revelations about secret connections linking Pakistan, Saudi  Arabia and the terror networks chief Osama bin Laden, a  new book says.																								Author Gerald Posner details Abu Zubaydahs confessions to his interrogators how bin Laden personally told him of a 1991 meeting at which Saudi had agreed to let the al Qaida chief leave the country.																								A Pakistani contact, high-ranking air force officer Mushaf Ali Mir, entered the equation at a 1996 meeting in Pakistan which Zubaydah also attended.																								Meanwhile, Newsweek today quoted Taliban officials in Pakistan and Afghanistan as saying bin Laden convened a huge terror summit in Afghanistan in April, shortly after Saddam Husseins regime collapsed, in which he outlined plans to launch unbelieveable attacks using biological weapons.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, November 11, 2003 				 Mariahs surprise is for the ear, not the eye
				 	 Mariah Carey in Shanghai. (AFP)																								Shanghai, Nov. 10 (AFP): Pop diva Mariah Carey promised today to dazzle Shanghai fans during two concerts this week with more than the range of her multi-octave voice  she intends to wear as little as possible. 																								If its raining or its cold, Ill still be in the same skimpy outfits that I would wear if its hot, Carey promised at press briefing here. 																								The biggest-selling female artist in history, who will be performing in Shanghai on Wednesday and Friday as part of her Charmbracelet world tour, said she also plans to keep her audience guessing. 																								My show is very improvisational and sometimes we ask the audience what they want to hear, so I really dont know what Im going to do until I get on stage, so were all going to be a bit surprised, she said. 																								Carey, 33, first shot to superstardom in the 1990s and has had more number-one songs than any other artist, with the exception of Elvis Presley and The Beatles, according to Columbia Records. 																								The famously hard-working singer, songwriter and sometime actress is attempting to re-launch her career after going through a very public nervous breakdown last year. 																								She also left Virgin Records in January 2002 after Glitter, her semi-autobiographical film with accompanying album, flopped with both fans and critics. Virgin, which is affiliated with the British record label EMI, let Carey out of one of the most expensive contracts in music history  $100 million for five albums  and paid her $28 million in damages. 																								Carey then signed with Island, owned by Universal, in May for $20 million for three albums, and in December last year launched Charmbracelet. Her new effort has reportedly sold more than three million copies and gained a footing in the US charts with a remix of Bringin on the Heartbreak. I look forward to performing and singing and I couldnt be happier, said a visibly tired Carey, who arrived in Shanghai Sunday night after concerts in Britain, France and Italy.

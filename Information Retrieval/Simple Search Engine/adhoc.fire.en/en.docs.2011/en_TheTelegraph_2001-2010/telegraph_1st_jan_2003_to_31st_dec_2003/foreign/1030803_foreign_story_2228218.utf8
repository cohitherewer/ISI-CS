 Sunday, August 03, 2003 				 Blair passes milestone
																								London, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Tony Blair became Britains longest serving Labour Party Prime Minister today but had little else to celebrate, with an appearance before a suicide inquiry looming and public trust in his government collapsing.																								The milestone of six years and three months in government he has now passed eclipses the previous record for prime ministerial tenure set by Clement Attlee from 1945 to 1951.																								Blair, who radically modernised his party, dragging it out of 18 years in the political wilderness, was holidaying with his family in Barbados. But as he left the country he learned that he will be summoned later this month to give evidence to a public inquiry into the suicide of a government scientist at the centre of a row over the reasons Britain went to war in Iraq.

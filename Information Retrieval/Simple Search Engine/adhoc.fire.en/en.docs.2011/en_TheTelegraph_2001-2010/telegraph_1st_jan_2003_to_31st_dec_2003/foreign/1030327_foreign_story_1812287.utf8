 Thursday, March 27, 2003 				 Turkey rethink 
																								Ankara, March 26 (Reuters): Turkeys armed forces chief General Hilmi Ozkok today hinted that Ankara might yet hold back from plans to send troops into northern Iraq, which Washington fears could undermine its war operations. 																								The comments came a day after the US announced proposals for war aid of up to $8.5 billion for Turkey. The dispatch of troops to Iraq against US advice would make Congressional approval of such a package, doubtful after Turkish refusal to allow a US invasion from its soil, less likely still.

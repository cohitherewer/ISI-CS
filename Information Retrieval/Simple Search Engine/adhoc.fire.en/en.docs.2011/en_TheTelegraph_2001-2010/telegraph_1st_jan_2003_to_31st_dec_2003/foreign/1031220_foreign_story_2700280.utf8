				 	 A model of the Freedom Tower which was unveiled in New York. (AFP)																								New York, Dec. 19 (Reuters): A twisting, shimmering, glass-encased skyscraper topped by a spire evocative of the Statue of Liberty, will replace the destroyed World Trade Center towers, officials said today after months of heated argument between architects over the design.																								The building dubbed the Freedom Tower will be the worlds tallest at 541 metres when it is completed by the end of 2008 and is intended to reclaim part of Manhattans famous skyline shattered in the September 11, 2001, attacks.																								We will build it to show the world that freedom will always triumph over terror and that we will face the 21st century with confidence, said New York governor George Pataki, who has final authority over what is built on the 6.4 hectare site in lower Manhattans financial district. The tower will overtake Taipei 101 office block in Taiwan as the building regarded as the worlds tallest. 																								New Yorks new tower will contain some similar elements to the original twin towers that stood at 417 metres, including the restoration of the well-known Windows on the World restaurant and an observation deck. But the architects said it would be much safer and more environmentally sensitive. The entire project, with a memorial to the 2,752 victims at its centre, was estimated to cost up to $12 billion over the next decade It also includes six other office buildings and a transportation hub to be designed by renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The plan and model of the building calls for 60 occupied stories, including 241,500.000 square metres of office space, rooftop restaurants, and the viewing floor up to a height of 335 metres.

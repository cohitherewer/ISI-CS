 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Happy holidays for Bush knees
																								Washington, Dec. 19 (Reuters): President George W. Bush can care for his aching right knee without surgery, the White House said yesterday after he underwent an MRI scan and X-rays to examine pain that has forced him to cut back on his running workouts.																								Happy holidays, Bush said as he emerged from a 4-hour visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington.																								During the stay Bush also met wounded troops from Iraq and Afghanistan and visited secretary of state Colin Powell, who the President reported was recovering very well from prostate surgery on Monday.																								He also delivered a pep-talk to hospital workers. Youre healing the defenders of our country. Youre comforting the champions of freedom, he said in the hospital auditorium. Bush ignored a reporters question about his knee as he left the hospital.																								Overseeing the exam were Bushs personal physician, Dr Richard Tubb, as well as Walter Reeds chief orthopaedist and a sports specialist, the White House said in a medical statement on the exams.																								Neither surgeon recommends surgery, the statement said. It said Bush was suffering mainly from wear and tear on top of an old athletic injury.																								Knee surgery and a lengthy rehabilitation could have complicated Bushs plans to campaign for his re-election next year.																								The statement said Bush should continue to exercise, as limited by his symptoms. It recommended cross training, strengthening his quadricep (thigh) muscles, and stretching.																								White House spokesman Scott McCellan said Bushs knee has been bothering him when he runs. While he has not been running really like he used to, he has been running occasionally, he said. Bush was working out regularly on an elliptical trainer, in a swimming pool, and by lifting weights and stretching, McClellan said.																								Bush was seen on Tuesday night descending, with some awkwardness, the steep stairs leaving Washingtons Blair House, where he had attended a diplomatic corps reception. But McClellan said he had not observed any problems with Bushs walking.																								The 57-year-old President was not sedated during the exam, McClellan said.																								The studies were made to evaluate the progression of long-standing, intermittent, activity-related pain at the front of his knee, the White House medical statement said. The President has not experienced any knee instability or mechanical symptoms.

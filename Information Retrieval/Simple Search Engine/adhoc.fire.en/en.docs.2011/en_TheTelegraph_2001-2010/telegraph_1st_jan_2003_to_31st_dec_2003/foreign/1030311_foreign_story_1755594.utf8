 MICHAEL PATERSON				 	 Michael Caine																								London, March 10: An outraged comment from Michael Caine in The Italian Job has been voted the greatest one-liner in cinema.																								British movie fans said that his exasperated cry: You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off as a fellow crook destroys a van by blowing it up was their favourite remark on screen.																								Runner-up: Rhett Butler with Scarlet OHara in Gone With The Wind.																								Caines one-liner in the 1969 crime caper about a gang stealing gold bullion from a bank vault in Turin pushed Clarke Gables legendary put-down as Rhett Butler in Gone With The Wind into second place.																								His line: Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn, was considered shocking when the film was released in 1939.																								The cult British comedy Withnail And I, in which two drink-addled unemployed actors leave London for a holiday in the north, came in third place for the remark: We want the finest wines available to humanity, we want them here and we want them now, delivered by Richard E Grant as Withnail.																								That film had the most lines  21  nominated by a poll of 1,000 movie fans but such classics as Casablanca, Some Like It Hot and All About Eve were overlooked.																								No lines from black and white films made the top 10. Andie MacDowells cringe-worthy: Is it raining? I hadnt noticed, from Four Weddings and a Funeral, was voted the worst line, pipping Arnold Schwarzeneggers monosyllabic mantra: Ill be back, in The Terminator.																								The survey of movie fans was carried out to mark the Orange Word screenwriters season at the British Library, which will feature talks by Chris Columbus, Hanif Qureishi, Mike Leigh and Bruce Robinson, the creator of Withnail and I.

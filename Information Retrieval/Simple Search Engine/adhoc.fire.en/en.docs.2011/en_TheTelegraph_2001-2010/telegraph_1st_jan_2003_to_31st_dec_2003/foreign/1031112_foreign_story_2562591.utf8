 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Al Qaida threat
																								Dubai, Nov. 11 (Reuters): A London-based Arab magazine said today that Osama bin Ladens militant al Qaida network has claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing in Saudi Arabia and warned of more attacks in the Gulf Arab region.																								It was not possible to verify the authenticity of the claim, sent by email to al-Majalla weekly, an advance copy of which was received by Reuters. The London-based magazine carried no direct quotes but paraphrased the purported statement. Al-Majalla said the message from a hitherto unknown al Qaida member, Abu Mohammed al-Ablaj, claimed that the group was behind Sundays car bombing at a Riyadh compound housing mostly Arabs which killed at least 18, including five children. On the injury of children in the bombing... he (Ablaj) warned against working with Americans or residing among them because then there would be no differentiating between them and they would be considered as shielding them, it said. Ablaj referred to religious edicts which permit the killing of all those who support Westerners. Ablaj warned of new coming strikes in the rest of the Gulf countries and chose not to mention the places, but confirmed that the circle would widen, the magazine said.

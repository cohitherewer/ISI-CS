The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, April 12, 2003 				 Voice of war turns Web hero
				 	 Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf																								Los Angeles, April 11 (Reuters): A member of Saddam Husseins vanquished regime has sprung up as an unlikely hero on a website, embraced by both supporters and foes of the US-led invasion of Iraq.																								Television news junkies transfixed by daily briefings by Iraqi minister of information Mohammed Saeed al Sahaf are now logging onto a day-old website featuring his finest invective against US and British infidels. The site, (http://www.WeLoveTheIraqiInformationMinister.com), is a coalition effort of bloodthirsty hawks and ineffectual doves united in their admiration for al Sahaf and his pronouncements, such as: I now inform you that you are too far from reality.																								Among al Sahafs now-famous declarations was: There are no American infidels in Baghdad. Never! 																								Writer and former Greenpeace activist Kieran Mulvaney, a Briton living in Alaska, said he and his friends got the idea for the site while watching cable news coverage of the three-week-old war. 																								I mentioned to one of my friends that the best part is watching this guy, Mulvaney said yesterday. He is so brazen that I could almost admire him.																								Mulvaney and his friends designed, built and put up the site in three days. Within hours of going live on the internet, the site has exploded, Mulvaney said. The same day, US troops marched into Baghdad and al Sahaf disappeared, or in the view of his new website, went on administrative leave.																								I hope he is alive somewhere so he knows how famous he has become, Mulvaney said. Weve had all kinds of e-mail from literally all over the world. We even had a few e-mails from within the Pentagon saying: We really like this guy and we miss him. The site already is offering T-shirts and mugs bearing al Sahafs best-loved statements: My feelings  as usual  we will slaughter them all! and has selected actor and director Sydney Pollack to play the information minister in the Hollywood version of the war. 																								Mulvaney said he will appeal for sightings of al Sahaf, and there are plans to poll fans about what the beret-wearing minister should do after the war.																								One fan has advocated an urgent campaign to spare al Sahaf if he is found: He is too much of a global asset to be murdered/shot/stabbed or otherwise wasted.

 Thursday, October 09, 2003 				 Spears joke
				 	 Britney Spears Annapolis (Maryland), Oct.  8 (Reuters): Marylands first lady was only joking when  she said she would like to shoot pop star Britney Spears,  but yesterday it was no longer a laughing matter.																								Kendel Ehrlich, wife of the states Republican governor Robert Ehrlich, had been criticising what she views as the entertainment industrys negative influence on youth, during a domestic violence prevention conference last week in the city of Frederick. Really, if I had an opportunity to shoot Britney Spears, I think I would, Ehrlich laughingly told the audience, accusing the 21-year-old Grammy Award-nominated singer of exaggerating the importance of sex for young girls.																								Spears, a former Mickey Mouse Club member and once-demure pop princess, has recently begun to refashion herself as a sex object with steamy live performances and a topless photo on the October 2 cover of Rolling Stone magazine.																								Frederick radio station WFMD discovered Ehrlichs remark about Spears while reviewing a conference tape-recording and ran a news story about it on Monday. 																								By yesterday, the first ladys office was forced to issue a statement.

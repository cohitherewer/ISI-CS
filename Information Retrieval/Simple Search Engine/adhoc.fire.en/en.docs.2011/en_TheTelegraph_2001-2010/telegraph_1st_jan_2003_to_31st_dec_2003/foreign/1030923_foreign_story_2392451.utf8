 Tuesday, September 23, 2003 				 Fighting Hoon denies leak
																								London, Sept. 22 (Reuters): British defence secretary Geoff Hoon, his job widely seen as being on the line, came out fighting today at his second appearance before an inquiry investigating the death of an expert into Iraqs banned weapons.																								In combative mood, he said his department had made no errors in its handling of the scientist, who killed himself after being thrust into the limelight as the source of a report alleging the government had hyped the threat from Iraq.																								Hoon was adamant that the ministry of defence had protected the anonymity of David Kelly and denied a suggestion that the government had agreed a strategy to leak Kellys name.																								Kelly committed suicide after Hoons ministry confirmed to journalists that he was the source of a BBC news report that accused the government of sexing up a dossier on Iraqs weapons of mass destruction to justify war to a sceptical public.																								British media have pinpointed Hoon as the most likely government fall guy of the Kelly affair. But the former barrister looked in no mood to take the blame today, even accusing counsel for Kellys family of misleading earlier witnesses.																								On behalf of the Kelly family, Jeremy Gompertz, suggested there had been a government-wide strategy to leak Kellys name  as part of its efforts to undermine the BBC report  without appearing to do so. I would be extremely surprised if that is an argument that any reasonable person could make, Hoon countered defiantly.																								During the media storm over the BBC report, the ministry of defence issued a press statement saying a possible source for the report had come forward and it decided to confirm Kellys name to journalists if the right name was put to it. Blairs official spokesperson also released a string of details to reporters about the nature of the sources work, the department he worked for and who paid him. Hoon said he had been unaware of the spokespersons press briefing.

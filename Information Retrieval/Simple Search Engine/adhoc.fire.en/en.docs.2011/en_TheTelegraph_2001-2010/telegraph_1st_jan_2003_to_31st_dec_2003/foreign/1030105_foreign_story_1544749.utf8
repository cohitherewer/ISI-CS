 Sunday, January 05, 2003 				 S. Korea plan to end standoff
																								Seoul, Jan. 4 (Reuters): South Korea pushed a compromise to end a nuclear standoff between North Korea and the US today as it agonised over its relationship with the worlds only superpower.																								South Korean officials meet Russian counterparts in Moscow where they are expected to try to sell a plan in which Washington guarantees the security of the Communist North, branded part of an axis of evil by the US, in return for its abandoning any nuclear weapons programme.																								The South Korean National Security Council met in the morning to fine-tune the proposals to be presented at talks in Washington on Monday with the US and Japan.

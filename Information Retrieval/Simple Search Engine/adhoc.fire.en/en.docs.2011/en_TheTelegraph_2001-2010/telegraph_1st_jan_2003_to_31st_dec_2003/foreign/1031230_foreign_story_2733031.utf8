The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Freed from jail, Jaish bomber targets Pervez
 IMTIAZ GUL AND REUTERS				 	 More teeth: Musharraf  Islamabad, Dec. 29: One  of the two suicide bombers who targeted President Pervez  Musharraf last week was a Jaish-e-Mohammad activist who  was freed from an Afghan prison last year, intelligence  officials said today.																								Musharraf narrowly survived the twin bombings on Thursday in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.																								An intelligence official said Mohammed Jameel, 23, a resident of Rawalakot in the Pakistani part of Kashmir, was a member of the outlawed Jaish-e-Mohammad. The group is blamed for attacking Parliament in December 2001, an incident that brought it to the brink of war with Pakistan.																								Musharraf banned the group along with several others in an attempt to curb Islamic militancy in Pakistan.																								Another intelligence official said Jameel was caught fighting alongside the ousted Taliban in Afghanistan and was freed from an Afghan jail last year along with 29 other Pakistanis. On arrival in Pakistan, Jameel was screened by security agencies but was freed.																								The JIT (joint investigation team) had concluded that the suspect was not involved in any anti-state activities as nothing adverse had been found against him, said the official who asked not to be named.																								Nobody realised that he would turn into a suicide bomber, he added. The other suicide bomber was an Afghan.																								Senior Pakistani officials say that a network of Kashmiri and Afghan militants with ties to international terror groups were responsible for the attempt on Musharrafs life.																								Hardliners are furious with Musharraf for supporting the US-led war in which Pakistan arrested hundreds of Taliban fighters and al Qaida militants and handed them over to America. 																								Musharrafs recent peace overtures with India have also fuelled the militants anger. Pervez legitimacy bill																								Pakistani parliamentarians today passed a bill that gives vast powers to President Pervez Musharraf, including authority to sack the elected government.																								The National Assembly endorsed a set of constitutional amendments that also allow Musharraf to hold the slot of army chief for one more year. The amendments relate to changes Musharraf made in the constitution under the Legal Framework Order (LFO) before he returned the country to democracy in 2002.																								Discussion on the bill to make the LFO a part of the constitution commenced in the Lower House last week following a dramatic deal between Musharraf and the Islamist Opposition, which allowed him to continue as chief of army staff till December 31, 2004, and legitimise his presidency by seeking a vote of confidence from the National Assembly, Senate and four provincial Assemblies.																								The deal will now be sealed during a vote of confidence in Musharraf, which would keep him in power until 2007. The vote is likely to be held on January 1, three days ahead of the Saarc summit.

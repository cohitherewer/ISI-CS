 Saturday, September 13, 2003 				 Celebrities fete Armani
 GINA PICCALO Beverly Hills, Sept. 12:  They lined up like airplanes on a runway, fussing with their  hair and their hemlines as they waited their turn before  the cameras. Preening was at a premium on this night as  the guest of honour, Giorgio Armani, had dressed most everyone  there.																								Should I take this off? Michelle Pfeiffer asked her publicist, lifting a black velvet wrap off her bare arms to reveal the beaded Armani dress beneath. Other relative lesser-knowns  Jennifer Love Hewitt, Debra Messing, Brendan Fraser, Thora Birch  queued up behind her. An ebullient Christian Slater threw back his head and shouted: We fight to wear his clothes! We beg! We claw! Jodie Foster was there too, poised and classic, speaking reverently of the designer, whom she called just a simple man.																								Then Sophia Loren (so tanned! so glamourous!) arrived arm-in-arm with her best friend, Armani, and the paparazzi frenzy began in earnest. This is better than the Oscars! said one veteran photographer. And indeed, the A-list actors turned out en masse on this moonlit Tuesday night in Beverly Hills to fete a man with whom they entrust their most precious commodity: their image. The shindig was hosted by the merchants of Rodeo Drive to inaugurate the Walk of Style, Beverly Hills version of Hollywood Boulevards Walk of Fame.																								Foster told the crowd she became an Armani devotee after the media lambasted her in 1988 for wearing a dress that looked like I sat in a wedding cake. I wised up pretty fast, she said. Pfeiffer, one of Armanis first celebrity clients, noted sagely: He would never make you look foolish.																								Those who couldnt make it  namely Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese  sent love notes to Armani that Messing read to the crowd. To Roberts, Armani is brilliant! De Niro called him the maestro. Scorsese considers him more cinematic than Fellini. In fact, praise for the snow-haired designer reached such a crescendo that Steve Martin seized on it for a few punch lines. He opened his comments reading what he said was Armanis biography, only to confess mid-sentence that hed mistakenly read from that of Leonardo Da Vinci.

 Tuesday, July 29, 2003 				 Tight neckties can affect vision
																								London, July 28 (Reuters): Men should think twice about how tight they wear a necktie because it could increase their chances of developing glaucoma, a group of serious eye diseases.																								Research reported in the British Journal of Ophthalmology showed that a tight necktie raises blood pressure in the eye, which is a leading risk factor in the illness that can lead to damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. A tight necktie increases IOP (intraocular pressure) in both normal subjects and glaucoma patients and could affect the diagnosis and management of glaucoma, said Dr Robert Ritch of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary in the US.																								Ritch and his colleagues tested IOP of 20 healthy men and 20 who suffered from glaucoma while they were wearing an open-neck shirt, before putting on a tight necktie and three minutes after loosening it. Sixty per cent of the men with glaucoma and 70 per cent of the volunteers had increased eye pressure after wearing a necktie.

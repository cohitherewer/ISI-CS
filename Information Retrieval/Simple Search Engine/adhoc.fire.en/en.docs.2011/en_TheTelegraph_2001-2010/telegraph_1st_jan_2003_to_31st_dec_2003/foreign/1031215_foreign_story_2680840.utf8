The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Blair beats Bush, not the blues
																								London, Dec. 14 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair enjoyed one of his best days in a bad year today  but there was no American-style euphoria over Saddam Husseins capture.																								While American soldiers whooped for joy and Iraqis fired guns in the air, Blair struck a surprisingly sober note in London.																								Let this be more than a moment for simply rejoicing. Let it be a moment to reach out and reconcile, Blair told reporters at Downing Street, before declining to take questions.																								There could be no doubting Blairs satisfaction at Saddams demise, particularly as he was taken alive without a shot fired.																								And whereas Washington embarrassed London by announcing the start of the Iraq war first, Blair was quicker off the mark than President George W. Bush with his confirmation of Saddams capture.																								Yet Blair knows that even with Saddam behind bars and on trial, there is plenty of hard work left both to bring peace to Iraq  and to restore his own battered political fortunes.																								British and US troops are still at risk from guerrillas, although the attackers may lose some inspiration without Saddam at large.																								The tortuous process of returning sovereignty to Iraqis  while avoiding civil war  still looks as tough as ever.																								Weapons of mass destruction once so trumpeted by Blair, and Bush, as the motive for war have not been found, leaving Britons dubious over his trustworthiness.																								The potentially damning conclusion of an inquiry into the suicide of a British weapons expert  one of the lowest points of the Iraq saga for Blair  is just around the corner. Besides, human rights groups will be watching closely to see that Saddam is treated according to international law.																								Saddams capture might be seized upon by the Prime Minister as something to laugh about, but I very much doubt if it will be the last laugh, anti-war politician George Galloway said in Egypt. 																								Because the truth is the country was taken into the war on the basis of a lie.																								Blairs ratings tumbled over the Iraq war. He is nevertheless favourite to win the next general election, probably in 2005. War sceptics clap loud																								Worldwide jubilation today at the capture of Saddam showed how friendless he was. Even France and Germany, fierce opponents of the US-led war to oust Saddam, lauded his arrest.																								French President Jacques Chirac said: This is a major event which should strongly contribute to the democratisation and the stabilisation of Iraq and allow the Iraqis to once more be masters of their destiny in a sovereign Iraq.																								German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder saluted Bush in a telegram while again urging international efforts to rebuild the shattered oil state. 																								Saddam Hussein caused horrible suffering to his people and the region. I hope the capture will help the international communitys effort to rebuild and stabilise Iraq, he wrote.																								Pakistan described the arrest as an important development, voicing hopes it would lead to stability in Iraq.

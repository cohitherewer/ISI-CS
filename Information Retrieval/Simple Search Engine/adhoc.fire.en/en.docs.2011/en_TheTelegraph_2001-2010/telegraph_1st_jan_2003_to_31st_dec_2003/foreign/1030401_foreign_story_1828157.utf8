After 2,000 years, Rome is reliving the revolt of the centurions, read a banner held aloft by the costumed characters, who eke out a living posing for tourist photos.																																	The culture ministry has ordered them away, complaining that they are a blight on the Colosseum, which attracts some three million visitors a year. But the latter-day legionnaires vow to reclaim their stamping ground.																																	How dare they say that we disfigure the Colosseum? raged Franco Magni, alias Brutus, wearing knee-high strappy sandals and gleaming body armour. Theyve built lifts and souvenir shops inside the Colosseum to make money out of it but were being driven away, stopped from doing our work. Its a disgrace.																						The band of about 40 bare-legged centurions and gladiators waved their swords, raised their fists and chanted We want to work! as bemused tourists took snapshots.

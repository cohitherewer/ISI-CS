 Morris Plains (New Jersey),  July 18 (Reuters): Boxer shorts and pajamas belonging  to President John F. Kennedy as well as a swim suit and  lipsticks belonging to his wife Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis  will be auctioned tomorrow.																								The auction, at Dawsons Auctioneers amp; Appraisers in Morris Plains, New Jersey, will include more than 300 items ranging from the whimsical  World War II Navy-issue boxer shorts, with the sown label, Jack Kennedy  to the historic, a personal presidential campaign notebook. The items were put up for sale by Jacqueline Kennedys personal secretary between 1957 and 1964, Mary Gallagher, and her personal attendant between 1959 and 1965, Providencia Paredes. Bidding for Kennedys personal campaign notebook, which has 22 pages of lists, speech ideas and campaign notes, will start at $7,500 and is expected to fetch $20,000.																								The excitement for this collection is unbelievable, said Paula Hantman of Hantmans Auctioneers and Appraisers, which will conduct the auction.																								Interest was high, she said, because after previous auctions by the Kennedy family and President Kennedys secretary Evelyn Lincoln, few more such Kennedy auctions are expected.																								Bidding for Kennedys personal campaign notebook, which has 22 pages of lists, speech ideas and campaign notes, will start at $7,500 and is expected to fetch from $15,000 to $20,000.																								The auction also includes clothing items belonging to the former first lady, known for her elegant fashion sense, including shoes, suits, nightgowns, a swim suit, and dresses. Some of her personal notes and lipsticks will also be on the auction block.																								Buyers can pack the Kennedy-wear in a briefcase given to then Senator Kennedy as a wedding gift, which is being put up for auction by the Museum of American Financial History.																								A Japanese Barbie doll, which was owned by Kennedy daughter Caroline, will also be sold.																								Other items of note include a photo of Jacqueline Kennedy taken and autographed by Richard Avedon and an autographed special edition of Kennedys inaugural address.

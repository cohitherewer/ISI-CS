The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, January 03, 2003 				 V-Day debut for bust boosters
																								Bangkok, Jan. 2 (Reuters): Thailands health ministry will launch a troupe of specially trained bosom-enhancing dancers on Valentines Day to show women how to boost their bust lines without resorting to ill-fitting and often expensive bras. 																								Pennapa Subcharoen, deputy director-general of the department of traditional medicine, said Thai women had been bombarded with images of big-busted women via the media and many felt they were inadequate. 																								Many women are not aware that wearing an appropriate size of bra and regularly taking bosom-firming dance can make their wish come true, Pennapa said. 																								So we are training 12 pairs of instructors to teach women how to take care of their breasts and we plan to launch them on Valentines Day nationwide, she said.																								She said many bras on the market were inappropriate for Thai women and wearing bras of the wrong size could also be harmful over a long time.

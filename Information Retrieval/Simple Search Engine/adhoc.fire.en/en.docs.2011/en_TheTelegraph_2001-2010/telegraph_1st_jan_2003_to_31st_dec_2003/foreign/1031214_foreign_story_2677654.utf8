 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Halliburton overcharge to be repaid, says Bush
																								Washington, Dec. 13 (Reuters): President George W. Bush, seeking to deflect criticism from the controversy surrounding Halliburton contracts in Iraq, said yesterday he believed a subsidiary overcharged the US government for fuel deliveries to Iraq by $61 million, and expected it to be repaid.																								Bush said the Pentagon was investigating the overcharge after an audit found Halliburtons Kellogg, Brown amp; Root unit overcharged the US army by $1.09 per 3.8 litres for nearly 215 million litres of fuel for Iraqi citizens.																								Their investigation will lay the facts out for everybody to see. And if theres an overcharge, like we think there is, we expect that money to be repaid, Bush said. Critics of the Bush administration say Halliburton, the Houston-based oil company where vice-president Dick Cheney was chief executive, has unduly benefited from its government connections. The fuel deliveries fall under a contract awarded to Halliburton in March.																								Democrats are using Halliburton as a symbol of what they view as big business profiting from the Bush administration. Democrat contender Howard Dean said that there should be an independent investigation of Halliburtons alleged ties to the Bush administration.

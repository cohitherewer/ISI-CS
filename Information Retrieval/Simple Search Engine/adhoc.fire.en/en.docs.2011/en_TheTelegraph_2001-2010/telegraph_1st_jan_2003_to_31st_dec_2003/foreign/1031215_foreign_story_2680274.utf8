The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Bloodshed before big break
				 	 An Iraqi laughs while a soldier frisks him in Baghdad on Sunday. (Reuters)																								Khalidiyah (Iraq), Dec. 14 (Reuters): A car bomb ripped through a police station west of Baghdad today, killing at least 17 people, in the latest attack on the force central to Washingtons plans to hand over power to Iraqis.																								US troops on the scene said there a suicide bomber may have been behind the blast. It left a thick cloud of black smoke rising into the sky over the restive village of Khalidiyah, 60 km from the capital, around 0540 GMT. Pools of blood, shattered glass and scattered shoes littered the street. A US officer said 17 were dead and 33 wounded. None were Americans or from allied foreign forces. An Iraqi police major put the toll at 16 dead and 32 hurt.																								US troops and several Bradley armoured vehicles and tanks stood off about 50 metres from station, with soldiers stepping in to break up a confrontation between Iraqi police and about 200 local demonstrators who chanted Yes, Yes to Saddam. 																								The remains of a twisted car lay outside the two-storey station. A stone wall around the structure appeared to have borne the brunt of the blast which destroyed parts of it.																								US Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Swisher told reporters at the scene that there was some evidence of a suicide bomber.																								A US military spokesman in Baghdad said there were no casualties among US or foreign allied forces. 																								Ambulances and rescue workers ferried the casualties to a hospital in Ramadi, 110 km west of the capital. 																								The bomb was the latest in a string of attacks on Iraqi police and other targets seen as co-operating with the US-led occupation. Scores of Iraqis have been killed. US-led forces in Iraq have also come under daily attacks since the end of the war that toppled Saddam in April.																								Several police targets have come under attack, including in Khalidiyah and Ramadi, before. The US-appointed police chief in Khalidiyah was killed in September. 																								The Iraqi police, trained by US forces, have often complained that they are not sufficiently armed or protected.																								The police, along with a 40,000-strong new Iraqi army and security forces, are central to US plans to turn responsibility for security and formal sovereignty over to Iraqis by the middle of next year, ahead of the US presidential election in November.																								Edging towards having more US allies involved on the ground in Iraq, Seoul announced today that President Roh Moo-hyun would ask parliament to approve the deployment of 3,000 South Korean troops to help rebuild the war-torn country. 																								Many in South Korea oppose sending more troops to Iraq, where two South Korean workers were killed last month.

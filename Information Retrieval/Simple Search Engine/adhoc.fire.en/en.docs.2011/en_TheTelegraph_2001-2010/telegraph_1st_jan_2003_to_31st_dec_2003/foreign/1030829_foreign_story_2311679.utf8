(AFP) Tokyo, Aug. 28 (Reuters):  Actor Tom Cruise had nothing but praise for Japanese Prime  Minister Junichiro Koizumi today  including the leaders  musical talents.																								Hes really an extraordinary man  and a pretty good singer. We sang Elvis together, Cruise told reporters after meeting Koizumi at his official residence. I think hes a charismatic and very intelligent man.

But the prime minister said later it was I want you, I need you, I love you, the first song he had ever learned in English.

The actor said he had invited Koizumi  who faces a party leadership race in a few weeks  to the premiere of the movie, part of which was filmed in Japan.																								It is due for release in December.

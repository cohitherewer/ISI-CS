 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Vatican rage at cow parade 
																								Vatican City, Dec. 16 (Reuters): A top Vatican official said today he felt pity and compassion for Saddam Hussein and criticised the US military for showing video footage of him being treated like a cow.																								Cardinal Renato Martino, head of the Vaticans Justice and Peace department and a former papal envoy to the UN, told a news conference it would be illusory to think the arrest of the former Iraqi President would heal all the damage caused by a war which the Holy See opposed. I felt pity to see this man destroyed, (the military) looking at his teeth as if he were a cow. They could have spared us these pictures, he said. 																								Seeing him like this, a man in his tragedy, despite all the heavy blame he bears, I had a sense of compassion for him, he said in answer to questions about Saddams arrest. 																								Martino was referring to the videotape released by the US military which showed a grubby, bearded and dishevelled Saddam receiving a medical examination by a military doctor after his capture in an underground hole today. Martino was one of the Vatican officials most strongly opposed to the US-led invasion of Iraq. Its true that we should be happy that this (arrest) has come about because it is the watershed that was necessary... we hope that this will not have worse and other serious consequences, Martino said. 																								Martino said the Vatican hoped the arrest of Saddam can contribute to promoting peace and the democratisation of Iraq.

 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 Scribes gun stunt backfires
																								London, March 17 (Reuters): British police today said they arrested three men after a tabloid reporters airport stunt with an imitation machine gun backfired.																								News of the World reporter Robert Kellaway successfully smuggled a replica M-16 machine gun onto an airliner in the kind of exploit that has become a staple for Britains tabloids since the September 11 attacks. But after he published details of his investigation into airline security at Gatwick airport earlier this month, police arrested three men, one of whom media sources identified as Kellaway.																								All three were arrested for conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence, said a police spokeswoman. 																								Kellaway hid in the back of a lorry supplying in-flight meals to board a 200-seater Monarch Airlines plane, where he was photographed brandishing the gun along with a replica pistol.

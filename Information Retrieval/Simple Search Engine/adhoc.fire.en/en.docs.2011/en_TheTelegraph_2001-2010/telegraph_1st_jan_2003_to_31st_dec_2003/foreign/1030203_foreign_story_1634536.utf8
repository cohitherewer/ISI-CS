The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Brother recalls valour
  Kalpana Chawla did not care much about risks and was very cheerful and confident before she took off. She did not care about risks and was very passionate about her job, Sanjay Chawla, Kalpanas elder brother, told PTI in New Delhi. Our father was a bit reluctant when she initially revealed her intentions to be an astronaut because of the risks involved, but, her determination eventually prevailed, Sanjay (PTI picture ) said. Before her second space mission, some family members had met Kalpana, but Sanjay could not do so. Kalpana asked us not to bring any gift for her but spend the money in making the environment better, he said.  Copyright

Briefs  War Briefs  23 Indian contracts on UN list  New Delhi, April 9: The United Nations has put 23 Indian contracts on the priority list for Iraq once the oil-for-food programme resumes in the war-torn country, reports our special correspondent. These contracts include goods like instant full-cream milk powder, wheat, medicine, vitamins, soyabean meal, water pumps, veterinary pharmaceuticals, gas turbines and educational materials.  The office of the Iraq programme has informed the Permanent Mission of India that the suppliers of goods under the oil-for-food programme have been divided into three categories.  Contracts identified as possible priorities by the UN have been listed in the first category, followed by contracts of goods already in transit in the second. Other goods to be considered as possible priorities comprise the third category.  Among suppliers whose goods are in transit, only those identified on the priority list are being contacted now. Arrangements for other transit contracts are currently being discussed with the UN.  British support  London (Reuters): British support for the  war in Iraq reached its highest level yet today, but pollsters  said any military kudos could quickly wear off for Prime  Minister Tony Blair. The pollsters pointed out that wars  rarely won elections and the khaki effect may soon fade   patriotic backing for troops risking their lives does  not translate into voter support. Support is at its highest  level since the war began, said pollster Peter Kellner  after the latest YouGov opinion poll in the Daily Telegraph  showed 63 per cent in favour.  Chirac appeal  Paris (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac called on Wednesday for a crackdown on racism following recent anti-Semitic attacks and signs that war in Iraq has heightened tension between Frances Jews and Muslims. Chirac made the appeal at a Cabinet meeting, government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope said, three weeks after two French Jews were assaulted during an anti-war protest.  Iran attack ire  Tehran (Reuters): Iran  accused US-led forces in Iraq of firing a rocket which killed  a boy in southwest Iran on Tuesday, state television said.  The missile hit a residential area outside Abadan, a border  port city about 50 km east of Basra. An interior ministry  spokesman said the incident was caused by US and British  aggressors responsible for violating the Islamic Republics  airspace and inflicting human and property losses. The  incident was the second in the Abadan area since war started  in Iraq. A stray rocket from the battle in southern Iraq  hit an oil refinery depot in the city on March 21 and injured  two people. Iran, which has remained neutral in the war  on its doorstep, played down the first incident and said  it was a consequence of living next to a war zone. Copyright

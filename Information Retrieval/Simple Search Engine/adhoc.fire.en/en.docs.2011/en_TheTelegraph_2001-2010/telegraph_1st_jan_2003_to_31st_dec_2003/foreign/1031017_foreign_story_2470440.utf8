(Reuters) 																								They are better known for their narcissism. But last night many of the worlds leading designers, models and rock stars showed a more giving side with a glitzy fashion show in aid of the Princes Trust.																								The event, Fashion Rocks, was billed as the ultimate fusion of the catwalk and concert, with stars such as Robbie Williams, Duran Duran and David Bowie performing live as the models strutted their stuff.																								Giorgio Armani, whose work was this week recognised as high art with an exhibition at the Royal Academy, was joined by 16 leading fashion houses including Gucci, Christian Dior, Alexander McQueen and Prada at the Royal Albert Hall.																								Robbie Williams, who wore a black Versace suit with silver trainers, said the idea of a fashion show-cum-concert was rather marvellous.																								He said: This is a fantastic event. I get to sort out my dress sense  sort of  sing one of my songs and look at some of the most beautiful women in the world. Theyre all here.																								Most of all, Williams said he had come to see Elizabeth Hurley  whose purple and yellow Versace gown was, he confessed, distractingly revealing. Among the models who turned out on the runway were Naomi Campbell, Eva Herzigova and Jodie Kidd. Campbell, who arrived on the arms of the designers Dolce and Gabbana, said: Its a wonderful event.																								About 5,000 people paid up to 1,000 each for tickets for the show, which is expected to raise 750,000 for the Trust. The Prince of Wales arrived with Camilla Parker Bowles, who wore a blue velvet fishtail dress with chiffon sleeves, designed by Robinson Valentine. Julien Macdonald, the designer, said he had been asked for some fashion tips by Parker-Bowles. He said: She said: I need to get more of a rock star image. What should I do?. I told her that for 10.99 you can do that right away with my tights.																								After taking his seat in the hall, the Prince was confronted with a 100 foot high image of a naked Liz Hurley. While she left the stage for the first of 18 costume changes, her co-host, the American comedian Denis Leary, told the audience he wanted to show them what every man would like to see Liz Hurley wearing. An image of a naked woman with Hurleys head superimposed was then flashed up on the giant screen.																								Other celebrities attending included Beyonce, Richard Gere, Minnie Driver, Joan Collins and Lauren Hutton.						THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

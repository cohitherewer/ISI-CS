 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Multans Romeo and Juliet tale pulls at Pak heartstrings
				 	 A human rights activist during a rally to protest against the killing of Afsheen Musarrat in Multan. (Reuters)																								Multan, Dec. 11: The story of Afsheen and Hassan reads like a modern-day Romeo and Juliet. Cousins and neighbours in a small village in central Pakistan, they studied at the same university and fell head over heels in love.																								Yet their misfortune was to come from feuding branches of the same landowning family. Like Shakespeares famous star-crossed lovers, their illicit romance ultimately ended in tragedy. 																								As he was formally arrested this week, Afsheens father confessed in tears that he had strangled his own 23-year-old daughter, ostensibly killing her to protect the familys honour. I gave her sleeping pills in a cup of tea and then strangled her with her dupatta, a handcuffed Musarrat Sahu said in a statement. Look sir, when I have no honour, I have nothing else. Honour is the only thing a man has, he told the police. I can still hear her screams, she was my favourite daughter. I want to destroy my hands and end my life.																								Musarrats agony reflects a broader turmoil within Pakistan, as the country struggles to reconcile ancient tribal and Islamic traditions with modern-day values. Every year hundreds of Pakistani women fall victim to honour killings, murdered by brothers, husbands or fathers because they are said to have transgressed the traditional social codes that govern life in much of rural Pakistan. Few of the perpetrators are brought to justice, with police reluctant or unwilling to intervene in a family matter.																								Those who are arrested are often freed, under Islamic laws that allow a victims heirs to pardon the murderer  in such cases usually a close relative  in return for money. But human rights activists and journalists have driven Afsheens story on to newspaper front pages, and it has become a test case of President Pervez Musharrafs resolve.																								Musharraf, who espouses a modern and liberal version of Islam, has been criticised for doing nothing to reform Islamic laws that human rights groups say give women little protection against rape, violence and murder. 																								Afsheen was studying computer science at a university in Multan when she fell in love with Hassan, family friends and servants said. Afsheens is an educated family, full of civil servants, engineers and lawyers. But in a region where almost every marriage is arranged, her romance did not please her grandfather Allah Ditta. Locals talk of political rivalry between the two families.																								So, when Afsheen finished her studies, she was hurriedly married off to a cousin from another branch of the family.																								A few weeks later, mounting pressure drove Afsheen to run off with Hassan to the home of a sympathetic relative in Rawalpindi. But the family soon tracked them down, and forced her to return, Musarrat said. Five days later she was dead.																								Hassan, on the run since Afsheen died, is close to despair. Her family swore on the Quran they would not harm her if she went back with them, but they didnt keep their word, he said by telephone. My life is in severe danger.																								Mohammad Yousaf Malick, assistant superintendent of police in the nearby town of Kabir Wala calls grandfather Allah Ditta the driving force behind the sorry saga. But the 75-year-old man says the army and police are framing him.																								The girl was ill, she had a breathing problem, he said. It was because of this illness that she died.																								But Afsheens autopsy report, obtained by Reuters, tells a different story, describing the mark of a cloth around her neck, and a similar mark on the back of her right hand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, November 20, 2003 				 Presidents palace bubble breached
				 	 The front page of Wednesdays Daily Mirror . (AFP)																								London, Nov. 19 (Reuters): The White House voiced confidence in British security today after an undercover reporter infiltrated Buckingham Palace and posed as a footman in President George W. Bushs royal suite.																								As the palace launched an urgent investigation into the embarrassing breach, Bushs team played down fears that his critics in Britain  be it by protest or sleuth  would burst the bubble in which the President usually travels. We have every confidence in the British security, White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said. 																								Buchan spoke hours after a tabloid journalist said he had tricked his way onto the palace staff in the run-up to Bushs visit and, as a royal footman, was even due to serve breakfast to the Bush retinue this morning.																								We are living in an age of terror. We employed very basic subterfuge here and got incredible access, said Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan. Its on one level almost bordering on the humorous, but in fact its incredibly serious.																								A red-faced Buckingham Palace said it would launch an urgent probe after a lapse that the Daily Mirror said could have exposed the worlds most powerful man to a terror attack at the heart of the British establishment. We are conducting a full investigation into how this reporter came to be employed at the palace, said a spokeswoman.																								The British government insisted the President was never at risk from the liveried intruder.																								This person did not pose a risk to the President or to the queen, said interior minister David Blunkett. We are now turning our attention to those who may cause a risk.

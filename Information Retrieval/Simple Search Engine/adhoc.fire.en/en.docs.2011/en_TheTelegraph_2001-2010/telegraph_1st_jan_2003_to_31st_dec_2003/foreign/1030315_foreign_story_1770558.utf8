 ROBERT KAHN				 	 Jessica Lange																								Los Angeles, March 14: They cant scare Jessica Lange away.																								Entertainment industry insiders for weeks have suggested that actors who rant against US policy in Iraq risk alienating their fans or losing lucrative endorsement contracts.																								But Lange says such stories are merely scare tactics designed to make people shy away from speaking out.																								Theyre hollow threats, Lange said this week at the premiere of Normal, an HBO drama about transgender issues.																								It doesnt occur to me to consider that when Im speaking out because I feel so strongly about this that nothing would deter me. Lange was one of the several celebrities who recently delivered an antiwar petition  signed by more than 1 million people  to the US mission to the UN. 																								The Bush administration is hellbent on this and I think they have been since last September, the two-time Oscar winner said.																								Nothing that the other religious or political leaders in the world say seems to affect the drive theyre on. 																								For her part, Jane Anderson, the director and writer of the Jessica Lange-starrer Normal, said she isnt worried Langes sentiment would affect viewership of the drama. The film stars Tom Wilkinson as a man awakening to the realisation he would rather be a woman.					 LOS ANGELES TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 Penn to join Iraq press corps
				 	 Sean Penn																								San Francisco, Nov. 26 (Reuters): Sean Penn may be joining the press corps in Iraq.																								The actor, who made a controversial visit to Iraq last winter, is considering going back, and this time publishing his accounts of life in the war-torn country for the San Francisco Chronicle, the papers editor Phil Bronstein said yesterday. He brings a very keen directors and actors eye to slices of life in Baghdad, said Bronstein, an old friend of Penns who read some of the unpublished material Penn wrote during his last trip to Iraq.																								Bronstein said the arrangement with Penn remains informal, since he has not yet decided if and when to return to Iraq. Penn sparked controversy last winter when he travelled to Iraq to speak out against the planned US war to topple Saddam Hussein. But if he were to return, he would probably focus on everyday life, said Bronstein, who described Penns earlier dispatches as short vignettes that caught moments in peoples lives and what they were doing.

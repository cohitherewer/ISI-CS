The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, May 06, 2003 				 23 killed in Bangladesh storm
																								Dhaka, May 5 (Reuters): A storm packing hail, heavy rain and winds of up to 120 km per hour has devastated a Bangladeshi village, killing at least 23 people with 19 missing, witnesses and state television said today.																								Hundreds of mud-walled and tin-shed houses were razed, trees were felled and electricity poles uprooted when the storm swept through Noapoti village, around 180 km east of Dhaka last night, a witness said. 																								Hardly a structure in the village was left standing, the initial television reports said. The victims included men, women and children, said Mohammad Afzal, a reporter in Brahmanbaria. At least 400 were injured.																								He said more than 100 people were admitted to hospital with injuries caused by flying debris, such as roofing material torn from houses.																								He quoted survivors as saying the storm struck as they were preparing to go to bed and lasted about half-an-hour. It virtually mowed down the whole village, one survivor said.

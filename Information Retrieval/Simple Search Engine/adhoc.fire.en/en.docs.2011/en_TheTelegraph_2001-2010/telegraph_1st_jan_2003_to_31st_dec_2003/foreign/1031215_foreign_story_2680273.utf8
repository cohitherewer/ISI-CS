				 	 President George W. Bush addresses America after the capture of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Earlier, Bush told Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist: What an enchanting day, a day of relief this is for the Iraqi people. (Reuters)																								London, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Saddam Husseins capture will delight most Iraqis and devastate the deposed dictators loyalists, but even this stunning victory for US forces may not quell the violence they face in Iraq.																								Even as Iraqis took to the streets to rejoice at the seizure of the once feared ruler, analysts said it was premature to assume that resistance to the US-led occupation would crumble.																								There will be a reduction in operations sponsored by former regime loyalists, but this is not the full story because they are not the only group involved, said Mustafa Alani, an Iraq analyst at Londons Royal United Services Institute.																								It wont affect those by Iraqi or Arab mujahideen and might increase them as those who did not want to be branded as supporters of Saddam might now join a resistance with a more nationalist dimension, he said.																								US officials have blamed Saddam loyalists and foreign militants for unremitting attacks that have killed nearly 200 US soldiers since President George W. Bush declared major combat in Iraq over on May 1.																								Saddam had eluded capture for eight months after Baghdad fell on April 9 to US forces, who also failed to find any of the weapons of mass destruction cited by the US and Britain as the main reason for the war.																								Its a huge coup and most Iraqis will be celebrating the capture of this tyrant, said Toby Dodge of Warwick University and the International Institute for Strategic Studies.																								But its not as clear-cut as that. The insurgency has grown well beyond Saddams control or even influence. There are 15 to 30 groups that have no direct contact, financially or strategically, with Saddam Hussein, he said.																								Even the commander of US forces in Iraq conceded that Saddams capture did not necessarily mean resistance would end.																								We do not expect at this point in time that we will have a complete elimination of those attacks, Lieutenant-General Ricardo Sanchez said in Baghdad.																								But Iraqi Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, a member of the Iraqi Governing Council, took a more optimistic view.																								With the arrest of Saddam, the financial resources feeding terrorists have been destroyed and his arrest will put an end to terrorist acts in Iraq, he told the Iranian news agency IRNA.																								Timothy Garden, of Kings College London and the Royal Institute of International Affairs, said Saddams capture would boost the morale of US-led forces and of the US-appointed governing council, but might not stem the bloodshed.																								It seems most unlikely that Saddam was micro-managing the violence because that would have made him very vulnerable to capture, Garden said. 																								Several analysts said it was a vital psychological blow that buried lingering Iraqi fears of a comeback by Saddam and opened the way for a trial that could help Iraq deal with its past.																								It really destroys forever the idea of a return to Saddam for many who thought he was a kind of legend capable of resistance and carrying the Iraqi flag again, said Abdel-Monem Said, director of Egypts Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies.																								Most important it will be an opportunity politically as he was caught alive to put him on trial and all the atrocities of this regime will be in the open, he said.																								US forces have previously detained or killed 40 of a list of 55 most wanted Iraqis, topped by Saddam. Among them were his two sons Uday and Qusay, killed in a blaze of firepower in July.																								Alani said it was a propaganda coup for the Americans to have captured Saddam alive, especially after their galling failure to seize al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.																								Its an intelligence prize because they can get information from him about cells working now. And its a huge victory because he was the head of the regime and not like anyone else on the list of 55 most wanted.																								Tracking down Saddam in his hometown of Tikrit could give renewed hope for US efforts to stabilise and rebuild Iraq.																								His capture gives the US a window of opportunity, said Dodge. If they redouble their efforts and increase their troop commitment, they could contain or even roll back the insurgency. But the temptation of Bush, facing a re-election campaign, will be to call this victory and cut and run. That would be a disaster for Iraq, for West Asia and for the strategic interests of the US in the region and beyond.

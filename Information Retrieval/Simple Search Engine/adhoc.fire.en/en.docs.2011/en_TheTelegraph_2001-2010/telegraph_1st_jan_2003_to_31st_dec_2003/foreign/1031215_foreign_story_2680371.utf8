The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Finally, a link with September 11
 CON COUGHLIN																								Baghdad, Dec. 14: For anyone attempting to find evidence to justify the war in Iraq, the discovery of a document that directly links Mohammed Atta with the Baghdad training camp of Abu Nidal the infamous Palestinian terrorist, appears almost too good to be true.																								Ever since four hijacked civilian jets devastated the US eastern seaboard on September 11, 2001, there have been any number of reports circulating among western intelligence agencies suggesting Iraq under Saddam Hussein had close links to al Qaida. Most of the claims relate to meetings between al Qaida and Iraqi intelligence for co-operation on matters such as funding, training and equipment.																								Prior to the discovery of the document published today by The Daily Telegraph, the most controversial report related to the suggestion that Atta had met Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani, a senior Iraqi intelligence officer, in Prague in April 2001.																								But while both President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have dropped numerous hints that they believe there was a significant level of co-operation between Saddam and al Qaida, their respective intelligence agencies have actively sought to downplay the significance of the relationship, especially the suggestion that Saddam was in any way involved in the September 11 attacks.																								To this end Americas Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), with the backing of Britains MI6, have poured scorn on Attas Prague meeting.																								However, the tantalising detail provided in the intelligence document uncovered by Iraqs interim government suggests that Attas involvement with Iraqi intelligence may well have been far deeper than has hitherto been acknowledged.																								Written in the neat, precise hand of Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, former head of the Iraqi Intelligence Service and one of those named in the US governments pack of cards of most-wanted Iraqis not to have been apprehended, the personal memo to Saddam is signed by Habbush in distinctive green ink.																								Headed simply Intelligence Items, and dated July 1, 2001, it is addressed: To the President of the Baath Revolution Party and President of the Republic, may God protect you.																								The first paragraph states that Mohammed Atta, an Egyptian national, came with Abu Ammer (an Arabic nom-de-guerre  his real identity is unknown) and we hosted him in Abu Nidals house at al-Dora under our direct supervision. We arranged a work programme for him for three days with a team dedicated to working with him... He displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy.																								There is nothing in the document that provides any clue to the identity of the targets, although Iraqi officials say it is a coded reference to the September 11 attacks.																								The second item contains a report of how Iraqi intelligence, helped by a small team from the al Qaida organisation, arranged for an (unspecified) shipment from Niger to reach Baghdad by way of Libya and Syria.																								Iraqi officials believe this is a reference to the controversial shipments of uranium ore Iraq acquired from Niger to aid Saddam in his efforts to develop an atom bomb, although there is no explicit reference in the document to this.																								Habbush writes that the successful completion of the shipment was the fruit of your excellent secret meeting with Bashir al-Asad (the Syrian President) on the Iraqi-Syrian border, and concludes: May God protect you and save you to all Arab nations.																								While it is almost impossible to ascertain whether or not the document is legitimate or a clever fake, Iraqi officials working for the interim government are convinced of its authenticity, even though they decline to reveal where and how they obtained it. It is not important how we found it, said a senior Iraqi security official. The important thing is that we did find it and the information it contains.																								A leading member of Iraqs governing council, said he was convinced of the documents authenticity. There are people who are working with us who used to work with Habbush who are convinced that it is his handwriting and signature. We are uncovering evidence all the time of Saddams dealings with al Qaida, and this document shows the extent of the old regimes involvement with the international terrorist network.																								This is the second document published by The Daily Telegraph that appears to highlight Saddams links with al Qaida. Earlier this year, it published details of another Iraqi intelligence document that indicated Saddams regime was attempting to set up a meeting with Osama bin Laden, the al Qaida leader, who was then based in Sudan.																								Intelligence experts point out that a memo such as that written by Habbush would of necessity be vague and short. Trained intelligence officers hate putting anything down in writing, said a former CIA officer. You never know where it might turn up.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Friday, March 07, 2003 				 11 killed in Gaza raid 
																								Jabalya, Gaza Strip, March 6 (Reuters): Israeli forces killed 11 Palestinians, including some torn apart by a tank shell, when troops stormed a Gaza Strip refugee camp today, after a suicide bomber killed 15 people on an Israeli bus.																								More than 140 Palestinians were wounded during the nine-hour Israeli raid, part of a spasm of violence that has battered US hopes of calming the 29-month-old conflict ahead of a possible war on Iraq. 																								The Gaza operation came hours after the first Palestinian suicide bombing in two months.

 Monday, February 10, 2003 				 German kin shun Rumsfeld for war talk
 TONY PATERSON																								Feb. 9: The Rumsfelds of Weyhe-Sudweyhe, an unremarkable red-brick suburb of Bremen, were once proud of their long-lost cousin, Americas secretary of state for defence  but no longer.																								Like many Germans, they are appalled by Donald Rumsfelds hawkish attitude to military action against Saddam Hussein. About 18,000 anti-war demonstrators marched through Munich yesterday to protest at his presence at an international security conference  chanting slogans such as No room for Rumsfeld!																								We think it is dreadful that Donald Rumsfeld is out there pushing for a war against Iraq, Karin Cecere (nee Rumsfeld), 59, said from her two-up, two-down home. We are embarrassed to be related to him, she said.																								Margarete Rumsfeld, her 85-year-old mother, was equally dismissive: We dont have much to do with him anymore. Nowadays hes just the American defence secretary to us, but for Gods sake, hed better not start a war.																								They used to feel differently. Twenty-five years ago, the German Rumsfelds were thrilled to welcome Rumsfeld  then the US ambassador to Nato stationed in Brussels  into their extended family.																								Like many Americans keen to trace their European antecedents, Rumsfeld had made contact with the Weyhe-Sudweyhe Rumsfelds, a branch of the family with whom his near relations had lost touch since his great-great-grandfather, Heinrich, emigrated to America during the 19th century.																								Rumsfeld paid three visits to Dietrich Rumsfeld, a bricklayer, and his wife Margarete in their small artisans cottage. On the last occasion, they greeted him with chicken soup and roast pork for lunch. It was a really pleasant family gathering, almost like a wedding, said Karin Cecere. Mr Rumsfeld seemed a genuinely nice man. It is such a shame about his war ambitions.																								She had grown up during the Second World War and her instincts were to search for a solution to the deadlock with Saddam that did not involve military action. I was born in the war and saw its aftermath, and my mother went through it, she said. There must be a peaceful way of solving the Iraq problem.																								This change of heart over their Rumsfeld cousin reflects the mood in Germany. More than 60 per cent of Germans oppose a war and the US defence secretary has become a hate figure for the countrys peace movement. His desire to topple Saddam by force is at odds with the Social Democrat-led government of Chancellor Gerhard Schrder, which is opposed to war in Iraq.																								Even before his arrival in Germany yesterday, Mr																								Rumsfeld had faced fierce criticism from senior German																								government officials for describing France and Germany																								as quot;old Europe quot;. 																								Last week he caused further outrage when he told the																								House Armed Services Committee in Washington that																								Germany, like quot;Libya and Cuba quot;, had indicated that it																								 quot;did not want to help in any way quot; the international																								efforts to tackle Iraq. 																								The German government attempted to play down the																								criticism. quot;Mr Rumsfeld is like he is. I can say no																								more, quot; said Joschka Fischer, the foreign minister.																								Other senior politicians were more explicit. quot;Rumsfeld																								has flipped out - his behaviour is impossible, quot; said																								Klaus Kinkel, a Free Democrat and former foreign																								minister.																								Some Germans have misgivings, however, that their																								countrys hard line against war with Iraq may backfire																								- especially if, as widely predicted, France drops its																								own objections at the last minute and joins in																								military action.																								Angela Merkel, the leader of the Christian Democrats,																								yesterday became the first opposition figure to call																								for Germany to become involved. quot;If it is impossible																								to solve the situation peacefully then Germany has to																								take part in a military operation, quot; she said, accusing																								Mr Schrders government of quot;spreading ill-will and																								confusion quot; in Nato.																								In Munich Mr Rumsfeld sought to dispel the furore over																								his own comments by claiming that he had intended the																								phrase quot;old Europe quot; as a term of affection, like that																								of quot;old friends quot;.																								He admitted that he was sometimes inclined to be blunt																								- but blamed it on his German roots. quot;My family																								originates from northern Germany. People there are																								well known for their direct and clear manner of																								speaking. quot;																								His explanation did not impress most Germans - least																								of all his cousins in Weyhe-Sudweyhe. Mrs Cecere said:																								 quot;Were all in favour of plain-speaking but our																								relation goes just too far. quot;					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

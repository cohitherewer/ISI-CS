Briefs  War Briefs  Gujarat support for Bush  Ahmedabad, April 8 (PTI): A city-based NGO today held a rally in support of the US in its fight against terrorism.  The support to the US in its attack against the Saddam Hussein regime stems from the optimism that the superpower, in its tirade to quell the menace of global terrorism, will help India get free from the evil being fomented by neighbouring Pakistan, convener of Alliance Against Terrorism Nagesh Bhandari said. Several members of the organisation shouted slogans condemning Saddam and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf as they pledged support to the US and Britain.  Chemical tests  Near Karbala (Reuters): New US tests indicate that substances  found at sites in central Iraq are not chemical weapons  agents as first suspected, US military sources said. The  latest tests turned out negative, one source said. US military  officers had said initial tests on substances found near  the central Iraq town of Hindiya suggested the presence  of nerve agents sarin and tabun and the blister agent lewisite.  Military sources said it was not yet clear what the substances  were.  Vienna (Reuters): The Iraq war has so far produced only a handful of refugees, but it is too early to rule out a humanitarian crisis like the one sparked by the 1991 Gulf War, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers said. There were more Iraqi refugees in the industrialised world than from any other single country, having already fled the rule of Saddam Hussein before the war began, he said.  Warship siege  Sydney (Reuters): Anti-war protesters stopped an Australian  warship leaving Sydney Harbour for Iraq by attaching themselves  to the ship with mountain climbing gear and laying an underwater  object in front of the vessel. They surprised the water  police as the guided-missile frigate HMAS Sydney  steamed towards Sydney Harbour. Television footage showed  one protester attaching himself to the bow of the ship and  unfurled a No War banner. Greenpeace said in a statement  that it had stopped the ship.  First Pak strike  Peshawar (Reuters): Shops and businesses were closed in  some Pakistani cities on Tuesday in the first strikes by  traders against the war on Iraq. The stoppages, called by  several traders groups and backed by hardline Islamic groups,  were partly observed in Karachi and some other cities.  Copyright

 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Scandal sucks in Parmalat family
				 Stefano Tanzi leaves  a meeting with prosecutors in Parma on Tuesday. (AFP)																								Milan, Dec. 30 (Reuters): Italian magistrates questioned Parmalats founder, his son and his niece today after the arrested patriarch admitted misappropriating hundreds of millions of euros from the family-controlled food group.																								Magistrates believe founder Calisto Tanzi falsified accounts at Italys eighth-biggest industrial group for years, pushing the firm into insolvency with debts that prosecutors have put at 10 billion to 13 billion euros ($12.5-16.2 billion). 																								The 65 year-old Tanzi told investigators yesterday he had funnelled around 500 million euros away from Parmalat and into other firms, including Parmatour, a family-run tourism company.																								We will now have to analyse the flow of cash (of these companies) one by one to see how it came in, how it came out and where it went, Tanzi lawyer Fabio Belloni told reporters as he entered Milans San Vittore jail where his client is detained.																								As the investigation into the scandal spread, magistrates in Tanzis home town of Parma questioned his son, Stefano, and his niece, Paola Visconti. It was the first time magistrates talked to the pair, both of whom are Parmalat board members.																								Magistrates, who believe Calisto Tanzi embezzled more than 800 million euros ($1 billion) from his global food empire over the past decade, grilled him for a third day running today at the gloomy San Vittore jail.																								The billions of euros missing from Parmalats books have prompted comparisons with the bankruptcy of US energy trader Enron two years ago and raised questions about the effectiveness of Italian regulators, banks and international ratings agencies.																								The US Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday it was filing a suit against Parmalat seeking substantial fines.

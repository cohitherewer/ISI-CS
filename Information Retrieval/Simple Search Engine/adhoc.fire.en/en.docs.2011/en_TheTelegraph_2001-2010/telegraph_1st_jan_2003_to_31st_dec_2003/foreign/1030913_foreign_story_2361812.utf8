 Saturday, September 13, 2003 				 Israel faces global anger over move on Arafat 
																								Jerusalem, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Israel faced an international outcry today over its decision to remove Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, a threat that drew tens of thousands of supporters into the streets to rally to his defence.																								The decision yesterday turned Arafat into a hero... and thats a shame, commentator Roni Shaked wrote in Israels largest newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. Calling Arafat an obstacle to peace but under US pressure not to exile him after two suicide bombings killed 15 Israelis on Tuesday, Israels security cabinet vowed yesterday to remove him in a manner that will be determined separately.																								The wording left open options that could include killing Arafat  a proposal which Israeli newspapers said defence minister Shaul Mofaz raised but Prime Minister Ariel Sharon shot down  or expelling him from the Palestinian territories.																								After the Israeli decision, thousands of Palestinians flocked to Arafats headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah and pledged to defend him with their lives.																								Crowds numbering in the thousands also rallied in other cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in Arafats support.

 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 Aherns daughter seals $1m book deal
				 	 Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern																								Dublin, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Irish Prime Minister Bertie Aherns younger daughter was celebrating today after securing a book deal worth $1 million from a US publisher.																								Journalism graduate Cecilia Ahern, 21, landed the deal with Disney unit Hyperion for two novels, the first of which, entitled P.S. I Love You, is to be published next year. 																								Earlier this week it was reported she had landed a separate 300,000 euro ($314,300) deal with London-based Harper Collins to publish in Ireland and Britain.																								Last night was just unbelievable. I got another deal with America for two books and for a million dollars. I cant believe it, she told state broadcaster RTE. Aherns Irish-based literary agent said P.S. I Love You  which took less than a year to write  was also currently under consideration by the US film industry.																								Theres tremendous interest in Hollywood at the moment and I think Ill have a deal for the film rights closed by next week, Marianne Gunn OConnor said.																								OConnor said Aherns novel  in which a man who dies of a brain tumour helps his partner through her grief by leaving her a collection of posthumous letters  had hit a chord with US publishers. Since September 11 America has been limping along and people are depleted of good news and Cecilia has come up with a book that has an amazing feelgood factor. Its about how to handle grief and it gives a message of hope  that love never dies.

																								Karachi, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Hundreds of angry Pakistani Shias went on a rampage in Karachi today, destroying property and setting fire to an American fast food restaurant after the funeral of a doctor killed by gunmen.																								Crowds of youths attacked a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) outlet and smashed up a number of cars and motorcycles after the funeral of Abne Hasan, a Shia doctor killed yesterday, police and witnesses said.																								The mourners hurled stones and smashed glasses in KFC. Later they set it ablaze, deputy police chief Tariq Jamil said from Karachis central district, where the restaurant was attacked. The fire was quickly put out, witnesses said.																								Pakistani hardline Islamists and Shia groups are traditionally anti-American, but it was not clear why a US fast food chain was targeted. Jamil said the violence took place after funeral prayers attended by around 2,500 people for one of two Shias killed in two different incidents in Karachi yesterday.																								The crowd also attacked a petrol station and a police picket near the graveyard, he said.

 Thursday, June 26, 2003 				 Case over fully-clad letdown
																								London, June 25 (AFP): A disappointed theatre-goer who expected to see naked dancers leaping across the stage, only to find them fully-clothed, had his complaint upheld yesterday by Britains advertising watchdog. 																								Publicity leaflets for a two-night engagement in London by the respected Phoenix Dance Theatre had shown two honed naked bodies  one male, one female  prancing through the air. 																								But it turned out that the images did not resemble the actual performance, according to the unidentified theatre-goer in a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority. 																								In its defence, the Phoenix Dance Theatre said the black and white photo was intended to reflect the prowess of its dancers. 																								But the authority rejected the claim, noting that the photo of the naked pair was positioned next to list of performance times. Because of that, the authority considered that readers were likely to expect that the performances contained naked dancers, it said.

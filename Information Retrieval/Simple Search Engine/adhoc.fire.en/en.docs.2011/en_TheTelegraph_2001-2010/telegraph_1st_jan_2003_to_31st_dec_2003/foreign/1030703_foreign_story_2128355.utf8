The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Pervez paid no wealth tax for 5 yrs
 New Delhi, July 2 (PTI): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf paid no wealth tax for five years on his extensive land and properties though he had declared in November 1999 that he had done so, according to a US-based magazine run by a Pakistani.And finally when he did pay wealth tax in 1999-2000 on his assets worth much more than Pakistani Rs 30-40 million in the market, he coughed up only Rs 710, the South Asia Tribune reported, claiming it had a copy of the official document. The magazine alleged that his real wealth was worth more than Rs 40 million but Musharraf had declared onlyRs 1 million. The magazine said Musharraf received millions when he recently sold his land in Bahawalpur. This amount should have been reflected in his wealth declarations. Quoting the documents, it said his total income tax deducted at source from 1994 to 1999 was Rs 115,524 on a total declared income of Rs 1.24 million.While musharraf had declared an income of rs 146,629 in 1994-95, his income was officially assessed at rs 151,189. Similarly, he paid a tax of rs 24,472 in 1996-97 and rs 31,927 the next year. After he became the army chief in 1998 and his income rose to rs 226,846, musharraf surprisingly paid only rs 18,180 or over rs 13,700 less than in the previous year, it said.  Copyright

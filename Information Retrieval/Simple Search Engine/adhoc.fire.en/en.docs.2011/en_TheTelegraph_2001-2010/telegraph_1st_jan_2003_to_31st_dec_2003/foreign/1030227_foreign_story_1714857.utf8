 Thursday, February 27, 2003 				 Anger over Gandhi tag on Osama
																								Colombo, Feb. 26 (PTI): Attempts by an Arabic newspaper editor to compare Osama bin Laden with Mahatma Gandhi drew strong reactions at a Commonwealth press meet here today.																								Abdul Bari Atwan, editor of the London-based Al-Quds al-Arabi, one of the few journalists to have interviewed bin Laden, said the al Qaida chief reminded me of Gandhi, a prince of peace. Like a man who has given up all his possessions to take up a cause. 																								However, the comparison drew protests from Indian scribe Kuldip Nayar, participating in the biennial Commonwealth Press Union conference, who sprung to his feet saying: Dont drag people who are not here (into the argument).																								Atwan also described the mastermind of the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the US as a man of average intelligence, but with good manners. He said bin Laden hated Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein more than the US .

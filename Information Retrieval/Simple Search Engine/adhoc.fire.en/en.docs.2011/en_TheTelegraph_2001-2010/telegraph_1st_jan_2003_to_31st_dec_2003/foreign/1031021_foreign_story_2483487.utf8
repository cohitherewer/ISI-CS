 Tuesday, October 21, 2003 				 Blaine ends stunt, heads to hospital 
																								London, Oct. 20 (Reuters): Illusionist David Blaine was recovering in hospital today after starving himself for 44 days in a transparent box hanging by Londons Thames river, a stunt that drew breast-baring admirers and egg-pelting critics.																								A filthy, unshaven Blaine emerged late yesterday and broke down in tears in front of thousands jostling for a glimpse of the 30-year-old New Yorker, who says he consumed only water during his ordeal.																								Medical teams checked Blaine on the scene before he was carried on a stretcher into an ambulance and taken to the London Independent Hospital. Doctors said he had taken his body to the limit.																								Forty-four days is about as far as you can go without long-term damage. Another week would have probably killed him, said Tom Sanders, a nutrition expert at Kings College London.

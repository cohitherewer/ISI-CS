																								Los Angeles, May 30: Barbra Streisand has filed a lawsuit against an amateur photographer, claiming he is violating her privacy by displaying a picture of her bluff-top Malibu, California, estate on a website designed to document erosion and excessive development along Californias 1,150-mile coastline.																								The lawsuit filed in a court in Santa Monica, California, beside seeking $10 million in damages, asks retired software engineer Kenneth Adelman to remove the image of Streisands mansion from the 12,000 photos he has posted on www.californiacoastline.org.																								Adelman and his wife, Gabrielle, have been snapping pictures for months from their helicopter to show the splendours of the coastline and various environmental threats. 																								The quality of the photographs is staggering, the lawsuit says, so anyone with an Internet connection can view the layout of Streisands pool, the positioning of her parasols and deck chairs, as well as the location of her windows, French doors and balconies of her main and guest houses  none of which are visible from the ground. 																								The singer and actress has taken steps to shield her private life from public view and protect her privacy, says the lawsuit, which argues the photograph intrudes on her privacy and violates a state law that targets the prying, telephoto lenses of paparazzi. 																								But Adelmans lawyer dismissed the lawsuit as one without legal merit and an effort to intimidate his client. 																								Mr Adelman is not a paparazzo. Hes not doing this for profit or stalking anyone, said his lawyer, Richard Kendall. 																								Kendall noted that the photograph of Streisands house, which also includes two neighbouring houses, does not capture an image of Streisand or any other human beings.  ``There isnt a constitutional  right to privacy of the placement of your parasols and deck  chairs on your outside patio, Kendall said.  ``The anti-paparazzi statute is designed to prevent trespass  and the stalking of celebrities. He is shooting from a helicopter  far offshore and the statute does not immunise beachfront  mansions from aerial photographs.  Streisands lawyer, John  Gatti, said the lawsuit was filed under seal, which specifically  requires that the complaint not be publicly released until  a judge determines whether it should be released or kept  private.  ``An important civil right of  privacy is involved, Gatti said. ``The lawsuit  seeks to establish the extent to which individuals are protected  against technologically enhanced encroachment into their  private property.  Alonzo Wickers, a First-Amendment  lawyer who represents television networks and newspapers  including the Los Angeles Times, said it will be difficult  for Streisand to prove an intrusion into her privacy or  a violation of the anti-paparazzi law because she does not  appear in the photograph.  ``If it were a picture of her  sunbathing topless, they might have a case,  Wicker said. The legal standard, he said, is capturing an  image that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.  Kenneth and Gabrielle Adelman,  California Institute of Technology graduates who retired  in their 30s after selling two start-up software companies  for $465 million, have been using digital photography to  snap pictures of every inch of the coastline.  She flies their helicopter while  he leans out the side snapping pictures in an effort to  record images of every cliff, beach, rocky outcropping and  housing development along the coast.  Adelman said he takes his pictures  from an elevation of 500 feet in public airspace over the  ocean - using a standard lens, not the enormous telephoto  lenses preferred by paparazzi.  The lawsuit contends that the  high resolution of the photographs allows Web site browsers  to click their way to a considerably larger and more detailed  view of Streisands home. Browsers also can pick out  Streisands home because the photo includes a caption  that identifies it as ``Streisand Estate, Malibu.  In two letters to Adelman, Streisands  lawyers demanded that he remove the photograph or face legal  consequences, including punitive damages and attorneys  fees.  Adelman refused, citing protection  under the First Amendment to publish such photographs..  He said he didnt target Streisands home and  didnt add the caption below the photograph. Adelman  said made the Web site interactive so that anyone from the  public could add captions to help identify features along  the coastline. Someone did, he said.  Adelman said his project is an  effort to establish a photographic record of the entire  coast . The only place he has yet to photograph is Vandenberg  Air Force Base, which has so far denied him permission to  fly by on the grounds his photos might cause a security  risk. A status conference on the case  is set for Aug. 28 before Superior Court Judge Allan J.  Goodman. 					 LOS ANGELES TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

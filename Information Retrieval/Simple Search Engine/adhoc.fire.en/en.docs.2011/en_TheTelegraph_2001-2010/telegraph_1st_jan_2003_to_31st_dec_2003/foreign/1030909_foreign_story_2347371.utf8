 Tuesday, September 09, 2003 				 EU hunts for rotting images
																								Brussels, Sept. 8 (Reuters): The European Commission has started the hunt for images of rotting lungs and dying cancer patients to be printed on cigarette packets across the EU, a spokesman said today.																								Next month cigarettes sold in the EU must show even larger health warnings than now, and from mid-2004 member states will have the option of adding pictures to the packs showing the hazards of smoking, the EUs executive body said. 																								The European Commission announced a tender today for organisations to come up with images and test their impact on different European audiences. 																								Research in countries with illustrated health warnings have proven they speak more than a thousand words, health and consumer protection commissioner David Byrne said.

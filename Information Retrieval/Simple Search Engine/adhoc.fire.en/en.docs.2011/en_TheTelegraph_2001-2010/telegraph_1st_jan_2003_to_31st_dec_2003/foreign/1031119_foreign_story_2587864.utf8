Nelly made it easier to cope with a first pregnancy, Canadian pop star Nelly Furtado has said.																																	It was good to get busy with the recording during the pregnancy because this way there was no time to worry about the physical transformations that I went through, she told Portuguese daily newspaper Correio da Manha. This is my profession, I cant ignore it. This way I have already given a lesson in responsibility to my daughter.																																	The 24-year-old, who gave birth in September to daughter Nevis, wrote and produced most of the tracks on her second album Folklore while she was pregnant. Furtado said the new album, which comes out on November 24 in Europe, was heavily inspired by memories of childhood vacations spent on Portugals verdant mid-Atlantic Azores archipelago, where her parents hail from. 																																	The singers first album, which features a mixture of musical styles, sold over six-million discs around the world since its release in 2000, leading one critic the call the singer the best thing to come out of Canada since maple syrup.

The collection, containing 129 lots, had been valued at between 5.75 and 8 million euros due to the rarity of some of its pieces, including tete-beche (head-to-tail or inverted impression) blocks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 In faraway Delhi, news of capture chewed on with afternoon meal
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Al-Sakab New Delhi, Dec. 14: Adday  . Al-Sakab, the charge daffaires of the Iraqi embassy here,  watched news of Saddam Husseins capture amid entertaining  a few guests he had called for a Sunday afternoon meal at  his Vasant Kunj residence.																								There is nothing more that I know about it. I heard it on TV like you and the rest of the world, Al-Sakab said. He had no means of confirming it himself, nor did he make any effort to do so as it would have been futile.																								The embassy at upscale Vasant Vihar was wrapped in the quiet of a lazy winter Sunday that was not ruffled, at least outwardly, by the news.																								But then, the Iraqi outpost in Delhi has been getting used to a less active life-after-Saddam as the Americans took over in Baghdad. There has been a sharp drop in the number of visitors over the past seven months. And the few who came were greeted with the uncertainty the Iraqi diplomats and staffers have lived in since US troops swept into Baghdad on April 9, catching news of home mostly on TV.																								Al-Sakab refused to say what the capture of Saddam would mean to the denizens of the embassy. Nothing has changed, it will be like before.																								Saddams huge portraits that greeted visitors to the embassy disappeared when the regime fell. Amid efforts to sweep all traces of him from the building, only the green-and-white national flag has stood with certainty.																								In a recent chat, Al-Sakab had made it clear it would be wrong to identify him or other Iraqi diplomats here with Saddam. We represent our country Iraq and the Iraqi people. He had scotched rumours that some of them were trying to seek political asylum in India. People write and say anything they want about Iraq these days.																								Al-Sakabs wife and three children are with him in Delhi, but he worries about his brothers and sisters who are in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities, as do his fellow diplomats and the 120-odd families that are here. He said he had not been able to speak to his relatives at home for several days.																								At the embassy today, only a Nepalese couple, Gagan Gurung and his wife Geeta  local employees  were present. But the couple had no knowledge of the developments in Iraq. Asked if she was aware about Saddams capture, Geeta  alone at the time as Gagan had gone to the market  said: Is that so?																								It was a question many Iraqis asked when they first heard the reports.

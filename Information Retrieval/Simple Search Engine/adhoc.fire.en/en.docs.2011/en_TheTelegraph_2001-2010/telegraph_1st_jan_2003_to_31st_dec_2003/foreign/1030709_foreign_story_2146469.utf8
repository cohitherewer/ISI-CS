 Wednesday, July 09, 2003 				 Di to be recast as comic hero
 New York, July 8 (Reuters):  Britains Princess Diana will be reincarnated as a mutant  comic book superhero this autumn, according to publisher  Marvel Comics.																								The character will appear in a five-series storyline called Di Another Day in Marvels X-Statix monthly comic, a spinoff from its popular X-Men, Marvel spokesperson Brian Reinert said yesterday.																								The first of the comic books will go on sale on September 10.																								Di appears as one of the team of super-powered mutants in a satirical look at fame and pop culture, Reinert said.																								Theyre more concerned about their bank accounts than saving people from injuries and saving the world, he said.																								X-Statix writer Peter Milligan said the late princess was tailor-made for the series because she is someone famous for being famous.																								At a glance, Diana may not resemble the flying, teleporting, lethally oscillating characters that populate my comic, but the strange power she exerts from beyond the grave certainly makes her a valid subject to explore, Milligan said in a statement issued by Marvel. And, of course, she looks great in Spandex!																								A Buckingham Palace spokesperson has called the idea utterly appalling and a cheap attempt to cash in on Dianas fame and the tragic circumstances surrounding her death.

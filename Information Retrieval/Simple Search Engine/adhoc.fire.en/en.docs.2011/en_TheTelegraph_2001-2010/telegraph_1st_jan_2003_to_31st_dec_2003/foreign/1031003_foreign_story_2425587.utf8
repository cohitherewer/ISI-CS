 Friday, October 03, 2003 				 Halle Berrys marriage fails to live another day
				 	 Halle Berry with Eric Benet Los Angeles, Oct. 2 (AP):  Actress Halle Berry announced she has separated from her  husband, rhythm and blues singer Eric Benet, after less  than three years of marriage.																								Eric and I have had marital problems for some time now and have tried to work things out together, Berry said yesterday in a statement. 																								However, at this point, I feel we need time apart to re-evaluate our union. We ask that you respect our privacy as we are going through this emotional time. Benets representatives did not immediately return a call for comment.																								Tabloids have speculated about instability in their relationship from nearly the moment the X-Men star married Benet in January 2001.																								Berry and Benet met in 1999 at a party to celebrate the premiere of Berrys HBO movie Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, about the first Black woman nominated for a best-actress Oscar with 1954s Carmen Jones. Berry won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for the Dandridge role, then became the first Black woman to win a best-actress Oscar for her work in 2001s Monsters Ball.																								This is the second marriage for the actress, who divorced baseball player David Justice in 1996. She has also acted in the James Bond thriller Die Another Day. Benet has a young daughter from a previous relationship with a girlfriend who was killed in a car crash 15 months after the girl was born. His first album, True to Myself, was released in 1996. He has had such hits as Spend My Life With You and Love Dont Love Me.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, January 08, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Wench wonder																																	 Sydney, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Cricket-mad Aussies at the fifth Ashes test in Sydney this week made sure they missed none of the action by hiring the latest sports accessory, a beer wench.																																	Instead of wasting time queueing for cooling beakers of Victoria Bitter, fans paid young women from the modelling agency Sex Bomb Promotions A$65 ($38) an hour to do it for them.																																	Alistair Flower told The Daily Telegraph newspaper in Sydney he and his mates had hired two beer wenches, dressed in denim hot pants and tight T-shirts, for the first days of the test so they wouldnt miss any of the play.																																	We were surrounded by the Barmy Army (British fans) and wanted to have a couple of glamours in our group, Flower told the paper, which labelled the cricket accessory a beer wench. 																													 																Texas tattoo																																	 Fort Worth, Texas (Reuters): A Texas man who uses tattoos to spread the gospel believes he set a new world record during the weekend by adorning the skin of one of his friends  non-stop for more than 30 hours. Tattoo artist Bobby Doran, who says he shares his Christian faith while tattooing, went to work on his friend Bill Davis, and after 30 hours and 15 minutes of continuous work, covered much of his body with with images of skulls, dragons, lightning, clouds and Jesus. I can talk a little gospel to the people, Doran said of his work. According to Guinness World Records, the longest continuous tattoo session had been 27 hours, 12 minutes set in Britain about two years ago.																													 																Saintly slip																																	 Berlin (Reuters): Germanys television licence fee agency apologised on Monday for sending an angry letter demanding payment from an eighth century saint. This was quite embarrassing, said Eckhard Ohliger, an official at the Cologne-based GEZ fee collection headquarters, which collects 6.5 billion euros ($6.8 billion) per year from viewers. But unfortunately mistakes happen. Father Karl Terhorst said the agency had sent letters demanding payment of the monthly 16.15 euro fee to a woman named Frau Walburga St. at the address of the Roman Catholic Church in Ramsdorf, 120 km east of Cologne. At first I just ignored the letters, Terhorst said. But after the last letter demanding payment threatened the saint with legal action and a 1,000-euro fine, I figured it was time to write back.

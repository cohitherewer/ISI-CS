																								Beijing, March 12 (AP): The Chinese government has ordered the Rolling Stones to axe four of their best-known hits from their landmark mainland shows next month, a concert organiser said today.																								The band, which is scheduled to perform in Shanghai on April 1 and in Beijing on April 4, will not be allowed to play Brown Sugar, Honky Tonk Woman, Beast of Burden, or Lets Spend the Night Together, said Chen Jixin, head of Beijing Time New Century Entertainment, a concert organiser behind the two China dates.																								The four songs, all of which include sexual references, were originally cut from the mainland release of the bands 40 Licks compilation album by Chinas culture ministry, Chen said. Brown Sugar refers to an interracial coupling.																								The album was released by EMI Records China earlier this year. It was the first Rolling Stones album to legally hit the China market; pirated Stones CDs are widely available in Shanghai and Beijing.																								Chen said she didnt know why the government had banned the four songs. 																								The ministry of culture said no one was immediately available for comment.

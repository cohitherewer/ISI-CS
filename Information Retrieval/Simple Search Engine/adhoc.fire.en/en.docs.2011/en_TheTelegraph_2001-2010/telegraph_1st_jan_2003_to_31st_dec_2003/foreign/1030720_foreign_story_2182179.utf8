 Sunday, July 20, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Playboy cartoons																																	 Los Angeles, July 19 (AFP): Comic-book godfather and Spider-man creator Stan Lee is set to enshrine Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner in a new adult cartoon series, the entertainment press reported yesterday. 																																	Lees production company, Pow! Entertainment, will produce the animated series which will feature the pipe-puffing Hef as the head of an elite crime-fighting squad made up by voluptuous Playboy Playmates. 																																	The cartoon-generated Hefner and his crime-fighting women, dubbed Hefs Superbunnies, will of course be based in Hefners Playboy mansion, famed for decades for its legendary parties. 																																	As a fan who bought and cherished the very first copy of Playboy in 1953, it is an enormous thrill for me to be partnering with a man who has done so much to shape the culture of the times we live in, Lee told Daily Variety. 																																	Hugh Hefner has long been one of the great communicators in our society, and I cant think of anyone Id rather partner with, he added.

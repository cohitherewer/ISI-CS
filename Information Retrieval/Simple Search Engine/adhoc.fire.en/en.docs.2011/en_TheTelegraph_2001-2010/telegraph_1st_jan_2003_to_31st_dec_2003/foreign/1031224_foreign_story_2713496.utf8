																								Baghdad, Dec. 23 (Reuters): American soldiers arrested Muslim militants with ties to an Iraqi fugitive near the top of their most wanted list, but the assassination of a senior Iraqi judge highlighted continuing instability in post-war Iraq.																								Youssef Khoshi, a chief investigating judge in Mosul, was shot and killed by three men in a car last night. He was shot six times from behind in the back. He died immediately, the police said today. The slaying was part of a wave of attacks in recent weeks on officials working under Iraqs US administration.																								Guerrillas have killed US soldiers and anyone seen cooperating with them. 																								A bomb was found yesterday in the home of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, a Shia leader and head of the US-backed Iraqi governing council, but was defused, his son said.																								Hakim was in Moscow for debt relief talks, but the bomb underscored fears that Iraqs volatile sectarian mix could explode before the country even starts rebuilding. American soldiers were hopeful they could close in one of their most wanted fugitives, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, after capturing three Muslim militants with ties to Saddam Husseins former deputy.																								We detained three individuals in the extremist religious organisations with ties to... Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, Lieutenant-Colonel William Adamson, head of a US task force in Baquba, said. Adamson said raids after Saddams capture were yielding valuable intelligence which would make it easier to make further arrests of guerrillas, who have killed 202 US troops. Bahrain alert																								The US has warned American citizens in Bahrain about a terrorist threat in Bahrain during the Christmas holiday, the US embassy in Bahrain said today.																								The warning in pro-western Bahrain, headquarters of the US navys Fifth Fleet, comes amid a heightened state of alert in the United States ahead of Christmas.

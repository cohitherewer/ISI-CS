The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, October 21, 2003 				 Baby Apec declared brain-dead
																								Bangkok, Oct. 20 (Reuters): A baby boy abandoned in a Bangkok trash can and nicknamed Apec is brain-dead and has only two or three days to live at most, hospital officials said today.																								The 3.2 kg baby, named after the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in the Thai capital, would remain on life support until he died a natural death, they said.																								He is brain-dead, Surapee Ruangsuwan, director of the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health said. We will not disconnect him from the respirator and keep him alive until his heart stops beating on its own, which is likely in the next 48 to 72 hours, maybe sooner.																								The boy, deprived of water for nearly a week, was found wrapped in two plastic bags by a policeman near the Apec venue.																								Police yesterday arrested the babys 23-year-old mother in her hometown of Roi-et, 280 km northeast of Bangkok.

 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Bush chant: no risk, no reward
																								Washington, Dec. 11 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush today rejected European criticism of his decision to bar Iraq war opponents from $18.6 billion in US reconstruction money for Iraq and said contracts would be reserved for those countries that risked lives in Iraq.																								Its very simple. Our people risked their lives. Friendly coalition folks risked their lives, and, therefore, the contracting is going to reflect that, and thats what the US taxpayers expect, Bush said. The decision to bar war opponents like France, Russia and Germany from the contracts generated outrage in Europe. The timing of the announcement created a new challenge for Bush, coming as he prepared to send former secretary of state James Baker to France, Germany and Russia as well as Italy and Britain to seek debt restructuring for Iraq. If these countries want to participate in helping the world become more secure, by enabling Iraq to emerge as a free country, one way to contribute is through debt restructuring, Bush said.																								But helping reduce Iraqs estimated $120 billion foreign debt will not mean those nations can compete for the $18.6 billion, he said. White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Baker, a Bush family friend, will leave on Monday for Europe and will report back to Bush.																								We all share the same goal of helping the Iraqi people build a better and brighter future and they should not be saddled with the debt of a brutal regime, McClellan said. Bush telephoned French President Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday to ask them to receive Baker. Bush scoffed at a question seeking his reaction to Schroeders statement today that international law must apply to the awarding of the contracts. International law? I better call my lawyer, he said. Iraq is everyones business:  Annan																								UN secretary general Kofi Annan yesterday criticised a US decision to bar countries that opposed the Iraq war from bidding for reconstruction contracts. The stability of Iraq is everyones business and we should pool our efforts and avoid steps and decisions that are divisive, Annan told journalists when asked for his reaction.

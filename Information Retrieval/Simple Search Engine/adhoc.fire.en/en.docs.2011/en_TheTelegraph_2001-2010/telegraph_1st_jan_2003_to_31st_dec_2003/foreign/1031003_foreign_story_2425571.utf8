 Friday, October 03, 2003 				 Peter the Great more admired than Putin
				 	 Vladimir Putin																								Moscow, Oct. 2 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin is more admired than Lenin, Stalin and Ivan the Terrible but is not quite up to Peter the Great  the leader some say he most tries to emulate, a survey published today said.																								Tsar Peter I, a ruthless leader who forced Russia to look West three centuries ago and founded the glittering former capital that bears his name  St Petersburg  was picked by 45 per cent of respondents as their most admired Russian leader.																								The poll, published by the World Economic Forum during a conference it is hosting in Moscow, put Putin in second place with 39 per cent.																								Putin, who has wide support for his tough law-and-order policies and attempts to push the economy towards a more Western model, looks almost certain to win a second term in next years presidential election.																								Putin was followed by Catherine the Great, a German princess who ruled Russia in the 18th century, with 19 per cent.																								Tied with 10 per cent for fourth place were the stolid communist leader Leonid Brezhnev and Ivan the Terrible, the murderous 16th century tsar.																								Just behind them were the first men to occupy the Kremlin during the Soviet era  Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin, both of whom saw millions of their compatriots off to an early grave.

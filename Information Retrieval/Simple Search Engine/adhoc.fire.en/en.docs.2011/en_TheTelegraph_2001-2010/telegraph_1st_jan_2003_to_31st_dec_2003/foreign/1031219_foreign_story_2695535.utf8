 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Iraq whets US Osama appetite
																								Bagram, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Americas top general said today al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden would definitely be captured one day, just like Saddam Hussein.																								General Richard Myers, on a one-day Christmas visit to US troops in Afghanistan accompanied by comedian Robin Williams and other US entertainers, said bin Laden was probably alive and hiding in the rugged tribal lands of the Pakistan-Afghan border.																								Its very difficult to find individuals, Myers, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said at the US headquarters in Afghanistan at Bagram. But what will happen is, with absolute certainty, if bin Laden is still alive, and I think most suspect he is, that he will be captured some day, just like we captured Saddam Hussein.																								Some day he will be brought to justice, just like Saddam.																								Myers said common wisdom had it that bin Laden was somewhere in the Afghan-Pakistan border region,where he has some support, where he can buy support, and probably very difficult terrain. 																								Myers earlier visited Iraq, where Saddam was tracked down last Saturday eight months after his rule was ended by a US-led invasion. In Afghanistan, he said he was pleased a key national assembly meeting, or Loya Jirga, to approve a new constitution had passed off so far without incident.																								We have basically a pretty stable country and the incidents we have are actually isolated terrorist incidents, he said. That doesnt mean tomorrow that we arent going to have a car bomb attack, I am not saying that, but the security situation has dramatically improved.

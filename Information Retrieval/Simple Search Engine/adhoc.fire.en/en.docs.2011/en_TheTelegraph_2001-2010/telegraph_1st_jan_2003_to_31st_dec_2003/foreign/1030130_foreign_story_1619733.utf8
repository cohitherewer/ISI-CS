 Thursday, January 30, 2003 				 Victorious Sharon faces daunting task
																								Jerusalem, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, riding high on a sweeping victory by his Right-wing Likud party, faced the daunting challenge today of forging a lasting coalition after an election that redrew Israels political map.																								Sharon quickly appealed to other factions to join a broad unity government to confront the twin crises of a Palestinian uprising and possible war in the Gulf, but the Centre-Left Labour Party declined despite its worst election defeat.																								He could be forced into an alliance with far-Right and ultranationalist parties which want to spur him to an even harder line against the Palestinians, a move which could put him at odds with Israels chief ally, the United States.

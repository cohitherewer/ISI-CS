But the shoe is about to be on the other foot.																																	Brazilian jewellers H.Stern have teamed up with Havaianas, Brazils most popular flip-flop brand, to make a range of luxury flip-flops with a top price of $19,840 (58,500 reais).																																	A spokeswoman for Havaianas, made by Alpargatas, said yesterday that the luxury range, which also includes models priced at $3,660 (10,800 reais) and $2,440 (7,200 reais), would be made to order from H.Stern starting today.																																	The strap of the most expensive flip-flop is inlaid with diamonds and 1,636 feathers made out of 18 karat gold. Hidden among the gold feathers of the left-foot sandal is a small amulet in the shape of a frog, a symbol of prestige among Indians. The rest of the flip-flop is rubber with a black sole.

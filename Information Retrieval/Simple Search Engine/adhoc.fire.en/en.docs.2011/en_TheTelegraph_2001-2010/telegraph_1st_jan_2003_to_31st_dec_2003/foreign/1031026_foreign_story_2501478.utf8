 Chicago, Oct. 25 (Reuters):  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said today it would review the status  of its 1.1 million US employees and fire any illegal immigrants  on the payroll if American law requires it.																								The internal probe at the worlds largest retailer comes amid a government investigation into allegations that contractor cleaning crews used by Wal-Mart had recruited illegal immigrants to work on cleaning crews at the stores for the worlds largest retailer.																								The company, which has promised to cooperate with federal officials, said it would scrutinise the background of its own employees to ensure that none are employed illegally.																								Were reviewing the status in various areas, said Wal-Mart spokesman Tom Williams. If that is the case  and we dont believe it to be  were obviously going to follow the law.																								US officials this week arrested about 250 workers at 60 stores in 21 states as part of a worksite enforcement effort known as Operation Rollback. Most of the workers belonged to contract cleaning crews.																								Federal law enforcement officials said some Wal-Mart executives had direct knowledge of the alleged scheme. A spokesman with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement said this week that a company that knowingly hires illegal workers can be penalised up to $10,000 per person.

 HUGH DAVIES				 	 Jude Law																								London, Feb. 11: Nicole Kidman, in London last night for the premiere of The Hours on the eve of a possible Oscar nomination, fended off questions about her friendship with the actor Jude Law.																								Asked at the Chelsea premiere of the British film if she and Law were an item, she recoiled in apparent horror. No, she said emphatically, Were not, its not true. I think its important to respect other peoples privacy.																								Law, 30, who has recently finished filming Cold Mountain with Kidman in Romania, is reported to be living apart from his wife, Sadie Frost, who remains at their home in Primrose Hill, north London.																								He pleaded for privacy last night, speaking of a difficult time for his family. He added: Can you now please give us the privacy we eagerly need so that we can put our lives in order.																								He said earlier: There is absolutely no third party involved in our marriage. To suggest otherwise is malicious and hurtful. His wife, with whom he has three children including a four-month-old son, has undergone treatment in a private London hospital for post-natal depression. 																								She has said: There are no marriage problems.																								Last night Kidman, 35, in an elegant black dress with asymmetrical sleeve, seemed on surer ground when questioned about the possible Oscar nominations. She said that she was making no predictions, but if The Hours, in which she plays Virginia Woolf, was selected, that would be absolutely fantastic.																								Earlier, in an interview with Elle magazine, she spoke of plans to buy a house in London. I love the people, and the humour. And the grey skies and rain. And I have so many British friends. I really want to get my own place here.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

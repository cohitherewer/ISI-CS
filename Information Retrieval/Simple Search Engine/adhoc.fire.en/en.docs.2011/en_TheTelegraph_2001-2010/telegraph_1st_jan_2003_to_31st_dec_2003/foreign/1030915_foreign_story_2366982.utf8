 Monday, September 15, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Pieces for peace																																	 Paris, Sept. 14 (Reuters): John Lennons widow Yoko Ono could end up stark naked on a Paris stage tomorrow as she performs her one-woman art show Cut Piece, in which members of the audience are to cut off pieces of her clothing.																																	Ono, 70, who accompanied her Beatle husband in numerous controversial anti-war campaigns including the Bed-In for Peace against the Vietnam War, first performed her Cut Piece show in 1964 in Japan as a protest for peace. Come and cut a piece of my clothing wherever you like  the size of less than a postcard  and send it to the one you love, the avant-garde artist said in a statement ahead of the performance at Paris Ranelagh theatre.																																	 I first performed this work, in 1964, I did it with some anger and turbulence in my heart. This time, I do it with love for you, for me and for the world, she added. 																																	Last year Ono rented a giant billboard space in London, that read: Imagine all the people living life in peace, alluding to Lennons hit song Imagine.																													 																Best beauty Rome (Reuters): Semi-clad young beauty  queens have suffered an unprecedented defeat at the hands  of fully-dressed grandmothers in the Italian television  ratings battle. When beauty pageant Miss Italia, a yearly  fest of sexy girls in swimsuits, went head to head with  Velone, a dance and comedy contest for ladies over 65  on a rival channel, the grannies came out on top. With both  programmes on air on Thursday night, 4.94 million Italians  tuned in to see the wisecracking older women, while 4.82  million were eyeing the voluptuous would-be starlets. In  previous years, Miss Italia had always got much higher  ratings than competing programmes. So its true that beauty  isnt everything, commented leading daily newspaper Corriere  della Sera.

 Tuesday, September 16, 2003 				 15 Taliban men killed in clash
																								Spin Boldak (Afghanistan), Sept. 15 (Reuters): At least 15 Taliban fighters, a senior commander among them, were killed in southern Afghanistan in an overnight clash involving US-led forces, an Afghan official said today.																								But a former intelligence official from the ousted hardline regime denied the death of Mullah Abdur Rahim, who has control over southern Afghanistan where the Taliban has been most active in carrying out attacks in recent months. Fifteen Taliban were killed, including Mullah Abdur Rahim, in Maruf district, said Afghan foreign ministry official Khalid Khan Achakzai, speaking in the town of Spin Boldak. 																								He said the fighters killed in the clash had probably come from Zabul, which borders the province of Kandahar where Maruf is located.																								Mullah Abdul Samad, an intelligence officer in the radical Taliban regime, denied the death of Rahim. There have been deaths on both sides but it is wrong that Abdur Rahim has been killed. It is mere propaganda, Samad said.

 Thursday, October 02, 2003 				 Bridget creator to be mom
 MATT BORN				 	 Helen Fielding																								Memo to Self: Cigarettes  none (vg); calories  lots (but eating for two); alcohol units  one (champagne, glass of  celebratory necessity, feel dreadful in mornings anyway).																								It is news likely to send neurotic thirty-something singletons reaching for the chardonnay and a comforting packet of Hob Nobs: Helen Fielding, the creator of Bridget Joness Diary, is pregnant.																								The 43-year-old author, who to her fans had long been synonymous with her lovelorn fictional alter ego, confirmed on Tuesday that she was expecting her first child with her boyfriend, American comedy writer Kevin Curran, in February.																								The couple, who met four years ago, were understood to be overjoyed and excited at the prospect of parenthood, while Fielding was reported to be happy and healthy. And well she might be. Curran, an executive producer and writer on The Simpsons, appears to be a veritable Mr Darcy. Fielding describes him as lovely, funny and sweet, while friends say he is very dry, funny and very, very tall.																								The couple now spend most of their time in Los Angeles, where they have a 1-million home in the Hollywood Hills.																								The impending birth will cap a memorable year for Fielding. Bridget Joness Diary, and its follow-up, The Edge of Reason, have sold over 15 million copies worldwide, earning her an estimated 2.2 million. The film of the first novel took 200 million at the box office and earned its star, Renee Zellweger, an Oscar nomination. A sequel starts production this autumn. A new novel, Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination  a girly spy thriller  is due out in November. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

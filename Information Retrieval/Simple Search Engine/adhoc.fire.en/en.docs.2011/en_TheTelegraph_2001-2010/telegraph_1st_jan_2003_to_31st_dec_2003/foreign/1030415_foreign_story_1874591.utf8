 Tuesday, April 15, 2003 				 Trophy trove for Marines
																								Baghdad, April 14 (Reuters): Staff Sergeant Nathan Braswell hopes a flag he found in a captured Iraqi base will earn him a tidy sum when he sells it on the Internet.																								Like many fellow US Marines, Braswell grabbed the trophy as American forces advanced on Baghdad. 																								Unlike the souveneir-hunting majority, he doesnt plan to keep it.																								I got the flag that was in the commanding generals building. Its very large. Its in great condition, said Braswell, 24, who picked up the Iraqi national colors on the eastern outskirts of the city.																								Im going to put the flag on eBay, he said, referring to the internet auction sight where memorabilia from the toppled regime of Saddam Hussein are already in hot demand.																								Some collector would probably like it.																								Braswell said he would identify the grid reference of the installation where he found the flag to give an added touch of authenticity for war relic connoisseurs.																								Other Marines lucky enough to stumble across caches of Iraqi bayonets are making a few bucks on the side selling them to troops who were not so quick off the mark.																								One Marine was offering several combat knives to his comrades for $20 each  although he kept his favourite one wedged in the webbing loops on his flak jacket as a memento.																								Some say they plan to mount their souvenirs on the walls  making a kind of collage of items like knives or shoulder flashes found on military uniforms discarded by Iraqi troops.																								Im going to make me a nice little plaque thats got the dates I was here, said Lance-Corporal Louis Blankenship, 21, taking a break in his armoured vehicle in a car park in the suburbs.																								Ill put my dog tags on it, he said.																								Many of the items might look rather bizarre on mantelpieces back home in America. 																								Trophies claimed included the sights to a Soviet-built 120 mm mortar  that looks a bit like a piece of surveying equipment  and Iraqi gas masks.																								When you come home you have to show that you were there, You take some pictures, said Corporal Alex Fala, 25. Throughout the wars in the past, everybody has brought back something.

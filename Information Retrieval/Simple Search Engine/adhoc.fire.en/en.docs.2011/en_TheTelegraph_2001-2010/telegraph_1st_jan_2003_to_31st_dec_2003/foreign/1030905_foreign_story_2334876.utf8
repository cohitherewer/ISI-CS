 Friday, September 05, 2003 				 Egg greets evasive Arnie 
				 	 Arnold Schwarzenegger after being hit by the egg. (AP) 																								San Francisco, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Arnold Schwarzenegger was once so hungry to compete, he abandoned his army post to attend a bodybuilding tournament. He won the contest but later spent a week in military prison.																								But when it came to political debates, the actor has showed no similar competitive desire. Yesterday, he conspicuously skipped the first in a series of debates with governor Gray Davis and the top candidates who want to replace him in the states unprecedented recall election.																								Instead of debating his rivals, Schwarzenegger went among college students at California State University in Long Beach where he got hit with an egg on the way to the stage.																								The egg splattered his tan jacket and he wiped if off without pausing or breaking stride, then handed the yolk-stained garment to an aide, and addressed the students in shirt-sleeves. This guy owes me bacon now, Schwarzenegger said later, as he laughed off the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 7 killed in bomb blast at Bangla fair
																								Dhaka, Jan. 18 (AFP): At least seven people were killed and 15 others injured when a bomb was thrown during a fair attended by 25,000 followers of a Muslim saint in northwestern Bangladesh, a report said today.																								The attack took place in the remote Dariapur village in Tangail district, 72 km northwest of Dhaka.																								Some 25,000 people had converged for the annual Urs (religious fair), when a bomb was hurled last night as people crowded around the saints grave, Belayet Hossain, police chief of the Sakhipur sub-district in Tangail, said.																								Six people died and seven others were injured in the attack, but the death toll might go up, he added.																								The official BSS news agency later said one more person had died in hospital of his injuries and that 15 people were injured.																								Preliminary investigations suggest it is an internal feud among the people who manage the saints grave over money collected for the Urs, Hossain said.																								Nine people have been arrested in connection with the blast, he said, adding that army bomb experts had rushed to the area to determine what kind of explosives were used. 																								Security in the area has been beefed up.																								The fair is the largest in the district. Last month 18 people were killed and 100 injured when bombs ripped apart four cinemas in the Mymensingh district.

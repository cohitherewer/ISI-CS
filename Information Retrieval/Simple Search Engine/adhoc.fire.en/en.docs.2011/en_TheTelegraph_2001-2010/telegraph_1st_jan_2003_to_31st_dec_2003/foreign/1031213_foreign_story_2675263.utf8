 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Khatami backs Ebadi
																								Paris, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Reformist Iranian President Mohammad Khatami was quoted today as saying he had told his government to ensure that Nobel peace prize-winning lawyer Shirin Ebadi could continue her work without disruption.																								Khatami told French newspaper Le Monde that Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to win the prize, had in the past encountered a few problems. He gave no details, but Ebadi has powerful foes.																								Despite her status as a hate-figure among Irans religious hardliners  she has received death threats and was assigned a bodyguard by the government  Ebadi argues passionately that Islam is not incompatible with human rights. 																								I have given very firm instructions that Ebadi be allowed to continue her work in appropriate conditions, he told the newspaper in an interview for its tomorrows edition.																								I have instructed the interior and information ministries to ensure she can work in full safety. 																								He did not specify what sort of support she would get from his government.																								Ebadi, who received the 2003 award on Wednesday for her work to promote the rights of children and women, flouted Irans dress code for women by appearing at the prize ceremony without a headscarf  a move for which Khatami chided her.																								Wearing the headscarf is a tradition everyone respects in Iran. That said, and Ive said this to Ebadi, as a Muslim woman it would have been better to have worn the scarf to get her prize. But everyone is free in their choices, he said.																								Ebadi, seen by many as a symbol of reformist hope in Iran but labelled a political stooge of the west by conservative clerics, has said she will return to Iran despite security concerns and use her prize money to continue that work.

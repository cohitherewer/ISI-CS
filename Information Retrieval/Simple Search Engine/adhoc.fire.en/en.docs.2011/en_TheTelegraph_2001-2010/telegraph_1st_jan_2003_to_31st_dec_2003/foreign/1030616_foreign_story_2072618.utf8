 Monday, June 16, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Cricket crunch																																	Salt Lake City (Utah), June 15 (Reuters): Mormon crickets, the plague of the western US, are on the march again, ravaging farms and turning roads blood red.																																	Farmer Duane Anderson said the bugs are at times so thick that he could kill 10 crickets with a single step on his 3,200-acre spread in Dog Valley about 100 miles south of Salt Lake City. Officials in Utah, Idaho and Nevada say this years infestation may be the worst in recent history. 																																	The grasshopper-like insects have become a traffic hazard, rendering some hilly roads impassable as they become caked with crushed bug carcasses. But for Anderson and other farmers, the bigger concern is economic. Mormon crickets and grasshoppers have for six years in a row wreaked havoc in Utah.																													 																Loch Ness London (Reuters): Sorcerer Kevin Carlyon  performed an incantation on the shores of Loch Ness on Friday,  trying to lure Britains favourite monster into the open.  Carlyon, High Priest of British White Witches, said he had  cast a spell two years ago to scare off the monster so it  would not be caught by a visiting Swedish scientist Jan  Sundberg. But Sundberg is no longer a threat, he said, and  now the time has come to reverse the hex on Nessie. I  feel this one went quite well, he said. During Fridays  ceremony, Carlyon said he cast a talisman into the loch   a flat stone inscribed with ancient Nordic runes and witchcraft  symbols  while chanting the incantation: Let Nessie be  free, may her spirit be free, so may it be. 																													 																Reality bites																																	 Rio de Janeiro (Reuters): Police in Rio de Janeiro arrested an amateur actor on Friday who played a drug-runner in the hit gangster film City of God for trying to steal a womans purse. Fiction turned reality. Unfortunately, it is another example of social inequality in this country, said police investigator Carlos Alberto Pinto, adding that Rubens Sabino, 19, could spend up to four years in jail.

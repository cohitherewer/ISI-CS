 Friday, September 26, 2003 				 Edward Said dies of leukaemia
				 	 Said New York, Sept. 25 (Reuters):  Palestinian intellectual Edward Said, whose writings included  the book Orientalism, died in New York at age 67  today after a battle with leukaemia, a colleague at Columbia  University said.																								Said was a literary critic and theoretician but was also known as a prominent Palestinian activist. Arab commentators said Said would be remembered as a Palestinian patriot and a towering intellectual who broke ground in the theory of literature and Orientalist studies.																								For many years he was a member of the Palestinian National Council but he broke with Yasser Arafat in the belief that the Oslo peace accords signed in 1993 betrayed Palestinian refugees.																								Said called the Oslo accords a Palestinian Versailles that further eroded Palestinian human and national rights, and opposed a segregated two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, proposing an integrated, democratic country instead. Said was a professor of comparative literature at Columbia. His books include Orientalism and A Question of Palestine.

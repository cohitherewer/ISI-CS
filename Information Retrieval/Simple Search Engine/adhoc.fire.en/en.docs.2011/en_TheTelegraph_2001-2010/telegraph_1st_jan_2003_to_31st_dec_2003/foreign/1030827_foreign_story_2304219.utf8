 Wednesday, August 27, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																British excess																																	London, Aug. 26 (AFP): British holidaymakers fondness for late nights and alcoholic excess is leaving many of them more tired and ill when they return home than before they left, an opinion poll said today. 																																	The overindulgence means many take sick leave on their return, costing British businesses hundreds of million of pounds a year, the survey estimated. 																																	According to the poll of 1,000 people, more than half said they felt more tired on returning to the office than before they went away. 																																	Around one in 10 feigned sickness to allow themselves time to recover, with a similar number falling genuinely ill, the survey found. 																						Young people were the most likely to need a rest after their holiday, with a quarter of 18 to 24-year-olds admitting that going to night clubs was the most important part of their break and that they got drunk every night. 																																	The survey, carried out by the manufacturers of an energy drink, Lucozade, reinforces the stereotype of young Britons seeing holidays mainly as an excuse to drink excessively and couple with the opposite sex in a hot climate. 																																	 recent weeks Greek police have launched a tough crackdown on the behaviour of British visitors to Faliraki, a holiday resort on the Mediterranean island of Rhodes. 																						The move follows the deaths of at least three British tourists and complaints of widespread drunkenness, public nudity and violence among British holidaymakers																													 																Roar ruse Berlin (Reuters): A mysterious crate  labelled Wild Animals and blasting out lions roars in  a German town had locals running scared and animal lovers  up in arms before it was revealed as an advertising stunt,  police said on Tuesday. The crate was right in the town  centre and people thought there were real lions inside,  said a police spokesperson in the south-western town of  Darmstadt. It was loud. A lot of people were really scared.  Police came to investigate after two women complained about  the treatment of the animals apparently locked in the crate.  Gingerly approaching the crate, they ventured a look through  a slit in its side but, instead of discovering caged beasts  angrily stalking the container, they saw a promotional video  for Land Rover vehicles intercut with shots of roaring lions.  A spokeswoman for Land Rover said the campaign had been  running for a few months and had so far proved a success.  Weve generally only had positive feedback on it so far,  she said. Weve never had this kind of response before.

 Tuesday, February 11, 2003 				 China rebel gets life in prison
																								Beijing, Feb. 10 (Reuters): A Chinese court sentenced a US-based Chinese dissident to life in prison today for spying for Taiwan and organising and leading a terrorist group, triggering protests from an international rights group.																								The sentence handed down to Wang Bingzhang, 55, was one of the heaviest for a pro-democracy activist in recent memory.																								We are very angry. We lodge a strong protest, Wang Xizhe, a spokesman for the Washington-based rights watchdog Free China Movement, said by telephone.																								The official Xinhua news agency issued a terse two-paragraph dispatch that said Wang was also deprived of his political rights for life. It gave no further details. The Intermediate Peoples Court in Shenzhen convicted Wang, who has a doctorate in medical research and had lived in New York since 1982, after a one-day trial behind closed doors in January. Court officials reached by telephone declined to comment, underlining the sensitivity of the case.

				 	 Angelina Jolie																								Pristina (Yugoslavia), Dec. 31 (AP): Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie has said she has concerns about the security of Kosovos minorities after a recent three-day trip to the province to visit the UN refugee agency and those displaced since the war.																								Jolie, a goodwill ambassador for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said yesterday she came to spend time with UNs refugee agency staff for the holidays and see the situation for the minorities in this area, a statement released after her departure said.																								People think that when a war is over, everything goes back to normal, Jolie said. But in Kosovo, the security situation remains questionable for minorities.																								Kosovo, legally part of Yugoslavia, has been run by the UN and Nato since 1999, when the alliance bombed Serb troops loyal to former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop their crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists.																								Some 2,00,000 Serbs and other minorities have left the province since then, fearing attacks avenging the crackdown, which killed thousands of ethnic Albanians. 																								Only a few thousand of the displaced Serbs have returned, and those who remain here live mainly in Nato-guarded enclaves.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, February 26, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																In Nicoles honour																																	 Sydney, Feb. 25 (Reuters): Australia cleared a place on the mantle for Nicole Kidmans Oscar today, a day after the film star scored top honours at Britains annual Bafta awards.																																	Kidman won best actress for her portrayal of tortured writer Virginia Woolfe in the film The Hours, a role which garnered the Australian actress a Golden Globe a month ago. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) tribute is widely seen as signalling who is favoured to win Oscar gold at Hollywoods Academy Awards next month.																																	The Australian press, enamoured of the flame-haired actress for her smile, her wardrobe and her consummate grace under pressure, was happy to play favourites. Nics finest Hours create Oscar dream trumpeted the Daily Telegraph, a populist Sydney daily newspaper. 																													 																An octopus flips the lid																																	 Munich (Reuters): A common octopus in a German zoo has learned to open jars of shrimps by watching zoo attendants perform the act underwater. Frida, a five-month-old female octopus, opens the jars by pressing her body on the lid and grasping the sides with the suckers on her eight tentacles. With a succession of body twists she unscrews the lid. Depending on how tight the lid is, it takes her anything from 10 seconds to an hour to get it off, said Frank Mueller, head of the aquarium at the Hellabrunn Zoo. Frida opens shrimp jars before the public at feeding time twice a week. Mueller said he taught Frida the trick after he remembered seeing octopuses showing remarkable dexterity off the coast of Morocco, where he went diving when he was younger. Frida was imported from Morocco. We just did it in the tank a few times and eventually she cottoned on, he said. You wont see any other marine creatures do this.

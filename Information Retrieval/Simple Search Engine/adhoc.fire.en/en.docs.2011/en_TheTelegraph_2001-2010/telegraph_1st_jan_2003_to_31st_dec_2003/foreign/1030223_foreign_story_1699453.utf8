 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 Baywatch star, wife injured in accident
				 	 David Hasselhoff																								Los Angeles, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Actor David Hasselhoff suffered fractures to his back and ribs and his wife injured her ankle when the Baywatch star crashed the motorcycle they were riding into a curb, police said yesterday.																								The 51-year-old actor and his wife Pamela Hasselhoff, 39, were taken to nearby UCLA Medical Center for treatment, where both were in stable condition, Los Angeles police spokesman Jason Lee said in a statement.																								The couple was riding on Hasselhoffs 2003 Harley Davidson motorcycle when they were hit by a gust of wind, lost control of the motorcycle and collided with a curb, Lee said.																								Both were thrown from the motorcycle and David Hasselhoff struck a light pole as his wife landed on the soft shoulder of the roadway, Lee said.																								He said David Hasselhoff suffered a fractured lower back and several ribs as well as minor abrasions and contusions. Pamela Hasselhoff suffered possible fractures of her left ankle and right wrist.																								A spokesman for Hasselhoff, who starred as rugged chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon on the syndicated hit Baywatch until the long-running series ceased production last year, could not immediately be reached for comment on the accident.																								Baywatch debuted on NBC in 1989 and was canceled after one season. But Hasselhoff and his partners acquired rights to the show and brought it back as a syndicated series in 1991 based on its popularity overseas.																								The 11-year-old show also made household names of Pamela Anderson, Carmen Electra and Yasmine Bleeth.																								Hasselhoff also starred in the 1980s crime-fighting series Knight Rider, which featured an intelligent supercar.

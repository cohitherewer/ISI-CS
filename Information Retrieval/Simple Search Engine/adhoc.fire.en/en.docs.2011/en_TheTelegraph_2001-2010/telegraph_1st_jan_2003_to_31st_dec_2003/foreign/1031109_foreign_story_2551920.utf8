 Sunday, November 09, 2003 				 Suu Kyi not free till aides get liberty
																								Yangon, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Myanmars generals have freed democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, but she is refusing to accept liberty until 35 colleagues are released from detention, UN envoy Paulo Sergio Pinheiro said today. 																								She will not accept to have any privilege or any access to freedom of movement until everyone detained since May 30 has been released, Pinheiro said. The UN human rights envoy said he had been told by the ruling generals during talks in Yangon this week that Suu Kyi, detained after a bloody clash between her followers and government supporters, was no longer under house arrest.																								Pinheiro, who spent two hours with Suu Kyi on Thursday, said she demanded the release of 35 colleagues in the National League for Democracy before she would consider herself free.																								She also demanded an inquiry into the May 30 violence, which each side blames on the other, and for those responsible to be held accountable, he said.																								She wants justice, not revenge, the Brazilian academic added.																								He quoted her as saying: Lets move forward. Lets work so it doesnt happen again.

 Sunday, November 02, 2003 				 Bush unhurt as car breaks security block
																								Southaven (Mississippi), Nov. 1 (Reuters): A car breached security and crashed into a building where US President George W. Bush was attending a political rally today, briefly delaying the Presidents departure.																								The President was never in any danger whatsoever, White House spokesman Trent Duffy said. There was a vehicle that did crash into the side of the building.																								Bush was in his limousine at the time but was not close to the car when it crashed into a loading dock of the arena. The President was later seen waving to reporters before boarding Air Force One to head to his next stop in Kentucky.																								Duffy said no shots were fired in the incident and a suspect was immediately detained and handed over to local law enforcement officials.																								Police led a woman away after the crash, according to a television technician at the scene who had seen film of the incident. A young boy and girl were also near the car, the technician said. Security officials chased the car as it headed toward the building, witnesses said. 																								Some security personnel were seen running with guns drawn toward the entrance of the arena where Bush had given a speech.

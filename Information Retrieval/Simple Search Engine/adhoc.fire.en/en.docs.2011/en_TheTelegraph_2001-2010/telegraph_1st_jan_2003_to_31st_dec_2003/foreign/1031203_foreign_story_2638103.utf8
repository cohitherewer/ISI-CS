 Wednesday, December 03, 2003 				 US warns Russia: Dont back Georgia rebel regions
				 	 US secretary of state Colin Powell (left) with Georgias interim President Nino Burdzhanadze in Maastricht. (AFP)																								Maastricht (Netherlands), Dec. 2 (Reuters): The US issued a thinly-veiled warning to Russia today not to back Georgias breakaway regions amid instability in the former Soviet republic after last months bloodless revolution.																								Georgia, troubled by three restive regions, plans to hold presidential elections on January 4 to replace Eduard Shevardnadze, who was toppled by mass protests last month after allegations of vote-rigging in parliamentary polls.																								The international community should do everything possible to support Georgias territorial integrity throughout and beyond the election process, US secretary of state Colin Powell told the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).																								No support should be given to breakaway elements seeking to weaken Georgias territorial integrity, he told OSCE members from Europe, Central Asia and North America gathered for the meeting in the Dutch city of Maastricht.																								Georgias stability is monitored by both the west  because of a $2.5 billion oil pipeline due to take Caspian oil to the Mediterranean  and neighbour Russia, which fears instability could aid Chechen separatists holed up in Georgian mountains.																								Interim President Nino Burdzhanadze, an Opposition leader appointed after Shevardnadze quit, accused Russia yesterday of interfering in Georgias domestic politics and urged Moscow to move away from its Soviet-era Big Brother meddling.																								Tbilisi was angered last week when Russian officials met leaders from South Ossetia and Abkhazia  which broke free of Georgian control more than a decade ago and want to join Russia  and from Adzhara, which does not want secession but is hostile to the new Georgian rulers. Dutch foreign minister and OSCE chairman Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told the meeting that all 55 members of the democracy body except Russia had agreed to a statement supporting the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.																								De Hoop Scheffer and Powell both regretted Russia would not adhere to a deal struck with the OSCE to scale back its forces in Georgia, where it has two bases.																								US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who met his Russian counterpart in Brussels today, said he had stressed the importance of respecting Georgias territorial integrity, but did not say if he had received any assurances on the matter.																								Regional leaders accuse Mikhail Saakashvili, the Georgian Opposition leader on track to win the January election, of contemplating using force to restore control over territories lost to Tbilisi for a decade or more.																								The Kremlin, which played a central role in negotiations leading to Shevardnadzes resignation, has vowed not to interfere in Georgias internal politics.																								But after Russia met regional Georgian leaders last week, the respected Moscow daily Izvestia said the Kremlin might try to engineer a formal break between Tbilisi and the two regions most hostile to Georgian rule.																								After meeting Burdzhanadze on the sidelines of the OSCE summit, Powell said he had offered Georgia both technical and financial help for the upcoming elections. 																								De Hoop Scheffer said the OSCE had raised more than seven million euros for Georgia.																								Powells visit to Maastricht is on the first day of a three-day trip that will also take him to Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria before ending on Thursday in Brussels, where he will attend a Nato foreign ministers meeting.

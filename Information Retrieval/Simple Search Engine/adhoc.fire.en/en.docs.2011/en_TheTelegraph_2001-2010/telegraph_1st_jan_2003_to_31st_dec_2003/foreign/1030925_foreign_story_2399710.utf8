The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, September 25, 2003 				 The Boss beats the Beatles 
				 	 Bruce Springsteen New York, Sept. 24 (Reuters):  Bruce Springsteen is indeed the boss, beating the Beatles  and all others for making the most popular album of all  time, according to Zagat Surveys Music Guide, which  hit stores yesterday.																								Zagats new 332-page guide lists the top 1,000 albums of all time, according to ratings from more than 10,500 music aficionados. Topping the guides most popular list is Springsteens Born to Run, with the Beatles Abbey Road and Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band taking second and third places, respectively.																								An original list of 2,500 albums, compiled for guidebook publisher Zagat by music industry specialists, was whittled down to the final 1,000 by respondents, who listed their five favourite albums and then rated other albums they were familiar with on a 30-point scale.Survey participants applauded Springsteens 1975 breakthrough album for its cinematic vision of American teen-age romanticism and its promise of the endless Saturday night.																								Abbey Road, on the other hand, was praised by one participant as the Sistine Chapel of rock  roll.																								Rounding out the most popular top 10 list are U2s The Joshua Tree, the Beatles The White Album, Miles Davis Kind of Blue, Springsteens Darkness on the Edge of Town, The Beatles Revolver, Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon and U2s Achtung Baby.																								The surveys publisher, Tim Zagat, said he hopes the rankings will spark a lively debate among readers. I hope there is some controversy, Zagat said in an interview. People can argue until the cows come home over whether Mozart was a better songwriter than Bob Dylan, but just that you are juxtaposing Dylan and Mozart catches you by surprise and makes you think.

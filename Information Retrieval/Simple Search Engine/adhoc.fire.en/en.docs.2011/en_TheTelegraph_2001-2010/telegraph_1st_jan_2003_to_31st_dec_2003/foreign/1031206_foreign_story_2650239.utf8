 Saturday, December 06, 2003 				 Pak fines Indian consulate purchaser
																								Islamabad, Dec. 5 (PTI): A Pakistan high court today dismissed as frivolous a petition by a businessman who claimed to have purchased the Indian consulate building in Karachi and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on him for making false claims.																								The miscellaneous application was frivolous and without any substance, Justice Ata-ur-Rahman of the Sindh high court said. 																								He also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 against the plaintiff, Syed Ali Baqir Naqvi, who claimed to have bought the consulate building. 																								The structure was closed in 1995 following differences between the two countries. Since then it has remained locked.																								The court said that Pakistan, according to the Vienna convention, had a responsibility to protect the interest and the properties of foreign missions. 																								It said Pakistan should take all necessary steps to secure them from being encroached upon or usurped in any manner.																								Acting on a complaint filed by the Indian high commission in Islamabad two months ago, the Pakistan foreign office had said the Sindh government has already cleared the encroachments and posted police guards at all the five properties. 																								Subsequently Naqvi challenged the Pakistan governments stance in the Sindh high court.

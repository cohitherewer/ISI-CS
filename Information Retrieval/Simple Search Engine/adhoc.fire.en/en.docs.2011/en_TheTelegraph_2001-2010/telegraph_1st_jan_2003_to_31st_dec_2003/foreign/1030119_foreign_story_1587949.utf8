The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 Robbie desires a classic album
 BERNHARD WARNER				 	 Robbie Williams in Cannes. (Reuters)																								Cannes, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Like other successful rock stars, Britains Robbie Williams, has a huge recording contract and a revolving door of model and actress girlfriends, but theres one thing gnawing at him  a Sgt. Peppers-like classic album.																								Despite topping the charts in Britain and much of Western Europe with his latest release Escapology, the 28-year-old singer/songwriter isnt satisfied. Its the best one Ive done, but Im going to keep going, chasing that elusive classic album thats in the top 10 or top 20 albums ever written, he said at a news conference in the French Riviera resort of Cannes to promote his fifth solo album.																								I might as well set my ambitions high and go for a Sgt. Peppers or a Nevermind, Williams said, referring to the time-tested top-sellers from The Beatles and Nirvana. Escapology has sold five million copies since its release two months ago. But achieving a status similar to that of The Beatles could be difficult  Williams recently split with long-time writing partner Guy Chambers.																								EMI, the worlds third largest record label, is hoping hes got a classic in him too. The company forked out one of the most lucrative recording contracts of all time, widely believed to $125 million. Williams, sporting dark sunglasses for his late-afternoon news conference, said hes not feeling the pressure.																								Ive sold nearly 30 million albums. If EMI get 5 an album, you do the maths, he said coolly. All I have to do is repeat it, and I can do it. 																								He also dismissed the notion that he has to conquer the worlds largest music market, the US, where he has not sold well in the past, in order for Escapology to be a success.

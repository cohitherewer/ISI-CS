																								San Antonio, Oct. 14: An early morning mug of coffee doesnt just raise the spirits, it also makes men more fertile, according to research.																								Scientists have shown that sperm become more active  and more likely to fertilise an egg  when they are exposed to caffeine. Researchers at Sao Paulo University, Brazil, looked at 750 men undergoing vasectomies and divided them into four groups depending on how much coffee they drank each day.																								Fabio Pasqualotto, who led the study, found no differences in hormone levels or the number of sperm. However, sperm mobility was higher in patients who drink coffee compared with patients who do not drink coffee, he said. Caffeine could become a useful tool for helping infertile men, he said.

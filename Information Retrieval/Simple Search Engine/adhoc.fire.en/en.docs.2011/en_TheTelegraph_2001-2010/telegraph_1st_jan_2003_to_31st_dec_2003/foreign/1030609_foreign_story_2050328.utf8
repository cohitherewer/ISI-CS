				 	 Hillary Clinton 																								New York, June 8 (PTI): Despite being heartbroken and outraged after learning of the Monica Lewinsky affair, former US First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton still felt Bill Clinton as the most interesting and energising person.																								The excerpts from her upcoming memoir Living History, made public yesterday, reveals the various ups and downs in the couples relationship, especially during the impeachment of the former President by the house of representatives and his narrow acquittal by the senate. All I know is that no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energising and fully alive person I have ever met, she says.																								Bill Clinton and I started a conversation in the spring of 1971, and more than 30 years later, were still talking. What can I say to explain a love that has persisted for decades and has grown through our shared experiences of parenting a daughter, burying our parents and tending our extended families, a lifetime worth of friends, a common faith and an abiding commitment to our country, she asks. 																								The memoir, described by Time magazine as a love poem, a policy paper, a travelogue and a campaign memo, describes how she and Clinton first met, her adjustments to the White House, the trials of health care, Whitewater, impeachment and finally, how she and her marriage survived the most public and painful of indiscretions.

 Monday, December 08, 2003 				 Soldier killed in Iraq strike
																								Baghdad, Dec. 7 (Reuters): The top US general in Iraq warned today of an upsurge in attacks in the months before Washington hands over sovereignty in June, as insurgents killed an American soldier in a roadside bomb attack in the north.																								Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez also urged Iraqis to help find fugitive former dictator Saddam Hussein  whom he called a needle in a haystack  and said US forces would keep up their offensive against insurgents using any weapon at their disposal.																								In the latest fatal attack on US forces, guerrillas blew apart a Humvee with a roadside bomb in the northern Iraq city of Mosul, killing one American soldier and wounding two.																								We heard an explosion and ran towards it. I saw four US soldiers lying on the ground, with their Humvee destroyed, Mosul policeman Hamid Saleh said.

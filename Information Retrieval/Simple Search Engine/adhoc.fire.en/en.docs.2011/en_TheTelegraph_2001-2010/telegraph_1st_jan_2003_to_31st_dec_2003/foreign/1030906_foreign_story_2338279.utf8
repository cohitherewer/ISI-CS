 GRAHAM TIBBETTS																								London, Sept. 5: For decades fans of PG Wodehouse have tramped round rural England in search of their holy grail  the location of the mythical Blandings Castle.																								Following a trail of subtle clues left by the author, the pilgrims have attempted to pinpoint the country seat of Lord Emsworth, his eccentric family and his prize pig, the Empress of Blandings. But their hunt may now be at an end after two geographers claimed to have solved the enduring mystery using the latest computer mapping technology. 																								Ian Greatbatch and Daryl Lloyd, both PhD students at University College London, have identified 19th century Apley Park House near Bridgnorth, Shropshire as Wodehouses inspiration. I am dead chuffed. It looks almost exactly as I would have imagined it, said Lloyd, 25. Its uncanny that an objective approach should have come up with a castle that looks so right.																								Their mission began last year when the two Wodehouse buffs decided to turn their geographical skills to a long-standing problem. I was reading Sunset At Blandings, which had an appendix about a previous search for Blandings, said Greatbatch, 30.																								It started off with a conversation in the pub. We thought we could apply what we do to this particular subject.																								The 12 Blandings novels and short stories follow the fortunes of Lord Emsworth, his son, brother, 10 sisters and the empress during the pre-war years. Through them Wodehouse weaves teasing references to the possible location of the fictional country retreat.																								They reveal that the estate is in Shropshire; has a view of the Wrekin hill; is 45 minutes drive from Shrewsbury, not hurrying; has the Severn near or within its grounds; is 2.5 to three miles from the notional village of Market Blandings, which in turn is three hours 41 minutes by train from Paddington and has a drive three quarters of a mile long from the main road, a boating lake and water meadows.																								Lloyd and Greatbatch fed the information into Geographical Information Systems  a technique more commonly used to identify suitable sites for new supermarkets. Drawing on a series of computer-based maps, it enabled them to cross reference the various clues until they came up with a location that they are 98 per cent confident is correct.																								Intriguingly, another Wodehouse enthusiast, Norman Murphy, who had previously visited 20 possible Blandings, had singled out Apley as a likely candidate. However, he eventually plumped for Sudeley in Gloucestershire as the castle and Weston Park, east of Telford, as the estate. 																								The pair delivered their findings at the Royal Geographical Societys annual conference in Kensington yesterday. Murphy, a former president of the PG Wodehouse Society, remains to be convinced, however.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

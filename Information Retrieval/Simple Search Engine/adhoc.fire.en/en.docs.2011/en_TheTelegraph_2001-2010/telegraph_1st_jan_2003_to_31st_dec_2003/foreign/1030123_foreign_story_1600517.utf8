 Thursday, January 23, 2003 				 23 killed in Mexico quake
																								Colima (Mexico), Jan. 22 (Reuters): A powerful earthquake shook central and western Mexico, killing at least 23 people on the Pacific coast, a death toll that could rise further today once the full extent of the damage is revealed.																								Emergency workers struggled through the night to treat dozens of injured and pull victims from the rubble of collapsed homes and buildings in Colima, a city of some 125,000 people just inland from the Pacific coast. Colima Governor Fernando Moreno said at least 21 people were killed in the state after the quake struck late yesterday. Two others were killed in the neighboring state of Jalisco.																								They were crushed, or they suffocated when walls and houses collapsed on top of them, he said this morning, adding that the death toll could still rise further. Since we were without electricity for five hours, we havent been able to make a thorough check, he said.																								Dazed residents slept in the open air or sat in chairs in the street on a balmy night, too scared of possible after-shocks to go back into their homes.																								There are many houses that have fallen down and many buildings destroyed, Red Cross volunteer Marta Requena said in Colima near the epicenter.

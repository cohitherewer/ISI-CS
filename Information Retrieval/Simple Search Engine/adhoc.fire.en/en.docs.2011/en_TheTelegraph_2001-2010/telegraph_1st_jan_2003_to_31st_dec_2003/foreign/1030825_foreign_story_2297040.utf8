The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, August 25, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Comic caper																																	 Edinburgh, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Geek was chic for US comedian Demetri Martin today as he won Britains most prestigious comedy award at Edinburghs Fringe festival with a nerd-centric routine that drew on charts, graphs and palindromes.																																	Martin, provoking guffaws with a 222-word poem that read the same backwards as forwards, is only the second American to win the 7,500 Perrier Comedy Award.																																	The prize is traditionally a launching pad for up-and-coming young comedians. Past winners include Oscar-winning actor Emma Thompson, Blackadder veterans Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie and TV funny man Frank Skinner.																																	Martin, a 30-year-old Yale drop-out, beat out favourite, Australian Adam Hills, along with fellow American Reginald D. Hunter, Britains Howard Read and the New Zealand spoof musicians Flight of the Conchords.																																	With an act packed with linguistic word games and mathematic minutiae, Martin has described himself as a nomadic obsessive.																																	The winner of a Jury Prize at the Aspen Comedy festival, he has a development deal with the Hollywood studio Dreamworks.																													 																Hair hunt Kuala Lumpur (Reuters): A Malaysian  teenager was given a forced haircut by Muslim authorities  who deemed his punk-style Mohican un-Islamic. The Star  newspaper reported on Saturday that the unnamed 17-year-old   described as a high school dropout  was nabbed by the  Islamic Development Unit of Kota Baru, Kelantan, a north-eastern  state controlled by the Islamic political party PAS. The  paper said officials lectured him against emulating destructive  culture before taking the scissors to his red-dyed Mohican.

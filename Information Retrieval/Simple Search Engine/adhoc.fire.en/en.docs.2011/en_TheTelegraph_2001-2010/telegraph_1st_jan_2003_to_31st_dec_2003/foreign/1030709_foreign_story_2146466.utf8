 Wednesday, July 09, 2003 				 YSL wants to start all over again
																								Paris, July 8 (AFP): Legendary French designer Yves Saint Laurent, who retired in January 2002, said late yesterday that he missed working and that the new collection of his former muse made him want to start all over again. 																								Coco Chanel began working again at age 70! the 67-year-old Saint Laurent said at the presentation of the autumn-winter 2003-2004 collection of his onetime muse Loulou de la Falaise, held during haute couture week in Paris. 																								Saint Laurents retirement triggered the closure of his fabled couture house in October last year, bringing an end to a fashion era that begun when he and his partner Pierre Berge created the label. De La Falaise, who once served as director for YSLs accessories and jewellery line, now has her own boutique where she sells clothing, bags and jewellery. 																								Sometimes, I feel terribly bored, he said. In terms of my morale, everything is not perfect yet, but I feel better that I dont have all those responsibilities. 																								 quot;I had too much distress, too many worries. Everything was too much for me physically and mentally when I was working. I rest a lot now, quot; he said. 																								Saint Laurent explained that he had been hospitalised for pulmonary edema, a life-threatening condition that causes the lungs to fill with fluid, which he said had been caused by his excessive smoking. 																								 quot;Im not totally back on my feet, but Im okay, quot; he admitted, adding that he would spend the summer in the Moroccan port of Tangiers. 																								The French designer also noted that he had recently taken drawing classes so that he could eventually be able to design theatre sets. 																								French choreographer Roland Petit -- with whom Saint Laurent has collaborated several times -- recently asked him to work on his next production for Russias Kirov ballet, the designer told AFP. 																								 quot;Maybe thats how I will come back, quot; he said.

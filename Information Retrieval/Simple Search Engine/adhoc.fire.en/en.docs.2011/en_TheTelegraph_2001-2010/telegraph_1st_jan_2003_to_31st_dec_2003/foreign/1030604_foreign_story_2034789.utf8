 Wednesday, June 04, 2003 				 Suu Kyi not hurt, says govt
																								Yangon, June 3 (Reuters): Myanmars military government said today that detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi had not been harmed in last weeks clashes between her supporters and pro-government groups, rejecting rumours she had been injured.																								World leaders have urged Myanmar to release the Nobel peace laureate and democracy leader who was detained on Friday after violence erupted as she toured a northern town. The government said four people were killed and 50 injured in the disturbances, but there has been a flurry of rumours in Myanmar dissidents circles  including many exiles in Thailand  that she received a head injury. 																								Deputy foreign minister Khin Maung Win told diplomats in Yangon that was not true. The minister said reports that Aung San Suu Kyi was injured were false, said a diplomat who attended a briefing by Khin Maung Win.

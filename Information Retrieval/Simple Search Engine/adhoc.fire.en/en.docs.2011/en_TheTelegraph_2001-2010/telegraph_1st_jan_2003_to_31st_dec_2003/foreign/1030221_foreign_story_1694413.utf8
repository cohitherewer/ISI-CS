 Friday, February 21, 2003 				 Briton shot dead in Riyadh
																								Riyadh, Feb. 20 (Reuters): A Briton residing in Saudi Arabia was shot dead in the capital Riyadh today and the alleged attacker arrested, Saudi television reported.																								The television said the Briton, who worked at a British aviation company in the kingdom, was attacked as he sat in his car at traffic lights.																								It identified the arrested man as Saud bin Ali bin Nasser, who worked at an automobile dealership, and said he was a naturalised Saudi citizen.																								The televison did not give the motive for the killing.																								A UN special investigator has cast doubt on the confessions of five Britons being held in Saudi Arabia over a series of bombings for which they could be sentenced to death.																								Four of the men, along with a Canadian and a Belgian, confessed on television in 2001 to the attacks in 2000 and 2001 that killed a Briton and an American.																								They all later withdrew the statements, although one of the men, James Lee, again admitted last month to being involved in the bombings, which Saudi officials say were part of a turf war over the lucrative liquor trade in the conservative Muslim state.

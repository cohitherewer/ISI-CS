 Wednesday, August 27, 2003 				 The smart way to check temperature
																								Singapore, Aug. 26 (Reuters): It sounds comical. An eye patch or sunglasses to read body temperature.																								But new technology developed by a Yale University researcher aims to do just that, providing athletes with a constant reading of body temperature to prevent heat stroke and dehydration.																								The wireless technology, unveiled in Singapore today, triggers an alarm when body temperature reaches a pre-set level  sending a reminder to sweaty athletes to guzzle water when their body gets too warm.																								Officials from Giant Wireless Technology Ltd said the Hong Kong-based company expected to launch commercial applications for the technology, known as TempAlert, early next year.																								This could take the form of an eyepatch or conventional sunglasses, they told a briefing in Singapore. 																								Dr Marc Abreu of the Yale School of Medicine who developed the technology said it could also be used by couples to monitor the female body for tracking fertility.																								You will be able to track temperature changes continuously so youll know precisely when youre ovulating, Abreu said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Attack blame pinned on Saddam
 PHILIP SHERWELL Baghdad, Dec. 20: Saddam  Hussein was personally directing the post-war insurgency  inside Iraq, playing a far more active role than thought,  American intelligence officers have concluded since his  capture.																								Despite the bewildered appearance of the deposed dictator when he was hauled from his hiding-hole last weekend, he is believed to have been issuing regular instructions on targets and tactics through five trusted lieutenants. 																								This could have serious implications for his status in US custody. American officials have made it clear that he will lose his rights as a prisoner of war if he was involved in the post-war violence.																								Documents found in his briefcase when he was caught indicated he had been kept informed of the progress of the insurgency but they did not suggest he had overall control of operations by former Baath Party loyalists. However, since the arrest and interrogation of guerrilla leaders named in the paperwork, US investigators believe Saddam was at the head of an elaborate network of rebel cells.																								They have put together a detailed picture of Saddams support structure while in hiding. This enabled him to issue commands without the use of satellite phones that could be picked up by monitoring devices.																								The Daily Telegraph has also learned that millions of dollars to support the insurgency were recovered in raids on other suspected Saddam safe houses. US officials say he was in regular contact with five enablers  veterans of his feared security services drawn from his power base of Tikrit. 																								Each man had his own responsibility: logistics, financing, planning, operations and as chief of staff. It was the last of these, picked up in a swoop in Baghdad nine days ago, who gave Saddams hiding place.																								They knew where he was and were able to travel to him or meet him somewhere, said Major Stan Murphy, the intelligence officer for the 4th Infantry Divisions 1st Brigade, which captured the deposed dictator.																								The enablers kept Saddam informed and passed his commands to a second layer of subordinates, who headed rebel cells in cities such as Samarra and Fallujah and who passed the orders down through several tiers to the lowest level operatives.																								He would give very general guidance like, Hey, Id like to see more attacks,  the major said. His enablers would then go out to the various tiers below them and give specific guidance, money and weapons.																								By capturing Saddam and several leaders of his fidayeen fighters, the Americans believe they have dealt a serious blow to the Baathist insurgency.																								It is unclear, however, if the recent breakthroughs will have a significant impact on the home-grown and foreign Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas motivated by religious fervour and hatred of America.																								Meanwhile, two more attacks were reported on former senior Baathists in the holy city of Najaf, where Shia leaders have also been targeted. In one incident, the five-year-old son of a former Baathist official was shot dead when attackers fired at his mother.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

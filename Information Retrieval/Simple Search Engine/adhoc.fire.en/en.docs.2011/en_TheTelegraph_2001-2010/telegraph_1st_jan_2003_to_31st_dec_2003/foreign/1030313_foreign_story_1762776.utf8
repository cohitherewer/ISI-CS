 Thursday, March 13, 2003 				 Furore over fries
																								Paris, March 12 (Reuters): The US Congress picked on the wrong country when it replaced French fries with Freedom fries on its menus to protest Frances opposition to a possible US-led war in Iraq, according to a Belgian fry expert.																								Michel Mes, who runs the website www.belgianfries.com, said that fried potatoes were invented in Belgium, not France, and were only referred to as French fries in the US. Of course, in good food tradition, the French claim to be the inventors of our beloved fries, he writes on the website. 																								Anyway, we modest Belgians dont mind the French claim, because we know that fries are Gods gift to our people. 																								Restaurants in the US House of Representatives replaced the name French fries with Freedom fries yesterday in a small ceremony widely broadcast with commentaries on French TV.

Grannies on the go Rome, May 7 (Reuters): Out with sexy 20-year-old women in barely-there bikinis. Think wise-cracking grannies. Italys most popular television show plans to drop its regular offering of voluptuous young dancers in skimpy outfits and is on the hunt for Italys coolest woman over 65.But while the semi-clad young things were required only to shimmy in and out of the set in between skits and celebrity interviews, the senior showgirls will perform dance routines, tell jokes and answer questions about their lives.Were looking for women who are spontaneous and are prepared to make fun of themselves, Gianna Tani, casting director of Striscia la Notizia (roughly Strip the News), told Il Messaggero newspaper.Trials have started for the show, which will run all summer on Canale 5, one of the channels owned by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis Mediaset company. One of the most promising candidates was an 82-year-old lady from the Veneto, who told hilarious jokes, Tani said.Noise merit London (Reuters): A British church minister fined over the noisy singing, clapping and loud music at his church lost a court appeal on Wednesday on the grounds it was devoid of merit.

Local authorities and New South Wales state Premier, Bob Carr, slammed the green, marijuana motif covers as promoting drug use to young people. A big overreaction, said Robert Punch, owner, chief executive and founder of Corporate Phone Covers. Its a novelty. You wouldnt go and buy a big block of chocolate after smelling the chocolate one, he said. Made in China and arrayed next to chocolate, strawberry, blueberry, cherry and rose-scented snap-on covers, the marijuana version sold well, though only to the over 18s, Punch said. It sells better than the strawberry, much better, he said. Surf at loo London (Reuters): The worlds first portable lavatory with Internet access is due to be unveiled in Britain this summer. The iLoo is being built by Microsoft Corps internet arm MSN which aims to showcase its creation at Britains summer music festivals. The Internet is so much a part of everyday life now that surfing on the loo was the next natural step, said MSN marketing manager Tracy Blacher on Tuesday. The converted lavatory will feature a wireless keyboard, plasma screen and quick internet access. In 2001, MSN installed  Copyright

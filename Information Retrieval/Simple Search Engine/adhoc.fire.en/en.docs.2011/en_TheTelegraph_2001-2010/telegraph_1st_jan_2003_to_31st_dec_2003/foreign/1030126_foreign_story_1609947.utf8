 Sunday, January 26, 2003 				 Koirala in democracy battle cry
																								Kathmandu, Jan. 25 (PTI): Warning that King Gyanendra could face serious consequences if he refused to hand power back to the people, former Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said he was ready to lead the struggle for restoration of democracy in the country.																								All the democratic parties are prepared to launch a joint struggle against the royal move and I am ready to lead the struggle, the Nepali Congress President said while inaugurating the general convention of the Nepal Students Union (NSU) in Birgunj. Power does not come by begging, so joint struggle is the only way to snatch power from the monarch, he said.																								In his hard-hitting address yesterday, Koirala said: There is no place for absolute monarchy in the present world.																								Kings who have no place in the hearts of the people cannot be welcome anywhere else. I cannot guarantee favourable consequences to the king if he continues to exercise power and refuses to return it to the people, Koirala said. 																								No one is ready to believe that the king is the incarnations of Lord Vishnu especially after the royal palace massacre of 2001, Koirala, who was the Prime Minister when the palace massacre took place, said.																								Koirala asked the students to be ready for the struggle to return power to the people.

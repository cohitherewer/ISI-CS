 Thursday, August 21, 2003 				 Cannabis on trial as pain-killer
																								London, Aug. 20 (Reuters): Queen Victoria took it for period cramps, multiple sclerosis sufferers have long praised its soothing effects  now cannabis is to be given to British patients to see if it eases pain after surgery.																								Hundreds of Britons are being recruited to take cannabis capsules after operations, as part of a major study.																								Anecdotal evidence suggests cannabis  taken by many thousands of people across the world as a recreational drug  does soothe pain, but British scientists said today it was now time for proper clinical tests.																								Many patients and clinicians want an answer to the question of whether cannabis is effective at relieving pain, said Anita Holdcroft, the doctor leading the study.																								We need to assess the scientific merits of some of the anecdotal evidence and we need to do this in the same way as any other experimental pain treatment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, October 17, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Rat gets rapped																																	Brussels, Oct. 16 (Reuters): A supermarket rat who had dodged a host of poison traps got its come-uppance when an 80-year-old shopper knocked it unconscious after it tried to steal her cheese, a Belgian daily said today.																																	The rat had been hiding in the supermarket for a month, but staff attempts to trap the rodent had repeatedly failed.																																	The woman told the daily Gazet Van Antwerpen how she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her hand after picking up a pack of cheese at the supermarket just outside Brussels.																																	A rat the size of my hand, was hanging on my finger, she told the paper.																																	I grabbed the rat with my other hand and smacked it on the floor. The animal was on the floor, completely knocked unconscious.																													 																Brief ban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (Reuters): Tanzania  has banned imports of second-hand underwear, fearing the  used garments might spread skin diseases, an official said  on Thursday. Underpants, bras, stockings and underskirts  are all covered by the new rule, which will be enforced  by inspectors examining consignments of used clothes entering  the east African country. This is a measure to safeguard  human health, said Liandry Kinabo, head of process technology  standards at the Tanzania Bureau of Standards, said. The  ban came into force on Wednesday. Imports of second-hand  clothes from rich nations form a significant part of the  economy in Tanzania and various other African countries,  where many people cannot afford new clothes.																													 																Foul Britain																																	London (Reuters): More than half of Britons could have breath that smells worse that their pets, according to a survey released on Thursday. And women are the worst offenders, with three out of five failing a sulphur emissions test, according to research by toothpaste manufacturer Aquafresh. Some mouths may be dirtier than cat litter, dentist Brian Grieveson said in a statement that accompanied the research. Most people in the UK do not realise that cleaning your tongue is as important as cleaning your teeth, he added. Scots had the best oral hygiene, with only 10 per cent suffering bad breath, compared to 27 per cent in London. Throughout the nation, 52 per cent were rated at a level that could be worse than that of a pet animal. We are one of the last countries to understand the need to clean our tongue, with people in America and parts of Europe practising tongue cleaning routinely, said Grieveson. Secretaries were the freshest profession, achieving 100 per cent freshness in the survey of 1,000 people, while retail staff fared worst and received the warning:You could be losing sales.

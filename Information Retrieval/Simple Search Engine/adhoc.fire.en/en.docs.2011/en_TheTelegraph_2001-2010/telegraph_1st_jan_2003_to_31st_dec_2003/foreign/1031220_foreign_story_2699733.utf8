 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Eating disorders lead to addiction
																								Washington, Dec. 19 (Reuters): People with eating disorders are much more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol or smoke than the general population, according to a study released yesterday.																								Parents of girls with eating disorders should take special note of the report, issued by the National Centre on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University in New York.																								Individuals with eating disorders are up to five times likelier to abuse alcohol or illicit drugs, and those who abuse alcohol or illicit drugs are up to 11 times likelier to have eating disorders, Joseph Califano, CASA president and former US secretary of health, education and welfare, said in a statement.																								Both problems afflict the very young and quickly spiral out of control. High school girls with eating disorder symptoms are much likelier to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or use drugs than those without such symptoms. 																								Even middle-school girls  typically age 10 to 14  who have dieted in the previous month and evidence no eating pathology are almost twice as likely to become smokers as non-dieters.																								CASA collected information from federal government health data, and 500 books, reports and articles for its analysis.

 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Bremer hole in Blair claim
																								London, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Paul Bremer, the top US man in Iraq, contradicted Britains Tony Blair today when he rejected reports that inspectors had found a network of laboratories that could be used to produce banned weapons.																								In a pre-Christmas broadcast on the British Forces Broadcasting Service, the British Prime Minister said the Iraq Survey Group had already found massive evidence of a huge system of clandestine laboratories.																								Asked on ITVs Dimbleby programme about those words, the US administrator for Iraq, apparently unaware they came from Blair, was dismissive.																								It sounds like a bit of a red herring to me. It sounds like somebody who doesnt agree with the policy, sets up a red herring and then knocks it down, he said. When it was pointed out that it was Blair who had publicised those claims, Bremer appeared to row back a little. There is a lot of evidence that has been made public, he said.																								A spokeswoman in Blairs Downing Street office said the Prime Minister had been referring to material published in the weapons inspection groups interim report earlier this year.																								The existence, or otherwise, of chemical and biological weapons in Iraq remains a huge issue for Blair despite Saddam Husseins capture earlier this month. Blair told sceptical Britons war on Iraq was necessary because of the threat posed by its banned weapons. Nine months after Saddam was toppled, not one of the weapons he claimed the Iraqi leader had primed for use has been found.																								A survey released today labelled Blair Britains least trustworthy politician. The poll for website CyberBritain.com found almost 4,000 of over 13,000 people canvassed in the run-up to Christmas opted for the Prime Minister. Taint on Tony																								Former minister Clare Short today alleged Prime Minister Tony Blairs lies over Iraq were worse than those of John Profumo, the Tory minister who quit in 1963 after lying to the Commons over vice girls Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies. 																								For the honour of the government and the renewal of the Labour Party, I very much hope he steps down gracefully, she said in an interview to Sky News.

 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Iraq war had nothing to do with decision
																								London, Dec. 20 (Reuters): The son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said today Libyas decision to abandon banned weapons programmes should improve relations with the US and other major powers.																								It will pave the way for the normalisation of political relations with the States and also with the West in general and also will lead to eliminate any threat against Libya from the West and from the States in particular, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi told CNN.																								He said Libya wanted to make clear it now had no military nuclear ambitions. 																								I think the intention at the beginning (was) to use that (nuclear) system for civilian purposes, but also we know that it is easy to be transferred into a military project, al-Islam said.																								And thats why we want to be sure that the Americans are aware of the whole programme and they know that it will be just used in future for... civilian purposes and not for military purposes, because (from) our point of view there is no need anymore for acquiring a nuclear weapon, he said.																								We dont have any biological activities, he added.																								Libyas move was the culmination of secret negotiations with Britain and the US launched around the start of the Iraq war and announced less than a week after US forces captured ousted dictator Saddam Hussein.																								But al-Islam said the war in Iraq had nothing to do with Libyas decision to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programmes. It was long and tough and secret negotiations for almost nine months. But at the end, two weeks ago, we closed a deal and we said okay, now it is a done deal. In fact we started the cooperation before even the invasion of Iraq and we decided to announce the outcome of that cooperation two weeks ago, and that means the capture of Saddam or the invasion of Iraq is irrelevant, he said. 																								Gaddafis son and a charity he heads were instrumental in negotiating a $2.7 billion compensation deal over the Lockerbie bombing and separate talks with France over the bombing of a French airliner. The Lockerbie compensation deal opened the way for the lifting of UN sanctions earlier this year.

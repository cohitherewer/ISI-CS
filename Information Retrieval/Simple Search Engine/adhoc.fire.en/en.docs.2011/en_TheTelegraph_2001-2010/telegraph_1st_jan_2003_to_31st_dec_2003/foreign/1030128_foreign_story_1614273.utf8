The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, January 28, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Thai massage missive																																	 Bangkok, Jan. 27 (Reuters): A massage a day keeps the Thai death toll at bay.																																	Thats the message from Thailands health ministry, which said today it planned to set up traditional massage services at petrol stations to help motorists relieve stress and, hopefully, cut the road toll. The ministry, in a statement, said it was working with a Thai fuel company to provide the services in 21 petrol stations on major inter-city highways and around Bangkok from next month.																																	The more hours people continue to drive on roads, the less concentration motorists tend to have and the more accidents are likely to occur, Vichai Chokevivat, head of the ministrys department of Thai traditional medicine, said. A 15-minute pause for stretching or massage will help relieve their stress, Vichai said. On average, two people die in road accidents every hour in Thailand  one of the worlds worst accident rates, the ministry said.

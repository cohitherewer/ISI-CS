 Friday, September 19, 2003 				 Suu Kyi undergoes surgery
																								Yangon, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has undergone successful surgery for gynaecological problems at a private hospital in Yangon, Japans Kyodo news agency said today.																								Kyodo quoted hospital sources as saying Suu Kyi was at the Asia Royal Hospital and had undergone an operation on the uterus today morning.																								This is not true, hospital administration officer Myat Thu told reporters. But a Yangon doctor said she had entered the hospital. It is quite true. I have friends who work at the hospital and they say she was there, the doctor said.																								A doctor at the hospital said the ninth floor was sealed off yesterday and plainclothes security men were in the building.																								There were arrangements for an operation on a VIP patient, but only authorised people could gain access, the second doctor said.																								Myanmars military junta has kept Suu Kyi, 58, at an undisclosed location since May 30, after a bloody clash between her followers and government supporters in northern Myanmar.																								The junta says she is being held for her own protection and has ignored an international outcry over her detention, saying it will free her when political temperatures cool.																								Special envoys from the UN and Indonesia are awaiting permission to visit Myanmar to check on Suu Kyis condition and press for her release.																								The US said earlier this month it had credible reporting that Myanmars pro-democracy icon was on a hunger strike, which Yangon vehemently denied.

 Saturday, March 08, 2003 				 UK cleric sentenced
																								London, March 7 (Reuters): A London-based Muslim cleric, accused of supporting Osama bin Laden, was sentenced to nine years imprisonment today for urging his followers to kill non-believers in a holy war.																								Jamaican-born Sheikh Abdullah el-Faisal, 39, was also ordered to be deported from Britain on release. He was convicted at the Old Bailey central criminal court last month on three rare charges of incitement to murder and found guilty of three counts of stirring up racial hatred through the use of threatening and abusive words.																								Faisal urged his followers to use chemical and nuclear weapons in an Islamic holy war, the court had heard. He encouraged his audiences to wage war against non-believers, in particular Hindus and Jews.

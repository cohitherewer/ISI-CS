 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 UN nuke inspector arrives in Libya
																								Tripoli, Dec. 27 (Reuters): The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog arrived in Tripoli today to begin scrutinising Libyas nuclear facilities, saying the country did not seem to have been close to building an atomic bomb.																								International Atomic Energy Agency director-general Mohamed ElBaradei said on his way to take up Libyas recent offer to open its nuclear facilities there were no signs it had enriched uranium  a step that could be the first move to a bomb. From the look of it, they were not close to a weapon, but we need to go and see it and discuss the details with them, he said in an interview on the flight to Tripoli.																								The important thing for me is to get a comprehensive understanding of the programme  the origin, its history, its extent, and then agree with the Libyan authorities on a plan of action to eliminate whatever needs to be eliminated that is not linked to peaceful activities.																								Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafis oil-rich state, long on the US list of sponsors of terrorism, said earlier this month it was abandoning plans to build an atomic bomb and other banned weapons.																								The move marks an about-face for the mercurial Gaddafi, who seized power 34 years ago in the desert nation of 5.5 million. He now wants trading benefits, including an end to US sanctions, in return.																								ElBaradei met senior Libyan officials on his arrival.

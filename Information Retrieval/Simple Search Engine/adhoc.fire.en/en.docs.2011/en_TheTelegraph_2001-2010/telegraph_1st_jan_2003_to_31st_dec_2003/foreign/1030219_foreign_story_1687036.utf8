				 	 Nicole Kidman																								London, Feb. 18 (Reuters): Hollywood star Nicole Kidman confessed today that she has a phobia of acting and said: Every time I star in a film, I think I cannot act.																								Kidman, hotly tipped for an Oscar for her critically acclaimed role in The Hours, said: Ive tried to pull out of almost every one Ive done because of sheer terror.																								I can always come up with a list of actresses who would do better and try to convince the director to cast someone else, she told Britains Radio Times magazine. The Australian actress said her parents  Anthony, a psychiatrist, and Janelle, a nurse and teacher  were certainly not star-struck by her success.																								My mother keeps telling me to call it quits, she said. She thinks my nature is too fragile for acting. Shed love it if I was a writer and had a more secluded life. I agree. Kidman said her parents did not even come to the Academy Awards when she was nominated for he role in Moulin Rouge because they were on a bush-walking trek.

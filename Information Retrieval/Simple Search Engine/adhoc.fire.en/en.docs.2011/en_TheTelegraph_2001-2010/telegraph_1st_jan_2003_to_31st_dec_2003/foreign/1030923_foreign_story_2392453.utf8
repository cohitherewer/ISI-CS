 Tuesday, September 23, 2003 				 Cloning hope for Parkinsons
																								Washington, Sept. 22 (Reuters): US researchers yesterday said they had used cloned cells to treat a Parkinson-like disease in mice and said it provided a good experimental basis for testing whether so-called therapeutic cloning will work.																								While they did not clone each individual mouse, the cells they used were from cloned embryos and relieved the symptoms of artificially induced Parkinsons, they reported in this weeks issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology.																								Cloning is highly controversial but many scientists believe therapeutic cloning can revolutionise medicine. The idea is for a patient to provide a single cell that could be manipulated and grown into new tissue or even organs. 																								Theoretically, it could cure juvenile diabetes, severe injuries and diseases such as Parkinsons which is caused when the body mistakenly destroys healthy brain cells.																								Lorenz Studer of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York and colleagues were working with embryonic stem cells  the bodys master cells, valued because they have the potential to become any kind of cell in the body.																								The cells were directed to become several different types of brain cell  including the dopamine-producing cells that are destroyed in Parkinsons.																								The researchers created symptoms of Parkinsons in six mice using chemicals to damage their brains, then transplanted the dopamine-producing cells into their brains.																								The symptoms of the mice got better, the researchers reported. Usually mice with this brain damage walk in constant circles.																								When killed and examined, the mice had healthy colonies of the transplanted cells in their brains. There has been great interest in developing renewable cell sources for the generation of dopamine neurons in the experimental treatment of Parkinson disease, they wrote.

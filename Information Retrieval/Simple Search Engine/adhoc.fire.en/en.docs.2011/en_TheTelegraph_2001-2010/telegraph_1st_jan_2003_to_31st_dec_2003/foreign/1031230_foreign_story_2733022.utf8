Saddam has confessed the names of people he told to keep the money and he gave names of those who have information on equipment and weapons warehouses, Iyad Allawi, a member of the US-appointed Iraqi governing council, told the London-based Asharq al-Awsat daily.																								The governing council is searching for $40 billion worth of funds seized by Saddam when he was in power and which has been deposited in Switzerland, Japan, Germany and other countries under the names of fictitious companies, Allawi said.																								He said the council had asked international legal companies to track the money.																								Allawi said interrogators were now focusing on whether Saddam had any links to militant groups.

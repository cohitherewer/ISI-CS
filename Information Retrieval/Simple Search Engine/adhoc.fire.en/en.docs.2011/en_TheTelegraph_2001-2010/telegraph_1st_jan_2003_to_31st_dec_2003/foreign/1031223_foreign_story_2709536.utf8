 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Oil scent puts Putin in write-off mode
				 	 Head of Iraqs governing council Abdel Aziz al-Hakim with Russia President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow (AFP)																								Moscow, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Russia offered to write off 65 per cent of Iraqs $8-billion debt after Baghdad signalled that Moscow was in a good position to revive pre-war oil contracts.																								A member of the Iraqi governing council, Samir Sumaidy, said Russia made the proposal at a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and the head of the US-backed council Abdul Aziz al-Hakim at the Kremlin.																								Putin has made an offer of Russia exempting Iraq from 65 per cent of their debts. That is a decision made by Russia to be confirmed within the Paris Club, Sumaidy said after attending a meeting at the Kremlin.																								A roadside bomb killed two US soldiers in Baghdad today, hours after troops captured a former general in Saddam Husseins once-feared security services on charges of recruiting ex-soldiers to attack Americans.																								The blast that ripped through a military convoy in the late morning also killed an Iraqi interpreter and wounded two other soldiers, the US military said in a statement. The military deaths, the first in five days, brought to 202 the number of US soldiers killed by hostile fire since the US declared major combat over in Iraq on May 1.																								Hakim met Putin after a tour of west European countries devoted to reconstruction and efforts to cut Iraqs debt burden after the US-led war that ousted President Saddam Hussein.																								Despite Russias offer, sources close to the Paris Club of creditors said nothing had been discussed concerning potential write-off levels as far as the group was concerned as a whole, and suggested no such offer would be coming any time soon.																								Theres never been any discussion on (write-off) figures  the in-depth analysis of the situation still has to be completed, one source said. Hakim told Putin that Russia, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, could help ensure the world bodys role in post-war Iraq.

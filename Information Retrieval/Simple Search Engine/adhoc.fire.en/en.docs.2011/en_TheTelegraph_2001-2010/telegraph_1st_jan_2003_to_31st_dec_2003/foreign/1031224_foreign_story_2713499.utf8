 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 US accepts Musharraf assurance on secrets
																								Washington, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has assured the US that his government is not  at least in the present time  providing any nuclear secrets to countries like Iran and North Korea, Bush administration officials said today.																								White House spokesman Scott McClellan called Musharrafs personal assurances important and said close cooperation between the US and Pakistan in the war on terrorism would continue  despite any transfers of nuclear technology and know-how that might have taken place in the past. 																								That is the past. And for a variety of reasons, Im not in a position to discuss those matters, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. But let me talk to the Present. President Musharraf has assured us there are not any transfers of WMD-related technologies or know-how going on in the present time, McClellan said. Diplomats in Vienna said last month the UNs International Atomic Energy Agency was investigating whether blueprints for Irans centrifuge had come from someone in Pakistan or elsewhere.																								Tehran has acknowledged using centrifuge designs that appear identical to ones used in Islamabads nuclear weapons programme. 																								The Pakistani government said yesterday that Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistans atom bomb, was being questioned about reports of possible nuclear links between the two countries. Khan is a national hero in Pakistan for developing a nuclear bomb tested in 1998 to rival Indias.

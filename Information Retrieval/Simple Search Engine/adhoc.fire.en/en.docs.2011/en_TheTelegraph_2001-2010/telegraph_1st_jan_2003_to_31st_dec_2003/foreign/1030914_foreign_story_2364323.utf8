The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, September 14, 2003 				 Madonna felt isolated in school
				 	 Madonna																								London, Sept. 13 (Reuters): Madonna, whose mother died when she was five, always felt friendless and isolated as a schoolgirl, she says in an interview in the Times.																								It wasnt until I became successful that I filled up my emptiness, said the multi-millionaire pop icon who embarks on yet another career on Monday when her first childrens book  The English Roses  is launched.																								I felt very awkward and out of place in school. Not popular, not attractive, not special in any way and I was longing for love and approval from someone, she said in the interview published today. Madonna, the fiercely determined mistress of reinvention, said: This will sound shocking but I think I would have had more natural confidence if Id had a mother.																								Now she herself is a 45-year-old mother of two who felt inspired to pen a childrens book when reading at bedtime to her own daughter. You know the women in Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty or Snow White are really passive. They dont move the plot along at all.																								They just show up, theyre beautiful, they get snapped up by the princes, the princes tell them they want to marry them and then they go off and live happily ever after, Madonna complained. 																								And I thought: Whats a girl supposed to get out of this? Thats such a load of crap. Id read to the end and Id say to Lola: Wait a minute, nobody asked her what she wanted.																								The English Roses is a moralistic tale about four girls who exclude the lonely and beautiful Binah from their friendship.																								My daughter is, to a certain extent, a little bit of Binah as well because in school often children can be quite mean and ostracise her because Im her mother, she said.

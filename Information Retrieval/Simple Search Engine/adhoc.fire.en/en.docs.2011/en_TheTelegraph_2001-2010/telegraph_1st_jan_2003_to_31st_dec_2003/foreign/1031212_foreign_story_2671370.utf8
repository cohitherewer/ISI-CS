 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 EU divided on summit-eve
																								Brussels, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Poland cast grave doubt on chances of the European Union agreeing a new constitution at a crucial summit starting tomorrow after failing to find any common ground in talks with Germany.																								If I were to be a prophet today, there seems to be no possibility of an agreement, with such a rigid stance on the part of Germany and Polands determined and strongly-argued position, Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said.																								If Germanys position is unchangeable, then our position is also unchangeable, he said after meeting German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in Berlin today. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, host of the summit as Italy holds the blocs rotating presidency, said on arrival in Brussels it would take a miracle to clinch an agreement, although he added sometimes miracles happen.																								The leaders of all 15 EU members and 10 states due to join in May meet tomorrow for talks likely to drag on into Sunday to try to finalise a draft constitution designed to allow the bloc to function smoothly once it grows to 450 million people.																								Bitter divisions have emerged between the founders, led by France and Germany, which want a radical overhaul of the way voting power is distributed in the EU to reflect population size, and Poland and Spain, which want to retain the status quo. Germany said it would rather delay adopting the text than accept a watered down compromise.																								No result this year is in our opinion clearly better than a bad result that would delay or prevent the work of Europe for years, German foreign minister Joschka Fischer told parliament. The pre-summit mood was dominated by gloom and brinkmanship. A Spanish government official was highly critical of the way Italy had handled the pre-summit negotiations.																								We have not received a single proposal, he said. Nor have we received a visit from the presidency. Were stunned by the way the Italian presidency has acted the past few months. Prodi said one compromise would be to agree to a constitutional reform now but phase in elements gradually, with some possibly not entering force until 2014.

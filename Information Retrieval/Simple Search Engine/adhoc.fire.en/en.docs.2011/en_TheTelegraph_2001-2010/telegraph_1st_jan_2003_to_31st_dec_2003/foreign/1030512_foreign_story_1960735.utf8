The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, May 12, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																A Beatle in Rome																																	 Rome, May 11 (Reuters): Taking the floor where gladiators once battled wild beasts and fought to the death, ex-Beatle Paul McCartney brought rock  roll to Romes Colosseum for the first time. We understand its the first time theres been a band in the Colosseum since the Christians, McCartney joked with the audience, in reference to the persecution of the early Christians by the Romans.																						Rock the Colosseum, he yelled towards the end of the show last night, before launching into sing-along Beatles hit Hey Jude to a rapturous response. 																																	 its heyday some 2,000 years ago, the Colosseum could seat as many as 80,000, but yesterday just 400 people were let in for the benefit show. This is a beautiful, beautiful place, the 60-year-old star told the audience. 																						McCartney made ample use of his treasure trove of Beatles hits, with 18 of the 27 songs he performed coming from the pioneering 1960s bands repertoire  including Cant buy me love, Let it be and the classic of classics Yesterday.																													 																Fraud charge New York, (AP): A New York Times  reporter committed frequent acts of journalistic fraud,  including stealing material from other newspapers, inventing  quotes and lying about his whereabouts, according to an  investigation conducted by the paper. The review found problems  in at least 36 of the 73 articles written by Jayson Blair  from the time he began receiving national reporting assignments  in late October to his May 1 resignation. The Times described  the episode as a low point in the 152-year history of the  newspaper. Blair, 27, used these techniques to write falsely  about emotionally charged moments in recent history, from  the sniper attacks in suburban Washington to the anguish  of families grieving for loved ones killed in Iraq, according  to a story the Times posted on its website yesterday  before its publication in todays editions. Its a huge  black eye, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., chairman of the  New York Times Company and publisher said.

 Friday, August 01, 2003 				 Austrian in sky-diving feat
																								London, July 31 (Reuters): An Austrian stuntman today became the first person to skydive across the English Channel, free falling at 200 kmph in the process.																								Felix Baumgartner jumped out of a plane at 9,000 metres above Dover, England, wearing a specially constructed carbon wing and flew towards France before parachuting into hills above the port of Calais.																								I made it which is great, he told reporters on landing.																								Its pretty cold up there. I still can feel nothing, said the self-styled God of the Skies, who started parachuting as a teenager. 																								Setting off early in the morning to avoid commercial flights, Baumgartner used oxygen supplies during the 35 km flight to survive the rarefied air.

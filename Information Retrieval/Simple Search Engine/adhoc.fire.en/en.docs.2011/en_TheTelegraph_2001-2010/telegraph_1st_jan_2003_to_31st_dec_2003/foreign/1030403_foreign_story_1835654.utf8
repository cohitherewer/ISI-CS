 RICHARD T. COOPER																								Washington, April 2: The war in Iraq has entered a difficult phase in which protecting coalition forces without killing or wounding large numbers of civilians is growing more difficult by the day.																								During the opening phases of the war, many US combat troops moved north through open desert or bypassed major cities and towns. With plenty of space and time, troops on the line were spared the need to make instant judgments between life and death.																								But as elements of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 1st Marine Division advanced deeper into the more densely populated areas south of Baghdad yesterday, they were finding it increasingly troublesome to hold civilians at arms length.																								That proximity and the lightning-quick decisions that mark warfare mean that the margin of error is evaporating in a conflict that places a high priority on protecting American and coalition lives but also holding civilian casualties to a minimum - for both humanitarian and political reasons.																								In the cold calculus of war, there is always a trade-off between safeguarding ones own troops and protecting the lives of civilians. The closer troops are to civilians, and the faster a combat force tries to advance, the more difficult it becomes to avoid killing or injuring noncombatants caught in its path.																								The only way to get speed without US casualties is inordinate firepower, said Richard Hart Sinnreich, former director of the armys School of Advanced Military Studies. Were going to have to face the trade-off between speed and casualties  US military and Iraqi civilian casualties.																								These two political incentives are at war. And at some point, avoiding civilian casualties can lead to such delay that it ends up costing more lives, he said, echoing an argument made by many other military analysts.																								Fought over the objections of some of the US oldest allies, and virulent opposition in the Arab world, the war is fraught with political implications.																								That is why senior US officials have repeatedly emphasised their efforts to avoid civilian casualties. Commanders yesterday defended their troops right to protect themselves and said that any blame lies with Saddam Hussein.																								Officials with the US Central Command based in Doha, Qatar, said the bloodiest of several incidents  the killing of seven women and children in a car that US troops said ran a checkpoint  was under investigation. But they sought to shift responsibility to Iraqi fighters who they say often hide behind civilians.																								The blood is on the hands of the regime for their decisions and their willingness to use their population this way, said Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks, spokesman for Central Command. 																								If theres a question of morality, it really should go back to the regime. While we regret the loss of any civilian lives, Brooks added, at this point they remain unavoidable.																								Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed Brooks in remarks at yesterdays Pentagon briefing: Id like to express our regrets to the families of the Iraqis killed yesterday at the checkpoint near An Najaf. Loss of any innocent life is truly tragic. ``Our policy of doing all we can  to spare civilian lives stands in sharp contrast to the  Iraqi regimes constant violations of the international  laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Convention, let alone  decent human behavior, he said. ``The climate  established by the Iraqi regime contributed to this incident.` In Baghdad, Iraqi Vice President  Taha Yassin Ramadan rejected U.S explanations.``Those are  women and children. Even if they dont stop in time,  you dont shoot them like that, he said.  ``It was intentional. It reflects the nature of the aggression. Brooks said that troops were increasing  their ``vigilance in the wake of a suicide bombing  Saturday that killed four U.S. servicemen and that propaganda  campaigns that have been trying to win Iraqi support will  also inform them on how to behave at checkpoints. ``Youre dealing with young  kids on the front lines, be they from the U.K., Australia  or the U.S., said James Wilkinson, spokesman  for Franks. ``They may be jumpy out there, but they have  reason to be, because of the tactics of terror. More incidents involving civilians  were reported Tuesday. Capt. Kenrick Bourne of the 101st  Airborne said soldiers wounded seven women and children  in two shootings at checkpoints. He said that in both cases,  cars loaded with women and children but driven by men did  not stop at roadblocks. The problem in coming weeks is  not so much that Saddams regime has resorted to using  suicide bombers and paramilitary fighters who masquerade  as civilians. Standing alone, both are manageable.What elevates  such tactics into a major threat to U.S. troops and to the  Bush administrations larger  objectives for the war is the fact that Saddams regime  has embraced them just as the nature of the battlefield  has begun to change. ``We have accepted some operational  handicaps in order to be careful. Its a tactical cost  for a strategic gain, said Jeffrey White, a  defense analyst at the Washington Institute. ``They dont have a lot of  options, but they have some, he said of Iraqi  fighters. ``They can fight from within their population.Inevitably,  the Iraqi decision to use civilians and to draw the fight  to populous areas - farms, villages and crossroads hamlets,  as well as major cities such as Basra and Baghdad - exposes  coalition troops to greater risks, as British Marines have  experienced in Basra. ``As long as were being  careful, and were being extremely careful,  White said, the risks of U.S. casualties are avoidable.And  so is some level of civilian casualties. ``If political time were not a  factor, if we are prepared to be patient, then I believe  the Iraqi forces can be taken down without undue cost either  to us or to the Iraqis, said Sinnreich, the  former Army school director.  ``But if people get hepped on  doing things in a hurry, thats not going to happen.``The  enemy has a vote. But we also have a vote.Gen.  Tommy Franks, the commander of U.S. forces in the war, insists  that the problem is easily managed. ``What it means is that all of  our troops will exercise caution, will increase the standoff  to civilian vehicles and the things that I think would be  common sense to anyone in order to better protect against  this particular kind of threat, Franks said  after Saturdays suicide bombing. ``The question, well, what effect  will this have on noncombatants? It doesnt change  the rules that we use at all, he said.But the  incident near Najaf on Monday showed the limits of that  policy. Although details remain incomplete,  it appears that the Army unit was operating in such close  confines to civilians that increasing ``the standoff to  civilian vehicles, in Franks phrase, may  not have been an option.

 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 Pope book of poetry to be out soon
																								Warsaw, Dec. 31 (Reuters): An unprecedented book of poetry written by Pope John Paul, including the Pontiffs thoughts about choosing his successor, will soon be published in his native Poland, the Catholic Information Agency said yesterday.																								The agency said the books working title was The Rome Triptych, the Meditations of John Paul II and that it had been written over the last several months. The Pope, the author of several best-selling books about faith, has not published any poems since the start of his pontificate in 1978.																								John Pauls work is a poetic meditation about themes of finality, a last will of sorts. The Pope will discuss the choice of his successor, for example, the church-based agency wrote.																								A close friend of the Pope, Polish bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, said he believed the book would be about the religious reflections of John Paul. The Holy Fathers thinking is intense and deep and this may not be a book for everyone.																								The agency said the book of poems may be published as soon as in January in Krakow, the southern Polish city where the Pope was archbishop before he was elected Pontiff.

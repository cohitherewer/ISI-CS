																								A new toll road in Britain has been built on two-and-a-half million copies of old Mills and Boon novels to prevent it from cracking.																								Unsold copies of the books were shredded into a paste and added to a mixture of asphalt and tarmac. It helps to bind the asphalt and tarmac, preventing the surface from splitting apart after heavy use. 																								Tarmac Central, the construction firm responsible for laying the road known as M6, used 92,000 books per mile for a 16-mile stretch of the road and said it should ensure the motorway remained free of roadworks. Richard Beal, project manager, said Mills and Boon novels were used because millions are returned to the factory each year unsold.																								The reject copies are then passed on to other companies where they are recycled and used for other purposes. He said: There is the old saying that the road to true love doesnt run smoothly but thanks to thousands of Mills and Boon romance novels we hope that the M6 toll will.																								Ironically the books are renowned for their slushiness but when pulped they help to make the road solid and hold the tarmac and asphalt in place. There is no specific reason why Mills and Boon were used. They just produce more volume of books than most other publishers.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

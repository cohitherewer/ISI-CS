The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, January 18, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Daring drunk																																	 Bangkok, Jan . 17 (AP): Most people would hate to be called a drunk, but Thailands Arunothai Sriaran is wearing the epithet like a crown.																																	Arunothai was named Miss Drunk at a contest yesterday to promote Thai wines after downing five shots and walking a zigzag path between two rows of wine bottles without knocking them down.																																	I was not drunk. Only a little bit dizzy. I was fine and refreshed after a cup of coffee and washing my face, Arunothai said today. The local wine is rather sweet ... Like orange juice, said Arunothai, a 36-year-old wine seller who defeated 14 other female rivals by completing the obstacle course in seven seconds after putting down five pegs of wine. A peg is about a litre. For her troubles, Arunothai won the $120 prize.																													 																Taxi TV																																	 New York (Reuters): Stuck in traffic watching the meter tick in a New York taxi? Why not just sit back, relax and watch a little TV? Riders in some New York yellow taxis can now tune in to the small screen under a pilot programme by the citys Taxi and Limousine Commission. In New York City, at the TLC, were always looking at new technology to try and improve customers lives in taxis, Matthew Daus, chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission said. The commission is testing seven different approaches, including interactive systems that let riders surf for information on entertainment such as theatres, restaurants and movies, as well as get updates on news and sports. 																													 																Dracula dig																																	 Bucharest (Reuters): Western consultants have driven a stake through the heart of Romanias plan to build a grisly Dracula theme park near Vlad the Impalers birthplace, a government official said on Thursday. A feasibility study by consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers discourages the government from building it in the medieaval city of Sighisoara, birthplace of 15th century Count Vlad Tepes, thought to have inspired author Bram Stokers Gothic novel Dracula. It means victory for conservationist groups and Unesco, the UN cultural arm, which have fought the plan for two years. 																													 																School case																																	 Kiev (Reuters): A Ukrainian boy has taken his school to court for exploiting children after he was made to adhere to the Soviet tradition of sweeping schoolyards and cleaning school buildings to instil the work ethic. Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported on Thursday that the boys father said his son would come home dirty and complain about feeling humiliated by teachers who made him clean the schoolyard instead of going to physical education or art classes.

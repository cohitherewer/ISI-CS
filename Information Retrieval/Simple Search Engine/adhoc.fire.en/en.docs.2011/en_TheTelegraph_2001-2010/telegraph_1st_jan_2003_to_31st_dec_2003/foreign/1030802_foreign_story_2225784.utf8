 Saturday, August 02, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Diaper diktat																																	 Buenos Aires (Reuters): Supermarket cashiers in Argentina are being forced to wear diapers to keep them from taking toilet breaks at work, a union says. Female cashiers in western Mendoza province must wear adult diapers in case cold, nerves, pressure or stress provoke incontinence, union official Jorge Cordova told local news agency Diarios y Noticias on Thursday. Cordova refused to name the supermarket, but he did say the chain is backed by foreign capital, said Sandra Varela, Mendozas labour sub-secretary. The truth is, its difficult to imagine a line of 20 adult cashiers wearing diapers for eight hours, said Varela, who is investigating the matter. In 17 years as a labour lawyer, Ive never heard anything like this before, she added.																													 																Marten raid Frankfurt (Reuters): German car engineers,  at the forefront of technological innovation, are being  outsmarted by small furry animals that damage thousands  of cars every year by chewing through wires. Martens, forest-dwelling  weasel-like creatures with sharp teeth and bushy tails,  scamper into parked vehicles at night. They nibble through  ignition cables and cooling hoses, causing thousands of  breakdowns a year from short-circuits and overheated engines.  Carmakers cant do anything, there are no cables in the  world that are marten-proof, no chemicals to stop them and  anyway, animal protection groups would kick up a fuss,  said a spokesperson for DaimlerChrysler.																													 																Dog defence																																	 London (AP): A judge was forced to forced to bow out of a dangerous dog case after learning his own pet mongrel was appearing for the defence.

 JOHN HISCOCK																								Beverly Hills, Dec. 13: Tom Cruise comes into the Beverly Regent Hotel in Beverly Hills like a one-man Christmas parade. He exudes bonhomie and cheer, stopping to shake hands, slap backs and chat with fans and well-wishers. He has a smile and a cheery word for everyone. 																								People who work with him say he is always the same: enthusiastic about everything he does and full of encouragement for those around him.																								At the moment he is particularly enthused by his latest film, The Last Samurai, imbued as it is with themes of honour and integrity. He co-produced the film, which opens in January, and stars as the disillusioned and haunted US army officer Captain Nathan Algren who, after Americas Civil War, is hired by the emperor of Japan to train the countrys first modern, conscript army. 																								But as the emperors advisers try to eradicate the Samurai warriors, Algren finds himself impressed and influenced by the Samurai and their warrior code.																								It is something that impressed Cruise, too. The elegance and beauty of the Samurai, their spirit of bushido, of strength, compassion and fierce loyalty, their commitment to honouring their word and a willingness to give their life for what they know is right was something I couldnt resist, he said. I just knew I had to make this picture. I have a very strong connection to its theme, as well as to the characters in the story.																								The film took two years to make, during which time Cruise immersed himself in learning horse-riding, hand-to-hand combat and Samurai sword-fighting, as well as studying the American Indian wars, the Civil War and Japanese history.																								His director, Ed Zwick, says of him: Tom knows only one way to commit himself and that is completely. There is something about Tom that already was Samurai, even before the movie began.																								Dressed in blue jeans and a blue patterned shirt, with his hair cropped short, the actor looks more like a teenager than a hardened warrior. Friendly and affable as always, he claims that, despite his earnest involvement in his projects, Im having fun.																								He goes on: Ive always chosen what Im interested in. I take great pride in what I do and with every film I am looking for a challenge. With every picture that Ive made Ive learnt a lot about filmmaking, about myself and about other people. When youre producing films as well as acting in them, it challenges you on so many different levels, and I like that.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

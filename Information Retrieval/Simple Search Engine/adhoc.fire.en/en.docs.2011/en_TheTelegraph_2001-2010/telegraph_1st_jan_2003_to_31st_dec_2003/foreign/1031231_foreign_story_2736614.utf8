 Cairo, Dec. 30 (Reuters):  The French government and the Muslim worlds most prestigious  centre of Islamic learning found common ground today on  a contentious French law which would stop Muslim girls wearing  headscarves in French state schools.																								The Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar, Mohammed Sayed Tantawi, told reporters that although wearing the headscarf or hijab was a religious duty, governments of non-Muslim countries had the right to pass any laws they like, even on dress codes.																								He was speaking before talks in Cairo with French interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy, who assured him that France guarantees its Muslim citizens complete freedom to practise their religion.																								French President Jacques Chirac has called for a law banning Islamic headscarves and all religious symbols in state schools, strengthening Frances commitment to secularism.																								Many Muslims object to the ban, saying that wearing the headscarf is a religious duty for Muslim women and that the garment should not count as a symbol meant for display.																								But Tantawi, an Egyptian state-appointed official known for his liberal views, said that different rules applied to Muslims living in Muslim countries and those living outside.																								If the Muslim woman is in a non-Muslim country, like France, for example, and the officials there want to pass laws which are contrary (to Islam) on the question of the headscarf as it relates to the Muslim woman, then that is their right which I cannot interfere with as a Muslim, he said.																								In that case, if a Muslim woman observes the laws of a non-Muslim state, then from the point of view of Islamic law, she has the status of acting under coercion, he added.																								He cited the example of Islamic dietary laws, which allow infractions when Muslims are unable to meet the requirements through no fault of their own. Just as I do not allow non-Muslims to interfere in my affairs as a Muslim, at the same time I do not permit myself to interfere in the affairs of non-Muslims, the sheikh added.																								The Muslim Brotherhood, one of the Muslim worlds largest and most influential Islamist groups, disagrees and strongly opposes the French governments plans.																								The secular philosophy on which the French President based his decision to support this proposal, considering the hijab a religious symbol, is not correct. The Islamic hijab is a religious duty, the group said in a statement last week.																								Sarkozy said French Muslims had the same rights as Catholics, Protestants, Jews and others and assured his mainly Egyptian audience that the law did not target Muslims.

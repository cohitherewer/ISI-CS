 Thursday, May 22, 2003 				 Virus cases mount in Taiwan
																								Taipei, May 21 (Reuters): Taiwan, which has the worlds fastest-growing outbreak of SARS, reported dozens more probable cases today as the epidemic appeared to be on the wane in China and Hong Kong.																								A day after Taiwan reported a record daily rise in new infections and deaths, health officials reported 35 more cases, bringing the total on the island to 418.																								The virus has spread rapidly through the islands health system, with a ninth hospital reporting suspected SARS cases today. 																								As the island of 23 million people struggled to contain the virus, China reported 12 new infections and Hong Kong just one, extending a steady decline in cases of the disease, which surfaced in southern China in November and has killed at least 665 people worldwide.																								The WHO said today it had removed the Philippines from a list of SARS-affected countries and Australia lifted a warning against travel to Singapore. WHO said it was removing the Philippines from its list because it had no new cases for 20 days, or two virus incubation periods.

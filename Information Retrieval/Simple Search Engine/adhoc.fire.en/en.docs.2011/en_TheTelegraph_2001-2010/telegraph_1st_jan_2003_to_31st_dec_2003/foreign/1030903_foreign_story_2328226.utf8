 Wednesday, September 03, 2003 				 Russia elections on December 7
																								Moscow, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin today confirmed December 7 as the date for parliamentary elections that should provide a pointer to his grip on power as he prepares to make a bid for a second Kremlin term.																								Lets get down to it, Putin said in televised comments after announcing he had signed a decree fixing the date for elections to the State Duma (lower house).																								Supporters of the 50-year-old Putin, who is genuinely popular for bringing stability to Russia after the zig-zags and political tension of the 1990s, dominate the 450-member Duma. 																								Most analysts say he will consolidate his hold in parliament  while publicly distancing himself from any one bloc  ensuring a smooth ride back into the Kremlin in March 2004.																								The former KGB spy, in power since 2000, has set targets of doubling economic growth, ending mass poverty and imposing a Kremlin blueprint for peace on rebel Chechnya.

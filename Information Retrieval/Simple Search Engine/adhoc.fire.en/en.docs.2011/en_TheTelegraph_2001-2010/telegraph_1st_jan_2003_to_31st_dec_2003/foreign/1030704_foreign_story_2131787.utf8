 Friday, July 04, 2003 				 Blair office launches fresh assault on BBC
																								London, July 3 (Reuters): The British government today launched a fresh assault on the countrys public broadcaster, the BBC, over a claim government officials doctored a dossier on Iraqs weapons to strengthen their case for war.																								Breaking a temporary truce in the weapons row, Prime Minister Tony Blairs office said a letter from a top Blair aide that was leaked to a newspaper proved that the BBCs charges were false. The Guardian newspaper today published a letter sent by Alastair Campbell, Blairs communications supremo, to a parliamentary committee that is probing an allegation aired on the BBC that Campbell sexed up Iraqi intelligence.																								In the letter  which Blairs office said bore the approval of the intelligence services  Campbell said he suggested 11 changes to a September dossier on Iraqs weapons of mass destruction, six of which were adopted. Blairs spokesman said the letter proved Campbell had not sought to exaggerate intelligence of Iraqs banned weapons  the primary Anglo-American motive for attacking Iraq.																								The letter completely contradicts the BBCs claim, the spokesman said.																								The BBC, citing an anonymous intelligence source, accused Campbell of inserting into the dossier a claim that Iraq could deploy weapons in 45 minutes. Blairs office says the charge is an attack on the governments integrity and wants an apology.																								The BBC declined to comment on the letter today, saying it would await the committees verdict. The row comes at a bad time for Blair. The failure to find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has undermined his governments credibility and dented his popularity.																								A recent poll showed that 34 per cent of the public is less likely to trust Blair on other issues due to the weapons row. The Foreign Affairs Committee is due to publish its report on the weapons row on Monday but opposition legislators are claiming the report will be politically biased.

				 	 Madonna																								Los Angeles, Nov. 13 (Reuters): A few years ago, if someone said Madonna was selling toys, one would assume sex toys.

Madonna and merchandising company Signatures Network Inc yesterday announced a deal to develop dolls, apparel, accessories, cosmetics, stationery, room decor and back-to-school products aimed at the pre-tween readers, aged 7 to 12, who made Madonnas book a hit.																								Im excited about the opportunity to develop a range of beautiful products that will complement the book and continue to spread its positive messages to children, Madonna said.																								Set in London,The English Roses is a moralistic tale about the importance of compassion and friendship through the story of four little girls. The book has been printed in 30 languages, released in over 100 countries and became the largest childrens book release in publishing history with a first printing of 1 million copies. The Roses products begin rolling out in early 2004.

 Tuesday, August 19, 2003 				 Tape says Osama, Omar alive
																								Dubai, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Al Arabiya television today aired an audio tape it said was from an al Qaida spokesperson saying Osama bin Laden and Taliban chief Mullah Omar were alive and urging Muslims to fight a holy war against US troops in Iraq.																								The Arabic television channel attributed the recording to Afghanistan-based al Qaida official Abdel Rahman al-Najdi, who it said was on a US list of wanted al Qaida members. An FBI official said Abdel Rahman al-Najdi was not on their list of most wanted.																								I would like to bring the good tidings to Muslims everywhere that Sheikh Osama bin Laden is well, very well and that Mullah Omar is also alive, the voice on the recording said, referring respectively to the al Qaida chief and Taliban leader who was ousted in a 2001 US-led war in Afghanistan.

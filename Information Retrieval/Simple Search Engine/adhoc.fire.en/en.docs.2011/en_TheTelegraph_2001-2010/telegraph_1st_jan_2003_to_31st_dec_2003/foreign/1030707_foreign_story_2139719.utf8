 Monday, July 07, 2003 				 Blair tells BBC to back down on dossier
 COLIN BROWN AND CHRIS HASTINGS				 	 Tony Blair 																								London, July 6: Tony Blair has demanded that the BBC retract its claim that Downing Street sexed up material provided by the intelligence services for a dossier presented to parliament on Iraqs weapons of mass destruction in an effort to persuade public opinion to support the war.																								He said the charge was as serious an attack on my integrity as there could possibly be. The Prime Minister dramatically entered the fray last night just as the battle between the corporation and the government was coming to a head, with the publication tomorrow of a Commons report into claims that Downing Street exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein.																								In a sign that Number 10 is confident of being cleared, Blair appeared to stake his reputation on the issue in a newspaper interview. The idea that I or anyone else in my position frankly would start altering intelligence evidence or saying to the intelligence services, I am going to insert this, is absurd, he told The Observer. There couldnt be a more serious charge: that I ordered our troops into conflict on the basis of intelligence evidence that I falsified. You could not make a more serious charge against a Prime Minister. The charge happens to be wrong. I think they (the BBC) should accept it.																								Greg Dyke, the director-general of the BBC, was prepared to take an equally defiant tone, telling the corporations governors that they cannot afford to back down in what has become a do or die battle.																								Dyke told an emergency meeting of the governors, who are meant to be entirely independent, that they must stand behind the original news story, broadcast in May, even if the MPs now investigating the allegations judge it was incorrect.																								Dyke is expected to give the 11 governors new information that he insists substantiates the original claims made by Andrew Gilligan, the defence correspondent on Radio 4s Today programme. 																								Dyke also provided them with copies of Gilligans broadcast and the open letter sent to Alastair Campbell, Tony Blairs communications director, in an effort to prove Campbells complaints bear no relation to the original news item.																								The director-general is expected to urge the governors to issue a statement unambiguously endorsing the BBCs story tomorrow  the day that the Commons foreign affairs select committee publishes its findings into the allegations.																								The report by the Labour-dominated committee is widely																								expected to clear Mr Campbell of the central																								allegation that he quot;doctored quot; the dossier to highlight																								a warning that Saddam Hussein could deploy chemical or																								biological weapons within 45 minutes.																								The BBC, however, is hoping that some members of the																								committee may be publicly critical of Mr Campbell, or																								even refuse to sign up to the final conclusions. One																								BBC executive claimed yesterday that committee members																								were still split on the reports findings. The																								conclusion that there was no evidence to suggest Mr																								Campbell had altered the dossier contrary to the																								wishes of the intelligence services was passed only																								with the casting vote of the chairman.																								A senior BBC official said: quot;Greg will tell the																								governors in no uncertain terms that if there is any																								attempt to retreat from the story or to apologise for																								what has been said it will be the end of BBC News.																								Its do or die.																								 quot;Greg will tell them its not just about standing by																								Andrew Gilligan. Its about standing by the original																								source who is both well placed and well informed. He																								will also point out that Mr Campbells complaints are																								about issues which were not even included in the																								original broadcast. quot;																								The Telegraph understands that Mr Dykes warning will																								be delivered with the blessing of Mr Davies, who is a																								close friend of Gordon Brown, the Chancellor. It is																								believed that the chairman has already briefed his																								fellow governors and warned them of the need to stand																								firm.																								The BBC governors include Dame Pauline Neville-Jones,																								a former diplomat and deputy secretary of the Cabinet																								Office who has already expressed publicly her concern																								at the use of intelligence information by the																								Government during the war. Other governors include																								Baroness Hogg, the head of John Majors policy unit																								between 1990 and 1995, and Sir Robert Smith, the																								vice-chairman of Deutsche Asset Management.																								One governor told The Telegraph last night that it was																								likely that they would back Gilligan: quot;I think that																								Alastair Campbell has been involved in a highly																								successful diversionary tactic. It seems pretty clear																								to me that the September document [the first Iraq																								dossier] was a pretty thin affair and was scraped																								together from a number of sources. quot;																								Friends of Richard Sambrook, the head of BBC News, say																								that he will apologise for the handling of the story																								only if the Commons report provides an outright																								condemnation of the story.

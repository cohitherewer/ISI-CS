 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Charged, its showdown time for Jackson team
 WILLIAM BOOTH				 	 Michael Jacksons lawyer Mark Geragos speaks at a press conference in Los Angeles. (AFP)																								Santa Maria (California), Dec. 19: Michael Jackson, who often describes himself as the Peter Pan of pop music, was formally charged yesterday with molesting a child on several occasions earlier this year after giving him alcohol at his Neverland Ranch.																								An hour later, Jacksons attorney blasted the family of his clients accuser as shakedown artists and called Santa Barbara county law enforcement officials vengeful crusaders with an axe to grind and no case.																								The charges and countercharges, in duelling news conferences beamed around the globe, highlight a sensational showdown scheduled to play out here next year between a combative district attorney and the fallen King of Pops equally tenacious celebrity defence lawyer.																								A month after being handcuffed and arrested, Jackson now faces seven felony counts of committing lewd and lascivious acts on a child younger than 14 and two counts of administering intoxicating agents to enable Jackson to commit sex acts with the boy. The crimes allegedly took place in February and March.																								Yesterdays three pages of court filings do not detail the circumstances of the alleged molestation, nor do they specify the sexual acts allegedly committed, but sources involved in the case say the accusations come from a boy, now 14, who was suffering from leukaemia and had visited Jackson often at Neverland Ranch. Over the years, Jackson has repeatedly hosted young visitors at Neverland, a vast compound that includes a zoo and amusement park rides. 																								Santa Barbara county district attorney Thomas W. Sneddon Jr said he had agreed to allow Jackson to reclaim his surrendered passport and travel to the UK for appearances there over the Christmas and New Years holidays.																								Asked if Jackson might be a risk to flee from justice, Sneddon said no, but added: If he wanted to leave at some point, he could leave. Though his career has slipped from its peak in the 1980s, Jackson still has access to millions of dollars and travels by private jet accompanied by bodyguards. Jackson is free on $3 million bond. His arraignment here is scheduled for January 16.																								Mark Geragos, the singers attorney, denied the charges as completely unfounded and said Jackson would fight them with every fibre of his soul.																								Geragos said Jackson is irate over the charge that he committed lewd acts, but said the 45-year-old entertainer is ready for the legal fight of his life. If found guilty of all charges, Jackson could be ineligible for probation and sentenced to a maximum of eight years in prison for each count of molestation and three years for each count involving the intoxicating drinks.																								We will take no quarter in this defence, Geragos promised. We wont stand for the besmirching of this man.																								In his most sensational remarks at a brief news conference in Los Angeles, Geragos said the charges against Jackson are driven by two things  money and revenge. He called the case an intersection between a shakedown and somebody with an axe to grind.																								Geragos suggested that Sneddon and his team were engaged in a witch hunt against Jackson, who was pursued 10 years ago by Santa Barbara and Los Angeles investigators for the alleged molestation of another boy, then 13 years old. After 13 months and 400 interviews in the case, no charges were brought. The boy and his family settled a civil lawsuit against Jackson for a sum reported to be between $15 million and $24 million. Jackson has maintained his innocence in connection with those allegations.																								The charges were filed in Santa Maria because its court house is closer to Jacksons Neverland Ranch than is the county seat of Santa Barbara, about 70 miles southeast.																								Speaking to reporters outside the offices of the clerk of Superior Court, Sneddon dismissed as incomplete a parallel investigation by the Los Angeles county department of children and family services into the same allegations. The Los Angeles authorities found no basis to proceed. That inquiry was conducted in February, around the same time that Santa Barbara authorities say Jackson molested the boy. 																								In a memo at his news conference, Sneddon said the accuser will take the witness stand during the trial and that the boys family is committed to this process and have said repeatedly that they are not interested in money.

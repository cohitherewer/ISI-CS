Every living thing on earth  humans, animals and plants  is made up of chains of four chemical codes, said Sirisak Thepakham, a researcher at the National Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. 																								I translated the code to musical tones. 																								Sirisak paired the letters A, T, G and C representing the four types of DNA chemicals with the la, si, do and so of the tonal scale. Combinations of the letters were used to construct the remaining notes.

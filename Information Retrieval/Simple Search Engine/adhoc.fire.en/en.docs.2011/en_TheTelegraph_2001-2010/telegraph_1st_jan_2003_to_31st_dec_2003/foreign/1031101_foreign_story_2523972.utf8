 Saturday, November 01, 2003 				 Mojo mystery for Rumsfeld
																								Washington, Oct. 31 (Reuters): US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld said yesterday he does not know whether or not he has lost his mojo, as a leading news magazine suggested, because he doesnt really know what mojo is.																								Is Rumsfeld Losing His Mojo? was the headline in Time magazine above a story about Rumsfelds recent difficulties concerning Iraq policy and differences with US lawmakers. 																								Have you lost your mojo? a reporter asked Rumsfeld during a Pentagon briefing. Rumsfeld said he did not consult a dictionary  as he has for words like slog about which he has sparred with reporters  but he spoke with an aide who had.																								And they asked me that, and I said: I dont know what it means. And they said: In 1926 or something, it had to do with jazz music. Rumsfeld added: And I guess the answer is that beautys in the eye of the beholder. I dont know enough about mojo to know. 																								The Websters New World Dictionary defines mojo as a charm or amulet thought to have magic powers, or power, luck, etc., as of magical or supernatural origin. 																								The word is thought to be of Creole origin.																								Mojo has most recently come into popular culture in connection with the Austin Powers movies, starring Mike Myers, in which mojo was portrayed as the secret behind the title characters libido. 																								At one point, Myers complains: Crikey, Ive lost my mojo!																								Legendary blues singer Muddy Waters also famously sang in the 1960s: I got my mojo working, but it just wont work on you.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, September 26, 2003 				 Find Mr Right even after 35
				 	 Rachel Greenwald 																								Los Angeles, Sept. 25 (Reuters): Over 35? Still looking for Mr Right? Feeling left on the shelf?																								Perhaps it is time to repackage your assets, take a hard look at your personal brand and start telemarketing yourself. Sounds a bit like launching a new laundry soap, or marketing yoghurt as an aphrodisiac? Thats precisely what former marketing consultant turned find-a-husband coach Rachel Greenwald is suggesting in her book Find a Husband After 35 Using What I learned at Harvard Business School.																								Its not very traditional to hear the words dating and Harvard Business School in the same sentence. But I believe this is marriage 911  an emergency  and I think it requires proven business techniques to get results, Greenwald said.																								This is no book for the faint-hearted, for die-hard romantics or wilting wallflowers. Finding a husband aint easy in the US where there are 28 million single women over 35, compared to a mere 18 million men.																								Greenwald, who used to market Evian water and Carolee jewellery, has put together a 15-step programme that shows women how to package their assets, develop a personal brand, use telemarketing to get the word out, establish a husband-search budget and hold performance reviews to assess results. She even tells women how to conduct a toe-curling exit interview with a man who has just dumped them to find out what went wrong.																								These are tactics Greenwald successfully used herself 11 years ago when she determined to marry before 35, and to help her single friends, all smart and fabulous women who for some reason had reached their late 30s or early 40s but hadnt found the man they wanted to wed.																								I realised I was giving them the same stuff I was saying in my day job as a marketing consultant  packaging, branding, niche marketing  and it struck me there was a connection between brand marketing and dating tactics that really made sense, she said.																								Greenwald married her husband, Brad, 11 years ago at the age of 28 after meeting him at her own event marketing party (step 12 in her system). The couple has three children and Greenwald describes her husband as the most incredible man on this earth.																								Overwhelming feedback from men has proved that men looking for wives could also brush up their marketing skills. It surprises me that women say they cant find any men, and men say they cant find any women. So really it is a marketing challenge of how to connect these two entities. This book is universal for men for women, for gays and lesbians, and for people of any age, she said.																								But not apparently for the French. Although the book is to be published in at least a dozen other countries, there will be no French edition. The French publishing representative said no one in France would buy this book, as everyone there wants to get rid of their husband, not find one, the author said.

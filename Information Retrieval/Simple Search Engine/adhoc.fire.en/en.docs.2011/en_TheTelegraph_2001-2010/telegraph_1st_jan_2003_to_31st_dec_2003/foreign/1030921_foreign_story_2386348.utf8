 Glasgow, Sept. 20 (AP):  The wing of a plane carrying the country band the Dixie  Chicks clipped the side of a building after the jet landed  at Glasgow airport today, their spokeswoman said.																								 The Texas trio had just arrived from Dublin on a private, twin-engine plane for an evening concert at the Scottish exhibition and conference centre in Glasgow. The girls are all absolutely fine, their publicist, Barbara Charone, said from London. Im sure it wasnt pleasant. The incident happened when part of the wing just hit a corner of the building. She said the band would go ahead with the concert no one was injured. It sounds worse than it really was, she added.																								Malcolm Robertson, a spokesman for Scottish airports, which runs Glasgow airport, said the plane, carrying 16 passengers, was taxiing at walking speed towards its parking slot when a tip of one wing clipped a building at 1425 GMT.																								Firefighters went to the scene as a matter of routine but it was not considered a major incident, he said. 																								The building and the wing both suffered superficial damage, he added.																								All the passengers got off the plane and walked into the airport, Robertson said.

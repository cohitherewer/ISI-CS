 Sunday, August 10, 2003 				 PC unfriendly Blair opens e-mail file
				 	 Tony Blair																								London, Aug. 9: Tony Blair will finally come to terms with the Internet age this month when he invites the public to contact him by e-mail.																								For the first time he will have a public e-mail address, allowing voters to bombard him with comments from their homes and offices. The Prime Minister, who is notoriously bad at using computers, will be expected to deal with only a few of the e-mails himself.																								But Downing Street says that they will all be read and that many will receive considered replies. Downing Street receives about half-a-million letters a year  1,370 a day on average  and the convenience of e-mail means that many more people are likely to write.																								Blair, who has said that his children are much better with new technology than he is, was to have launched his e-mail address earlier. Most British leaders can be contacted by e-mail and, to try to embarrass Blair, the Tories said that without a dotcom address he was in the same position as his counterpart in Cuba. The e-mail address, which will be accessible through the No 10 website (www.pm.gov.uk), will be operational by the end of this month.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

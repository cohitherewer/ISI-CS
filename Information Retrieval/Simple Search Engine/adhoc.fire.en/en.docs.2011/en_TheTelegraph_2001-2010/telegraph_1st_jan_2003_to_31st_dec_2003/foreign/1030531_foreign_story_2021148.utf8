 Saturday, May 31, 2003 				 Microsoft in AOL deal
																								Seattle, May 30 (Reuters): Number one software maker Microsoft Corp. yesterday said it would pay $750 million to AOL Time Warner Inc. to settle a 16-month-long anti-trust suit as the rivals agreed to work together on Internet-based media and technology.																								The deal marked the end of one of Microsofts most contentious legal disputes following its final anti-trust settlement with the federal government late last year. By putting the legal dispute behind them, AOL and Microsoft said they would be able to focus on their shared interest in creating a bigger and more efficient market for digital media on the Internet. Under the terms of the settlement, AOL, the worlds number one Internet services provider, won the option to use Microsofts flagship digital media software as well as its Internet Explorer technology for web browsing on a royalty-free basis for 7 years.

 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 PLA made part of party
 Beijing, Dec. 17 (PTI):  Chinas ruling Communist party has formally made the 2.5-million-strong  Peoples Liberation Army (PLA), a strong constituent of  political power, under the absolute leadership of the party,  the state media reported today.																								The decision was effected by the central committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Central Military Commission (CMC), Xinhua news agency said.																								The CPC and CMC have approved the amended provisions on the political work of the PLA, the worlds largest standing army.																								CMC chairman Jiang Zemin, who relinquished his post of President of the country in march this year and general secretary of the CPC in november last year, had instructed that the PLA must be put under the absolute leadership of the party, the report said.																								Another amendment made to the provisions on the political work of the PLA previously published in 1995, is the inclusion of the important thought of three represents.																								The theory of three represents, pioneered by Jiang, says the CPC, always represents the most advanced productivity and culture in China and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people. 																								Analysts say this fundamental change in the CPC would allow the ruling party to make itself relevant in China, which is changing rapidly after its opening up to the outside world.																								The new contents also comprise the experience obtained by the PLAs political commissars and new requirements for the army in the high-tech era, Xinhua quoted pla sources as saying.																								The PLA News, the mouthpiece of Chinas armed forces, published an editorial on Monday to call the revised provisions a fundamental statute on the political work of the army.																								It was of great importance for revolutionising, modernising and regulating the army, the paper said.

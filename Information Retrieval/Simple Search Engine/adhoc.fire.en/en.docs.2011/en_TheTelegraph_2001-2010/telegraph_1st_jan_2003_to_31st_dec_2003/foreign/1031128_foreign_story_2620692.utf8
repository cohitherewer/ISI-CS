 Friday, November 28, 2003 				 Stephen King down with pneumonia 
																								Bangor (Maine), Nov. 27 (AP): Best-selling author Stephen King was expected to remain in a Maine hospital for several days as he recovers from pneumonia, a spokesperson said.																								King is conscious and in good spirits in eastern Maine Medical Centre, and is expected to recover fully, his spokesperson, Warren Silver, said yesterday.																								Silver told the Bangor Daily News there appears to be a connection between the pneumonia and a 1999 accident in which King was struck by a van and nearly killed while walking near his summer home. He suffered a punctured lung and a broken leg, hip and ribs in the accident.																								The puncture resulted in a fair amount of scar tissue in Kings lungs, creating what doctors see as a vulnerability to ailments such as pneumonia, Silver said.

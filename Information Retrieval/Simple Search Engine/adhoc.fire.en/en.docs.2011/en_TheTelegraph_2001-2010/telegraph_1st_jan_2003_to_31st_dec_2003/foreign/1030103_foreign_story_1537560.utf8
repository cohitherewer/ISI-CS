 Friday, January 03, 2003 				 Pervez threatened me: Imran
				 	 Imran Khan																								Islamabad, Jan. 2 (PTI): Cricketer turned politician Imran Khan accused President Pervez Musharraf of threatening him with serious consequences before the October elections and said he committed a big mistake by supporting the military establishment and now repented it.																								Khan said he was threatened by Musharraf and the officials around him with serious consequences when he refused to toe their line before the general elections.																								Let me clearly state that I made a big mistake by supporting the military establishment in the hope of dawn of a new era in the country and I do repent over it because I was used by them, Khan said in an interview to The News daily published today.																								A strong critic of former Prime Ministers, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, Khan said he supported Musharraf with a hope that the general was serious about bringing political, social and economic reforms to the people. Khan said when he criticised Musharrafs referendum last year, he was threatened and told that his party Tehreek e-Insaf would not manage even a single seat.																								He said Mushrraf raised some hope in the peoples minds when he overthrew the corrupt Nawaz Sharif government but had now made ugly compromises that would ruin Pakistan in the coming days. 																								The former cricketer said in the name of pragmatism, Musharraf has released all the outlaws from jails and made some of them Cabinet ministers. 																								The only difference between the jailed criminals and sitting ministers facing charges was that the jailed ones had no vote bank, otherwise they could also secure their release, he said.																								Criticising the role played by the secret agencies in Pakistan, he said they were busy in serving their own selfish interests in the name of great supreme national interest.																								The wife of a Pakistani doctor detained for suspected al Qaida links today challenged the governments claims that her husband, brother-in-law, nephew and sons had practised anti-state activities.																								Ahmed Javed Khawajas wife Amatul Jalil filed a petition with the Lahore High Court rejecting the five mens two-week detention under the national security act as illegal.

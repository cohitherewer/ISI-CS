 Wednesday, February 05, 2003 				 Britain cleric removed from mosque post
 TOM BERGIN																								London, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Britains most high-profile radical Muslim cleric, who applauded the September 11 attacks and last weeks space shuttle crash, has been removed as head of the mosque where he preached.																								The UK Charity Commission said today Abu Hamza al-Masri had used his position within the charity to make inappropriate political statements.																								His north London mosque was raided by police last month in a probe into the discovery of ricin poison.																								Egyptian-born Masri, whose missing eye and hook in the place of his right hand have helped make him a hate figure in British tabloids, said he would ignore the ruling.																								The reason for banning me is for making political comments against America and Israel, he said.																								Masri was already at the centre of a row this week after tabloids reported he had gloated over Saturdays crash of the space shuttle Columbia and the death of its crew.																								It was a trinity of evil against Muslims, because it (the shuttle) contained Americans, an Israeli and a Hindu, he was widely reported as saying.																								As well as the five US crew members, Columbia was carrying Colonel Ilan Ramon, the first Israeli in space, and Kalpana Chawla.																								The commission said in a statement it had acted to protect the reputation of the mosque. Masri would still be free to pray at the building, currently closed following the police raids.																								Masri has recently been preaching and leading prayers on Fridays in the street outside the mosque in Londons Finsbury Park area.																								The cleric, who lost an eye and both forearms while fighting the Russians in Afghanistan, questioned the commissions authority to ban him.																								The Charity Commission has actually collaborated with the police to close the mosque, and actually to hijack the whole mosque, he told Reuters by telephone.																								The Commission accused Masri of a similar charge.																								Trustees of the charity (that owns the mosque) had been prevented from governing the charity properly by the activities of Abu Hamza and his supporters, it said.																								Masri, an admirer of Osama bin Laden, who the US blames for the September 11 attacks, has three months to lodge an appeal with the High Court in London.																								Some sections of the British media have recently made calls for Masri to be deported. He holds a UK passport, which he said has now been confiscated, through marriage to a British woman.																								Masri is suspected by the US of links with bin Ladens al Qaida network and is wanted in Yemen on terrorism charges. 																								His son has served prison time in Yemen on terrorism charges.																								The worlds first trial of a suspect in the September 11 attacks neared its close today with the defendant complaining of unfair treatment as German judges rejected his pleas to hear more evidence.																								Presiding judge Albrecht Mentz dismissed a series of defence motions this morning and formally ended the evidence phase of the trial. Prosecutors will start presenting their closing arguments tomorrow.																								Judges have now heard the entire case against Mounir El Motassadeq, a 28-year-old Moroccan charged with being an accessory to 3,045 murders in New York and Washington.

 Saturday, August 09, 2003 				 Bush backs Terminator for California
																								Crawford (Texas), Aug. 8 (Reuters): President George W. Bush said today he believed that Arnold Schwarzenegger would make a good governor of California.																								Bush, answering questions at his Texas ranch, repeated that the California recall election was something for the people of California to decide, but when asked what he thought about the actor as governor, Bush replied: I think hed be a good governor. 																								The White House has not definitively said whether Bush, a fellow Republican, would campaign for Schwarzenegger and has been careful to distance itself publicly from the recall election scheduled for October 7.																								I will never arm wrestle Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bush told reporters at his ranch.

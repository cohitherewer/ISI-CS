																								Washington, Nov. 10 (Reuters): The US Supreme Court said today it would decide appeals by Afghan war detainees challenging their incarceration at a US military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the first time the justices will rule on the Bush administrations anti-terrorism policy.																								The justices agreed to decide whether US courts have jurisdiction to consider the challenges by a group of detainees of their continued confinement without access to families or lawyers, and with no charges brought against them. The Supreme Court will hear an hour of arguments next year.																								The justices said in a written order they would decide whether US courts lack jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad in connection with hostilities and incarcerated at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba.

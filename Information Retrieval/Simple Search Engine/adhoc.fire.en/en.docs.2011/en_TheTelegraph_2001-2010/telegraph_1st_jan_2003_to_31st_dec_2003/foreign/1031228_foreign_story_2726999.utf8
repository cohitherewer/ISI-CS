The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Race to find survivors
																								Bam, Iran, Dec. 27 (Reuters): International rescue workers hacked desperately through flattened debris for survivors and cemeteries overflowed in Irans ancient Silk Road city of Bam today after an earthquake that killed at least 20,000 people.																								Swiss rescuers with sniffer dogs were the first foreign team to start hunting for trapped survivors, Iranian television said.																								The pre-dawn quake yesterday also injured about 30,000 people, state television said. The quake measured 6.3 on the Richter scale and struck when many people were still asleep.																								If the figures are finally confirmed, the Bam quake was the worlds worst in terms of death toll in more than 10 years. Some 19,700 people were killed in January 2001 when a Richter 7.7 trembler hit Gujarat.																								Reuters witnesses said the citys cemeteries were crammed to overflowing with fully-clothed corpses and a stench of death was beginning to pervade the streets.																								The International Red Crescent has advised people to wear gloves and facemasks because of fears of an epidemic.																								Fatemeh, 35, was burying her two children. I am burying myself in this grave, she said.																								Taher, 50, was inconsolable, sobbing wake up, wake up to the corpse of his teenage son Farzad.																								About 70 per cent of Bam, a popular tourist spot some 1,000 km southeast of the capital Tehran with an historic citadel and other centuries-old buildings, was levelled.																								Exhausted, dust-covered rescue worker Omid Alipour said his team had dug out only three injured survivors during the night.																								We dont have anything, just our bare hands, he said.																								Reporters said roads to the 120,000 or so people in the quake-stricken outlying villages had been broken by the force of the tremors but some aid workers were setting out on foot.																								Television showed the injured, bloodied and bandaged, being crammed into aircraft and flown to cities around the country. It said 3,000 had been flown to hospitals in other cities.																								The interior ministry confirmed today the death toll now stood at 20,000, state television said. Prisoners on the run																								Some 600 prisoners were on the run in Bam after their jail crumbled in the quake, local officials said.																								The prison partly collapsed. Some of the prisoners were killed, others escaped, said Assadollah Iranmanesh, spokesman for a regional emergency committee. Places particularly prone to looting are secure.

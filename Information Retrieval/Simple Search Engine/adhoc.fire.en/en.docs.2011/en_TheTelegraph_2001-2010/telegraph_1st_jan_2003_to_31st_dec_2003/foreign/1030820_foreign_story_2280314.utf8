The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, August 20, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Hero-free zones 																																	Canberra, Aug. 19 (Reuters): Superman, Batman, Spiderman and the Hulk might be able to save the world but they cant get through the doors of an increasing number of childcare centres in one Australian city.																																	Declaring themselves superhero-free zones, at least 12 day centres for pre-school age children in Melbourne are banning crime-fighting superhero costumes because they say the unwelcome alter-egos encourage children to be aggressive. Mayor Bill Baarini from Hobsons Bay Council, which runs the superhero-free Altona Meadows Child Care Centre, said it was often the less assertive child with lower self-esteem who ended up the victim of playground superheroes.																																	While the policy hasnt eliminated rough play altogether, it had certainly made a significant difference in reducing injuries and bullying at the centre, he said in a statement. But Vickii Jenvey, a Monash University expert on childrens play, said the rough and tumble play the childcare centres were trying to stamp out was different from aggressive behaviour. Cloaks and masks dont cause aggression, Jenvey said. Children can get aggressive with a piece of stick. Superheroes are actually archetypal characters, good fighting evil, and can be quite moral.																													 																Shower act Berlin (Reuters): German police briefly  detained a 36-year-old man after he tried to shower naked  in a car wash in the southern town of Fuerth. The man stripped  off and said he wanted to take a shower, but he couldnt  start the machine, the police said on Tuesday. It wasnt  a great idea. He could have been coated in car wax, scalded  by hot water or rubbed raw by brushes. The car wash owner  alerted police after spotting the man gearing up for his  shower among the brushes and hoses. Police said the man  had been looking for somewhere to wash since losing his  home at the start of the month.																													 																Scared thief																																	 London (Reuters): A British burglar who stumbled on a work of art that he mistook for a human head in a pickle jar was so spooked that he summoned the police to a house he had robbed. Conceptual artist Richard Morrison had made the head from bacon wrapped around a wire frame floating in a jar of formaldehyde. After the burglar phoned, police bashed down Morrisons door to raid his house, near Liverpool in northern England. Morrison returned home to find that his house had been broken into twice, once by the burglar and once by the police. It was of vital importance that we investigated, to ensure that there was nothing suspicious, the police said.

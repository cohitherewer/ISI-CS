 Thursday, June 05, 2003 				 Suu Kyi hurt, fear diplomats
																								Yangon, June 4 (Reuters): Diplomats and Myanmar dissidents fear that opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent a fifth day in custody today, could have been injured in a clash between her supporters and a pro-government group last week.																								The Nobel laureate and pro-democracy icon has been held at undisclosed locations since her detention after the violence on Friday, despite UN efforts to gain access to her before a trip by an envoy of secretary-general Kofi Annan, and mounting international calls for her release. 																								Suu may be in good health, or she may have been hurt, we just dont know, said one diplomat on condition of anonymity. 																								The government has denied reports Suu Kyi was hurt but said four people were killed and 50 hurt in the clash, and Suu Kyi had been taken into protective custody. 																								Despite the government denial, the diplomat said rumours were swirling in the capital Yangon. One is she is getting treatment at the Mingaladon Military Hospital on the outskirts of town. The other is that she is in a special military guest house.

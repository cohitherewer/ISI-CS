The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, December 17, 2003  Iraq Briefs				 				 				 																Sister smells drugs Dubai, Dec. 16 (Reuters): Saddam Husseins  sister said yesterday her brother would never have surrendered  meekly and that US forces must have used drugs or gas to  paralyse him. 																																	Saddam Hussein, hero of Arabs, would never surrender like this. He must have been subjected to drugs or nerve gas to paralyse him, for he is not one to surrender in this humiliating manner, Nawal Ibrahim al-Hasan told London-based newspaper al-Quds al-Arabi by telephone from an unidentified Arab capital. 																																	Al-Hasan said Arab leaders should ensure her brother had a fair trial in an international court and not in Iraq, a demand echoed by Saddams daughter Raghad today. We want an international, fair and legal trial, Raghad told Dubai-based Al Arabiya television from Jordan, adding his family would appoint a lawyer to defend him.																													 																Jordan papers Amman (AFP): Jordanian newspaper commentators  charged today that Saddam Hussein had been drugged during  his capture by US troops and denounced the humiliating images  distributed by the US army. It is clear that the man was  taken by surprise and he was drugged during his capture,  first with a certain gas and then he was administered a  type of drug that disoriented him, one commentator said  in the al-Dustour newspaper. Another Jordanian weekly  Al-Sabeel said: The US is known for producing mind-boggling  Hollywood movies that takes ones breath away. 																													 																Iran ire																																	 Tehran (Reuters): Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that President George W. Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon would suffer the same fate as the former Iraqi leader. Now that he has been captured, the Islamic world and all those who know what a savage animal he was feel delighted, Khamenei said in his first public comments since the capture of Saddam Hussein. But Khamenei also used Saddams downfall to take a swipe at Irans two other great political enemies  the US and Israel. I heard the US President saying the world is a better place without Saddam. I want the US President to know that a world without Bush and Sharon is a much better place, he said.																													 																Message aid Jerusalem (AFP): The Palestinian pro-government  daily, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, published today a paid  for message of solidarity with toppled Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein. The note, bearing Saddams picture on its left  hand side, read: Comrades and friends of the Baath party  in Hebron declare their solidarity with comrade leader Saddam  Hussein. Comrade hero, you shall remain a symbol of Arab  dignity in Palestinian eyes, concluded the message.

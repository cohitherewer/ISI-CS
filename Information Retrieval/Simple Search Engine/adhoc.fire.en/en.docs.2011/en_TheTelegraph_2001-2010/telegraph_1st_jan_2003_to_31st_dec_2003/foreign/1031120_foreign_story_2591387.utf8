 London, Nov. 19 (Reuters):  First it was The Madness of George Dubya, now A  Weapons Inspector Calls.																								US President George W. Bush, on a high-profile visit to Britain this week, is an inspiration to one satirical playwright.																								Justin Butcher, whose Madness of George Dubya made it big in the West End this year, has written a sequel that takes its title from the classic stage thriller An Inspector Calls by J.B. Priestley.																								The new play is set in the Oval Office on the eve of the presidential election. Bush has gathered his supporters to celebrate imminent re-election but is interrupted by a ghostly weapons inspector, fresh from wandering West Asia in search of weapons of mass destruction. The inspector has a damning report for the US Congress and interrogates his White House suspects to the accompaniment of satirical songs.

 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 Pak envoy faces recall threat
																								Islamabad, Jan. 10 (PTI): An embarassed Pakistan may recall its ambassador to the UN, Munir Akram, after allegations that he had assaulted his girlfriend in New York during an argument.																								The US government has already asked Pakistan to withdraw his diplomatic immunity so that New York authorities can prosecute him on misdemeanour charges.																								Even if it is a weak case, the Pakistan government will not let an individual, no matter how competent, hamper Pakistans presence at the UN, The Dawn, quoting a senior Pakistani government official, said today.																								This is likely to be an open-and-shut case, the official said adding a decision on the matter was expected soon. The foreign ministry wants to avoid this simple and unfortunate case from blowing up out of proportion in an already difficult, if not hostile, diplomatic milieu, the daily said. 																								The New York police department moved against the high-profile diplomat, who had just taken charge of the Pakistan seat in the UN Security Council, after a woman claiming to be Akrams wife complained to the police that she was being assaulted by the diplomat.

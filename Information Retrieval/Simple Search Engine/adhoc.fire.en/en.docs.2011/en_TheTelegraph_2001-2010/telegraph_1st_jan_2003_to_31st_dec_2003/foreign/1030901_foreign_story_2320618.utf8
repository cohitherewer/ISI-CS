				 	 Sylvester Stallone																								Venice, Aug. 31 (Reuters): Arnold Schwarzenegger may be dead set on running for California state governor, but fellow action hero Sylvester Stallone has a few words of wisdom for him.																								I think its very dangerous waters, the hero of the Rambo movies, Rocky and The Specialist, said in Venice during the 60th film festival here. In that particular field you cant yell action and cut and take two and take three. Its real.																								Schwarzenegger shocked California earlier this month when he announced on The Tonight Show that he would run for governor. Sending a message to current governor Gray Davis, who faces a likely recall, the star of the Terminator films said: Do your job for the people, and do it well  otherwise, you are hasta la vista, baby.																								Schwarzenegger hit the campaign trail outside south California for the first time last week.																								Stallone, who was in town to promote his latest movie Spy Kids 3, said he would rather battle it out on the silver screen. I personally think actors should remain actors, but I know hes always had blind ambition for that, so maybe itll work out great for him.																								Sly Stallone added he was getting a kick out of making kids movies, but for fans keen on his action flicks, Stallone borrowed a phrase from Arnie: Ill be back.

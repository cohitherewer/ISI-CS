 KATE CONNOLLY				 	 A young Santa yawns during a graduation ceremony at Hong Kongs first Santa Claus Institute. (Reuters) Berlin, Dec. 23: A small  German town is demanding that its most famous son be recognised  as the creator of Father Christmas, rather than the Coca-Cola  company.																								Landau, in western Germany, has launched a marketing campaign claiming that Thomas Nast, a political cartoonist born in the town in 1840, created the first sketch of the red-jacketed old man.																								Nast emigrated to the US at the age of six, going on to became one of the countrys most successful political cartoonists.																								According to the people of Landau, he sketched the first-known image of Father Christmas for Harpers Weekly magazine in 1862, taking his inspiration from a mythical German character called Pelznickel (Furry Nicholas) who visited naughty children in their sleep.																								Everything about the modern Santa Claus, from his reindeer-driven sleigh to his workshop of elves at the North Pole comes from Nasts drawings, which in turn were inspired by the local Pelznickel, said Michael Martin, Landaus archivist.																								He said that Coca-Cola, widely regarded as having invented Father Christmas in an advertisement in 1931, had refused to acknowledge Nasts earlier creations.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

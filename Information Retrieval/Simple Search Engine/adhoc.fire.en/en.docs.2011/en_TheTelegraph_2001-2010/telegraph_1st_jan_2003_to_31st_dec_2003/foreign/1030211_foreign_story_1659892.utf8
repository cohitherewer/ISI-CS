The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, February 11, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Better Bond																																	 Berlin, Feb. 10 (Reuters): British actor Roger Moore said today his real-life fight against child traffickers as a Unicef ambassador was far more rewarding than battling fictitious villains in his signature role as spy James Bond.																																	The British actor, who starred as agent 007 in seven of the Bond films, was awarded the German Federal Service Cross from President Johannes Rau for his work as special representative to Unicef.																																	This award is much more important than receiving an Academy Award, Moore, 75, said after the ceremony at Raus office in Berlin, where an international film festival is taking place this week. As James Bond, the villains were easily recognisable. Now the villains are not so visible and the fight is uphill, said Moore, who first played Bond in the 1973 film Live and Let Die. His final Bond outing was A View to a Kill in 1985.																													 																Thai love																																	 Bangkok (Reuters): Most brides-to-be are nervous before they walk down the aisle. But Gai was flapping as she stepped on to the stage for er wedding on Monday. She was a chicken. Her owner had matched her with Gook, a rooster decked out in a smart, red bow-tie for a mass pet wedding ceremony in Bangkok in the run-up to Valentines Day. No man should be alone, so I brought Gook along today so he could have a wife too, said the cocks owner, Jitleda Bunbok. Hundreds of spectators turned out to watch Gook and Gai tie the knot in front of television crews and photographers, in a group wedding that also featured miniature poodles, rabbits, and cats. We want to show that humans arent the only ones who can find love on Valentines Day, said one of the events organisers. 																													 																War game																																	 Washington (Reuters): Toppling Saddam Hussein is the easy part in the war simulation game Gulf War 2. Coping with what comes next is more difficult. Players assume the role of US President George W. Bush in the online game, receiving regular briefings from caricatures of defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, secretary of state Colin Powell and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. It starts with Baghdads quick fall but then proceeds to an Iraqi anthrax attack on Israel, a retaliatory nuclear strike and a revolt in Saudi Arabia. Once Saddam Husseins body is found, players are asked to select one of three look-alike successors, who soon requires military backing to fend off an anxious Iran. There are also uprisings in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Pakistan, which lead to warheads being smuggled to militant groups.

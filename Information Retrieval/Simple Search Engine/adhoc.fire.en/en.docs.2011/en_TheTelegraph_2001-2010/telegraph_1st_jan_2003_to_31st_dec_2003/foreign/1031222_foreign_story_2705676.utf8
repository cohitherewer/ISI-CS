 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 CIA doubts latest Laden tape 
																								Dubai, Dec. 21 (Reuters): An audiotape purportedly by Osama bin Laden broadcast yesterday accused Arab governments heeding US calls for democracy of being infidel agents of America, but the CIA cast doubt on the tape saying it appeared to be old.																								The voice on the tape, aired on Al Arabiya television station and said to belong to the al Qaida leader, also criticised moves toward parliamentary representation and democracy in the Gulf and West Asia. 																								In a sign the tape could be several months old, the speaker made no mention of specific events occurring after September when former Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas quit. 																								A CIA official said the tape appeared to be one that was previously broadcast. It appears that what Al Arabiya has aired was aired in October, the official said in Washington. Analysts say the tape could have been an edited version of an October 18 message aired by al Jazeera, put together with some old messages purportedly from bin Laden.

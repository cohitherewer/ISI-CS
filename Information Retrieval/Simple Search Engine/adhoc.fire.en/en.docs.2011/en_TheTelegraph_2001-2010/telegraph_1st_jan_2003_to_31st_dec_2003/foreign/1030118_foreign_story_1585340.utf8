(AFP)																								Kathmandu, Jan. 17 (Reuters): The daughter of Nepals king is to marry a commoner next week  but it is a marriage arranged by her parents and the wedding will be the second celebration in as many weeks for the family, which was almost annihilated in a 2001 massacre.																								Hindu priests chanted religious verses as 24-year-old Princess Prerna exchanged rings today with Raj Bahadur Singh, a 29-year-old computer science graduate from the University of California, in a ceremony at the Narayanhity Palace.																								A smiling King Gyanendra led Prerna, dressed in a red sari glittering with gold embroidery, to the hall for the Swayambar or engagement ceremony.																								A palace official said the couple also exchanged garlands in the first of a series of ceremonies before their wedding.																								This (the rite) signifies they have consented to become wife and husband, chief royal priest Ramesh Prasad Pandey said.																								A palace statement said Gyanendra conferred the title of Kumar on the intended groom, raising his position to that of a royal family member.																								The wedding will take place on Wednesday at the sprawling Narayanhity Palace, the site of a bloody shootout in June 2001 when inebriated crown prince Dipendra shot his father, King Birendra, and eight others.

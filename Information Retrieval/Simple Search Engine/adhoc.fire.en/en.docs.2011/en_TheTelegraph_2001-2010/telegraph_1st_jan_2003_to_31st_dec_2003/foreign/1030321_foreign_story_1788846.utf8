 Friday, March 21, 2003 				 Monica to host reality show
				 	 Lewinsky																								Los Angeles, March 20 (Reuters): Monica Lewinsky, whose affair with then-President Bill Clinton nearly cost him the Oval Office, will soon be hosting a reality show for Fox network, the Daily Variety reported today.																								The 29-year-old former White House intern has landed a job as host of the hidden-identity dating show, Mr Personality, slated to debut on Fox from April 21.																								Lewinskys deal comes not long after Clinton began his stint as a paid TV commentator on CBS, debating one-time campaign rival and former Republican leader Bob Dole in a revival of the Point/Counterpoint segment by news magazine 60 Minutes. 																								According to Variety, Mr. Personality will follow a group of men whose faces have been masked as they try to win the affections of an attractive young lady. Their looks will be concealed throughout the dating process, as the woman eliminates a contestant each week until she narrows her choice to one man.

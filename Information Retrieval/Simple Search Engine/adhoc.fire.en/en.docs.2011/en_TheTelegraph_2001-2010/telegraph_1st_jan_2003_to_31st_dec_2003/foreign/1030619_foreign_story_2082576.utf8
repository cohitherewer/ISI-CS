The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, June 19, 2003 				 Archer granted parole
 London, June 18 (Reuters):  Jailed British author and former Conservative Party deputy  chairman Jeffrey Archer has been granted parole and will  be released next month, the parole board said today.																								Archer, 63, author of international bestsellers such as Kane and Abel and Honour Among Thieves, was jailed for four years in July 2001 for perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. He will be released on or around July 19, which is exactly half way through his sentence, said a parole board spokeswoman. 																								Archer will have to observe conditions such as behaving himself and paying regular visits to his parole officer, she added. Archer, reported to be worth some 60 million ($100 million), was convicted of lying in a 1987 libel case against the Daily Star tabloid newspaper which had accused him of having sex with a prostitute.																								Archer won 500,000 in damages against the newspaper, money he repaid last year after his perjury conviction.																								No stranger to controversy, Archer broke prison rules during his incarceration by publishing a book A Prison Diary  Belmarsh Hell about his initial experiences in a top security jail before being moved to an open prison.

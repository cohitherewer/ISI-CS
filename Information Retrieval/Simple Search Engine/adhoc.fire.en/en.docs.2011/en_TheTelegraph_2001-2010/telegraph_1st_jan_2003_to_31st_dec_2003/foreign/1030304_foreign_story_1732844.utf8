				 	 Linda Evangelista at the Dolce and Gabbana fashion show in Milan. (AFP)																								London, March 3: Linda Evangelista, the original supermodel and star of the 1980s and early 1990s, got out of bed and made her catwalk comeback at Milan Fashion Week yesterday.																								Evangelista, who will celebrate her 38th birthday in May, is famous for one of the most quoted one-liners in fashion history  that she wouldnt get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day.																								Yesterday, as Mascagnis intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana signalled the start of the Dolce amp; Gabbana show, the Canadian-born model stepped on to the catwalk for the first time in nearly a decade, for an undisclosed fee.																								Back on the catwalk; Linda Evangelista Statuesque in six-inch spike heels that elevated her to over 6ft tall, she wore a fluorescent orange ski jacket over a black corset-dress.																								Walking gracefully, if gingerly, she completed her first lap without a hitch, while Victoria Beckham peered over her sunglasses. 																								In her heyday, Evangelistas changes of hair colour  she dyed it 17 times in four years  was front page news. Yesterday it was deep red.																								Earlier she had confessed to nervousness. 																								I said I would never model on the catwalk again, but one should never say never. I missed it. 																								But this is a trial run. Well see how it goes. Now living alone in New York since the break-up of her relationship with the Manchester United goalkeeper Fabian Barthez, she said she was older, wiser and very happy. 																								She appeared three more times, in a flesh-tone corset, combat pants and a skin-tight cat face dress, before closing the show with the British model, Naomi Campbell, and designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana. 																								Both girls wore fringed flapper dresses epitomising the collections techno-diva theme.																								Earlier, Tom Ford, the Gucci designer, left an audience of 800 gasping with an autumn-winter collection that was a passionate, if slightly perverse, love affair with the female form.																								His models, dressed as goddesses of the future, strolled a catwalk strewn with the petals of 100,000 white roses. 																								They wore bell-sleeved trenches in black and white, cinched at the waist with straps and buckles, and elbow-length gloves. Milan Fashion Week continues today with the autumn-winter collections by Giorgio Armani, Fendi, Moschino, Alberta Ferretti and Burberry Prorsum. Yesterday, designer Gianfranco Ferre received mixed reviews for his collection.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Monday, August 18, 2003 				 Hoon sees end of road for cabinet career in Kelly inquiry
 FRANCIS ELLIOTT				 	 Geoff Hoon 																								London, Aug. 17: British defence secretary Geoff Hoon has told close colleagues that he has accepted he must carry the can for the death of David Kelly, the government scientist at the centre of claims that Downing Street exaggerated the case for war on Iraq.																								Hoon telephoned colleagues last week to tell them he expected to have to fall on his sword over the affair. Last week, the Hutton inquiry into Dr Kellys death disclosed that Hoon had overruled his most senior civil servants request that the scientist be spared a public grilling by the Commons foreign affairs committee.																								The defence secretary told Sir Kevin Tebbit, permanent secretary at the ministry of defence, that Kelly would have to face MPs for presentational reasons.																								Hoon has informed friends that he believes the disclosure, and the allegations that he was prepared to put political expediency ahead of Kellys welfare, spell doom for his cabinet career.																								Despite mounting evidence that officials at No 10 and Tony Blair himself were intimately involved in pressure exerted on Kelly in the days before his apparent suicide, the defence secretary has made clear he intends to shoulder the blame.																								Hes told us hes going to carry the can, one close colleague said last night. He said, You dont dump on the boss.																								While Hoons allies insist that he will mount a stout defence of his actions when he appears before the Hutton inquiry, probably next week, the defence secretary has privately admitted that he believes his ministerial career is over. Geoff knows you dont come back from something like this, said one friend.																								Hoons acceptance of his fate will cheer No 10 as its most senior officials, including Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell, the Prime Ministers chief of staff, prepare to give evidence to Lord Hutton this week.																								The inquiry will be told that Blair made clear he wanted Kelly handled within the MoD as a personnel matter as soon as he was told that the weapons inspector had admitted to having met Andrew Gilligan, the defence correspondent for BBC Radio 4s Today programme. Gilligans allegations in reports on May 29 that the government had exaggerated the case for war in its September dossier triggered the row between Downing Street and the BBC.																								Blairs official spokesperson has repeatedly claimed that the MoD was the lead department in the handling of Kellys case and that the widely-criticised decision to release a statement leading to his identification last month was taken in accordance with MoD procedures. Downing Street officials are also preparing to tell the inquiry that they made strenuous efforts to keep the scientists name out of the public domain in the days after he had confessed to his MoD managers that he had met Gilligan.																								Lord Hutton will be told of an approach by senior officials at No 10 to the intelligence and security committee, a group of MPs and peers appointed to oversee the intelligence and security services, with an offer to interview Kelly in absolute confidence about his meeting with Gilligan. 																								The Downing Street staff are expected to claim that the committee rejected the offer, on the grounds that it would leave its members open to charges of collusion and impropriety. 																								The committee insisted that the fact of such a meeting with an official  even if he was unnamed  should not be suppressed.																								The committees insistence allegedly necessitated Hoons public statement that an unnamed official had come forward, which led in turn to Kellys speedy identification by the media. No 10 staff are expected to claim, however, that it was Hoons decision alone to allow Kellys public cross-examination before the foreign affairs committee.																								It emerged last week that Hoon overruled Sir Kevin who had urged him to resist any request from MPs to interview Kelly in public. He asked Hoon to show some regard for the man himself, pointing out that he had come forward voluntarily, is not used to being thrust into the public eye and is not on trial.

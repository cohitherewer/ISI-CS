 Sunday, May 04, 2003 				 Failure to get congestion discount riles Madonna
				 	 Madonna takes the stage during the BBC talk show Friday Night with Ross and Madonna in London. (AP/PTI) London, May 3: Madonna  criticised the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, last night,  claiming that she could not get a 1,000 discount on her  congestion charge without giving up her privacy.																								She complained to the chat show host Jonathan Ross that she would have to give her private phone number.																								Madonna made her comments as she chatted to Ross for his BBC1 show about life in London. She told him how she was upset that she would have to pay the full annual congestion charge of nearly 1,300 for her Mini Cooper.																								Residents in the charging area can apply for a 90 per cent discount. She said: Im p***ed off at the congestion charging because I live in the area where you are not supposed to have to pay.																								But now I have to pay because I dont have a listed phone number. And you have to prove where you live to the mayor  Red Ken.																								I have a bone to pick with him, because I dont want to have a listed phone number.																								A spokesman for Transport For London said: There may be some confusion here because there just needs to be a telephone number  we would be prepared to accept another contact number.																								During her chat with Ross, Madonna  estimated to be worth 227 million in the Sunday Times Rich List  said: Im not delighted that people keep writing that I dont like it here. She just fell in love with living in Britain. I have learned to love ale. Timothy Taylors the best. Ive become one of those English drunken girls. All it takes is a half a pint. Im a cheap date.

 Thursday, July 31, 2003 				 Shia named council head
																								Baghdad, July 30 (Reuters): Iraqs US-backed governing council named a Shia politician as its first leader today, after adopting a rotating presidency which will give representatives of all major groups a turn at being in charge.																								Ibrahim Jaafari, a medical doctor who is the spokesman of the Shia Dawa party, was chosen as the first president of the self-rule body. After more than two weeks of labourious discussion, the governing council of 25 Iraqis decided yesterday that nine of its members  drawn from various religious, ethnic and political factions  would take turns at being president. Each will serve for a month. Jaafari will be followed by Iraqi National Congress head Ahmed Chalabi.

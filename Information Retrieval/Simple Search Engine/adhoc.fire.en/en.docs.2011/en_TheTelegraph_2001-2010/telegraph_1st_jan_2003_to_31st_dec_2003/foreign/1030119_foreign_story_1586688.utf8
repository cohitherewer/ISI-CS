																								Indianapolis, Jan. 18 (AP): A new study suggests sex researchers have been overestimating the prevalence of sexual problems in women for years  perhaps because they have been looking at things from a mans point of view.																								The Kinsey Institute study found that a quarter of American women are significantly distressed about their sex lives  far less than the 43 per cent a 1999 study labelled as suffering from sexual dysfunction. Research on the topic has tended to focus on physical aspects of sex, such as orgasms and arousal. 																								 But the new study found that the best predictors of a womans sexual satisfaction are her general emotional well-being and her emotional relationship with her partner.																								This study emphasises the importance of non-physiological components of sexuality as well as the general importance of mental health, said John Bancroft, director of the Indiana University-based Kinsey Institute. Its not conclusive, but it counterbalances what I believe to be the rather extraordinary conclusion that 43 per cent of women suffer from sexual dysfunction.																								The Kinsey study, which will appear in the June issue of the of Sexual Behavior, was a random telephone survey of 853 women, ages 20 to 65, who had been in a heterosexual relationship for at least six months.																								Among other things, it found that 24.4 per cent of those women reported marked distress about their sexual relationship, their own sexuality or both, within the previous month. 																								That contrasts with a University of Chicago study that questioned more than 1,700 women, ages 18 to 59. That 1999 study found 43 per cent of women reported having one or more persistent symptoms of sexual dysfunction, such as a lack of desire for sex, during the previous year. University of Chicago sociologist Edward Laumann, who led the 1999 research, said the new work cannot be directly compared to his study.

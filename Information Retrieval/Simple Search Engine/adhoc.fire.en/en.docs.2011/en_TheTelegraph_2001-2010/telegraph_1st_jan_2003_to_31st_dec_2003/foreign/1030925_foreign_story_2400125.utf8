The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, September 25, 2003 				 Pervez rings old alarm 
				 	 Pervez Musharraf during a speech in New York. (AFP)																								United Nations, Sept. 24 (PTI): Raking up the Kashmir issue once again in the UN and describing it as the most dangerous dispute in the world, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today said a sustained dialogue with India was necessary to resolve the problem.																								He also said he would invite India to observe complete ceasefire along the line of control (LoC) in Kashmir.																								I invite India to join Pakistan in a sustained dialogue to resolve the Kashmir dispute. I am convinced that, with goodwill, we can find a just solution which is acceptable to India, to Pakistan and above all, to the Kashmir people, he told the UN General Assembly.																								Rejecting the charge that Islamabad was indulging in cross border terrorism, he accused New Delhi of exploiting anti-terrorism sentiments to delegitimise the Kashmiri freedom struggle.																								He also alleged that India was violating the international law by refusing to implement the Security Council resolutions and perpetrating gross and consistent violations of human rights in Kashmir.																								Pakistan would also be prepared to encourage a general cessation of violence within Kashmir, involving reciprocal obligations and restraints on Indian forces and the Kashmir freedom movement, he added. 																								If India is genuinely concerned about LoC infiltration, Musharraf said, it should agree to a viable mechanism to monitor both sides. 																								Stating that a just solution of the Kashmir issue holds the key to peace in South Asia, he said: I am glad that India has stepped back from its dangerous and failed experiment in coercive diplomacy last year. 																								But despite some improvement in the atmospherics, India continues to suppress the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people to exercise their right to self determination, he said, adding that New Delhi continues to refuse Pakistans offer of dialogue to resolve the issue.

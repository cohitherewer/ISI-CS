The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, January 10, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Love lost letters																																	 Washington, Jan. 9 (Reuters): James Hewitt, the British tank squadron leader who claims to have had a five-year affair with the late Princess Diana, said late yesterday that he would sell her love letters.																																	Yes, I was interested when someone offered me a large sum of money, Hewitt said in answer to questions from CNN host Larry King. And you would be interested if you got an offer tomorrow? King continued. Yes, I would be, Hewitt replied.																																	But what you will do with the money you will not say? King asked. An awful lot of good can be done with the money. Hewitt said. When asked if he would use it to do a lot of good, he replied that he would. The letters are in a safe place abroad, Hewitt told King.																													 																Claudia ache																																	 Berlin (Reuters): An unemployed construction worker obsessed with Claudia Schiffer who stole 124 wedding rings for the German supermodel has been sent by a Berlin court to a psychiatric clinic. The state court ruled on Tuesday the Mozambican man was not guilty of robbery due to mental illness. In the September 27 hold-up, he used a toy pistol and wore a Halloween mask to steal the rings and a watch worth 57,000 euros ($58,000). But the court said the 32-year-old man was a danger to society and ordered him sent to a clinic for treatment. The man has lived for years with the obsession of meeting Claudia Schiffer and wanting to marry her, the judge said in her verdict before sentencing him.																													 																Paltrow boat																																	nWellington (AP): Gwyneth Paltrow reportedly did not enjoy bobbing around in a small rowboat in rough swells during filming for her latest movie off the coast of New Zealands South Island. Paltrow and leading man Daniel Craig braved swells of up to 1.5 meters to film scenes for Ted and Sylvia in the rowboat off the tiny coastal settlement of Karitane, 40 km north of the southern city of Dunedin. The rough surf apparently unsettled Paltrow. She declined autograph requests on her return for lunch saying she was sick, New Zealand media reported Paltrow telling one autograph hunter. In the film, Paltrow plays American poet Sylvia Plath while Craig plays her husband, English poet laureate Ted Hughes. The film is about the stormy relationship between the pair. Filming in the region is set to take two weeks. Accompanying Paltrow in New Zealand is her mother, Tony award-winning theatre actor Blythe Danner, and boyfriend Chris Martin, lead singer of the band Coldplay. Paltrow won the best actress Oscar for her role in Shakespeare in Love in 1999.

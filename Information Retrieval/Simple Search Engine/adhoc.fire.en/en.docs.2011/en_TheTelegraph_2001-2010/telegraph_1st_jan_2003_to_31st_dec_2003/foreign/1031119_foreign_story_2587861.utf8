 Wednesday, November 19, 2003 				 Charm burst in California
				 	 California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger with his wife Maria Shriver at Sacramento, California. (AP)																								Sacramento (California), Nov. 18 (Reuters): After five years of Gray, Californias capital experienced a charm explosion yesterday as new governor Arnold Schwarzenegger took office.																								Yes, film celebrities such as Danny DeVito, Jamie Lee Curtis and Rob Lowe and American political royalty such as Caroline Kennedy, daughter of former President John Kennedy, attended the one-time Austrian farm boys inaugural.																								Yet no one exuded more charisma than the former Mr Universe, who spoke at three different lunches after his inaugural address. 																								He is so excited about it, best friend Franco Columbu, a former bodybuilding champion, said. It is almost like saying: Can you believe it, Im going to be governor.																								This is really incredible. It reminds me of the excitement when Arnold came to America. He said: You wont believe it, Franco, the opportunity.																								By contrast, outgoing governor Gray Davis, recalled in only the second such instance in US history, was known for his dry personal style that prompted many to say his first name suited him well. About 700 journalists recorded Schwarzeneggers ascent to power. 																								Apparently Schwarzenegger enjoyed all of this hoopla and does not mind foregoing the $30 million a movie Hollywood paid him for his latest big-screen appearance in Terminator 3.																								 Its very clear that Im not going to miss the action in my movies, because there is plenty of action here in Sacramento, he told legislators.

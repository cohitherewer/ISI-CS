 Wednesday, November 26, 2003 				 Concorde sails into sunset
				 	 A British Airways Concorde on its way to a museum in Lower Manhattan, New York. (Reuters) New York, Nov. 25 (Reuters):  After decades of supersonic flight, Concordes last trip  was a sluggish barge ride to its final resting place today  at New Yorks Intrepid Sea, Air amp; Space Museum, where  it will be on permanent display.																								British Airways Plcs fastest ever Concorde aircraft, which was built in 1976 and made its last flight earlier this month, was floated up the Hudson river by barge to the museum, where an official arrival ceremony took place.																								The planes journey from Brooklyn to Manhattan took almost as long as it used to take the jet to cross the Atlantic Ocean.																								The Concorde G-BOADs cockpit and cabin will be open to the public in the spring of 2004. An accompanying museum dedicated to the evolution of supersonic flight will take about six months to a year to complete, according to Jerry Roberts, the museums vice-president in charge of exhibits.																								One of seven British Airways Concorde aircraft, the G-BOAD was the fastest, setting a transatlantic record in 1996 when it flew from New York to London in two hours, 52 minutes, and 59 seconds.																								This is the best specimen and the pride of the fleet, Roberts said.																								Concorde was put into retirement by British Airways last month and by Air France in May as already high costs rose still more after an Air France jet crashed in July 2000, killing 113 people.

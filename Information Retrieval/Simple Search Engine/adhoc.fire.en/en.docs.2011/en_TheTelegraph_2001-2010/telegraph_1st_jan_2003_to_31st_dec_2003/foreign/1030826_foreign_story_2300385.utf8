 Tuesday, August 26, 2003 				 BBC attacks imperialist Murdoch
																								London, Aug. 25 (AFP): The BBC launched a direct attack against Australian-US press magnate Rupert Murdoch today, calling him a capital imperialist who wants to undermine public radio and television.																								Murdoch, owner of a global media empire which includes the British satellite broadcaster BSkyB, is against everything the BBC stands for, BBC1 director Lorraine Heggessey told the British daily The Independent.																								He is a capital imperialist, isnt he? Thats what he does. And all people of his political persuasion in the US are against the public sector, said the head of one of the BBCs two free-to-air channels. 																								Britons have national health service, (and) a public education, both of which benefit society without seeking to make a profit, she stressed.																								Heggesseys comments followed a suggestion on Saturday by BskyB (British Sky Broadcasting) director Tony Ball that the BBC should be forced to sell its most successful programmes. 																								The money raised by such sales should then be invested in experimental programming, Ball told the Edinburgh International Television festival.																								The public broadcaster responded by saying the idea underscored Rupert Murdochs long and hostile campaign against the corporation.

 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 US to assist in Pervez attack probe
																								Islamabad, Dec. 22 (PTI): The US will be sending a team of investigators this week to assist Pakistani security agencies in a probe into the failed bid to kill President Pervez Musharraf.																								The US team will examine the bridge that was blown by the militants seconds after Musharrafs convoy had passed on December 14 and help the security agencies in their investigations, official sources here said.																								Militants exploded 250 kg of c-4 plastic explosives beneath the bridge located near the 10th army corps headquarters in Rawalpindi. Preliminary investigations by security agencies have revealed that Musharrafs convoy escaped the blast due to electronic jammers which delayed the explosions by less than a minute. The local investigators have established that the bombs were ignited by a remote control device placed far away from the bridge.																								Those who planted the explosives knew the Musharrafs exact schedule from Karachi and probably could see his convoy approaching the bridge.

 Sunday, September 28, 2003 				 Time bomb wounds 13 in Karachi
 Karachi, Sept. 27 (Reuters):  A time bomb exploded on board a passenger bus in Karachi  today, wounding up to 13 people, police and doctors said.																								A low intensity time bomb has exploded on board a moving passenger bus, Syed Kamal Shah, inspector general of Sindh province police, said.																								This kind of terrorism has not been witnessed before in the city in recent years.																								Doctors said at least 13 people were admitted to two state-run hospitals. One passenger is in critical condition, they added. Shah said 11 people were wounded.																								I heard a clock ticking and then there was a loud explosion in the front side of the bus, said Babar Saeed, one of the victims. My eyes have only reopened in hospital.																								Mohammed Omar, a middle -aged victim who had been sitting at the back of the bus, said smoke filled the vehicle and people screamed for help. I jumped out of the bus... my leg has been broken.																								The explosion occurred on the main M.A. Jinnah Road, in the heart of the city, just three days ahead of the arrival in the Lahore of the South African cricket team, which initially cancelled its visit due to security concerns.																								It eventually agreed to play after Karachi was excluded from the itinerary.

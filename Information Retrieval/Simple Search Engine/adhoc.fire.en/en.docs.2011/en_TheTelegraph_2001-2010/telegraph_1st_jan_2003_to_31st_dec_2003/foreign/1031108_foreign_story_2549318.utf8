 Saturday, November 08, 2003 				 Turkey not to send troops
 Ankara, Nov. 7 (Reuters):  Reversing an earlier decision, Turkey said today it would  not deploy troops to help the US secure post-war Iraq after  encountering strong opposition from the US-appointed Iraqi  governing council.																								Political analysts said the move would expose the problems US forces are having in restoring order in Iraq but said it should not harm ties between Washington and Ankara. Turkey took its decision after US secretary of state Colin Powell rang foreign minister Abdullah Gul last evening to discuss Iraq, the foreign ministry said.

 Friday, March 14, 2003 				 Worldwide pneumonia alert
																								Hong Kong, March 13 (Reuters): The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a global pneumonia alert after a highly contagious respiratory illness killed one man and infected nearly 60 hospital staff in Hong Kong and Vietnam.																								Health authorities have not been able to establish any link between outbreaks in the two places, but experts studying the Hong Kong cases believe they were caused by rapidly spreading viruses yet to be identified.																								It must have come from a patient and is probably spread through very close contact by aerosol, like sneezing, said Prof. John Tam, who is among a team of doctors treating those battling the virus in Hong Kong. 																								It affects a lot of people very quickly and their conditions can deteriorate very fast, Tam said.																								An American businessman, who died today in a Hong Kong hospital, had been flown in from Hanoi where he had been admitted to hospital shortly after arriving from Hong Kong with severe respiratory problems.

 Monday, June 30, 2003 				 Fee row shuts Nepal schools
																								Kathmandu, June 29 (PTI): more than 8,000 private boarding schools in Nepal are likely to close down from tomorrow after talks between the school management and agitating student unions over restructuring of monthly fees ended in a deadlock.																								The Private and Boarding Schools Organisation of Nepal and seven student unions entered into talks after the unions locked up the account sections and offices of principals of over 100 private schools which charge more than Rs 1,000 as monthly fees. 																								But the talks failed to reach any agreement, sources in the school management and the unions said.																								Our main demands were to introduce fee ceiling system in boarding schools and to provide scholarships for 25 per cent students belonging to schedule castes and poor families, said Nepal Students Union general secretary Ganga Thapa. 																								We were ready to discuss with school managements matters concerning the restructuring of fees as the boarding schools charge unjustifiably high fees from students, he said.																								The tussle between the school managements and the unions will affect over 1.5 million students across the country.

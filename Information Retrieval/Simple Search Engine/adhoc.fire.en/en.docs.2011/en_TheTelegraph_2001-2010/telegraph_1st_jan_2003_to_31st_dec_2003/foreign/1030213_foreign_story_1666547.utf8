 Thursday, February 13, 2003 				 Italy frees Pakistan detainees
																								Naples, Feb. 12 (Reuters): An Italian judge ordered the release today of 28 Pakistanis arrested last month on suspicion of links with international terrorism, after deciding there was too little evidence to hold them. 																								The men were arrested two weeks ago after police burst into an apartment in Naples and discovered a kilo of explosives, 70 metres of fuse and detonators crammed behind a false wall.																								Islamic religious documents, detailed maps of Naples, with Nato and US military installations highlighted, and photos of jihad martyrs were also said to have been found.																								Qasim Muttaqi, Pakistans consular affairs chief in Rome, confirmed the release order and said Pakistan had always maintained their innocence.																								The judge has sent a fax to the prison ordering their release, even if they are not free yet, Muttaqi said. This is a very positive development. Weve always said that they were innocent and that they were just economic migrants trying to eke out a living, not terrorists.

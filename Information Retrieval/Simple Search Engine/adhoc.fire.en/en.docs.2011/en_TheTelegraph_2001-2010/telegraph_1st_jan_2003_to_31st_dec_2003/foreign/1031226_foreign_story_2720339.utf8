 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 China gas well burst kills 193
 							 - 41,000 residents evacuated amid rising toll two days after incident				 	 Survivors of Chinas gas explosion at a makeshift hospital in Chongqing municipalitys Kaixian county. (AFP)																								Beijing, Dec. 25 (Reuters): At least 193 people were killed and hundreds poisoned when a natural gas well in southwestern China burst and released a cloud of toxic fumes, medical workers, officials and state media said today.																								Authorities evacuated 41,000 people, most of them farmers, from the mountainous area after the government ordered everyone cleared from within five kilometres of the site of Tuesdays disaster in Kaixian county, in densely populated Chongqing municipality, the official Xinhua news agency said.																								Twenty teams were dispatched to villages in the surrounding area to search for survivors and identify casualties. Local officials feared the death toll would rise, Xinhua said.																								Children were among hundreds poisoned or suffering chemical burns, hospital workers said. Were very busy. There are patients everywhere. We havent counted the casualties, said another hospital worker.																								In hospitals, the injured had swollen and sensitive eyes and some had difficulty standing, the private www.sina.com website said. The total number of injured was not clear. 																								Rescue workers carrying oxygen tanks on their backs and wearing masks were seen near the site, one official said. 																								At one Kaixian hospital, more than 200 people were being treated for poisoning, an administrator said by telephone from the area, which is about 1,000 km west of Shanghai.																								China has a notoriously poor work safety record. More than 120,000 people died in work-related accidents from January to November this year, the official China Daily said earlier this month.																								The cause of the latest disaster, one of the deadliest of this year, was being investigated. An oil industry official in Chongqing said the well had burst while it was being drilled.																								Xinhua said at least 193 people had been confirmed dead by today evening. It said the gas well burst on Tuesday, spewing a high concentration of natural gas and sulphurated hydrogen 30 metres into the air at the Chuandongbei field, which is owned by China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), parent of oil major PetroChina. Evacuees were organised into 10 shelter areas as temperatures hovered around freezing, a county government official said.																								Xinhua said sulphurated hydrogen is a toxic gas that can poison or kill people who inhale 760 to 1,000 milligrams per cubic metre.																								It was also unclear why the reported death toll had shot up two days after the accident. Earlier today, Xinhua reported that 133 had died but soon raised that to 163 and then 191.																								An industry source said top CNPC officials said they did not know the exact number of casualties as of yesterday morning before going to the scene.																								Xinhua said 260 cubic metres of mud, to be pumped into the well to plug it up tomorrow morning, and 13 special rescue vehicles were en route to the scene.

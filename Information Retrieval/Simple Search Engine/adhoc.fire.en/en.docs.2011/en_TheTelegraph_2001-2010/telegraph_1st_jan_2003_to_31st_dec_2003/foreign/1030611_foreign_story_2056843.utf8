 Wednesday, June 11, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Winslet weds																																	 London, June 10: Actress Kate Winslet married Oscar-winning theatre director Sam Mendes in a secret ceremony, the couple announced last night. The wedding took place last month during a holiday in the West Indies. Winslets two-year-old daughter, Mia, from her first marriage, attended the low-key ceremony.																																	No relatives of the couple were present and they were joined by only three of their friends. Winslet, 27, the star of Titanic and Mendes, 37, who won an Oscar as the director of American Beauty, announced their marriage in a brief statement. A friend of the couple said: They just wanted to have something small and simple. A big, showy wedding was not what they wanted. 																													 																Heavy heave																																	 Lille (France), (Reuters): A 265-kg woman who had not left home in six years was hoisted by crane from her apartment and taken to hospital, the local fire department said on Monday. The 49-year-old woman fell ill late on Sunday but was too large to be carried down the winding stairs of her apartment. It took 30 firemen six hours to extract her from the second-floor flat.After 28 years with the fire department, its the first time I have taken part in this kind of operation We even had to dismantle part of the window to evacuate the patient, said a Bruay fire service official.																													 																Nefertiti																																	 Washington (Reuters): A British Egyptologist announced on Monday her team may have identified the mummy of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, the wife and co-ruler with pharaoh Akhenaten and stepmother to legendary boy King Tutankhamun. Joann Fletcher, a mummification specialist from the University of York in England who led the expedition, said her team may have unearthed Nefertiti from a secret chamber in tomb KV35 in Egypts Valley of the Kings in Luxor. Although we can only suggest the identity as a strong possibility, the findings certainly have some wide-ranging implications for Egyptology, Fletcher said. Her tomb was found near that of King Tut, the teen-age king who ruled Egypt in 14th century BC.

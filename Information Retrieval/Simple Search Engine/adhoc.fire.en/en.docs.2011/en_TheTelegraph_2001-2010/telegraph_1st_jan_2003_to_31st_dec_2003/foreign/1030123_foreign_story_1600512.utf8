																								Rome, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Forget dieting  theres nothing like love to help you shed those extra pounds, according to a survey published by an Italian health magazine this week.																								Eight out of 10 Italians find that a new love interest is the best way for both men and women to get into shape, Dimagrire (Lose Weight) said in its February issue. 																								Chocolate, other sweets and carbohydrates stimulate neurotransmitters causing a general feeling of well-being, but also pile on the calories, one nutritionist said. So, if being in love brings the same happiness, the organism doesnt need these foods to achieve well-being, Amleto DAmicis said.																								But the slimming effects of romance dont last forever. For a third of Italians, the pounds stay off only until marriage and for 23 per cent, a first child can bring those love handles back on for both mama and papa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, March 16, 2003 				 Leading al Qaida man held in Pak
																								Islamabad, March 15 (Reuters): Pakistani authorities said they had arrested a leading al Qaida member, Moroccan national Yasir al-Jaziri, in Lahore today.																								The arrest comes two weeks after the capture of another senior al Qaida figure, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in Rawalpindi. 																								He (al Jaziri) is less important than Khalid Sheikh Mohammed but he is quite an important person, secretary of the interior ministry Tasneem Noorani said. This is the biggest catch since Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, an intelligence source said, adding a second man, an Afghan called Gulzeb, alias Jaffar, had also been captured.																								Noorani said al Jaziri had been picked up in the smart Gulberg suburb of Lahore this evening. 																								The source said the arrest had been made by four Pakistani security personnel accompanied by two White men, and said al Jaziri had been tracked down thanks to information received from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.																								He said a laptop computer and some CDs had been recovered in the raid. The senior superintendent of police in Lahore said his men had not taken part in the operation.

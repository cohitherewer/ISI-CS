The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, September 23, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Kangaroo courage																																	 Canberra, Sept. 22 (Reuters): A kangaroo named Lulu was hailed as a hero today for saving an unconscious Australian farmer by alerting the mans wife and leading her to where he lay trapped under a fallen tree branch.																																	Hobby farmer Leonard Richards was checking for storm damage on his property at Tanjil South, 150 km east of Melbourne, yesterday when a falling branch hit him.																																	 a story reminiscent of the long-running Australian childrens television series Skippy, in which a pet kangaroo rescued people in distress in the Australian bush, the kangaroo began barking until Richards wife came to investigate. 																						Lulu was hand-reared by the Richards family, who rescued her from her mothers pouch after her mother was killed by a car about four years ago.

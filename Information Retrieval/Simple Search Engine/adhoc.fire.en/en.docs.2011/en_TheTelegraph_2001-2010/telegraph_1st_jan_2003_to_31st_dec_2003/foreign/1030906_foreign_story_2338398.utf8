The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, September 06, 2003 				 FBI issues alert for 4 linked to al Qaida
				 	 The four men the FBI is seeking. (AFP)																								Washington, Sept. 5 (Reuters): The FBI today urged the public to be on the lookout for four men  including two the agency has been seeking for months  who may be connected to possible threats against the US.																								The FBI issued Seeking Information alerts on its website for Adnan G. El Shukrijumah, Abderraouf Jdey, Karim El Mejjati and Zubayr al-Rimi.																								The alerts, signed by FBI director Robert Mueller, said the men should be considered armed and dangerous. But, he added: We dont have a specific threat.																								The warnings were issued a week before the two-year anniversary of the September 11, 2001 hijacked plane attacks and the day after the department of homeland security issued an advisory warning that al Qaida appeared to still be planning attacks against the US.																								In March the FBI had made urgent calls for public help to find El Shukrijumah, a Saudi-born man who they said could pose a very, very serious threat as part of an al Qaida plot against the US. The original information leading to El Shukrijumah was based on debriefings of al Qaida captives. An FBI official said the latest alerts were prompted by intelligence information which pointed to renewed interest in the four men.																								The FBI said El Shukrijumah carries a Guyanese passport but may attempt to enter the United States with a Saudi, Canadian or Trinidadian passport. 																								Al-Rimi is from Saudi Arabia, and El Mejjati was born in Morocco but has a passport issued in France. The FBI said his last known entry into the US was between 1997 and 1999.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, March 11, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																House rules																																	 Silicon Valley, March 10 (PTI): Bringing Down the House, produced by Ashok Amritraj and starring Oscar nominee Queen Latifah and Steve Martin, has topped the North American box office in its debut weekend.																																	The film, Walt Disney Cos lively comedy lampooning racism, grossed $31.7 million from Friday-to-Sunday ticket sales, according to industry box office service exhibitor relations, reported Variety magazine.																																	It was way ahead of rival Tears of the Sun, an action war film starring Bruce Willis which came in at number two in its debut weekend with gross ticket sales of $17.2 million. 																																	Bringing Down the House seemed to benefit from all the Oscar buzz for best supporting actress nominee Queen Latifah in Chicago.																						At the time of casting, Latifah was not as hot as she is today, Amritraj told India West paper earlier. 																																	She has suddenly become sizzling hot between her nomination for Chicago, and being a presenter at the Grammys. The fact she has peaked at such a crucial time is, to us, wonderful for the movie. 																													 																Hair-raising																																	 Madrid (Reuters): Cant Buy Me Love, sang the Beatles, but 1,400 euros ($1,550) was enough to land a Barcelona hairdresser a lock of hair snipped from George Harrison in 1964. It went to a hairdresser from Barcelona called Rafael Pages, who also has a hairdressing museum, said Jordi Tarda, an organiser of Sundays auction of pop memorabilia at an annual record fair in the north-eastern Spanish town of Girona. Tarda said photos capturing the moment the hair was lopped from Harrison in Liverpool and an accompanying note signed by the Beatle who died in 2001  verifying it was his own, meant there were no doubts about its roots. Harrisons hair raised the highest price at the auction which also included a pair of limited edition Michael Jackson shoes and a ticket for the premiere of the musical Tommy.																													 																Firm arms																																	 Wellington (Reuters): A $112,000 dispute between two New Zealand companies has been resolved in an unusual out-of-court settlement  a best-of-three arm-wrestling match.

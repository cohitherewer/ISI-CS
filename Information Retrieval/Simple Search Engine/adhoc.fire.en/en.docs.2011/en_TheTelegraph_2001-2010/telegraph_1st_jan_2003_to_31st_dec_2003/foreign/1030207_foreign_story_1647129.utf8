																								Glasgow, Feb. 6 (Reuters): British police said they arrested seven people today in the latest of a series of counter-terrorism raids around the country.																								The six men and one woman were arrested in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow, in an operation that police said was linked to the arrest of seven North African men in Edinburgh and London in December.																								There has been a series of raids at addresses in Scotland and England carried out by police this morning.... Seven people were detained under the Terrorism Act 2000, said a spokeswoman for Lothian and Borders police, which is leading the operation.																								In Glasgow, police cordoned off and were searching a flat in a rundown public housing development where a man and woman were arrested.																								Police originally went into the flat wearing chemical protection suits but later took them off. They said they expect the search to take two days. 																								Last month police found traces of ricin, a deadly toxin, at a north London apartment. 																								However, deputy chief constable Tom Wood, operations director of Lothian and Borders Police, played down any link. It is important to stress that there has been no discovery of dangerous substances, he said.																								 in a statement.																								A police spokeswoman said similar searches were continuing at the other addresses where arrests took place and could lead to further arrests.																								This was a carefully co-ordinated operation which was executed successfully, Wood said.																								All those arrested have been taken to a high-security police facility in Glasgow for questioning, the spokeswoman said.																								Anti-terrorist police have arrested over 300 people since the September 11 attacks on the US.

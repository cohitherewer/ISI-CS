 Wednesday, September 03, 2003 				 Tight-lipped Ford doesnt like going to the cinema
				 	 Harrison Ford Berlin, Sept. 2 (Reuters):  Harrison Ford said yesterday hes not a big movie fan and  doesnt much like going to the cinema.																								But the Hollywood hero said what really annoys him are lies about his private life that he says are printed in tabloid newspapers and celebrity magazines around the world. 																								I dont answer questions about my private life, Ford said in Berlin, where he was promoting his latest film Hollywood Homicide. The celebrity press that abounds in every country around the world today is not truthful about peoples private lives, the famously tight-lipped American actor added. 																								But its not my job to sit here and correct whats incorrect. That just gives it a second life. So I leave it alone and concentrate on the mission Im here on. Even though Hollywood Homicide and his previous film, a Russian submarine drama K-19: The Widowmaker, were box-office disappointments, Ford has starred in four of the 10 top-grossing movies ever made  Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Return of the Jedi. 																								Ford said he would start shooting a fourth Indiana Jones film next year. But he declined to reveal any details about it other than to say that Steven Spielberg will direct it.																								I promise you hell be 15 years older, Ford, 61, said of the Indiana Jones character who last appeared on the screen in Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade in 1989.																								Theres no intention of trying to stay in the same period of time. Other than that I cant really tell you anything about the story.																								Ford and American actress Calista Flockhart have been the subject of tabloid gossip since they hooked up at the January 2002 Golden Globe awards. Flockhart, 38, moved into Fords Los Angeles home with her adopted two-year-old son Liam earlier this year. Ford separated from his second wife, screenwriter Melissa Mathison, in 2001. In Berlin, Ford said he was sad to hear of the death of Charles Bronson, a veteran of more than 60 films. But he said he did not know much about Bronson.																								Im not a big movie fan so I dont go often to the movies, Ford said. The films he was most well-known for were not really my cup of tea.

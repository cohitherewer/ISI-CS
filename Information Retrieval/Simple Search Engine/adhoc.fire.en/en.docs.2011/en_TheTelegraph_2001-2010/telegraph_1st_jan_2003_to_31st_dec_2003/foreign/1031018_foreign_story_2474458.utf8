 George Clooney London, Oct. 17 (AFP):  George Clooney will slip behind the camera to produce The  Jacket, which begins filming early next year in Scotland,  Clooneys production company said on Wednesday. 																								The Jacket, the story of a Gulf War veteran accused of a murder he does not remember committing, takes place in the US but will be shot in Scotland in the West Lothian region near Edinburgh and in Glasgow. The leading roles in the film, to be co-produced by Clooney and Steven Soderbergh under their joint production company Section Eight, will be played by Oscar-winning actor Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley, who has starred in films like Bend It Like Beckham and Pirates of the Carribean.																								The filming of the $32-million budgeted movie should last seven weeks and is expected to generate some $10 million for the Scottish economy, according to Scottish Screen, an organisation responsible for selling Scotland as a desirable filming locale.

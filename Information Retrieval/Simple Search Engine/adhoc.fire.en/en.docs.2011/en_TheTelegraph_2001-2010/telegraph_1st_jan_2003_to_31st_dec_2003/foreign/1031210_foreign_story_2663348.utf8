 Wednesday, December 10, 2003 				 Molested woman sues Arnie
				 	 Rhonda Miller																								Los Angeles, Dec. 9 (Reuters): A woman who accused California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of groping her on a movie set sued the action star and his campaign staff yesterday for smearing her as a convicted felon when she went public with her claims during his gubernatorial campaign.																								Rhonda Miller was among a number of women who stepped forward before the October 7 recall election to accuse The Terminator star of groping them or making lewd comments.																								At an October 6 press conference, Miller accused Schwarzenegger of pulling up her shirt and taking a photo of her breasts during production of Terminator 2, in which she worked as a stand-in. Less than an hour later, Schwarzeneggers campaign staff directed reporters in a memorandum to the lengthy criminal record of a woman named Rhonda Miller on the Los Angeles Superior Court website, according to Millers libel lawsuit.																								In a statement issued that day, Schwarzenegger called Millers accusation not factually correct but apologised for making crude comments and occasionally engaging in rowdy behaviour. The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, accused the Republican governor and his staff of a calculated act of character assassination and contends they knew that Miller was not the woman identified in the court filings as having felony convictions for, among other crimes, prostitution and fraud.

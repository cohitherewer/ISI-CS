 Wednesday, April 23, 2003 				 Bangladesh ferry disaster
																								Dhaka, April 22 (Reuters): Rescuers have recovered the bodies of more than 100 people killed in two ferry disasters in Bangladesh but bad weather and the lack of proper equipment was hampering efforts today to find hundreds of others missing.																								One ferry sank in the Buriganga river near Dhaka and the other at Kishoreganj on the Meghna river, 150 km northeast of the capital, in the midst of a violent storm which lashed the country yesterday.																								Hundreds of grieving relatives and villagers gathered on river banks to identify their kin from the bodies lined up on the sand and to await rescue vessels.																								So far 103 bodies have been recovered from the Buriganga, said Sharif Shamsul Haque, the officer in charge of a police station at the site of the accident near Dhaka. He said 88 bodies, including many women and children, had been identified and were being handed to their relatives. We are telling people to come and take their loved ones home for burial, he said.																								Local television showed hundreds of mourning relatives crowding river banks and watching divers hauling up bodies and placing them on rafts to be taken ashore.																								Many wept or wailed over the bodies of their loved ones, but others appeared dumb-struck.

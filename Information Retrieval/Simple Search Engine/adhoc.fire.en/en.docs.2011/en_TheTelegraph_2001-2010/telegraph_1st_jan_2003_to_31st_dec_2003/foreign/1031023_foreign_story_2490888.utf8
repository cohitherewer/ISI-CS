 Thursday, October 23, 2003 				 Israel to defy UN
																								Jerusalem, Oct. 22 (Reuters): Israel today vowed to press on with construction of its vast barrier in the West Bank despite a UN resolution condemning the project and demanding it be halted.																								The fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of Israels citizens, deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told Israel Radio, reaffirming the long-standing position of Israels Right-leaning coalition.																								Late yesterday, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling the sprawling network of fences and walls a contradiction to international law and ordering Israel to stop and reverse its construction on Palestinian lands.																								Olmert said the Israeli government would defy what he called the dictates of an automatic, hostile, inconsiderate and misguided (UN) majority that always acts against Israel.																								Israel says it is a security fence to keep out suicide bombers. Palestinians call it a new Berlin Wall that cuts deep into territory they want for a state. The United States, Israels chief ally, has expressed misgivings about the project.

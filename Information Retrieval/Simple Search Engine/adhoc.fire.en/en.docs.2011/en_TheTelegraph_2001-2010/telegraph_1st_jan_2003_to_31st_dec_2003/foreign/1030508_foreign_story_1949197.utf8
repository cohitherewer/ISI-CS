The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Hollywood pitches in to help Ali
 Los Angeles, May 7 (AFP): Hollywood has launched a drive to bring a limbless Iraqi orphan who became the symbol of civilian suffering in the US-led war to the US for medical treatment.A constellation of tinseltown stars, including Arnold Schwarznegger, Angelina Jolie, Mariah Carey, Ashanti and Justin Timberlake, have already signed on for the effort to bring 12-year-old Ali Ismail Abbas to Los Angeles.Other luminaries including Christina Aguilera are also on board and top names like George Clooney and Julia Roberts are expected to join their ranks, promoter and marketing guru to the stars Cheryl Shuman said.Weve just launched this effort, but my hope is that with the help of these stars we can raise enough money to cover his medical treatment and then take care of this child for the rest of his life, she said. He needs prostheses and he is very, very badly burned and theres just no money to help him and maybe nowhere for him to go.  Copyright

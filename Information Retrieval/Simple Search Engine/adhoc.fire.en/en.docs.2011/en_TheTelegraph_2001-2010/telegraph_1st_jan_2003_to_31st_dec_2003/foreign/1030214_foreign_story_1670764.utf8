The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, February 14, 2003 				 Showbiz chorus against Bush
				 	 Spike Lee in Berlin on Thursday. (Reuters)																								Berlin, Feb. 13 (Reuters): New York director Spike Lee led a chorus of criticism against George W. Bush at the Berlin Film festival yesterday, telling the US President he had no moral authority to launch a war against Iraq.																								Going out of his way to praise the French and German governments for their outspoken resistance to the US governments war moves, Lee said it was an outrage that Bush was ignoring world opinion in his rush to attack Iraq.																								When you think about it, the German and French governments should be commended, Lee said at a news conference after his film 25th Hour, about New York after the September 11 attacks, made its international premiere. 																								Too many people are being bowled over by Bush and Tony Blair in Britain. Its ludicrous to expect the whole world to follow what they want. America doesnt have the moral right to tell other people what to do. To say the whole world has to fall into line is you-know-what.																								Dustin Hoffman and Martin Scorsese added their voices to a peace movement, telling audiences in Germany violence would not solve the worlds problems and that they wanted to speak out against Bush, without criticising America. I hope the world community will continue to voice itself and apply pressure on US, said Edward Norton, who stars in Lees film.

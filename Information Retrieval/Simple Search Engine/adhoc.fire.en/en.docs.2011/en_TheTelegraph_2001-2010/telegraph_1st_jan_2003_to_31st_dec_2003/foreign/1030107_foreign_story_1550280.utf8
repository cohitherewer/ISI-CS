 Tuesday, January 07, 2003 				 No security breach: Pak
																								Islamabad, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Pakistan said today it was confident there had been no security breach in its nuclear programme despite media reports that the country helped North Korea with arms technology.																								In a statement issued after meeting the National Command Authority, which controls Pakistans nuclear arsenal, Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali dismissed the reports as mischievous, motivated and highly irresponsible.																								The New York Times reported in November that Pakistan had provided North Korea with technology needed to make enriched uranium for nuclear weapons in return for missile parts. Pakistan denied the reports.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, June 11, 2003 				 Aid pledge boost to Lanka
																								Tokyo, June 10 (Reuters): International donors pledged more than $4.5 billion in aid to Sri Lanka today, giving it a major incentive to revive a flagging peace process between the government and Tamil Tiger rebels.																								But the rebels, who boycotted the meeting, maintained their silence, raising doubts whether stalled peace talks could be resumed. 																								The assistance, to be spread over four years, equals the amount pledged to post-war Afghanistan and was heralded by Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as marking a new chapter in the history of the Indian Ocean country.

We are concerned and disappointed that the media does not seem to be leaving him to the privacy that he needs if he is to learn new skills during his year off, a spokeswoman for Prince Charles office said. Harry is spending three months working on a ranch in the Australian outback as part of his gap year between school and possible further studies.																																	He arrived in Australia on Tuesday and started work the next day at a cattle station owned by friends of his late mother.																																	The spokeswoman said the royals were worried photographers and cameramen might use planes, helicopters and long lenses to film Harry on the ranch.

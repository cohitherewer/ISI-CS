The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, August 15, 2003 				 Hit a six into Zeta-Jones home for 100
				 	 Catherine Zeta-Jones																								London, Aug. 14 (PTI): An English village cricket club has challenged wannabe cricketers to hit a 150-yard shot into Catherine Zeta-Jones back garden and earn 100.																								The first batsman to achieve the feat would also have to go and ask for the ball in order to collect the 100, insisted Mark Portsmouth, chairman of the Mumbles Cricket Club in Swansea, Wales, who put up the prize. One big six could do it. It would have to be a massive hit but it is possible, Portsmouth said, the Daily Mirror reported. According to Wisden, the biggest hit ever was 175 yards and was achieved in 1856.																								The 33-year-old actress will use the house when visiting relatives in Swansea. Her windows are safe  she is having bullet-proof glass fitted to it.

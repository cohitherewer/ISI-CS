 Wednesday, October 08, 2003 				 Man gets life for UK killing
																								London, Oct. 7 (Reuters): A Muslim businessman was jailed for life by a British court today for the murder of his teenage daughters Christian boyfriend in the second case of so-called honour killing in the UK in just over a week.																								Londons Old Bailey court convicted Mustaq Ahmed, 40, of killing 22-year-old Albanian Rexhap Hasani after realising his daughter Sadhia had fallen in love and planned to marry him.																								Last Tuesday, Abdullah Yones, an Iraqi Kurd who has lived in Britain for 10 years, was also jailed for life after he stabbed his 16-year-old daughter Heshu because she was dating a Christian boyfriend.																								Scotland Yard police headquarters has now set up a special squad to investigate honour killings. It has already identified more than a dozen such crimes.																								Before Tuesdays sentencing, the Old Bailey heard how Ahmed lured Hasani to his factory in east London, where he bound, gagged and beat him up. Hasani, who was seeking asylum in Britain, was left to slowly suffocate to death.																								Prosecutors told the court that Ahmed felt Hasani had damaged his familys honour by his relationship with Sadhia. The whole idea of her marrying this asylum seeker was contrary to his belief, said prosecutor Brian Altman.																								Police said after the court hearing they hoped the successful conviction would set an example.																								This man was murdered because the girlfriends father disapproved of the relationship. He could not face the thought of his daughter being with an Albanian asylum seeker, who in his eyes was not a suitable partner, Detective Inspector John Macdonald told reporters.																								This result will again demonstrate that honour-type killings will not be tolerated and will be investigated as thoroughly as any other murder.

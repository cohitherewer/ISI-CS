 CHRIS HASTINGS				 	 Uma Thurman in the film Kill Bill. (Reuters) London, Oct. 12: Its full  of blood and violence but something rather more innocent  has upset the British film censor in Quentin Tarantinos  latest epic: the sight of Uma Thurmans feet.																								Untroubled by the incessant killing and the 150 gallons of spurting blood depicted in Kill Bill, Quentin Thomas, the president of the British Board of Film Classification, passed the film uncut for nationwide release this weekend.																								However, he confessed to being appalled by the condition of the leading ladys feet. There was quite a lengthy shot of them and they did not look very nice, said Thomas, in remarks that will no doubt bemuse the legions of male admirers of Thurman, one of Hollywoods most glamourous female stars.																								Kill Bill, Tarantinos fourth film, has been described as the most violent film ever screened. It tells the story of a hired killer, played by Thurman, who sets out to murder her fellow gang members after her entire wedding party, including her unborn child, is massacred at the altar. In one scene she repeatedly slams a door on the head of one of her attackers. Tarantino himself admitted the body count in the 55 million film is so high that it is virtually incalculable.																								Thomas, who passed Kill Bill with an 18 certificate, insisted that the films frequent, strong and bloody violence did not need cutting because it was not likely to prompt copycat actions. The scenes of beheadings and samurai sword fights, which prompted one of the films stars to issue a warning about its content, were, he said, too unreal to be taken seriously.																								Much of what you see on screen happens in a fantasy context. There is a lot of spurting of blood or tomato sauce, but it is like something out of a cartoon, he said. There is not a moment in the film that is the equivalent of the scene in Tarantinos Reservoir Dogs, where the ear of one of the characters is cut off. 																								Thomas, appointed film censor last year, added he had found the film ludicrous, indulgent and very boring.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

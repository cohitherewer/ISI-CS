 Friday, February 14, 2003 				 Jackson plans documentary rebuttal
																								Los Angeles, Feb. 13 (Reuters): An outraged Michael Jackson has signed a deal with Fox television to air his rebuttal to a controversial documentary that put his eccentric life under a critical microscope.																								Fox said yesterday it would air a two-hour special on February 20 featuring Jacksons own footage of British interviewer Martin Bashir, who is seen telling him: Your relationship with your children is spectacular.																								Jacksons attempt to turn the tables on Bashir, who he accused of betrayal, follows a new furore over the self-styled King of Pops relationship with his own three young children, and his defence of sharing his bed with other kids. Bashirs documentary drew huge TV audiences last week in both Britain and on ABC in the United States and prompted calls for Jackson, 44, to be investigated by child welfare authorities. Authorities in California have declined to comment.																								The Fox special, called Take 2; The Interview They Wouldnt Show You, includes footage from Jacksons own cameraman taken over the eight-month period that Bashir spent with Jackson at his Neverland ranch in California, in Berlin and in Las Vegas. 																								Bashir, in his documentary, expressed deep unease about Jacksons relations with his own children.																								But Bashir is shown on Jacksons own tape saying: It almost makes me weep when I see you with them (children) because your interaction with them is just so natural.

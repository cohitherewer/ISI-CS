 Thursday, October 23, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Karaoke kitsch																						 Berlin, Oct. 22 (AFP): Germans are screaming, moaning and panting for the latest nightlife craze  porno karaoke. 																																	Film producers Satt und Durstig organised a premiere in Berlin last month after a successful test run in the northern city of Hamburg and the trend has already spawned imitators in other major cities. 																																	The event follows the rules of traditional karaoke but instead of standing in for Whitney Houston or Frank Sinatra, contestants belt out the parts of adult movie stars. 																																	Players pair off in male-female teams as a XXX film is loaded into the projector. With the sound turned off, each duo is handed two microphones and has one minute to provide the aural fireworks for the action on the screen. 																																	The crowd, which tends to find the show more comic than erotic, then chooses the couple that has given the most convincing, creative and ecstatic performance while faking an orgasm before hundreds of strangers.

The  most recent incident took place in London in June, according  to the suit, which said that at the time of their marriage  Minnellis career had eclipsed, she was an alcoholic, overweight,  (and) unable to be effectively merchandised.																													 																Rogue royal																																	 Tokyo (Reuters): A Japanese prince and princess looked unlikely to live happily ever after when they were arrested on suspicion of defrauding guests of 13 million yen ($117,900) at a fake royal wedding in Tokyo.

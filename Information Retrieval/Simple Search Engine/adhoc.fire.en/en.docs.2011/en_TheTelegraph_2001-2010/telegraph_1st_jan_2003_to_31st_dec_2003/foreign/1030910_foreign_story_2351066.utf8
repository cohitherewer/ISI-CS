 Wednesday, September 10, 2003 				 Blast near Tel Aviv
																								Beer Yaakov (Israel), Sept 9 (Reuters): A Palestinian suicide bomber killed at least four people and wounded 15 outside an Israeli army base near Tel Aviv today in another blow to a collapsing US-backed peace process.																								It was a severe terrorist attack, a spokesperson for the ambulance service told Israeli Channel Two television, which said the bombers body was found at a bus station for soldiers at the entrance to the sprawling Tzrifin army base near Tel Aviv.																								An official in Prime Minister Ariel Sharons office said after the attack that Israel would take the necessary steps to defend its people in the face of the Palestinian Authoritys unwillingness to dismantle Islamic militant groups.																								There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast which left a charred, severed leg in the middle of the road, bloody flesh dangling from the roof of the bus stop and torn clothing scattered about the ground.																								Ahmed Korei, nominated to be the next Palestinian Prime Minister, condemned the bombing and called on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to end a cycle of killing. We condemn all acts of killing that target innocents, whether they be Palestinians or the Israelis who were victims of todays explosion, he said.

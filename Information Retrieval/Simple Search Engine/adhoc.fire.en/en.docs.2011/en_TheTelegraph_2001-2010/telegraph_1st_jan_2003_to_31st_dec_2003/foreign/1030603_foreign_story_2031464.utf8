 Tuesday, June 03, 2003 				 Pak province votes for Shariat
 Peshawar, June 2 (Reuters):  The parliament of a Pakistani province close to Afghanistan  passed a Bill today to implement Shariat, or Islamic law,  and its chief minister said those who failed to observe  it were not welcome there.																								The Bill was approved by the assembly of North West Frontier Province (NWFP), making it the only Pakistani province to take such a step. The assembly is dominated by the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), a six-party Islamic alliance accused by rights groups of trying to emulate Afghanistans former Taliban regime. From today, Shariat will be implemented in the province and there will be no place in the province for those who refuse to follow it, Akram Durrani, the provinces chief minister, told the assembly.																								Under Shariat, judgments are reached based on Islamic teachings and punishments can be severe, including amputations of hands for theft and stoning to death for adultery. Provincial law minister Zafar Azam declined to clarify what the move might entail. But an assembly official said a commission would be established to examine existing laws and bring them into line with Shariat, including its ban on interest-based loans.																								Azam said the provincial government would introduce a new Bill tomorrow to set up a Hasba (or accountability) department to promote religious observance, which critics say is modelled on the Talibans notorious religious police.																								On Saturday, the provincial government passed a directive ordering civil servants to pray five times a day and urging businesses to close at prayer times. It warned of unspecified action against those who failed to obey. Muslims are expected to pray five times a day, but this is not compulsory for government employees elsewhere in Pakistan, even though it is an Islamic state.																								The NWFP came under the control of the Islamic MMA after October elections critics say were manipulated by military President Pervez Musharraf to keep mainstream parties sidelined. Saturdays prayer order follows curbs on the sale of music and videos, destruction of posters featuring women and advertising Western products, and the imposition of a complete ban on alcohol in the NWFP.																								The MMA has also banned music on public transport, medical examinations of women by male doctors, male coaches for women athletes and male journalists from covering womens sports. Such moves are reminiscent of the religious fundamentalism of the Taliban in Afghanistan, overthrown in late 2001 by a US-led military campaign.

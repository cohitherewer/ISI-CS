Bouteuil and her brothers Dyrk and David Hesshaimer told the paper they met Lindbergh periodically when he visited Europe and knew him as Careu Kent but had no contact with his life in America.																													 																Car crazy Rome (Reuters): Italian police have arrested  a deranged man with a grudge against DaimlerChrysler smart  cars after he torched 15 of them in a summer rampage. The  25-year-old set fire to the 15 parked smarts, as well as  15 other cars, in Rome over the past two months, using a  cigarette lighter with a powerful flame, police said. The  damage amounts to almost half a million euros worth. I  cant stand the sight of smart cars, police quoted the  man as saying. He developed the grudge against the compact,  eco-friendly cars after authorities seized two of his own  smarts for traffic and parking offences. Doctors have diagnosed  the man as psychologically unhinged and a danger to society.																													 																Evil energy																																	Berlin (Reuters): If German politicians lack ideas for reforming the countrys struggling healthcare and pensions systems, they can now blame an adverse flow of energy in their workplace.The German parliaments glass dome, a Berlin landmark, makes for bad feng shui, according to an expert in the Chinese art of positioning objects, buildings and furniture. The energy is downright sucked out of MPs heads by the glass dome, feng shui adviser Wilhelm Wuschko told the mass-circulation daily Bild. To keep the energy inside, the dome should be coated with a protective foil, he said. Bild said the office of parliament president Wolfgang Thierse would not comment on the suggestion.

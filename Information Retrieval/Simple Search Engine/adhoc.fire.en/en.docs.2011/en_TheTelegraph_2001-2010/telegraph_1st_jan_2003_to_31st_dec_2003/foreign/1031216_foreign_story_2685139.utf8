 Tuesday, December 16, 2003  Iraq Briefs				 				 				 																$25-m bounty mystery																																	 Baghdad, Dec. 15: Theres no clear word yet on who, if anyone, will get the $25-million bounty promised for information leading to Saddam Husseins capture. But US officials indicated that someone close to the deposed dictators family might be in the money, the Washington Post said today. 																																	The Sunday Times of London said one of the few people in regular contact with Saddam was his second wife, Samira Shahbandar, who had been living in Lebanon with the former leaders only surviving son, Ali, 21. Asked at a news conference about reports that she had led coalition forces to the arrest, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the top US military commander in Iraq, said: Rumours. Next? 																																	Officials offered no detailed information on the role the deposed leaders family played in the tip that led to his hiding place, and they deflected questions on whether the bounty might end up rewarding a betrayal by someone in Saddams family. 																																	Major General Raymond Odierno, commander of the 4th Infantry Division that captured Saddam, said during the past week-and-a-half, US soldiers questioned five to 10 members of families close to Saddam. Finally we got the ultimate information from one of these individuals.																													 																Tikrit trouble Tikrit (Reuters): US soldiers used batons  on Monday to break up a demonstration in Tikrit to protest  against the capture of Saddam Hussein near his hometown,  witnesses said. Scores of people gathered outside Tikrit  university to denounce Saturdays arrest of Saddam, who  was born and captured near the town. God is Greatest, America  is the enemy of all peoples, they shouted with their fists  raised. US soldiers charged the protest, beating and arresting  some protesters.																													 																Saudi scorn																																	 Riyadh (Reuters): Saudi newspapers on Monday said the capture of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein without a shot fired exposed the weakness and hypocrisy of radical Arab leaders. What we saw yesterday was the televised unveiling of 30-year-old lie. A leader surrendered without fighting, the Arab street is stunned, and the Arab media appears to be in a state of shock, wrote Tareq al-Hamed in Saudi daily Asharq al-Awsat. The Arab News said: Hopefully, the pit in which he was concealed is also the grave for all despotism.																													 																																													 																Sunni support Fallujah (AFP): Residents of this Sunni  rebel stronghold west of Baghdad simply found it hard to  believe that Saddam Hussein had finally been captured. They  insisted the announcement was meant to end their resistance  to the coalition and vowed the attacks on occupation forces  will continue. I heard that hes been arrested but these  are lies and I dont believe it, said a vegetable seller.

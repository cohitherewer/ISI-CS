 Wednesday, April 09, 2003 				 Court victory for designer baby parents
																								London, April 8 (Reuters): The parents of a British boy dying from a rare blood disorder won a court appeal today which overturns a ban on their having a so-called designer baby to save the boys life.																								Senior judges rejected an earlier decision which banned the couple from using advanced screening techniques to select an embryo that would eventually provide tissue for their terminally ill son.																								Raj and Shahana Hashmi, from Leeds, northern England, said they were thrilled and would seek the potentially life-saving treatment for their son Zain, four, who has beta thalassaemia, a rare genetic disorder.

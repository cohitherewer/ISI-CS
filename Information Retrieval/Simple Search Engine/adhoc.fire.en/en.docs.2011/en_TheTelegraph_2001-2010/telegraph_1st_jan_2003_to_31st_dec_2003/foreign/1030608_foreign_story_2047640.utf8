 Sunday, June 08, 2003 				 Yangon blames Suu Kyi party for clashes
																								Yangon, June 7 (Reuters): A top Myanmar general blamed the party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi for a deadly clash last week, defying international anger over her detention and undermining efforts by a UN envoy to win her freedom.																								UN envoy to Myanmar Razali Ismail ended a second day of talks in the countrys capital today with no apparent progress in efforts to see Suu Kyi after some of her supporters said she was wounded in the May 30 violence.																								Military intelligence chief Khin Nyunt, in comments published in state media today just before he met Razali, said Suu Kyis National League for Democracy (NLD) was to blame for violence last week in which at least four people were killed.																								The recent course of confrontation taken by the NLD led to creating the untoward incidents, causing a great loss to the state, Khin Nyunt was quoted telling officials at an airport opening ceremony yesterday.																								Corrupt practices and the organisational work of the NLD instigated by foreign nations will not benefit the country.																								Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel peace prize winner, has been held in undisclosed locations since a clash between her supporters and those favouring the junta as she toured a northern town.																								The military says four people died and 50 were injured in the clashes. But dissidents in exile say members of a pro-government group, which had been following Suu Kyis convoy in four trucks, beat to death as many as 75 members of her entourage and local villagers with bamboo and iron bars.																								They also say Suu Kyi received head and shoulder injuries although her car sped off soon after the violence erupted.																								Nyunt held a one-hour meeting today with Razali, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annans envoy to Myanmar, but there was no immediate word on what was discussed.																								After further meetings at the foreign ministry, Razali suggested the junta had not yet agreed to give him access to Suu Kyi. Im still talking to the government, he told reporters.																								Diplomats had said the meeting with Nyunt would be key to whether the junta would grant access to Suu Kyi, who, according to some reports, may have been injured in the clashes.

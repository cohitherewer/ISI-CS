The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, October 31, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Greedy Stones																																	 Toronto, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Canadians shopping for music this Christmas may have to cross the Rolling Stones off their wish list after retailers yanked their products in protest.																																	Major music chains vowed yesterday to keep the bands music off their shelves indefinitely after the Stones made an exclusive deal with US retailer Best Buy Co. Inc. to carry its new four-disc DVD, Four Flicks, due next month. The deal extends to Best Buys Canadian outlets, shutting out other retailers.																																	What have these guys become? said Tim Baker, head buyer for the Sunrise Records chain. Weve been supporting the Rolling Stones for decades and loyalty is a two-way street. To do something like this just smacks of greed.																													 																Cold recipe																																	 Rome (AFP): Ice cream made from liquid nitrogen, the quick freezing chemical element, is the latest feature on the menu on Italys Lake Como, its makers said on Wednesday. Whipped up by an Italian chef and a physicist, the creators of the scoop sold at a lakeside restaurant are seeking patent rights for the idea. Liquid nitrogen, which has a boiling temperature of less than minus 195 degrees Celsius, enables the instant freezing of products. Ettore Bocchia, the chef behind the recipe, said that liquid nitrogen gave food more flavour and meant fewer additives were needed. 																													 																Cult film																																	 Singapore (AFP): It has taken 28 years but Singapore authorities have finally succumbed to the charms of alien transvestite Frank--Furter and approved the screening of one of the worlds most famous cult films, The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The film will get a one-time screening on Saturday at the end of a Halloween festival. The Rocky Horror Picture Show, a musical sci-fi satire centred on sexually ambiguous Frank--Furter, was a cinema flop on its release in 1975 but quickly became a cult with audiences loving the camp humour and addictive soundtrack.

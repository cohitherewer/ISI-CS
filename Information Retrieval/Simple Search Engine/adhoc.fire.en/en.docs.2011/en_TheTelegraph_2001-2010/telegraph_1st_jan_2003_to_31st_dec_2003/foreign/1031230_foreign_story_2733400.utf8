The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Phoenix pledge for city of death
				 	 Quake survivors reach out for a blanket dstributed by a resuce team in Bam. (AFP) 																								Bam, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Irans supreme leader vowed today to return the ancient quake-shattered city of Bam to its former glory, as rescuers wound down the search for survivors of Fridays disaster which killed up to 30,000 people.																								Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate power in the Islamic Republic of 66 million people, flew to Bam, 1,000 km southeast of the capital, Tehran, and pledged to rebuild the Silk Road city. We share your sorrow, those lost are our children. We will rebuild Bam stronger than before, he said, addressing a crowd in one of the citys devastated squares.																								In a rare moment of joy, officials said a six-month old girl had been rescued from the rubble of a flattened building. The infant, Nassim, was found in the arms of her dead mother. Rescuers said her mothers embrace had shielded the child from falling debris and saved her life.																								The quake was the worlds deadliest in at least a decade. Aid offers have poured in from around the globe including from arch foe the US which severed ties with Iran quarter of a century ago.																								But with some 25,000 victims already buried and virtually no habitable buildings left standing in Bam, survivors were leaving the city in droves.																								Sohrab Mohammadabadi, 46, who works as a driver, had packed a refrigerator, luggage and carpets on top of his car. My house has been destroyed. Im going to Rostamabad, about 3 km away, to stay with relatives, he said.																								As darkness fell on the city, people huddled around open fires in front of the rubble where their homes once stood. Street lights illuminated patches of the city as power began to return.																								Tahereh Taherian, a 45-year-old housewife, said she had lost 60 family members in the quake. God is testing us, she said. Im thanking God because one of our sons has been left alive.																								Many international rescue teams had begun packing up their sophisticated equipment by dusk today, concluding no-one could still be alive beneath the ravaged city. The first phase is over, said Thomas Krimm, spokesman of Germanys THW disaster relief organisation.																								That means the search and rescue teams are winding down their activities, although they are ready to engage if they get new indications from the local population. Its just that the chance of finding someone alive is steadily falling.																								Round-the-clock relief efforts have been hindered by piles of bodies in the streets, overflowing cemeteries, bitterly cold nights, rain, aftershocks and looting. I believe the toll will reach 30,000, said a government official.																								The judiciary announced it was setting up a court in the area to bring swift justice to armed bandits, seen prowling the streets, and other criminals. Armed looters have been stealing tents and blankets meant for quake victims.																								President Mohammad Khatami also arrived in Bam to see the devastation which many have blamed on poor government planning and shoddy building standards.																								The scale of the catastrophe is so big that whatever has been done is not yet sufficient, he told reporters. I hope more and more aid will arrive in coming hours. Khatami has appealed for help from anywhere but Israel. Iran rejected offers of international assistance when a quake killed 36,000 in 1990.																								A US Air Force C-130 Hercules landed in Kerman, near Bam, with a delivery of American aid yesterday, the first US flight into Iran since the Iranian hostage crisis ended in 1981.																								Washington broke ties with Iran after the U.S. embassy was stormed in 1979 and 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days. President George W. Bush last year included Iran in the axis of evil while Iranian clerics often refer to the US as the Great Satan.																								But for the residents of Bam, help was welcome from any quarter. When our own government cannot help, let the Great Satan help us. We pay taxes and yet in cases like this, there is no-one to help us, said Abbas Barkhordar, 45, who lost his entire family in the quake. Egypt breaks ice																								The Egyptian government has sent four planeloads of relief supplies to earthquake survivors in Iran, in a move towards reconciliation a quarter century after the two countries broke off diplomatic relations.																								The first two Egyptian relief planes left early on Saturday. A third took off on Sunday with tents, blankets and medicines, and a fourth arrived in Tehran today, the official Egyptian news agency MENA reported.

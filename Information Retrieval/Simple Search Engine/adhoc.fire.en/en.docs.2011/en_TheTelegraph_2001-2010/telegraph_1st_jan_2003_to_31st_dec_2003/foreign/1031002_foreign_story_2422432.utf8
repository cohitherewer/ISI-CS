 Thursday, October 02, 2003 				 Indonesia officials in Pak to grill students
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Oct. 1: A team of Indonesian investigators arrived in Karachi today to interrogate six detained Indonesian students for links to the al Qaida.																								The team consisting of investigators and officials arrived this morning and met their Pakistani counterpart and the detained students, an Indonesia consulate official said in Karachi. 																								The meeting with the detained students was held at a secret location in Karachi. The students were arrested from religious seminaries last week due to their links to the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). Among those arrested was Rusman Gunawan, younger brother of Hambali, the alleged mastermind of the Bali bombings. Hambali was arrested in Thailand in August and is currently in US custody. 																								Pakistani intelligence officials suspect the students may be part of a sleeper cell of the Jemaah Islamiyah, the al Qaida-linked southeast Asian terror network blamed for a string of deadly terrorist attacks in Indonesia. 																								Pakistani officials investigating the detained students hope to gather more information through interrogation with the help of the Indonesian team. With the help of the Indonesian officials, the investigators may may be able to establish the link between the JI and detained students, a senior Pakistani official said. None of the arrested students has so far been charged with any offence but their arrest was followed by a clampdown on 77 seminaries.

Mail menace																																	 London (Reuters): Misuse of e-mails and the Internet in the workplace has become a big headache for British employers, and UK companies are increasingly disciplining staff for accessing racy websites or sending porn to colleagues. Nearly one in three British companies have disciplined staff for breaking company Internet and e-mail rules in the past year. Several companies have begun drafting codes of conduct in an effort to regulate employees use of high-speed Net connections. One e-mail filtering specialist, Clearswift Ltd of Reading, has introduced Image Manager, a software product that scans outgoing e-mails for flesh-coloured images, thus stopping suspected pornographic images from entering or leaving the corporate network.

The case is unique and a possible violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, said fertility law expert Mark Rothstein. A doctor cannot refuse to do a procedure because a woman is blind or place new conditions on continuing treatments, said Rothstein, a professor at the University of Louisville Institute of bioethics, health and law.																																	 her lawsuit, Kijuana Chambers said the clinic performed three rounds of artificial insemination in 1999, then stopped when she refused to hire an occupational therapist to evaluate the safety of her home.

Additions to the existing draft include recognising womens considerable role in Afghan society, safeguarding womens property rights, and prohibiting cultures and customs against the dignity, welfare or interest of women.

(Reuters)																								New York, March 12: The rumours, it turns out, were true. In 1994, the remaining Beatles, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, reunited for a laid-back recording session that never saw the light of day  until yesterday.																								Footage of the trio performing the five songs  Baby What You Want Me to Do, Raunchy, Thinking of Linking, Blue Moon of Kentucky and Aint She Sweet  made its world premiere yesterday at the New York Library for the Performing Arts at a news conference to announce plans for the release of The Beatles Anthology DVD box set. 																								On Baby What You Want Me to Do, McCartney and Harrison are playing ukuleles, while Starr hits his legs to provide the percussion, as they all sit on a lawn. They play the rest of the tracks in a studio.																								The footage from the session will be included in the box set, which hits stores on April 1, but can be seen at the Performing Arts library starting March 28. However, Neil Aspinall, managing director of Apple Corps Ltd., which handles The Beatles business affairs, said there are no plans to release the songs as a new Beatles album. In a never-before-seen interview from 1994 included in the box set, Harrison said The Beatles were a quartet and that without John Lennon, the band no longer existed. 																								We werent going to get Roger Waters and go out as The Beatles, Harrison said.																								Aspinall did say, though, that about 50 to 60 hours of unreleased Beatles material had recently been discovered in The Netherlands and Australia and songs from those 1960s-era sessions will likely be made public, perhaps on the remastered Let It Be, tentatively scheduled for release late this year. 																								With The Beatles, there always seem to be surprises, Aspinall said. We keep finding things.					 THE LOS ANGELES TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 President race in 2008 on Hillarys radar 
				 	 Clinton																								Berlin, Nov. 26 (AFP): With a smile, Hillary Clinton suggested that she may run for US President in 2008 but will stay out of the campaign for next years polls in an interview with a german magazine released today. 																								Asked by Bunte magazine why she was not standing in 2004, a race already well under way, the New York Senator said she was happy with her current job. But on being told that people in the US were disappointed that she was not running, Hillary said: I know. Well, perhaps Ill do it next time around, she replied.																								The former First Lady has repeatedly denied she is contemplating standing for the Democratic nomination for next years election. 																								However, that has not stopped the speculation.																								She is widely thought to hold ambitions for the 2008 race.																								A Newsweek survey in September showed her to be a preferred choice for more Democrat voters than any other candidate who will stand against President George W. Bush.

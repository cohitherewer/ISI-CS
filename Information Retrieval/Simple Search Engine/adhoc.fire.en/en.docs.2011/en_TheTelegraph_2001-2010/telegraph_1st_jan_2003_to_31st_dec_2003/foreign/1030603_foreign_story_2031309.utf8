The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, June 03, 2003 				 Bush bubbles over, Chirac chill melts 
				 	 French President Jacques Chirac with US President George W. Bush during the G8 summit in Evian on Monday. (Reuters)  Evian, June 2 (Reuters):  Presidents George W. Bush and Jacques Chirac, trying to  patch up US-French relations after a deep rift over the  Iraq war, spoke warm words of support for each other today  in subtly different accents.																								After their chilly first handshake yesterday, Bush bubbled over with personal praise for his fiercest critic while Chirac  host to the Group of Eight summit that brought them together  voiced full support for Bushs West Asia peace plan. Both Bush and Chirac described today mornings G8 session on the world economy as very positive and the US leader said they both agreed how to move forward in Iraq. 																								We can have disagreements but that doesnt mean we have to be disagreeable to each other, Bush told reporters as they sat on a hotel terrace at this French spa overlooking Lake Geneva.																								The two men appeared more relaxed than at the start of today mornings G8 session, when Chirac efforted conversation with the US leader seated at his left while Bush sat rigidly and gave only clipped replies. 																								The summit was the first opportunity for the two to ease their differences, after Chirac raised US wrath by leading a non-nyet-nein anti-war front with Russia and Germany and tongue-lashed East European states for backing Washington. Clearly there still are some differences the US has with France, a senior Bush administration official said. Nevertheless, France and the US have been allies and partners many a time before, the official said. Todays meeting was about finding common ground. 																								Bush, who left the summit today to attend peace talks in West Asia, made a point of praising Chirac as an expert on the turbulent region  where France often tries to present Europe as an alternative to the US. 																								Today Im going to meet with Jacques and ask his advice on West Asia, he said, referring to a meeting he was about to start with Chirac. Hes a man who knows a lot about West Asia, hes got good judgment on West Asia.																								Chirac was more reserved, avoiding any such direct personal praise for Bush, but expressing his total support for the US Presidents efforts to bring peace to West Asia. Of course, we regret that he has to leave earlier than planned, but it is for a cause that we are all profoundly attached to  peace in West Asia, Chirac said.																								Chirac avoided any mention of the US-French rift, which has cast a lingering pall over the summit and led to speculation Bush was cutting short his stay as a deliberate snub to Chirac.																								During their 25-minute talk, a US official said, Chirac also refrained from his usual call for a multipolar world, which rattles Washington because it is a French codeword for a world where US power is held in check through the UN.

																								London, Nov. 27 (Reuters): British police hunting for international terrorists detained two men today, one of whom is believed to have connections with al Qaida and whose arrest could be pretty big according to a security source.																								Officers from Britains anti-terror branch arrested a 24-year-old man in the western town of Gloucester and said they had evacuated the surrounding area as they hunted for explosives.																								It could be pretty big in the sense that if we find what we suspect we are looking for, then we have got something big, a security source said. The police said the man, British-born of Asian origin, had been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. 																								Home secretary David Blunkett said: It is believed by the security and special branch services that this man has connections with the network of al Qaida groups.

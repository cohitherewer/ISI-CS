 Tuesday, August 05, 2003 				 Cherie poised to be sound of the summer
 															- UK first  ladys singing skills dazzle britons 				 	 Cherie Blair at Tsinghua University in Beijing. (AP) London, Aug. 4 (Reuters):  The singing skills of Cherie Blair, the wife of Britains  Prime Minister, are this summer dazzling Britons on the  dance floor.																								Cherie stepped in to help her husband Tony Blair when he was asked to sing during a grilling by Chinese students in Beijing last month on the case for war in Iraq.																								She rattled off a verse from the Beatles classic, When Im 64. 																								Now her effort has been worked into a dance track which is proving a hit with British holidaymakers in popular resorts like Ibiza in Spain and Ayia Napa in Cyprus, the Independent newspaper said today.																								The tune has taken off in a big way in the nightclubs all over Europe, a music industry source told the paper.																								It was treated as a joke but its now a big favourite on the dancefloor. Its hilarious to think it but Cherie could become the sound of the summer.																								The track made it onto the turntables after it was mailed anonymously to key figures in the dance scene, the paper said.

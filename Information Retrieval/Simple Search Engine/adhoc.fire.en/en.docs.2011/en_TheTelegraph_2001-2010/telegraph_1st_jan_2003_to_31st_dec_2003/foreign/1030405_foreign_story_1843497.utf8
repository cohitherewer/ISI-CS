 Saturday, April 05, 2003 				 Taliban base seized
																								Spin Boldak (Afghanistan), April 4 (Reuters): Afghan and US forces have seized a Taliban mountain base in south-western Afghanistan, killing eight Taliban and taking 15 prisoners, a US spokesman said today.																								The US deployed massive air power against dozens of Taliban fighters in the Tor Ghar mountain area of Kandahar province, dropping at least 35,000 pounds of ordnance after a US special forces unit came under fire on Wednesday.																								Afghan officials said the operation, which involved 600 government militiamen, was aimed at rooting out Taliban fighters who appear to have stepped up activities since the start of the Iraq war and the traditional spring fighting season.

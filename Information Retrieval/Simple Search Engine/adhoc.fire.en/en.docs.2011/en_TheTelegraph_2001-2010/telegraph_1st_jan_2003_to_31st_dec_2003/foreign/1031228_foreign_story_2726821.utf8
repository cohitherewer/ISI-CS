 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Suspected SARS case mars China festive spirit
																								Beijing, Dec. 27 (Reuters): Doctors in China tested a man suspected of having SARS today as neighbouring Hong Kong stepped up checks on travellers to avert another outbreak of the deadly virus ahead of the regions biggest holiday.																								Chinas first suspected Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome patient since the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the world SARS-free in July was in hospital in southern Guangdong province where the disease first emerged in late 2002.																								We have heard from a hospital that there is a suspected SARS patient in Guangdong, a provincial health bureau official said.																								After appearing in Guangdong late last year, SARS was spread by travellers and went on to infect 8,000 people in nearly 30 countries, killing about 800 and ravaging many Asian economies.																								If confirmed, the Guangdong case would be the first one globally not linked to laboratory accidents since the WHO declared the outbreak over.																								News of the possible new SARS case comes just weeks before the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday when there is a mass movement of people within China and across East and Southeast Asia.																								Hong Kong, a former British colony and hub for global travellers, stepped up checks on visitors from southern China after being told of the suspected case yesterday.																								Hong Kong health director Lam Ping-yan identified the patient as a freelance television station worker from booming Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong. The patient and those who have close contact with him are now being isolated and samples are being tested in the laboratory, Chinas Xinhua news agency quoted Lam as saying, adding the patient had not travelled outside China recently.																								WHO spokesman Peter Cordingley said the UN health agency had been informed about the case of a 32-year-old man.																								They told us...they had a suspected SARS case in a hospital in Guangzhou, that he developed classical SARS symptoms like a headache and fever on December 16, Cordingley said from Manila.It does not yet match our lab definitions of SARS. Were waiting for the results of further tests.																								China Central Television said the patient had had a normal temperature for the last three days and was stable.																								Global health officials have been watching for a resurgence of SARS since the start of the northern winter. Two recent cases in Singapore and Taiwan were linked to accidents in medical research laboratories.																								Xinhua said the patient was first diagnosed with pneumonia and quarantined. It said he was receiving medical checks and authorities were investigating the mans claim he had eaten no wild animals, believed to be a source of the disease, recently.																								All hospitals in Beijing should strengthen monitoring and examinations for fever cases, especially from Guangdong, Xinhua quoted a Beijing municipal health bureau official as saying.																								Guo Jiyong, deputy director of the bureau, had led a team to check the citys airports and railway stations, it said.																								Guo said all municipal entry-exit inspection and quarantine departments should strengthen temperature screening systems and send any travellers with a body temperature over 38 degrees Celsius to government-designated hospitals, Xinhua said.																								Most scientists say SARS is likely to have spread from farms in southern China, possibly jumping from animals such as civet cats, ducks, pigs and rats to humans.																								Chinas health ministry recently told health workers nationwide they would be punished if they failed to report SARS cases, aimed at avoiding a repeat of a SARS cover-up this year that sparked widespread international criticism.																								Taiwan also said it was watching the Guangdong case closely because people across the Taiwan Strait communicate very frequently, Shih Wen-yi, director of Taiwans centre for disease control, said.

 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 China orgy trial rolls
																								Beijing, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Fourteen Chinese accused of organising an orgy involving hundreds of Japanese visitors around the anniversary of Japans invasion of China went on trial today in a case that has sparked public outrage.																								Security was tight in and around the Peoples Intermediate Court in southern Zhuhai, with police standing by to prevent anti-Japanese protests, underlining the sensitivity of the case.																								The 14 defendants, mostly suspected pimps, went on trial behind closed doors. It was unclear how they pleaded, but they face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of organising prostitution.																								The scandal has sparked outrage in China, particularly on the Internet, and embarrassed Beijing and Tokyo, close trading partners that have shown signs of growing diplomatic solidarity in the face of the North Korean nuclear crisis. 																								The verdict was expected on Saturday.																								State media said the two-day orgy at a five-star hotel in the coastal city of Zhuhai in Guangdong province in September involved about 400 Japanese tourists and 500 Chinese prostitutes. The incident sparked fury in China particularly because it ended on September 18, the 72nd anniversary of the start of Japans occupation of the northeast.																								No Japanese has been indicted in the case so far, drawing angry comments on the bulletin board of Web site www.sina.com.cn. Why were those who went whoring not on trial? one said. Chinese should unite and boycott Japanese goods, said another.																								Prostitution is technically illegal in China but has become rife in the past two decades after economic reforms brought prosperity to the once impoverished country. 																								The defendants included two executives of the Zhuhai International Conference Centre Hotel, where state media says the orgy took place. 																								The 22-storey hotel had been closed for about two months and reopened in early December, a spokesperson said.																								The Chinese foreign ministry called the incident odious, but the government is eager to avert diplomatic fallout and has not fanned anti-Japanese sentiment.

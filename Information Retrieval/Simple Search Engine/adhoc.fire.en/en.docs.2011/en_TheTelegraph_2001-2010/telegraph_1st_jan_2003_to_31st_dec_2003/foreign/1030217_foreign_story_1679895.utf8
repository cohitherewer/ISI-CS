 Monday, February 17, 2003 				 Six Hamas members killed in blast
 SHAHDI AL-KASHIF																								Gaza, Feb. 16 (Reuters): At least six Palestinian members of Hamas were killed today in a blast near Gaza City which the militant Islamic group blamed on Israel and vowed to avenge.																								Two more Palestinians were killed in the West Bank city of Nablus during clashes which erupted during an Israeli army raid to arrest a high-ranking official in the Palestine Liberation Organisation, witnesses said.																								Witnesses in Gaza said a car laden with explosives blew up inside a farm in the al-Zeitun neighbourhood, known as a Hamas stronghold, just one day after a Hamas landmine gutted an Israeli tank and killed its four crewmen in north Gaza.																								Hamas officials blamed the car explosion on Israel, saying they believed its members had received a package which was detonated by remote control from a pilotless drone flying in the area. The army had no immediate comment.																								The boot of the vehicle had been ripped apart and blood covered the ground near a group of farm sheds surrounded by cinder block walls. Two people were wounded in the blast.

 Friday, October 10, 2003 				 US unveils new colour of money
																								New York, Oct. 9 (Reuters): The first US currency note with colours other than green and black went into circulation today with the purchase of three I Love New York T-shirts in bustling Times Square.																								In a nationwide promotion billed The New Color of Money: Safer, Smarter, More Secure, government officials said the newly designed $20 note with subtle background shades of green, peach and blue would be more difficult to counterfeit.																								Casildo Caballero, a vendor on the corner of 42nd Street and 7th Avenue who took one of the new bills from US federal reserve official Marsha Reidhill for three T-shirts, said he was impressed.																								Its colorful, its different... Id like to see them counterfeit this one, its going to be a lot of work to do that, Caballero told a throng of reporters, photographers and TV crews. US government officials and business, banking and civic leaders conducted transactions with the new notes in 30 US cities today. The new design was unveiled in May.																								In Washington, the new note made its debut at a post office when an official from the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing bought a book of stamps. Michael Stenger, special agent in charge of the US Secret Services Washington field office, said criminals look to get as much bang for the buck as they can. As the costs (of counterfeiting) rise, and the exposure to arrest rise, they tend not to take that road down a criminal path.

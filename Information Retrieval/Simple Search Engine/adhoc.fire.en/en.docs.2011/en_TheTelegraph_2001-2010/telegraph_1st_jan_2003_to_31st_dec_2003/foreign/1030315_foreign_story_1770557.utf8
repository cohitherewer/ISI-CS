 Saturday, March 15, 2003 				 Tabloid muzzled in China
																								Beijing, March 14 (Reuters): China suspended publication of a top weekly news tabloid today after it printed politically sensitive articles and defied the Communist Partys propaganda department, editors and reporters said.																								The 21st Century World Herald was shut for publishing articles comparing Chinas retiring leaders with a younger generation taking the reins of power this weekend, said a senior newspaper editor who declined to be identified.																								The tabloid, based in the southern city of Guangzhou and affiliated with the popular weekly Southern Weekend, also published articles on the nuclear standoff between the US and North Korea which ignored propaganda department orders that reports conform with the government position, he said. 																								A 21st Century World Herald official said the newspaper was redesigning the layout. 																								Also in recent days, the magazine China Newsweek sacked its two top editors after the glossy published an article reviewing the career of outgoing Premier Zhu Rongji.

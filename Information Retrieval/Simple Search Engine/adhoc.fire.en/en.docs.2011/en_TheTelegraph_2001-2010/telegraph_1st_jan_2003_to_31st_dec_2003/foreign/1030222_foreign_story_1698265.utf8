 Saturday, February 22, 2003 				 Grammys beckon Simon and Garfunkel
																								Los Angeles, Feb. 21 (Reuters): Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel have built a bridge over their troubled waters and may even sing at the Grammy Awards on Sunday in their first public performance together in 10 years.																								A spokesman for Simon said the two  who often had strained relations  sang together in a private setting on Wednesday, uniting for the first time since 1993.																								They got together yesterday and had a wonderful time. They got together as two great old friends and sang for the first time since 1993. Theyre thinking of performing at the Grammys, but theyre not sure if they have enough time, the spokesman said.																								Sources close to the situation said the two were to meet the award shows writer-producer Ken Ehrlich at Madison Square Garden, where rehearsals for the show were getting underway. 																								Neither Ehrlich or a spokesman for Cossette Production, the company producing the Grammys were available for comment.																								Simon and Garfunkel, considered the most successful folk-rock duo of the 1960s for creating such enduring hits as Sounds of Silence and Bridge Over Troubled Water, will get a Lifetime Achievement Award this week from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the host of the Grammys.																								The award, honouring their work, will be presented at a special pre-Grammy ceremony on Saturday night and will again be mentioned during the CBS telecast, beginning at 8 pm.																								Arts really excited about getting the award with his friend, a spokesman for Garfunkel said.																								Sundays Grammy ceremony is the first to be held in New York since 1998 and is expected to focus around the theme of New York City, which is why an appearance by Simon and Garfunkel, both native New Yorkers, would be particularly poignant.																								Other performances are expected by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, No Doubt, James Taylor, Yo-Yo Ma, Eminem, Norah Jones and Avril Lavigne.																								Simon and Garfunkel met as kids in the New York borough of Queens and released their first record in the late 1950s, calling themselves Tom amp; Jerry.																								They scored a hit with their first single, Hey Schoolgirl, but follow-up efforts floundered and they split up. They reteamed and released an initially unsuccessful debut acoustic album as Simon amp; Garfunkel in 1964 before splitting up again.																								But a year later, their producer overlaid their strongest song, Sounds Of Silence with Beatles-style electric guitars and drums and it became a huge hit.																								As their success grew, their partnership weakened with growing creative tensions, particularly as Simon, who penned most of the songs, began to feel constrained by working with the same collaborator and as Garfunkel began to feel overshadowed by Simons songwriting talents.																								They split around 1970 as their landmark album Bridge Over Troubled Water was released. They have reunited a few times since then, including in 1981 for a concert in New Yorks Central Park, attracting half-a-million people, and also toured in the early 1980s.

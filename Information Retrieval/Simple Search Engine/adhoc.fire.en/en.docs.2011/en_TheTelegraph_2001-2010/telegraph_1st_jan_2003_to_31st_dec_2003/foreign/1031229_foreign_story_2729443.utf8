The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Tragedy brings foes to talks table
 							 - Focus shifts from search for survivors to aid for the living				 	 A child in front of a tent in Bam on Sunday. (AFP)  Crawford (Texas), Dec. 28  (Reuters): High level US and Iranian officials put aside  diplomatic differences to directly discuss humanitarian  aid after the earthquake that killed tens of thousands of  Iranians, a state department official said. 																								Spokesperson Lou Fintor said the discussion took place in a phone call between deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage and Irans permanent representative to the UN, Mohammad Javad Zarif. 																								Given the urgency of the situation we deemed direct contact to be the most appropriate channel, Fintor said.																								The White House said earlier the US would send government and civilian emergency workers and 150,000 pounds of medical supplies to Iran following the quake that razed much of the ancient Silk Road city of Bam and killed about 20,000 people.																								White House spokeperson Scott McClellan said in a statement that the US was working with Iranian authorities, the UN and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent.																								Washington broke relations with the Islamic republic after students stormed the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. 																								President George W. Bush, in his 2002 State of the Union speech, branded Iran as part of an axis of evil. 																								But he offered condolences to the families of the dead and injured on Friday and promised the US would provide humanitarian aid.																								US officials usually communicate with Tehran through intermediaries, often channeling messages through Swiss diplomats. 																								Fintor played down the diplomatic significance of the direct contacts with Iran.																								There is no political angle. There is a humanitarian catastrophe in Iran and our only mission is to alleviate the human suffering associated with the earthquake, he said.																								Irans quick acceptance of help contrasts with its rejection in 1990 of outside doctors, workers, blood supplies, sniffer dogs and used clothes after an earthquake claimed 36,000 lives and injured 100,000 people.

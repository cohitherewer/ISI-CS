 Tuesday, October 14, 2003 				 Team McCartney rallies for Stella
 HILARY ALEXANDER				 	 Stella McCartney at the fashion show in Paris. (AFP) Paris, Oct. 13: There was  a strong show of family unity at Stella McCartneys spring/summer  2004 show on the final day of the Paris prt--porter season  yesterday. 																								Her father, Paul, arrived with his heavily-pregnant wife, the former Heather Mills, who is due to give birth to the couples first child in five weeks.																								Heather McCartney, wearing an optical-print tunic with Stella McCartney jeans and a burgundy felt Homberg, said: Paul and I know whether the babys a boy or girl, but we havent told anyone. Not even my parents.																								Also in the home team were Stellas sister, Mary McCartney-Donald, who photographed the show from her front row seat, Stellas publisher husband, Alasdhair Willis, the artist Sam Taylor-Wood and her husband, Jay Jopling, and the singer Sharleen Spiteri.																								The collection, said Stella, was all about movement.																								And it literally floated down the runway with butterfly dresses in layered, colour-shaded chiffon being wafted gracefully around the models bodies by a convenient wind machine.																								Although the designer said she didnt think her recent marriage had changed her approach to her work just yet, there was definitely a more romantic, ethereal quality to her clothes. 																								The colour palette shaded like a sunset from deep to light greens, from dove grey to blue, lemon and shell-pink.																								Everything was light and airy, from the fragile bodices tethered with tiny straps to the loose sleeves which wafted like wings and the dip-and-dive hemlines.																								Her most revolutionary statement, however, was with her swimwear; two-piece bikinis in dove-grey or pink, featuring a tiny, triangle top allied to high-rise, big knickers.																								Stella McCartney took her bow, wearing her sexy new jeans which, sadly, did not appear on the runway.																								Long, slim and slightly flared, they feature an attached denim pelmet skirt at the rear.																								It was fabulous. I loved it all. So feminine and pretty. I wish it was available right now, because some of those dresses would be great with my belly, Heather McCartney said.																								Shes fabulous, isnt she, said a beaming Paul McCartney. She just goes from strength to strength.																								The colours were beautiful, the ideas were original and I just felt the whole collection had a new maturity.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

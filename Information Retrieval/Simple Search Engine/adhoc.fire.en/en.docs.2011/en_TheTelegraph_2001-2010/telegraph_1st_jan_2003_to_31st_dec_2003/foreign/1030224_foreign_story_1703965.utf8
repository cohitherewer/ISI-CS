War fears																																	 Berlin (Reuters): American actor George Clooney stepped up his criticism of George W. Bushs administration today, saying he feared a war against Iraq was inevitable but would ultimately only lead to more violence. Americas policies frustrate me, he said in a German television programme. I think a war against Iraq is as unavoidable as it is senseless. I think its coming. But I also think the real danger is going to be what happens after it. Clooney, who in interviews with European newspapers has accused Bush of war-mongering, is on a growing list of Hollywood celebrities to speak out against war.

 Monday, May 26, 2003 				 Australian governor quits
				 	 Peter Hollingworth																								Canberra, May 25 (Reuters): The British queens envoy to Australia submitted his resignation today after intense public pressure to quit following two sex scandals from his clergyman past.																								Governor-General Peter Hollingworth, a former Anglican archbishop, faced claims he protected a paedophile priest in the 1990s and public anger over a 40-year-old, unproven rape case. The case was dismissed last week. Hollingworth, 68, said it was clear controversy from the unwarranted allegations could undermine the office that represents Queen Elizabeth as head of state in the former British colony. It is with deep regret and after much thought that I today advised the Prime Minister that I wish to resign from office, he said.

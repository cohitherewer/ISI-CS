 Saturday, May 17, 2003 				 Claudia lets church journal publish nuptial snap
				 	 Claudia Schiffer																								London, May 16 (AP): After going to considerable lengths to prevent the paparazzi from getting photos of her wedding last year to filmmaker Matthew Vaughan, Claudia Schiffer has given a church magazine a scoop by allowing it to publish an exclusive picture of the nuptials.																								Schiffer, who owns a mansion near Shimpling in Englands eastern Suffolk county, where the wedding took place, has allowed the local diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich to use a photo in its annual review. Given the secrecy that surrounded Schiffers marriage... I was thrilled when Claudia agreed to give us a picture of her special day to use in the magazine, said Nick Clarke, the diocesan communications director. The scoop figures to be a rarity. The diocese is printing 1,500 copies of the magazine, which is about three per parish.																								Catherine Zeta Jones, whose marriage to Michael Douglas was also shrouded in secrecy, sold the exclusive wedding coverage rights to OK! magazine for $1 million after turning down a similar offer from Hello magazine.																								Schiffer and Vaughan were married on May 25, 2002, at St Georges church in Shimpling in a ceremony that was shielded from the public gaze. Assistants held blankets to hide the model from about 100 people who gathered as she left the Swan Hotel for the church.																								Celebrities who attended the event included Madonna and her director husband Guy Ritchie as well as retired tennis star Boris Becker and the designer Valentino.																								, who created Schiffers wedding gown.

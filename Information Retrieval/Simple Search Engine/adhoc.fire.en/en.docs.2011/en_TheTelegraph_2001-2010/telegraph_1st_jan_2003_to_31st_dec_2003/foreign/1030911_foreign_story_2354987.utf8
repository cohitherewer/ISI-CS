The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, September 11, 2003 				 Madonna in a publishing first
																								London, Sept. 10 (Reuters): Harry Potter taught kids around the world the joy of reading. Now Madonna is going global in the thriving kids book business with a publishing first.																								The pop superstars first childrens book  The English Roses  is being published simultaneously next Monday in more than 100 countries and 30 languages.																								State-of-the-art technology has sent language barriers tumbling so printing plants around the world can spring into action in every tongue from French to Faroese. This is a publishing first with regard to numbers of languages and territories, said Nicholas Callaway, president of the Callaway Editions, the originating publisher, who has co-ordinated the global release. We have languages as varied as Chinese and Czech, Thai and Turkish, Hebrew and Hungarian, he said.																								This would not have been possible 18 months ago. We send so many digital files through the Internet, Callaway added.																								More than one million copies are hitting bookstores around the world next week, backed by a marketing blitz that takes Madonna from London to Paris and then on to the Oprah Winfrey talk show in the United States.																								As the hype builds, Callaway is the first to pay tribute to JK Rowling, whose five wizard sagas have broken publishing records.																								Everyone owes a great debt to Harry Potter for introducing a new generation worldwide to the magic of childrens books, he said.Interest in childrens books is on the rise and thankfully we are part of that trend.																								Critics may carp at the spotlight focusing on Madonna, a genius at both spotting and setting pop and fashion trends.																								Helen Fraser, managing director of Penguin Books who will be publishing the book in Britain, concedes that cynics will grumble about hype as the 45-year-old mother of two bursts into print after years as a raunchy pop star.																								Whenever somebody as famous as Madonna does something, cynics will use theH (Hype) word, she told Reuters.																								In the now-standard childrens blockbuster tradition, details of the plot have been kept strictly secret.																								But Fraser insists that the book  the first of five written by Madonna for kids  willappeal to people from eight to 80 which is the ideal range for publishers.																								And she agreed that childrens books were now the industrys big success story.It is suddenly an area that big companies are concentrating on. Now people realise it can be very exciting and that the very successful childrens books are read by adults.																								A spokesman for the Nielsen BookScan research agency which monitors over 140,000 titles a week, said in Britain alone, the value of childrens book sales has risen 40.5 percent in the first eight months of 2003 compared with last year. Kids books now make up 16 percent of the British market.																								That point was rammed home on Tuesday when Bloomsbury Publishing, Potters British publisher, reported a 14 percent rise in first-half profits.																								This publishing phenomenon continues to grow in size and value, said Chairman Nigel Newton.

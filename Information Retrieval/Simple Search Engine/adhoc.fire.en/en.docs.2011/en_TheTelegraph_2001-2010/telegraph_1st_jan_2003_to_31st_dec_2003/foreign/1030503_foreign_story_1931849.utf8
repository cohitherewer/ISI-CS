The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, May 03, 2003 				 Labour takes a knock 
 London, May 2 (Reuters):  Prime Minister Tony Blairs Labour Party took a knock today  in British local elections, but any Baghdad backlash against  his decision to wage war on Iraq appeared unlikely to dent  his supremacy.																								Blairs main political opponent, Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, seized control in 600 of the 10,000 local government seats up for grabs in England, a stronger showing for his struggling party than many had predicted. 																								But a senior Conservative ruined his celebrations by resigning on Thursday night and twisting the knife in Duncan Smiths back by saying he had virtually no chance of reversing Blairs successive landslide general election victories.																								We carry the handicap of a leader whom Conservatives...feel unable to present to the electorate as a credible alternative Prime Minister, industry spokesman Crispin Blunt declared.																								Nearly 40 million people were eligible to vote in the polls, for parliaments in Scotland and Wales and local councils in England yesterday, the sixth anniversary of the day Blairs Labour Party stormed to power in 1997. Turnout for the council elections was barely one in three.																								Conservatives won around 35 per cent of the vote in England, two percentage points up from the last time the same seats were contested in England, in 1999, but political analysts said it would not translate into major general election gains.																								Labour took 30 per cent, six points down.

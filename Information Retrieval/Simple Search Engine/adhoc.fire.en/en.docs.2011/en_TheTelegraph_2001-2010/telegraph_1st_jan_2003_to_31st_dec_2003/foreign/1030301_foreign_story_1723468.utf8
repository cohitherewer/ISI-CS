 Saturday, March 01, 2003 				 Pak unsure over UN council vote
																								Islamabad, Feb. 28 (Reuters): Pakistan, an Islamic nation that supports the US war on terror, said today that it had not decided which way to vote on the Iraq resolution in the UN Security Council and that all options for peace should be explored.																								Envoys from both the US and Iraq separately called on President Gen. Pervez Musharraf today to explain their stances and seek Pakistans support.																								We are looking at the situation and we have not taken any decision, a spokesman for Islamabads foreign ministry, Tariq Usman Haider, told an earlier news briefing on the Security Council resolution, which could pave the way to war.																								Pakistan is one of 10 non-permanent members of the 15-member Security Council, which held its first meeting yesterday on the resolution brought by the US, Britain and Spain saying that Saddam Hussein had failed to disarm.																								Adoption of a Security Council resolution needs a minimum of nine votes in favour and no veto from any of its five permanent members, the US, Britain, Russia, France and China. No vote is expected for about two weeks.																								Haider said visiting US assistant secretary of state Christina Rocca had sought Pakistans support.

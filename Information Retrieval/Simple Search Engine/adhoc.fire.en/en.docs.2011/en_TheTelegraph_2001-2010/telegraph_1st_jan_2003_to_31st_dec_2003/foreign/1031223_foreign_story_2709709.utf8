The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Mel and Julia move up
				 	 Julia Roberts in a scene from her new film Mona Lisa Smile. (AFP) Houston, Dec. 22 (PTI):  Mel Gibson tops the list of Americas favourite movie stars  and Julia Roberts who was at the third position last year  has moved up to number two.																								According to the annual Harris poll conducted online by Harris Interactive, a worldwide market research and consulting firm, Mel Gibson, who was at number two last year and has retained the top four every year since 1994, recaptures the top place, which he also held in 1996.																								Julia Roberts, who was numero uno in 2001 and number three last year, has moved up to number two this year.																								Mel Gibson is also topped among women and whites. Julia Roberts is preferred by people aged 18-29 for the third year in a row, while Denzel Washington retains his number one position among African Americans. Hispanics picked Robert de Niro as their favourite.																								When the replies are analysed by party affiliation, Republicans and Democrats agree on Mel Gibson as their number one. Among independents however, Julia Roberts and John Wayne tie for first place.																								There are a number of changes in the top nine places in addition to Julia Roberts moving up and Tom Hanks slipping out of the top place.																								However, most of these changes are very modest and overall the listing is remarkably stable: Sean Connery moves up to three from five last year; interestingly Tom Hanks has slipped from the number one position last year to four this year; Harrison Ford held the fourth slot last year; but this year he shares the fifth position with Tom Cruise, who moves up from nine last year; John Wayne, who was first or second in the list almost every year until 2001, slips to seventh position this year.																								Clint Eastwood retains the eighth position he held last year while Denzel Washington slips from seven last year to nine now.																								Nine of the 10 stars in this years top-10 list were also in last years list. The one change: Johnny Depp comes in at 10, displacing Sandra Bullock.																								Among all the movie stars who made this top-10 list, only Johnny Depp had a major box office success thus far in 2003 (in Pirates of The Caribbean).

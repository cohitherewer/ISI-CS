The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, October 19, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Blaine bother																																	 London, Oct. 18 (Reuters): US showman David Blaine is to swap his plastic box by Londons Thames river for a hospital ward when his 44-day starvation stunt ends tomorrow.																																	Filthy, unshaven and complaining of blackouts, Blaine will be taken to hospital by ambulance to begin what he describes as the most dangerous stage of his feat.																																	The hardest part is when you come out and you are brought back to nourishment, he said in a recent interview. The illusionist will build his strength slowly with mineral supplements before tackling solid food.																																	Blaine has been suspended in a see-through box beneath a crane next to Londons landmark Tower Bridge since September 5, apparently with no food and only one tube for water and another for urinating. The 30-year-old New Yorker said it was more dangerous than his previous stunts when he was buried alive in a glass coffin and encased in a giant block of ice.

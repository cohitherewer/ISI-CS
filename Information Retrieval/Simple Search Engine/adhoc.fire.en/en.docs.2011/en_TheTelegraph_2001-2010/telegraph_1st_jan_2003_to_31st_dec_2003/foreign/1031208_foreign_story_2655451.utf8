Richard  one of whose best-known hit records was called Summer Holiday  said he had offered the luxury home in Barbados via Blairs wife Cherie after the strain of the Iraq war looked to be getting to him. The Blairs and their four children took a break in the villa during August. I saw him during the war and thought: This man...became gaunt, tired, ancient-looking suddenly, said Richard, himself a famously young-looking 63. 																																	So I just phoned Cherie and I said: Look, it just looks horrible, and I know it must be terribly difficult, Richard told Britains Sky News in an interview. All I know is that a human friend of mine looked as though he needed a rest.																													 																Lenin film Berlin (Reuters): A heart-warming German  box office blockbuster, Good Bye, Lenin!, dominated  the European Film Awards, taking six top prizes at the 16th  annual competition. The bittersweet German comedy by Wolfgang  Becker  which topped Germanys box office this year with  nearly $40 million  took best film, best actor, and best  screenwriter. German actor Daniel Bruehl plays a teenage  son whose mother, a devoted communist, falls into a coma  just before the Wall comes down and wakes up eight months  later. Doctors warn the shock of the changes sweeping the  country could kill her. So he recreates a small East German  world in their apartment six months after the Berlin Wall  fell, to stop her learning that the Cold War has ended.

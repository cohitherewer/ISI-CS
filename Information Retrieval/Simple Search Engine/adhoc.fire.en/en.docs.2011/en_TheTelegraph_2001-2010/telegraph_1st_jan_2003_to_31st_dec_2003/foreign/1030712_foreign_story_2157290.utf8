The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, July 12, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Old is gold																																	 Tokyo, July 11 (AFP): Japanese women remained the oldest living humans in 2002 as the government announced today their average lifespan rose 110 days to 85.23 years. 																																	Japanese men also lived longer, with an average lifespan up 91 days to 78.32 years, the health ministry said in an annual report. 																																	It was the third year in a row both sexes broke records for longevity, and the 18th year Japanese women retained their title as the longest living people, the ministry said. 																																	There are fewer deaths from cancer and strokes in the elderly, which is one of the reasons lifespan increased, said ministry official Yoko Shirai. 																																	Suicides, however, kept down the average increase for Japanese men, the ministry said. Death by suicide trimmed the average lifespan of Japanese men by 266 days, up from 256 a year earlier, but only 113 days off womens lifespans, unchanged from 2001.  Men had a 2.61 per cent chance  of dying by suicide in 2002, while for women the percentage  was only 1.10 per cent.  Lethal shots Vienna (Reuters): A round of schnapps  on the house landed an Austrian waiter and his customers  in hospital after he served them dishwasher fluid that left  them with internal burns. After knocking back the shots  in a bar in the southern town of Klagenfurt, the four drinkers  were seized by coughing fits and their eyes turned watery  and red, the police said in a press release on Friday. They  complained to the waiter, who then downed a glass himself  and also began coughing. The five were rushed to hospital  where they were treated for burns to the mouth and gullet.  Police said a bartender had refilled the schnapps bottle  with washing detergent.

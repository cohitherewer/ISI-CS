 Sunday, October 05, 2003 				 Bono formally shows his prints 
 NEIL MCCORMICK				 	 Bono																								Dublin, Oct. 4: Amid scenes of hysteria and media frenzy not usually witnessed at the opening of an art exhibition, the Irish rock star Bono made an appearance at Dublins City Hall yesterday, for the first public display of his paintings.																								Not that this previously unheralded artist was making any great claims for his abilities. I love art too much to call these anything other than marks on paper, he said. Nevertheless, they are expected to fetch a tidy sum for charity.																								Executed on enormous white canvases in bold strokes of black, Bonos works were created to accompany a radical new version of Prokofievs Peter And The Wolf, performed by Bonos close childhood friend Gavin Friday.																								The CD and accompanying book  published next week by Bloomsbury  will raise money for the Irish Hospice Foundation, who looked after Bonos father who died of cancer in 2001.																								Bono said he found the challenge of illustrating the childrens tale a cathartic experience. Beneath the jollity there is a serious side to this work which is to do with my old man who gave me my voice and my interest in paint. . . but not the confidence to do anything with them, as you can see.																								Bonos daughters Jordan, 14, and Eve, 12, contributed by adding details of flowers to Bonos rather rudimentary forest. They show a lot more aptitude with a brush than I ever did at their age. Actually, more than I do now.																								The character of Peter is based on the young Bono while Bonos wife Ali is caricatured as a rather erotic cartoon cat called Pussy. When I said I would immortalise her, Im not sure this is what she had in mind, he joked.																								The works will be exhibited at Christies in London next week and auctioned by Christies New York on November 20-21. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

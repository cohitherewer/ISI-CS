 Sunday, March 09, 2003 				 Top Hamas leader killed
																								Gaza, March 8 (Reuters): Israel killed the top commander of Hamass military wing and three other militants in a helicopter missile strike on a car in the Gaza Strip today, drawing vows of revenge from the militant Islamic group.																								Ibrahim al-Maqadma, 51, was a founder of Hamas and was believed to be the top commander of its military wing, which has waged a suicide bombing campaign against Israel since mainstream Palestinian leaders signed interim peace accords with the Jewish state in 1993.																								Four Israeli helicopter gunships swooped out of the sky and blasted a car in which Maqadma and three other Hamas militants were driving, turning it into a heap of charred, smoking wreckage and scattering body parts along the road.

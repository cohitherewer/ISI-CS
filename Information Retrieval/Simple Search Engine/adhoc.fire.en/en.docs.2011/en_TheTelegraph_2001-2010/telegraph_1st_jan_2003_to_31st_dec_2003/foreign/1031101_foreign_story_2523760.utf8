 Saturday, November 01, 2003 				 Nepal Maoists assets on US blacklist
																								Washington, Oct. 31 (Reuters): The US has added the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) to its list of organisations whose assets in the US must be frozen because of their links with terrorism, the federal register said today.																								The Communist Party, which follows the teachings of Chinese leader Mao Zedong, took up arms against the Nepalese monarchy in 1996 and is fighting for a communist republic. More than 7,700 people have been killed in the war, which has hit the struggling economy and scared off tourists. The US has sided with the government and provided it military assistance.																								The state department said the party killed two US embassy guards in 2002. The party says it has given its members instructions not to attack foreigners.																								The notice in the federal register also proscribed two of the Nepalese partys aliases  the United Revolutionary Peoples Council and the Peoples Liberation Army of Nepal.																								The Communist Party of Nepal... has committed, or poses a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of US nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the US, said the notice, signed by deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage. The listing also bans financial dealings with the party.																								The state department had already listed the Communist Party of Nepal in an annual report among other terrorist groups  a descriptive category that has no legal implications.																								It was not immediately clear whether the party had any assets subject to US jurisdiction, but the state department lists Nepal as its only theatre of operations.

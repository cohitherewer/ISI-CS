 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Jackson friends gather in support
				 	 Michael Jackson 																								Los Angeles, Dec. 21: Celebrities have gathered at Michael Jacksons Neverland Ranch in a show of solidarity ahead of his anticipated sneak in, sneak out Christmas trip to Britain. 																								The get-together, entitled You Are Not Alone, after one of Jacksons hits, was reportedly thrown as a thank you to some 600 friends and relatives from the troubled pop star who is facing child sex abuse charges. 																								Among the guests were celebrities such as comedian Eddie Griffin and American Idol host and DJ Ryan Seacrest. Jackson is expected to travel to Britain imminently to fulfil his unspecified contractual commitments, reportedly to promote his CD, Number Ones. 																								However, although the CD is selling better in Britain than the US, he may not be guaranteed a warm welcome. Mark Beaumont, of music magazine NME, said: There will always be the hardcore fans, but that is a relatively small group now and people are becoming more suspicious. Some Labour MPs and a host of child welfare groups have called for a ban on him entering the country, putting pressure on British home secretary David Blunkett. 																								The home office has refused to discuss Jacksons case but said anyone entering the UK was assessed in the same way. In line with rules on immigration, civil servants will determine whether any individual could be refused entry, if there is a reason that their presence is deemed to be not conducive to public good. 																								But sources say the 45-year-old pop legend is unlikely to have the door slammed in his face. He has not been convicted of any offence and will be treated as innocent until proven guilty.

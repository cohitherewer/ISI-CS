 Monday, July 07, 2003 				 HK focus turns to bill rollback
																								Hong Kong, July 6(Reuters): Watering down reviled anti-subversion laws by Hong Kongs government has done little to allay concerns and the legislation should be postponed to allow public anger to cool, pro-democracy groups said today.																								Chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, struggling to defuse Hong Kongs biggest political crisis in years, bowed to public pressure yesterday and amended parts of the bill before its final reading this week. But he ignored calls to postpone the legislation for more public consultation and pressed ahead with plans to present it to the legislature on Wednesday, when opponents expect tens of thousands to surround the building in protest.																								Dont continue misjudging the opinion of the public, Richard Tsoi of the Civil Human Rights Front, which is organising a rally against the bill on Wednesday, said at a forum. We hope the government will postpone the legislation immediately. Half a million people took to Hong Kongs streets on Tuesday to denounce the law in the citys biggest demonstration since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.

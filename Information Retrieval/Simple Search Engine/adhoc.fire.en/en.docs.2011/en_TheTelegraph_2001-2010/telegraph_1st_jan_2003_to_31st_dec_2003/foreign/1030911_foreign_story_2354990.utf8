The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, September 11, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Lottery luck																																	 Miami, Sept. 10 (Reuters): Its too late. It was a lottery ticket worth $50 million and somebody had it in their pocket and didnt claim it and now its too late.																																	Florida lottery officials say the person who bought a Quick Pick ticket at a Miami-area food market for the March 12 draw let the 180-day deadline pass yesterday. Somebody didnt get their $50 million, lottery spokeswoman Sheila Griffin said. There is no second chance. It was the largest of 19 unclaimed jackpots in the 15-year history of the Florida Lottery. Winners have missed out on nearly $123 million.																																	Our thought is that it was someone who was on vacation who went home and never checked their numbers, Griffin said. The previous highest unclaimed prize was $15 million in 1991. The $50 million returns to the lottery, which uses it for special promotions that ultimately boost sales, Griffin said.																																	The winning numbers were 22-23-35-45-50-53. But theyre just numbers now. No one has ever tried to claim a prize after the deadline. If they did, it wouldnt do any good. Too late, Griffin said.																													 																Curious case Berlin (Reuters): A German who lost  a suitcase full of clothes after a holiday in 1979 is to  get it back 24 years after he first reported it missing,  police said on Tuesday. Officers found the brown and beige  case lying outside a police station in the western city  of Duesseldorf and identified its owner as a 61-year-old  former hairdresser who lost it after a trip to Senegal in  1979. Where the case had been was unclear. Duesseldorf police  said the clothes were in good condition and did not seem  to have been eaten by moths. Police said the man was surprised  and amused at the discovery but did not want the clothes  back, fearing the disco-era garb would no longer suit him.  But the mans wife persuaded her husband to take the case  back. She was curious to see what was in there, the police  said.																													 																Deadly drop																																	 Decatur, Georgia (Reuters): Ben Rogozensky had hoped not to drop into court this week. But thats exactly what happened on Monday when the 31-year-old inmate fell more than 3 metres through a ceiling crawl space during a botched escape at the DeKalb county courthouse outside Atlanta. Rogozensky landed in the middle of state court judge J. Antonio DelCampos chambers while the judge was having his computer serviced by a technician, said Mikki Jones, a spokeswoman for the DeKalb county sheriffs department. Rogozensky was recaptured shortly after dashing into an adjoining corridor. 																																	Jones said that Rogozensky, who was awaiting a hearing on charges of obstructing officers and giving false information, tried to flee after being taken to an empty jury room to confer with his lawyer.																																	He used a stool in a nearby bathroom to climb into the ceiling, she said. 																																	 NICOSIA, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Cyprus wants its taxi drivers to bin their medallions, cover up hairy belly buttons and ditch flashy rings to project a cleaner image among tourists.																																	The islands licensing authority plans etiquette classes for its cabbies after surveys conducted among holidaymakers showed some grooming was needed, Alithia newspaper reported on Wednesday.																																	Thick gold chains around the neck, sovereign rings on three of the five fingers...all this has got to go, the daily quoted an official at the licensing authority as saying.																																	Explicit tattoos, shorts exposing hairy legs and flip-flops were also in for the chop, the official added.																																	About 2.5 million tourists flock to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus every year, over half of them from western Europe.

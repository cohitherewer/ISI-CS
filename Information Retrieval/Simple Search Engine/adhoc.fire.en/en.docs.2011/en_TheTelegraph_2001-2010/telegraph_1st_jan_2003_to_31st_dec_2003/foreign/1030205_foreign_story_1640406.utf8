The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, February 05, 2003 				 Models, not Kylie, show off designs
				 	 Kylie Minogue during the launch of her new lingerie range, called LoveKylie, at Selfridges, London. (Reuters)																								London, Feb. 4 (Reuters): The thought of getting a peek at Australian pop diva Kylie Minogues new knickers had Britains media flocking to Selfridges today.																								Kylie, famed for appearing on stage wearing little more than her underwear, was launching her own range of lingerie called Love Kylie at the plush store on Londons Oxford Street.																								Pictures of the diminutive Australian star modelling some of her new range have adorned front pages and had British tabloid papers salivating with excitement in the last few days.																								Unfortunately for the massed rank of photographers who gathered for the launch today, Kylie left it to four models to brave the cold winter morning to show off her designs  but insisted she was wearing her lingerie under her leather dress.																								Shoppers could ogle a video of the near naked star being shown in a Selfridges window.																								All I had to do was jump up and down in my underpants, she told reporters.																								The lingerie, which Kylie describes as sexy but still girl-next-door and which was previously only available in Australia, has names such as Diva,Vamp and Fever  the name of the singers latest album.																								Chart-topping Kylie follows in the footsteps of fellow Antipodean, Elle The Body MacPherson, in launching a lingerie line.

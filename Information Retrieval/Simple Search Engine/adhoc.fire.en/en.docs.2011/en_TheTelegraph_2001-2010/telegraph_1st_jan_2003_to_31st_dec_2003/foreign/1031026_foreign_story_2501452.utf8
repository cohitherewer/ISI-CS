 Sunday, October 26, 2003 				 Bruce bid to save New York club
				 	 Bruce Springsteen																								New York, Oct 25 (Reuters): Rocker Bruce Springsteen has pledged big money to save the Greenwich Village club The Bottom Line from possible eviction by landlord New York University, the clubs lawyer said yesterday.																								The Boss and Viacom president Mel Karmazin have offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to bail out the club, lawyer Mark Alonso said. 																								He was not sure if the money would be a loan or an investment.																								The Bottom Line, a Greenwich Village fixture since 1974, has played host to some of the biggest names in music over the last three decades, including Springsteen, Stevie Wonder and Bonnie Raitt.																								The club owes New York UNiversity $185,000 in back rent, accumulated over three years. 																								The university also wants a big rent hike and physical improvements to the building before agreeing to a new lease.																								Even with Springsteen and Karmazins help and an offer from Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. to pay the back rent and expand an arrangement to broadcast live music from the club, the two sides remain far apart, Alonso said.																								NYU spokesman John Beckman said in a statement: The Bottom Lines rent is at least 50 percent below market value. 																								The current arrangement, in which our not-for-profit educational institution subsidises this for-profit entertainment business, is not appropriate or sustainable.																								The sides told a New York court on Thursday they had failed to reach a settlement during a 30-day recess to the eviction action granted last month by Judge Donna Recant. The judge is now expected to issue a ruling on eviction within 30 days.																								Springsteen, who rocked the nightspot with a memorable week of shows in 1975, earlier this week posted some comments on http://www.savethebottomline.com, saluting the club as a central part of New York City culture. Springsteen, in the past, has also shown support for country music group the Dixie Chicks after their lead singer criticised President Bush over the Iraq war.

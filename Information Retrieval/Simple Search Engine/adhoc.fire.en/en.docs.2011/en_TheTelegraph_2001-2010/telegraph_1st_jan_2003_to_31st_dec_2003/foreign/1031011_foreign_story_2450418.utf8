The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, October 11, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Britney can rest																																	 Philadelphia, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Britney Spears can rest easy, Marylands first lady doesnt really want to shoot the pop star. And now shes apologised too.																																	Kendel Ehrlich, wife of Marylands Republican governor Robert Ehrlich, said through a spokeswoman yesterday that she was sorry about an off-the-cuff remark she made at a domestic violence prevention conference while criticising what she saw as the negative influence entertainers can have on youth.																																	She suggested that perhaps Spears could come to Maryland so that she could apologise in person and have a benefit conference for domestic violence programmes, said Ehrlichs spokeswoman.																																	During the domestic violence conference last Friday, Ehrlich criticised Spears new sexual image and its message for girls. At one point, she joked: Really, if I had an opportunity to shoot Britney Spears, I think I would.																													 																Pole pain Berlin (Reuters): After 165 days of  sitting on top of a two-and-a-half-metre pole, the three  remaining contestants in the 2003 World Pole-Sitting championships  have cracked and decided to give their strained buttocks  a rest. The three men, two Poles and a 53-year-old German  truck driver, have agreed to end their lofty vigil after  lashings of pouring rain and sub-zero temperatures battered  their enthusiasm and sent their resilience plummeting to  rock bottom. They decided it was too cold, organiser Klaus  Mueller from the Heide Park Soltau amusement park in western  Germany where the event is staged said on Friday. The men  had squatted on their pole day and night since late April,  sat on a 40 by 60 cm board  about the size of a newspaper  page. They could only come down on ladders for 10 minutes  every two hours to visit the bathroom.																													 																Sick steal																																	 Banjul (Reuters): A 28-year-old man accused of stealing a mans penis through sorcery was beaten to death in the west African country of Gambia on Thursday, police said. Baba Jallow was lynched by about 10 people in the town of Serekunda, some 15 km from the capital Banjul. Reports of penis snatching are not uncommon in West Africa, with purported victims claiming that alleged sorcerers simply touched them to make their genitals shrink or disappear in order to extort cash in the promise of a cure. The police spokesman said many men in Serekunda were now afraid to shake hands, and he urged people not to believe reports of vanishing genitals. Belief in sorcery is widespread in West Africa. Seven alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by angry mobs in Ghana in 1997.

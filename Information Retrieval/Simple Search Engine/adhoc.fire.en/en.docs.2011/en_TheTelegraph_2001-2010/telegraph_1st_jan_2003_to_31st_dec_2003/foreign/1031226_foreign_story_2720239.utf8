The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Heres the days news: only good
																								Berlin, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Germanys top-selling newspaper published nothing but good news yesterday, dropping its normal fare of crime, violence and scandal for stories about tax cuts, falling petrol prices and accelerating economic growth.																								Theres only good news today, Bild wrote in two-inch high letters at the top of page one, where the giant headlines are usually devoted to sex scandals, Germanys cannibal trial, killers, adulterers or dishonest politicians.																								Urging Germans to shed their natural frosty demeanour for the Christmas holiday season, Bild columnist Peter Bacher said there was always plenty of good news around, even if it was sometimes overshadowed by evil, horror and terror.																								Bild also reported churches were full for Christmas services, Californias earthquake spared San Francisco, President Johannes Rau appealed for more state money for families, share prices rose, and political leaders promised more big tax cuts.																								Skipping its usual loser of the day entry, Bild picked two winners of the day, including rock star Ozzy Osbourne who was released from intensive care in hospital after an accident in Britain. Even a story about a Berlin celebrity who broke up with her boyfriend took a positive approach: Great news, Djamila Rowe is single again.

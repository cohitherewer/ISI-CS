The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, September 02, 2003 				 Talented today, millionaires tomorrow
 CATRIONA DAVIES AND PAV AKHTAR				 	 Keira Knightley London, Sept. 1: Experts  have picked 20 talented people under 21  some already household  names, others unknown outside their own circles  who they  believe will be among Britains top earners by 2020.																								The Rich List 2020 has been compiled by Philip Beresford, who has long experience of collating yearly Rich Lists, and includes up and coming names in the worlds of business, entertainment and sport.																								Those who have already achieved fame include the 17-year-old Everton and England player Wayne Rooney, the Billy Elliot actor Jamie Bell, 17, and the R amp;B singer Samantha Mumba, 20.																								Topping the list, with predicted earnings of 100 million, is Carl Churchill, a 19-year-old Internet entrepreneur from Solihull, Birmingham. He set up his business, DMC Internet, in 2001 and has already turned over his first 1 million.																								He said: I have always tried to be one step ahead and launch products before anyone else, and I think Ill still be doing that in 17 years time. Another entrepreneur, David George, 20, predicted by the study to earn 25 million from the web design tool he has developed, said: Im definitely driven  25 million is something worth driving towards.																								There are also unknown youngsters in fields where few become household names. These include Lucy Adams, 19, a skateboarder, Shanaza Reade, 15, a BMX rider, and William Felix, 16, who runs a lawnmower business.																								In compiling the list, Beresford consulted experts in pop music, sport, business, the film industry and publishing.																								He then worked out the potential future stars possible earnings by linking each with an older, established name in their field. For example, the 18-year-old actress Keira Knightley, who starred in the films Bend It Like Beckham and Pirates of the Caribbean, appears at number two and is thought to be capable of emulating the success of Catherine Zeta Jones, who is estimated to be worth 50 million.																								Beresford said: All of these people have the first signs of success: talent, determination, an unwillingness just to drift and huge self-confidence. They all have a chance of making it, the rest is up to them. Of course, Lady Luck comes into it too. 																								As well as looking at fields that traditionally produce millionaires, we chose disciplines that are likely to develop in the future, such as skateboarding, which is becoming huge in America. I suspect that the Internet will be passe by 2020 and there will be something fantastic to replace it. Someone like Carl Churchill may be at the forefront of whatever that is.																								Not all the youngsters are convinced of their status as potential millionaires. The skateboarder Lucy Adams said: My total winnings from all my competition successes to date total about 1,000. Romero Bryan, 19, who has designed clothes for Beyonce, Cameron Diaz and Victoria Beckham and is predicted to earn 30 million despite still being a student at London College of Fashion, said: I worry about how Ill pay my bus fare to college.

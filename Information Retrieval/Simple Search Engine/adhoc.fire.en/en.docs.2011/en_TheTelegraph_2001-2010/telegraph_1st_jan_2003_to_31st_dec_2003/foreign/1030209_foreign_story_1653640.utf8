 Sunday, February 09, 2003 				 Taliban fax calls for holy war against US
																								Islamabad, Feb. 8 (PTI): Taliban, ousted from power in Afghanistan, has asked its fighters to launch a fresh holy war against President Hamid Karzais government and the US-led coalition.																								In a statement reportedly issued from an unidentified location in Pakistan, Muhammad Mukhtar Mjahid, claiming to be a spokesman for the Taliban, said Mullah Omar has directed the organisation to declare a holy war against US and allies for the atrocities being committed in Afghanistan. Thousands of innocent Afghans were killed by the US military activities and dwellings that had survived the Russian aggression were destroyed, Mjahid said.																								Afghanistan has been deprived of its sovereignty, and with the ouster of the Taliban government the puppet regime of Karazi has been installed in its place said the statement, reportedly faxed to the office of Pakistan daily The News in Peshawar.																								The new directive caught observers here by surprise as the Taliban had already given such a directive when Omar was ousted from power along with Osama bin Laden. 																								Claiming that Kabul had become more insecure after the ouster of the Taliban, the statement said: Afghanistan is now a divided country with different centres of power. Narcotics have staged a comeback and the country is in turmoil. 																								Accusing the US of using terrorism as an issue to retain control over Afghanistan, it called on all Afghans to wage a war against America under the leadership of Mullah Omar.

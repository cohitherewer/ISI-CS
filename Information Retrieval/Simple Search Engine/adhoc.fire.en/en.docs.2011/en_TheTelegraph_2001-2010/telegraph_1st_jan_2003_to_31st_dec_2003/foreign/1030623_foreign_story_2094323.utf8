The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, June 23, 2003 				 Prince feels sorry for the girls
 ANDREW ALDERSON				 	 A tourist holds up a sign asking Prince William to marry her, outside Windsor Castle , on Saturday. (Reuters)																								London, June 22: Prince William spoke yesterday of his sympathy for his female friends  and their families  who come under scrutiny from the media because they are wrongly and unfairly linked to him romantically.																								The Prince is in no doubt that potential girlfriends are put off by newspaper interest in their private lives but he indicated that if the right person came along he would be prepared to make his move. Theres been a lot of speculation about every single girl Im with and it actually does quite irritate me after a while, more so because its a complete pain for the girls, said Prince William, who does not have a steady girlfriend.																								These poor girls, you know, whom Ive either just met and get photographed with, or theyre friends of mine, suddenly get thrown into the limelight and their parents get rung up and so on. I think its a little unfair on them really. Im used to it because it happens quite a lot now. But its very difficult for them and I dont like that at all.																								The Prince, who was 21 yesterday, would not be drawn on media speculation about particular girls in his life. 																								The most recent girl to be wrongly labelled as his first serious girlfriend was Jessica Craig, 21, from Kenya, whom he met on his gap year while travelling in Africa but who now has a boyfriend.																								His close friend and flatmate, Kate Middleton, 20, and her family also came under intense scrutiny from tabloid newspapers, particularly after she was photographed looking glamorous during a student fashion show.																								I dont have a steady girlfriend, the Prince admitted. He indicated, however, that he did not lack confidence if he found a girl attractive. If I fancy a girl and I really like her and she fancies me back, which is rare, I ask her out, he said. 																								But, at the same time, I dont want to put them in an awkward situation because a lot of people dont quite understand what comes with knowing me, for one, and secondly, if they were my girlfriend, the excitement it would probably cause.																								Prince William, who is modest about his description as one of the most eligible bachelors in the world, joked about his lack of a girlfriend. Only the mad girls chase me, he claimed. No, Ive never been aware of anyone chasing me but if there were, could they please leave their telephone number. The Prince appealed publicly to  the media to allow him privacy at St Andrews University.  There has been an unofficial deal between editors and St  Jamess Palace that photographers and journalists stay  away from the Scottish town in return for regular access  to the Prince during his four years as a student. There have, however, been recent  quot;snatched quot; photographs of the Prince, taken through  telephoto lenses, in the tabloids in recent months as some  editors complained that they were not receiving the level  of access to the young Prince that they had been promised. Prince William thanked the media  for giving him space at Eton College and St Andrews. quot;They  have been really good about the whole thing and Im  sure theyve been very frustrated at the same time, quot;  he said. The Prince has long been wary  of the press, perhaps not surprisingly given that his mother,  Diana, Princess of Wales, died six years ago in a car crash  in Paris as she was fleeing photographers. quot;I dont  think either side wants to return to the free-for-all of  the old days. Its a really fine balance and it could  be quite volatile if things get out of hand, quot; said  the Prince. quot;So I dont want to go back to that  - Ive seen it and I dont like it - and I hope  that it all works out the way it is. quot;I just really  hope that continues because Ive had such a good time  in my first two years at St Andrews and I would be absolutely  gutted if that disappeared. quot; He said of his own portrayal by  the media: quot;I dont want to be anything Im  not, and I dont want to come across as being superhuman  or an idiot. I just want to come across as me. quot;  For the moment, he is shunning  formality and likes to be known simply as quot;William  Wales quot;. quot;I am and always will be an HRH. But out  of personal choice I like to be called William because that  is my name and I want people to call me William - for now. quot; The Prince offered a bizarre explanation  for his trait of putting his head down in public: a habit  that has infuriated photographers for years. quot;I was  never shy, quot; he said. quot;But, its very funny.  I was called shy because I put my head down so much when  I was in public. quot;It was never because I was shy. It  was a really naive thing that I hadnt picked up on.  I know its silly and that everyone will laugh at it,  but I thought that, when I was in public, if I kept my head  down, then I wouldnt be photographed so much. Therefore,  I thought, people wouldnt know what I looked like  so I could go about doing my own thing which, of course,  frankly, was never going to work. quot;					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

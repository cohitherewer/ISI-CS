 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 EU gloom over voting impasse
																								Brussels, Dec. 12 (Reuters): The European Unions landmark summit to agree to a first constitution was plunged into gloom almost as soon as it began today as leaders stood their ground in a bitter battle over their nations voting rights.																								A last-ditch meeting between British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to seek a way out of the impasse brought no breakthrough, no real movement, diplomats said.																								The positions are a long, long way apart, Blair said. It is important to try and get an agreement. It may well not be possible.																								Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who as EU president for the past six months has struggled to steer the 25 bickering present and future member states to agreement on the historic draft treaty, conceded that the deadlock over power stakes in an enlarged union could sink the whole project. The voting system is the obstacle that can block the whole agreement, and that is a pity, he told reporters.																								The stand-off pitting France and Germany on one side and Spain and Poland on the other could drag the two-day meeting into tomorrow night, but Berlusconi said the leaders had set themselves a deadline of Sunday morning to get a deal.																								The aim of the constitution treaty is to streamline EU institutions, simplify decision-making and give the bloc more say on the world stage by creating the position of an EU foreign minister and strengthening the post of EU president.																								Diplomats say failure could paralyse the EU as it prepares to expand to 25 members in May with the inclusion of Poland and seven other ex-communist eastern states plus Cyprus and Malta. Some leaders are worried that if they fail to reach an agreement this weekend, a two-speed Europe may emerge with key founders France and Germany pressing ahead alone. 																								The summiteers briefly put aside wrangling over the constitution to adopt a security strategy which is designed to make the EU a more effective actor in world affairs and prevent divisions of the sort that rocked it over the US war on Iraq.																								They also approved a deal clinched by its main military powers, France, Germany and Britain, on a military planning cell for crisis management operations, which was watered down during weeks of negotiation amid US suspicions of its impact on Nato. The leaders endorsed a multi-billion-euro plan to encourage public and private investment into transport and research projects in a bid to revitalise the European economy.

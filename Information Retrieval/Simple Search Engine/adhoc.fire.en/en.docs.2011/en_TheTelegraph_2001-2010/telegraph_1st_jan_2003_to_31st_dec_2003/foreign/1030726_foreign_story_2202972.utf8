 Reagan wont oblige Julia
  Roberts, Reagan: Mistaken identity Oklahoma City, July 25 (Reuters): What was that again?Julia Roberts accused Richard Simmons of stealing her car and wanted Ronald Reagan to arrest him. But Reagan refused, saying the case was not strong enough because Simmons had had a medical emergency. Although the names might make Hollywood scandal sheet reporters drool, the Reagan in this case is not the former President but the police chief in Wayne, Oklahoma.Simmons is a Wayne resident, not the energetic TV personality with the frizzy hair. Roberts lives in Norman and is Simmons ex-wife  not the Hollywood pretty woman who was once married to Lyle Lovett.Reagan said that Roberts called police on July 13 and accused Simmons of stealing her car. The vehicle was later recovered at a hospital parking lot. But prosecutors declined to file charges because Simmons took the car for a medical emergency, Reagan said.  Copyright

 Friday, August 08, 2003 				 Pak to contest court move on Islamic charity group
																								Karachi, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Pakistan will challenge a court decision declaring the freezing of bank accounts belonging to a pro-Taliban Islamic charity illegal, a senior official said today.																								The Sindh provincial High Court ruled on Monday there was no justification for freezing the accounts of Al-Rasheed Trust, which operated several offices and relief centres in Afghanistan under the Taliban government.																								We are challenging the decision in the Supreme Court, Brigadier Javed Cheema, chief of the Crisis Management Cell of the interior ministry, said by telephone from Islamabad.																								The accounts were frozen under UN resolutions. Pakistan is a signatory to it and will implement its decision, he said.																								The UN resolution calling for a ban on groups involved in terrorism and choking their funds was passed following the September 11 terror strikes on the US in 2001. 																								Pakistan is a key US ally in the fight against the Taliban and Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network.																								The government has banned seven militant Islamic groups and frozen 24 of their bank accounts since the UN resolution. The accounts contained more than 590 million rupees ($10.2 million).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Destinys Child returns home
				 	 Beyonce Knowles																								New York, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Singer Beyonce Knowles says she and Destinys Child cohorts Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams will reunite in the studio early next year to begin work on their first album of new material together in more than two years.																								The last studio record by the Grammy-winning rhythm and blues trio was Survivor in 2001. Destinys Child will be back in the studio in January, Knowles said yesterday.																								The three singers parted company in late 2001 to pursue solo projects. Knowles cemented her own celebrity status as Foxxy Cleopatra in the 2002 film Austin Powers in Goldmember, then scored a hit earlier this year with her solo record, Dangerously in Love.																								Rowland made her solo debut with last years Simply Deep, while Williams released a gospel/soul record titled Heart to Yours.																								Knowles, who stars in the upcoming film The Fighting Temptations, opening on Friday, has kept particularly busy. She may issue another collection of her own songs before the new Destinys Child effort.																								I recorded about 45 songs for my record, but only put 15 on it, Knowles said. I still have a lot of songs that I really love that I couldnt put on the record. So I might be releasing another record of my unreleased songs before the Destinys Child record comes out.																								Knowles said she hopes the trio can take a few months to work on some new material and find a fresh sound.																								I want us to work together from the very start on every song because everybody has grown so much, she said. 																								Its been a couple of years. I know the sound is going to mature and be a little different. We have to figure it out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, November 26, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Heavy weight																						 Oslo, Nov. 25 (Reuters): Norways Prime Minister cannot use his new bomb-proof car despite a threat of attack by al Qaida because Norways state road authority says it is too heavy.																																	The vehicle, built by Germanys BMW AG to specifications for leaders of Nato nations, has been parked unused in a garage in Oslo since mid-October.																																	Weighing in at around four tonnes because of armour-plating and thick bullet-proof windows, the car is twice as heavy as a standard BMW 760 iL model and 40 kg over the limit for registration by Norways road authorities, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik said yesterday.																																	We expect the problem will be solved in a week or two, Bondeviks spokesperson Oiyvind Oestang said. Making the car light enough for registration had meant cutting down on safety features, he said. In May, a leader of Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network urged Muslims to attack the interests of the US, Britain, Australia and Norway. It was unclear why Norway, which did not take part in the war in Iraq, was singled out. 																													 																Paris picture Paris (AFP): For people curious to find  Amelies caf or the little Paris bistro where Audrey  Hepburn and Walter Matthau grabbed a bite to eat in Charade,  a new tourist guide makes it all easy. Paris Vu au Cinema  (Paris, as Seen at the Movies) digs into the French capitals  rich history as the setting for many films to give readers  step-by-step itineraries to finding the real-life addresses  glimpsed on the big screen. The book points the way to the  charming Montmartre locales inhabited by Amelie in the 2001  French movie of the same title  locales that have already  drawn thousands of Americans, Japanese and Germans struck  by the impossibly magical Paris depicted. Other harder finds  can also be traced, including the Cochon a Oreille restaurant  graced by Hepburn in the 1963 film Charade, or the  museum that stood in for the presidential palace in the  French movie version of Absolutely Fabulous. 																													 																Food fossil																																	 Berlin (Reuters): Scientists in Germany have announced the discovery of a petrified hoard of 17-million-year-old nuts they say form the oldest known cache of stored food. These fossilised nuts are the oldest proof we have for mammals laying in food stores, Martin Sander, a palaeontologist from Bonn university, said. In fact, theyre the oldest store of food yet known from any animal. His university colleague discovered the fossilised golden chinquapin nuts in a lignite mine.

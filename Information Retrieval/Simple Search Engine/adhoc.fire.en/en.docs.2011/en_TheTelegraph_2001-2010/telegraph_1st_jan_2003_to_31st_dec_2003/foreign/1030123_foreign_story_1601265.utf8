The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, January 23, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Foxed sign																																	 Mexico City, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Politicians routinely kiss babies in search of votes, but Mexican President Vicente Fox has now released a sonogram of his unborn grandson apparently flashing a V for Victory sign to win political points.																																	Foxs office released the image of the sonogram showing the outline of a tiny hand flashing the two-fingered salute that Fox made his trademark in his 2000 presidential campaign.																																	The sonogram was made public after Foxs claim at a public appearance last week that his unborn grandson had adopted the sign was met with widespread incredulity.																																	To prove his point, Foxs team posted the image on the presidential web site late on Monday and it made the front page of national newspapers yesterday. 																													 																Lingerie lock London (AFP): With more and more  Londoners dreading crime on the streets, police and designers  have put their heads together to create some novel theft-proof  fashion items  including lingerie. Commuters at Victoria  Station were invited on Wednesday to try out the concept  items. The lingerie stealth belt is made from a cotton  lycra fabric, and keeps valuables separate from a handbag.  Needless to say, its design ed to be invisible to would-be  thieves. Other products include: a phone safe, a wrist-hugging  cellphone holder that looks from a distance like a sports  sweatband. Made of stretchable gauze, it lets a wearer make  calls just by lifting his or her wrist to the ear. Half-a-dozen  bags and rucksacks, with features such as rolling velcro  tops and stretch hoods to stop thieves gaining access. Some  also have tough inserted layers to make them slash-proof,  and extendable wire clips and steel coils with combination  locks so they can be secured to pub and bar furniture. Spire mire																																	 Dublin (Reuters): Dublins skyline finally welcomed its latest addition on Tuesday in the form of a towering stainless steel spire said to resemble a giant knitting needle. But some locals were left wondering what was the point of the 120-metre Millennium Spire, which cost 4.5 million euros ($4.80 million) and was completed two years late. It has already been christened the Stiletto in the Ghetto and the Spire in the Mire, taking into account its location at the heart of OConnell Street, the capital citys main thoroughfare which has fallen into decay in recent years. Its not really in keeping with the city. They could have put the money to better use such as providing a hostel for the homeless, said passer-by Tom Kehoe, aged 68.

 Sunday, June 08, 2003 				 Poles cast ballot on joining EU
																								Warsaw, June 7 (Reuters): Poland voted today in a two-day referendum on joining the European Union in what would be the blocs biggest step across the old Cold War divide in its historic expansion eastward.																								Surveys suggest that three in four voters in Poland will choose to rejoin the West in the referendum ending tomorrow. But apathy could keep turnout below the 50 per cent needed for the result to be binding.																								Prime Minister Leszek Miller, whose minority cabinets future depends on a strong Yes in the vote, was among the first to cast a ballot on a sunny Saturday morning.																								This is one of the biggest days in Polish history. I hope Poles will today choose the best path for Poland and for the future of all of us, Miller said.

 Thursday, August 14, 2003 				 Ex-governor to make Arnie look serious 
 JOHN WILDERMUTH 																								San Francisco, Aug. 13: Former California governor Pete Wilson is quickly becoming the political face for Arnold Schwarzenegger, moving everything from his political team to his policy positions into the actors camp. 																								In the week since Schwarzenegger jumped into the recall campaign to replace Democratic governor Gray Davis, Wilson has been the actors surrogate, showing up across the television dial to give his blessing to the rookie politicians campaign. 																								The actor added three more of Wilsons top political operatives to the campaign yesterday, hiring Bob White, Wilsons former chief of staff, and Marty Wilson and Pat Clary, who both worked closely with the former governor. White worked with Schwarzenegger last year on Proposition 49, a successful measure to provide more after-school programmes for Californias young people. 																								After five years of listening to Davis and other Democrats disparage Wilsons two terms as governor, payback is one reason for his involvement. There is a personal element, Wilson said in an interview yesterday. Im outraged by (Davis) deficit in vision and leadership. 																								California was a different and much better state when he left as governor, Wilson said. 																								I wanted the job (as governor) in order to make changes, and we did, he said. We left (Davis) in great shape, with a multibillion-dollar surplus. In four years time, hes managed to create the worst business climate in the nation. Hes spent us into an unbelievable hole. 																								Thats red meat rhetoric for the millions of California residents unhappy with the direction the state has taken under Davis. And Schwarzeneggers political team, many of them Wilson alumni, see the ex-governor as the perfect person to paint the actor as a serious candidate. 																								Who better to state that Schwarzenegger is qualified and the tonic for what ails California than the states last successful governor? said Sean Walsh, a former Wilson spokesperson now working for Schwarzeneggers campaign. Were very, very pleased that Pete Wilson is out there supporting Arnold. 																								But while Wilsons enthusiastic endorsement can bring his friends to Schwarzeneggers side, it has also brought his enemies around, too. 																								And Wilsons decades in Californias political life, capped by a bitter fight over Proposition 187, an immigration measure opposed by the states Latino voters, has left him with plenty of baggage. 																								Even George Bush wouldnt campaign with Wilson in 2000, said Art Torres, head, state Democratic Party. 					 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

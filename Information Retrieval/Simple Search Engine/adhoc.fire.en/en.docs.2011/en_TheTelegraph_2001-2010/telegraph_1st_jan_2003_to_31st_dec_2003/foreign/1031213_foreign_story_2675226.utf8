 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Dec. 12: Pakistan today unveiled its first home-made Agosta 90-B submarine, PNS/M Saad, in a bid to offset the defensive imbalance in military hardware with India.																								At a ceremony at Karachis naval dockyard, President Pervez Musharraf said: The new military equipment being inducted in the army, navy and air force has undoubtedly strengthened the countrys defence. 																								He said the countrys survival depends on a strong economy and defence, adding: Things go wrong if any of the two pillars is weak.																								It was because of this reason that my government focused on strengthening both the pillars to enable Pakistan live with its head held high, Musharraf said.																								The President said the induction of the submarine is part of the governments strategy to enhance the capabilities of the navy as a potent strike force.																								The Agostas have been fitted with modern command and control systems and are capable of launching anti-ship missiles and torpedoes. It is designed as an anti-submarine, anti-surface and intelligence gathering resource.																								The construction of the second Agosta, diesel-electric submarine had started in 1998 under a contract with DCN International of France as part of a deal signed in September 1994. The $1.2 billion programme had envisaged sale and transfer of technology for three submarines.																								The first submarine was built at DCN Cherbourg, France, and commissioned in September 1999. Two submarines were to be built in Pakistan with the help of French engineers, eleven of whom were killed in April 2002 in a suicide bombing in Karachi. 																								The launch of Saad was delayed by the US-led war in Afghanistan and the brutal killing of the French engineers.																								Officials expect the third submarine, Hamza, to be ready for trials in 2006. 																								Musharraf said the recent induction of anti-tank missiles, the main battle tank Al-Khalid and the successful test flight of JF-17 Thunder, jointly manufactured by Pakistan and China, are some examples of the rapid strides Pakistan has made in the field of defence. JF-17 Thunder is an excellent aircraft, capable of facing any hi-tech aircraft of the enemy, he said.																								The next-generation JF-17 had its maiden test flight in August this year.  We have a total of three prototypes  to join the flight test programme next year, Pakistan air  force chief Kaleem Sadaat said recently. Pakistan and China  hope to produce sixteen planes, eight each for the Pakistan  air force and its Chinese counterpart.

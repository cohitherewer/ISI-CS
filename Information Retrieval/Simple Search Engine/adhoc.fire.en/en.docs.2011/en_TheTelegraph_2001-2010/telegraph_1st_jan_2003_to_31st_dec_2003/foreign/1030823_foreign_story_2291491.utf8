 Saturday, August 23, 2003 				 Dramatising Kelly death
 TOM LEONARD				 	 A name plate on the grave of David Kelly in Oxfordshire, England. (Reuters) London, Aug 22: The Iraq  dossier row and the death of David Kelly is to be dramatised  for television, Channel 4 said yesterday.																								The station has commissioned Peter Kosminsky to direct the feature-length factual drama, provisionally titled The Truth Game. It will be shown next year.																								Troy Kennedy Martin, who wrote the 1980s political thriller Edge of Darkness and screenplays for films like The Italian Job and Kellys Heroes, will write the script.																								Kosminskys most recent television work was The Project, a sharply critical BBC drama about tactics employed by Labour spin doctors during the 1997 election and the subsequent disillusionment among party workers.																								Despite Kosminskys claim that all the events were based on real incidents related to his team by Labour insiders, party supporters claimed that it was biased.																								Recent research by the Broadcasting Standards Commission concluded that many viewers want docu-dramas to respect historical facts, especially when they cover traumatic events.																								Mentorn, the independent television company which is making the drama, stressed that its researchers had been sitting in on the Hutton inquiry in an attempt to ensure factual accuracy. Kosminsky insisted that it would be a pedantically factual piece. I dont think you can do anything else on a subject where truth and trust are the central tenets of the whole story. Channel 4 has written to Kellys widow to inform her of its plans.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

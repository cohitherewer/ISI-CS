The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, August 21, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Lottery luck																																	 Rome, Aug. 20 (Reuters): An Italian pensioner felt faint and had to be taken to hospital when he realised he had forgotten to hand in a lottery ticket that could have won him a 66-million-euro jackpot of a lifetime.																																	He was so busy organising his daughters wedding that he forgot to take his slip to the lottery office when Europes biggest-ever jackpot was up for grabs last week.																																	 he realised he had guessed the correct six-figure number, he felt faint and had to be admitted to a hospital near Rome, Italian news agencies said yesterday. He was discharged two hours later.																																	The actual winning ticket for Italys Super Enalotto, whose jackpot had been rolled over for six months, was bought just outside Milan. The lucky punter remains anonymous.																													 																Magic man London (Reuters): American magician  David Blaine, dubbed the modern day Houdini, is to be  suspended in a glass box over the Thames river in London  for more than six weeks without food. The flamboyant, 30-year-old  New Yorker, famed for spectacular stunts atop poles and  frozen in ice, is to be hauled into solitary confinement  on September 5 in what he called the most extreme exercise  in isolation and physical deprivation ever attempted. Against  the backdrop of Londons Tower Bridge, he will spend 44  days suspended by a crane in his clear plexi-glass box with  no food, no communication and no distractions of any kind.  He will have one tube to give him water and another for  urinating. We are all capable of infinitely more than we  believe, Blaine said as details were released of his endurance  test that will be carried live on British television. This  is the first time that Blaine, who rose to fame with his  street magic displays in New York, has ever attempted  a major stunt outside the US. 																													 																Wife wanted																																	 Rome (Reuters): Active 102-year-old Italian looking for love and marriage. Promises can still deliver the goods. Centenarian Salvatore Bordino, a father of five who is an avid clay-pigeon shooter, cant understand why he is having trouble finding wife number three. I have a house, a pension and I can carry out all my manly duties, Bordino, who lives on his own in the southern Italian region of Calabria, told online newspaper Il Nuovo on Wednesday. Im looking for a beautiful woman, who is in the best of health. I still havent called it a day on certain activities.

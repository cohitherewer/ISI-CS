 Sunday, October 05, 2003 				 Bush seeks more time 
																								Washington, Oct. 4 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today asked for time in working out a plan for Iraqi self-rule even as he faces doubt from UN secretary-general Kofi Annan about US plans.																								The transition to self-government is a complicated process, because it takes time to build trust and hope after decades of oppression and fear, Bush said in his weekly radio address. Yet we are making steady progress, and we will keep our promise to fully return Iraqs government to Iraqs people.																								Our coalition is helping to train and equip Iraqs new army, so that Iraqis can take over border protection and other security duties as soon as possible, Bush said

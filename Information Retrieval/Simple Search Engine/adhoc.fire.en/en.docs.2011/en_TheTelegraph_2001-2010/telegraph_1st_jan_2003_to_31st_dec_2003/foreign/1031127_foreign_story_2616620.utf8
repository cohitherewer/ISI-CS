 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 Chastened Campbell says sorry for conduct 
				 	 Glen Campbell in a Phoenix jail after being arrested for drunken driving. (AFP)																								Phoenix, Nov. 26 (Reuters): Country music singer Glen Campbell, arrested at his Phoenix home on suspicion of extreme drunken driving and leaving the scene of an accident, issued a public apology today for his conduct.																								Yesterday, I was arrested and put in jail, Campbell said in a brief statement released through his Los Angeles-based publicist.																								 Even at my age, I learned a valuable lesson. I apologise to my wife, my family, my friends, and my fans. Campbell, 67, was released from a jail early yesterday after his arrest on suspicion of hitting another vehicle with his silver BMW at a Phoenix intersection during Monday afternoon rush hour and continuing on, Phoenix police said. No one was hurt in the two-vehicle accident.																								A witness apparently followed Campbell to his home in an older, affluent Phoenix neighbourhood and alerted authorities along the way with his cellphone, authorities said. Arriving police officers took the singer into custody at his residence. By his appearance and demeanour and the strong alcohol on his breath, he was taken into custody, said Serjeant Randy Force, a Phoenix police spokesman.																								Campbells blood-alcohol level was .20, two-and-a-half times above the legal limit for drivers in Arizona, according to court documents. By law, extreme drunken driving is more than .15. 																								The entertainer apparently displayed a range of emotions during the arrest and while in custody, including being combative and aggressive toward officers. That included being booked into jail on suspicion of aggravated assault for kneeing a sergeant in the thigh at the police station, Force said.

				 	 Tom Cruise in a scene from Minority Report. (AFP)																								London, Feb. 12 (Reuters): A British watchdog rapped film maker Twentieth Century Fox today for sending out a menacing mobile phone advertisement featuring the voice of actor Tom Cruise.																								The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) criticised the companys home entertainment arm after receiving 18 complaints from people who received the advert for the video and DVD release of the film Minority Report on their mobile phones.																								The message used a short clip from the film beginning with a mans voice drawing breath before Cruise asks: Wheres my Minority Report?																								He then breathes heavily before screaming: Do I even have one? Moments later a womans voice replies: No.																								Only at the end of the clip does the message reveal itself by stating: Dont miss out on your Minority Report. Buy it now on DVD and video.																								Complainants said they found the advert offensive and felt it could have caused distress by not making it clear it was a promotion. Others objected to having to pay to retrieve the advertisement from their voicemail.																								Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment said the message had been sent only to people who registered their contact details on the companys website and asked for information about film and DVD releases. 																								It said the people targeted would have known the film and would be familiar with Tom Cruises voice.

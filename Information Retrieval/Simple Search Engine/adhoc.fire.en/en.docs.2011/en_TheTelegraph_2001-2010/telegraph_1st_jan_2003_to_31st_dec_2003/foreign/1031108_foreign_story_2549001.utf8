The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, November 08, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																No ghost tales																																	Kuala Lumpur, Nov. 7 (AFP): Malaysia, which strictly censors foreign movies and books, has decided to ban tomes with ghostly tales and those touching on the supernatural, reports said yesterday. 																																	Deputy home minister Chor Chee Heung was quoted by The Star as saying that the government would no longer approve permits to import and publish reading material containing elements calculated to entertain by frightening. These include books within the categories of mystery, mysticism, fantasy, occultism and superstition, he said. 																																	These materials will create an unhealthy picture in the minds of the readers and influence them by such far-fetched ghostly stories, quot; he said. 																						However, titles such as the popular Harry Potter series would not be affected as they were deemed to be benign, he added. 																													 																Roo golf Stanthorpe, Australia (AFP): Golfers  are used to on a good day hitting birdies, eagles and holy  of holies albatrosses but here at the 100-year-old Stanthorpe  golf club they are more likely to hit kangaroos. While it  would seem normal that kangaroos would inhabit any piece  of verdant pasture this course is renowned for the hundreds  that line the fairways making it sometimes impossible for  the golfers to drive, hook or slice, off the tee. The kangaroos  dont care hearing the whizz of the ball over their heads,  a spokeswoman from the club, three hours drive west of Brisbane,  said. However occasionally we have to put them down when  they are hit by the balls. She said that they werent the  brightest animals in the world and shouts of four when  the ball is speeding towards a crowd is not a term they  are accustomed to. Theyre pretty thicko (stupid) as is  their skin but players have to go round with quite a few  balls because there is a rule where if you hit a kangaroo  you get another shot.  Kissing ban																																	Moscow (Reuters): Couples caught kissing on Moscows underground rail system could be fined under new regulations being considered by city authorities while those going too far could face jail, a newspapers website said on Friday. The ban could even extend to a husband embracing his wife, Stolichnaya Vechernyaya Gazeta said on its website. The newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said the city authorities were thinking of introducing the ban to raise levels of public morality. From the New Year, citizens kissing and embracing publicly will be fined, it said. Blatant cases could even lead to temporary detention in jail, it added. Education official Tatyana Maksimova said metro travellers were indulging in increasingly lax behaviour including drinking alcohol from bottles and cans.

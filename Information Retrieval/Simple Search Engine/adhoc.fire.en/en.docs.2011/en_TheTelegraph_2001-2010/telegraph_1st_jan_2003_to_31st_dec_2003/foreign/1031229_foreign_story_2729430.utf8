The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 ...And what to do if you have one
 CHARLES LAURENCE																								New York, Dec. 28: It could be the ultimate New Year tonic for British drinkers. A hangover pill that allows people who have over-indulged to wake up the next day with a clear head is to go on sale in this country.																								The pill, which was invented by Soviet scientists and used by the KGB, will be sold in Britain as RU-21, named with reference to the legal drinking age in America, where it has been selling like cold beer in a heatwave since May.																								Last week, as Spirit Sciences, the California-based company that produces the pill, disclosed that it had contracted distributors in Britain to supply shops here early in the New Year, the Daily Telegraph went to New York to discover whether drinkers found RU-21 as effective as its makers claim. The verdict was generally positive.																								Among the New Yorkers who should have had a crashing headache was Jeremy Griffiths, a 34-year-old chef who drank far too much Champagne and red wine on Christmas Day but, to his amazement, felt nothing more than a little short of sleep come Boxing Day.																								Griffiths was among tens of thousands of Americans who added the dietary supplement to their festive cheer.																								The pills were developed in secret after the Second World War by the Russian Academy of Sciences as part of a 25-year study into how the body absorbs alcohol. When the KGB heard of the pill, it seized the formula for itself as a tool for its agents. The idea was for them to be able to drink their targets under the table while remaining clear-headed.																								A pack of 20 pills costs $5 (2.82) in America, with a recommended dose of two pills per two alcoholic drinks. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Saturday, July 12, 2003 				 Diana fund freezes cash to fight suit
																								London, July 11 (Reuters): A memorial fund for Britains late Princess Diana that helps some of her favourite charity causes round the world said today it had frozen its cash as part of its fight against a lawsuit from a US firm.																								This is a major crisis, the Princess of Wales Memorial Funds chief executive Andrew Purkis said. We are a humanitarian force but it could all go down the pan. We are doing our damnedest to make sure it doesnt. The fund, first set up to channel 19 million of gifts amid the outpouring of grief after Dianas death, said it had halted grants as part of a transatlantic spat over memorial trinkets with US firm Franklin Mint. The privately-held Pennsylvania  firm launched a $25 million malicious prosecution lawsuit  last year to counter-sue the Diana fund after it tried but  failed to stop Franklin Mint using her name and image for  souvenir items in the US.

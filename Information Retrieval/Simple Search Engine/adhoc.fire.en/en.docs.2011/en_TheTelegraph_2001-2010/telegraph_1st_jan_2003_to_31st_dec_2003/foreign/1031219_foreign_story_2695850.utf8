 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Popular Putin to run again
				 	 Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow on Thursday. (AFP)																								Moscow, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russias most popular leader in years, said today he would run for a second term next March and dismissed suggestions he would change the constitution to stay longer.																								Odds-on favourite in the contest, Putin made his widely expected announcement in a three-hour televised phone-in programme less than two weeks after his allies scored a crushing victory in parliamentary elections.																								Yes, I am going to run, he said in the carefully scripted show, fielding questions from ordinary Russians mostly gathered before television cameras in snow-covered town squares. I intend to make an official declaration on this matter soon.																								He rejected outright the notion by some analysts that the constitution might be altered to keep him in office beyond 2008.																								I disapprove, he said, placing a written question from a viewer firmly on the table. I am against anyone, whoever he might be and however laudable his intentions might be, violating the constitution.																								Nearly four years after emerging from relative obscurity to take over from Russias first President, Boris Yeltsin, Putin remains highly popular with ratings of over 70 per cent.																								One recent poll said he was the most popular leader in Russias history after 18th century ruler Peter the Great.																								Dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and conservative tie, the President reassured Russians he was tackling their day-to-day problems of low pay, crumbling housing, insufficient benefits and bullying of their sons in an inefficient army. He told viewers, many earning well below the official average monthly wage of $185, that greater use of home loans would make life easier as would dismantling huge monopolies.																								With little left to chance on state-controlled channels, there was barely any drama. Even a woman from Arctic Yakutia, who had received no compensation for her sons death in the decade-old Chechnya war was simply told the matter would be resolved. There were few references to foreign policy, though Putin told a serviceman in ex-Soviet Kyrgyzstan that it was not in Russias interest to see a U.S. defeat in Iraq and urged Washington not to fall into a mentality of empire.

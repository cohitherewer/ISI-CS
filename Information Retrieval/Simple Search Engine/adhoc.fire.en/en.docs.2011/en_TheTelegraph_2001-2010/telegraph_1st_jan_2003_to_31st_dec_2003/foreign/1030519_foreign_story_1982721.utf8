																								Taipei, May 18 (Reuters): Taiwan saw another record rise in the number of new SARS cases today as the virus spread to an offshore island and two more hospitals had to be closed.																								The president of China, where Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome first appeared late last year, vowed to work with the world to halt the spread of the virus as it reported the lowest number of SARS deaths in a 24-hour period in a month.																								But there was bitter disappointment in Singapore which reported its first new case in 19 days, just as it was hoping to be declared free of SARS by WHO.																								Taiwan, with the worlds third-highest number of SARS deaths and infections after mainland China and Hong Kong, said the outlying Penghu islands had reported their first cases, stark evidence the virus was spreading. 																								A hospital on the Penghu islands was shut and more than 100 staff and patients were quarantined after a man and his wife, who visited a SARS-hit hospital on the main island, were found to have caught the virus.

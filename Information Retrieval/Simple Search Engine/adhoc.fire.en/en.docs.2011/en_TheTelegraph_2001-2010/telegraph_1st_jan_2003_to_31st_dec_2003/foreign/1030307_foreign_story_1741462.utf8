 Friday, March 07, 2003 				 Moore a new masters muse 
 HUGH DAVIES				 	 Julianne Moore																								London, March 6: Julianne Moore, who stars in The Hours and Far From Heaven, took on a different role for her latest project  acting as muse in the recreation of an Old Master.																								She posed for Michael Thompson, an American fashion photographer, in the style of La Grande Odalisque by Jean-Auguste Ingres.																								But despite the actress obvious beauty, the comparison of the photo with the 1814 original has opened up a debate about which subject is the sexier. Moore, whose flawless skin inspired Thompson to reproduce the classical nude, would certainly be considered more attractive by modern standards.																								Slim, toned and polished, she reveals nearly as much flesh as during her nude scenes in Boogie Nights and The End Of The Affair. 																								But the strategically placed sheet makes her appear demure when compared with the model in the painting, the Queen of Naples, who was Napoleons sister.																								More voluptuous, more relaxed and wearing the hint of a smile with a quizzical look in her eye, she emphasises the sterility of Thompsons creation and Moores vacant expression in the modern version.

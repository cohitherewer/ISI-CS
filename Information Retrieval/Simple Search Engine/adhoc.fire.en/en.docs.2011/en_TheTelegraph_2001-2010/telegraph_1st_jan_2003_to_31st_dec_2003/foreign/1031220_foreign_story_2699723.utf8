Canadian researchers used a website, www.encyclopedia-titanica.org, to trace the longevity of 435 survivors of the 1912 sinking and compared their lifespan with two contemporary population groups, one from Sweden and the other from the US.																																	 average (the Titanic survivors) lived 1.7 years longer than the general population from the US and 0.5 years longer than that of Sweden, they report in tomorrows issue of British Medical Journal.																																	This small advantage was limited to female passengers in first and second class. Five women lived beyond 100, and the three survivors from the tragedy still alive are now in their 90s. As for males from Titanics first class, they did not outlive their peers in the general population, despite their superior wealth and social status.																																	The Titanic sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg off the Newfoundland coast while on its maiden trip across the Atlantic. The official death toll was 1,489. Five hundred people were listed as survivors, of whom 435 have been traced. 																													 																Plunge price St Catharines (Ontario) (Reuters): An  American who survived a plunge over Niagara Falls and went  on to sign a lucrative deal as a circus stuntman, was fined  $2,256 on Thursday. Kirk Jones, 41, whose $100,000 circus  contract also stipulates he is entitled to an unlimited  supply of shaved-ice snow cones, pleaded guilty in a Canadian  court to mischief and to unlawfully performing a stunt.  I understand what I did was wrong, Jones said. Youll  never see an action in Niagara waters with my name written  on it again. Jones said he was afraid of heights but that  he had been seeking a new challenge in his life when he  took the plunge over the falls in October. 																													 																Toddler diet																																	 Phoenix, Arizona (Reuters): A two-year-old girl survived on a diet of butter, mayonnaise and water for at least several days in her west Phoenix home as her father lay dead on the couch nearby. Police said they believed the girl was able to open the refrigerator and turn on a kitchen water faucet to sustain herself for the days she spent alone in the small residence. She was found late on Wednesday by police officers and was reported to be in good condition at a local hospital. This is just an amazing story, said Detective Tony Morales.She was dehydrated and a little undernourished but she came through it and should be fine.

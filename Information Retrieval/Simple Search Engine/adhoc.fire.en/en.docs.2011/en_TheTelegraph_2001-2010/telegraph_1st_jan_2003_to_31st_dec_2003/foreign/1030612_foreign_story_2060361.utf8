The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, June 12, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Train trouble																																	 New York, June 11 (Reuters): A South African tourist sued New York Citys transit authority for $10 million yesterday, alleging a conductor slammed a subway train window on his finger when he asked if he was on the right train. 																																	Retired telecommunications engineer Pieter Swanepoel, 62, and his wife, Sheila, 59, were sightseeing in the Big Apple last December, his lawyer said.																																	 the A Train pulled into the 42nd Street station, my client leaned on the conductors windowsill to balance himself and asked him if the A Train was the one he needed to get back to Kennedy Airport, attorney Mitchell Kessler said.																						Suddenly, the conductor slammed the window shut and sheared off Pieters finger.																																	As the subway train pulled out of the station, Pieter saw a piece of bleeding bone sticking out, Kessler said. He told me that the conductors manner was not friendly or helpful. Kessler said Swanepoel, of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, complained that he lost the tip of his index finger and bled heavily.																													 																Schindler Istanbul (Reuters): A retired diplomat  known as the Turkish Schindler for saving Jews during  World War II has died at the age of 89, Istanbuls rabbinate  said on Tuesday. Selahattin Ulkuman died in an Istanbul  hospital on Saturday after a long illness, the rabbinate  said in a statement. While serving as Turkish consul-general  on the Greek island of Rhodes, Ulkuman prevented German  occupying officers from deporting 42 Turkish Jewish families  to the concentration camp at Auschwitz. Ulkumans son Ufuk  was quoted by Hurriyet newspaper on Tuesday as saying  the Nazis later bombed their home on Rhodes, killing Ulkumans  wife. The Nazis constantly threatened my father because  he had protected the Jews by giving them Turkish passports,  Ufuk said.																													 																Spider web Paris (AFP): Attempts to create a super-strong  fibre by mimicking the chemicals found in spider silk may  have all been in vain. University of Texas scientists say  they have outdone the spider and its lab-coat imitators  by spinning a fibre made of carbon nanotubes, the microscopic  tubes of carbon that have remarkable properties, being tough,  light and inert yet able to conduct heat and electricity.  Ray Baughman and colleagues, writing in Thursdays issue  of the British science weekly Nature, say they have  experimentally made up to 100-metre lengths of fibre, which  is five times stronger than steel.

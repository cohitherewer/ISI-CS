																								New York, March 28 (Reuters): Police arrested three men for climbing on a New York bridge today, an apparent prank that shut the bridge, led to an anti-terrorism response and sent the dollar down against the euro in London, officials said.																								The Williamsburg Bridge linking Manhattan and Brooklyn across the East River was closed in the morning rush-hour as anti-terrorism teams  on high alert since the September 11, 2001, attacks and stepped up since the US-led war on Iraq started last Thursday  converged on the area.																								Police officials said the three men arrested at 1317 GMT told officers they were climbers fooling around on the cables of the bridge. 																								Police also said they may have been partying through the night.

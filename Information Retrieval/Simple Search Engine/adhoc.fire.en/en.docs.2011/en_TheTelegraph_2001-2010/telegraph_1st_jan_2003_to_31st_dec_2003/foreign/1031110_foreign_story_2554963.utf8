The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, November 10, 2003 				 Charles weighs suit on private life slur
 															- libel specialists called in				 	 Dogged by scandal: Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in London on Saturday. (Reuters) 																								The Prince of Wales has instructed a leading firm of London solicitors to examine the case for legal action over allegations made by a former royal servant about his private life.																								Senior royal aides say that the heir to the throne is prepared to sue George Smith, who worked for the Prince for 11 years until 1997, for breach of confidence.																								The Daily Telegraph has learned that employment and libel specialists from Harbottle amp; Lewis have been asked by Clarence House, the Princes private office, to study new claims being made by Smith. Prince Charles was flying back to Britain today after a 10-day tour of India and West Asia. He will meet senior aides this week to assess the fall-out from this weekends latest allegations about his private life. 																								Last night Sunday tabloid newspapers ensured that Prince Charles and his private office were beset by a new wave of extraordinary claims. In a bizarre twist, a front page story in the News of the World claimed that Michael Peat, the Princes private secretary, had asked Mark Bolland, the Princes former deputy private secretary, in a phone call: Do you think Charles is bisexual?																								Bolland, who now runs his own public relations consultancy and writes a column for the newspaper, said that he replied: I was astonished at Michaels question. I told him emphatically that the Prince was NOT gay or bisexual.																								Senior aides to the Prince last night said that they were not in a position to confirm whether Michael had posed the question but suggested, if he had done so, it had been taken out of context.																								Its nonsense. Any such question would have been asked privately early after Michael started his new job last year and he would have been trying to ascertain the facts, said one royal aide. He would have been trying to ask about the various rumours that he was picking up in his new job.																								Another royal official said: Mark Bolland is simply trying to cause trouble and mischief for everybody associated with the Prince of Wales. Hes a ghastly man.																								Meanwhile, The Mail on Sunday boasted a world exclusive of Charles and his valet: the true story.																								The newspaper reported a lengthy interview with Smith, but failed to make specific allegations about the nature of an alleged incident that he was said to have witnessed. I stand by my story, said Smith. The newspaper claimed that another royal servant, who was not named, had also supported the allegations.																								Furthermore, Smith claimed that he was beaten and stalked by a hooded gunman after Diana, Princess of Wales, had made it known that she had recorded his claims in 1996 in the so-called rape tape that went missing after her death.																								Senior officials at Clarence House say that the Prince has so far been reluctant to take legal action against Smith, who they describe as a sad, sick man with a series of alcohol and stress- related health problems.																								The Prince is said, however, to abhor disloyalty and does not believe that any former employe e shouldbenefit financially from his or her betrayal of royal secrets. The revelations in todays tabloids came after court injunctions against two national newspapers.																								Smiths latest revelations were expected to appear in a Sunday newspaper today after court injunctionsagainst two national newspapers, taken out last week on behalf of Michael Fawcett, a second royal servant, were relaxed on Thursday.																								Mr Smith, a former royal valet, is expected to expand																								on claims that he first made to the Mail on Sunday																								last year when he was paid an estimated 30,000. This																								time his deal with the newspaper is likely to be worth																								considerably more after he agreed to swear an																								affidavit to support his allegations.																								Mr Smith, 43, claimed last year that, as well as being																								the victim of a male rape, he had witnessed an																								 quot;incident quot; involving a senior member of the Royal																								Family and a royal servant.																								Clarence House and Scotland Yard have investigated the																								male rape claim, first reported in 1996 - seven years																								after the alleged offence - and found it to be																								unsubstantiated.																								The Prince of Waless private office issued a																								statement on Thursday dismissing as quot;risible quot; the																								suggestions about his private life.																								This high-risk strategy has been criticised by some																								former royal aides, but yesterday it was revealed that																								the Queen had been consulted about the move and had																								approved the issuing of a statement.																								A decision on possible legal action against Mr Smith																								will be taken by Prince Charles this week.																								The Princes legal advisers have suggested that -																								depending on the nature of the latest claims - it																								would not be in his interests to pursue an action for																								libel because to do so would result in him being																								subjected to embarrassing cross- examination in court.																								Friends say that the Prince is unlikely to want to																								become involved in a quot;grossly undignified quot; and costly																								defamation hearing over claims which he hopes the																								public will treat as absurd.																								Prince Charles has in the past taken court action																								against disloyal former servants. These included Wendy																								Berry, his former housekeeper who published a book in																								America , which broke the terms of her confidentiality																								agreement and an earlier court order.																								He was incensed by Miss Berrys treachery because - as																								with Mr Smith - he had been particularly generous to																								her over her severance deal when she left royal																								service. The Prince had allowed Miss Berry to remain																								on his payroll for 18 months beyond retirement age and																								had made her a generous settlement.																								Miss Berry had broken a High Court injunction in 1995																								by publishing her book, The Housekeepers Diary, in																								the United States, thereby earning an estimated																								200,000.																								Prince Charles told friends that he considered her																								betrayal to be quot;morally and legally indefensible quot; and																								he went back to court to obtain a further order																								entitling him to all profits from Miss Berrys book.																								The housekeeper had to spend five years on the run to																								avoid the threat of being jailed.																								Although Mr Smith has not written a book, the Princes																								legal advisers are likely to conclude that he has																								broken the terms of his confidentiality clause.																								Former employees of Diana, Princess of Wales -																								including Paul Burrell - have not faced legal action																								for revealing royal secrets because the Princess is																								dead and because she was lax in forcing staff to sign																								strict confidentiality agreements.																								Mr Fawcetts lawyers will also be studying Mr Smiths																								claims today. Friends of Mr Fawcett, who until last																								year was one of Prince Charless most influential																								aides, say that he retains the right to sue for libel																								despite having the terms of the High Court injunctions																								against the newspapers relaxed.																								The Prince was said by his officials to be in a																								 quot;buoyant mood quot; yesterday despite knowing that more																								allegations about his private life were looming. He																								broke the fast with Muslims in Oman yesterday.																								As the light began to fade in late afternoon, Prince																								Charles knelt alongside rows of worshippers in the																								grounds of the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, eating																								dates and yoghurt and drinking water.																								An aide who accompanied the Prince said: quot;We are																								concerned about allegations being published which are																								totally false - thats why we have made our position																								very clear. What our next steps might be, well just																								have to wait and see what happens. quot;																								__________________________________																								Do you Yahoo!?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, October 10, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Gurkha loss																																	 London, Oct. 9: Seven former Gurkhas have failed in a renewed claim that the British army discriminated against them in terms of pay, pensions and conditions of service, The Daily Telegraph reports.																																	The court of appeal in London dismissed a test case challenge against a High Court ruling that the ministry of defence had not treated them unlawfully.																																	Lords Justices Simon Brown, Chadwick and Rix had been told by Nicholas Blake, lawyer for the Gurkhas: These men put their lives at risk for the crown for a considerable number of years. Once you are facing the same risks, you must receive the same rewards.																																	The Gurkhas claimed that large differences in pension entitlements and pay during leave and restrictions on accompaniment by wives and family breached human rights laws and the Race Relations Act.																													 																Paul prank London (Reuters): Former Beatle Paul  McCartney was fooled by a radio presenter who called him  on his mobile phone and pretended to be Canadian Prime Minister  Jean Chretien, a British newspaper said on Thursday. Montreal  radio comic Marc Audette, speaking English with a heavy  French accent, told McCartney he was being awarded the Order  of Canada, the Sun reported. Audette, of Canadian  station CKOI, even invited McCartney, caught just before  going on stage, and his wife Heather to dinner at the Prime  Ministers official residence. It was only when Audette  broke cover after littering his conversation with Beatles  lyrics that McCartney realised he had been pranked. McCartney  told Audette were going to sue your ass off, but then  laughed and said no when Audette asked whether he was being  serious. 																													 																Novel bid																																	 Boston (Reuters): A high-ranking Massachusetts legal regulator has been fined $10,000 for penning a pair of John Grisham-type thrillers on the taxpayers dime. Michael Fredrickson, general counsel to the Massachusetts state agency in charge of prosecuting lawyers for legal wrongdoing, spent substantial time at work writing and preparing his novels over the course of several years. In addition to writing A Cinderella Affidavit and Witness for the Dead while at work, Fredrickson asked his assistants to perform novel-related tasks. In his defence, Fredrickson argued that the time he spent working on the thrillers at the office was offset by time spent at home doing official job-related work.

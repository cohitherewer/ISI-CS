The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 But for cricket matches, life is music for Mick
																								The cricket-loving Mick Jagger has a problem that not even his money, power and influence can resolve. Here he is, on the American leg of the Rolling Stones world tour while England are in Australia contesting the Ashes, and he is unable to see any of the Test matches or one-day internationals.																								Its not on television at all here, he says grimly. Theres no satellite. Nothing. Just radio.																								It is the only cloud on 59-year-old Sir Philip Michael Jaggers horizon at the moment. 																								He was knighted in the Queens birthday honours list, his American concerts with the Stones are sold out and receiving adulatory reviews, and his new film role is causing a buzz in Hollywood.																								Although The Man From Elysian Fields is not yet on general release, it was well received at the Toronto Film Festival and is a hit in arthouse cinemas in the US. 																								Produced by Andy Garcia, with a cast that includes Anjelica Huston, Olivia Williams and the late James Coburn, it features Jagger in the role of the suave, Savile Row-suited owner of an elite Pasadena escort agency who sends out his employees to service wealthy, lonely women.																								Jagger has also dabbled in film production, and his Jagged Films company produced last years Enigma and the television documentary Being Mick. 																								The Map of Love, in which Dougray Scott will portray Dylan Thomas, goes before the cameras early next year. 																								However, it is unlikely that Jagger will be giving up the life of a touring rock and roll star to make the transition to full-time actor/filmmaker.																								I enjoy touring, he says. Its a very energising thing. You never get bored. Its very irresponsible because you dont have to worry. You get to one place, and you know youre not going to stay there more than a couple of days. Good, bad or indifferent, youre on to the next place. I get very emotionally involved with the whole thing.																								Acting is completely different because when youre singing youre out there for two hours, and on a film set you might be out there for a few minutes. 																								The problem with films is that you have to keep yourself involved and excited during the long, long waiting period, whereas, when you get on stage, it all comes out in a huge rush.																								Jaggers interview took place in a Los Angeles hotel before taking the stage with the Stones at the citys Staples Centre. 					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

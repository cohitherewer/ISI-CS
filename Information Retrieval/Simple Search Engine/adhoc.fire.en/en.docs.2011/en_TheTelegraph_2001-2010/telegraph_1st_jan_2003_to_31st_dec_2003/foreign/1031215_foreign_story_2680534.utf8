 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Saddam races Osama for greatest glory
 							 - Net and SMS stampede to pick Arab icon FIONA GOVAN The nominees: Osama, Omar, Arafat,  Naguib, King Hussien																								Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein have been nominated for the title of the greatest Arab of all time in a Middle Eastern variant of the BBCs Great Britons series.																								An Arabic television channel began accepting nominations last week, after buying the format for the popular programme from the BBC. Thousands have already logged on to the website for the series or sent text messages to vote for their preferred candidate.																								Both bin Laden and Saddam have already received votes. Other nominations include Saladin, famous for having recaptured Jerusalem from the Crusaders; Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader; King Abdul Aziz al Saud, the creator of modern Saudi Arabia; and Omar Sharif.																								In the programme, which is produced by the Middle East Broadcasting Centre, based in Dubai, viewers are invited to nominate their heroes for inclusion in the list of the greatest Arabs of all time.																								A list of the 100 most popular figures will be announced early next year. Programmes on the top 10 will be broadcast, allowing a further round of voting, after which the winner will be chosen.																								Viewers will then be asked to vote for their favourite figure following programmes promoting the qualities of each of the top 10 heroes.																								Producers at MBC, which claims to have an estimated 130 million Arab viewers worldwide, said that there was no intention to exclude controversial figures, but admitted that it might prove embarrassing if bin Laden or Saddam gained a large number of votes.																								Ramzi Rassi, the executive producer of the programme, said: Our main incentive is to allow all the Arab people to express their views. However, it could prove awkward if we have to promote certain figures as great if there is serious doubt over the goodness of their deeds.																								We expect motivated people to do everything they can to get particular figures on the list, just as they did in the UK and Germany. No doubt figures like Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, who have already received nominations, will be among them. 																								However, there will also be massive support for more benign characters, with different countries battling to get their national heroes elected. We expect heavy competition and consider it a healthy thing. If controversial figures prove very popular, they will be considered by the steering committee, who may decide to disqualify them. The mainstream opinion will rule.																								A German version of the BBC series that finished last month banned the nomination of Hitler or anyone associated with the Nazi regime so as to stop politically motivated groups hijacking the process.																								The only restriction on nominations in the Arabic version is a plea on the website not to include the names of the Prophet or the early four Caliphs because of their incomparable qualities and their stature across humanity. 																								Comparing these figures could also cause problems between different religious groups, a conflict that the producers are keen to avoid.																								MBC wants to replicate the mood of Britain and Germany when their shows were being televised, according to Rassi. Based on the other series, we expect to create a big surge in national pride, a real feelgood factor. Everyone has their own preferred hero and feels ownership of him.																								Abdul Ali Hamid, a history lecturer at the Muslim College in London, said the series would provide an opportunity to educate the world on the contribution of the Arabic people to arts and sciences. It will be a real shame if modern-day political figures, whose work may be considered great by some but dreadful by others, hijack the whole series and eclipse the greatness of Arab history.																								Emphasising that it was too early to speculate on who would be among the frontrunners, one producer of the series felt that modern personalities would eclipse the historical. 																								Other nominations include the late King Hussein of Jordan, Naguib Mahfouz, the Eygptian novelist, and Anwar Sadat, the former Egyptian President. Several women have also received support, including Lebanese singer Fairouz and the late Um Kalthoum, the Egyptian singer.																								One of the problems facing the show is how to determine who is an Arab. The Arab world is vast, including many different groups and cultures and people of different faiths and ethnicity.																								Mr Rassi clarified the programmes policy: People are welcome to nominate whomsoever they choose, but we will only include someone who has spoken or written in Arabic, or who has done something notable for the Arab people. 																								So I am afraid that no matter how many nominations Madonna receives, she will not appear on the list.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Friday, August 15, 2003 				 Pitt plans remake of Dean classic
 HUGH DAVIES Rebel with a cause:Brad Pitt (Reuters)																								Los Angeles, Aug. 14: Brad Pitt was reported last night to be anxious to play Cal Trask, the East of Eden part that fixed the image of James Dean, along with his role in Rebel Without A Cause, as a cult figure of youthful discontent.																								The actor has approached the estate of the late John Steinbeck to secure the movie rights to his novel, originally filmed by Elia Kazan in 1955.																								Trask was Deans first starring role as the bad son of a lettuce farmer. Filmed in CinemaScope, the movie captured the desolation of the California farmlands, with Dean giving a spellbinding performance. He acted in his sullen, troubled prime, mumbling his words and rolling his eyes, in a moody performance that won him an Oscar.																								The Academy Award was posthumous as he died soon after the film was released, when his Porsche collided with another car in Cholame, California.																								Excitement in the movie world about East of Eden has been sparked by its return to the top of the New York Times list of best-sellers, thanks to Oprah Winfrey recommending it as a must read.																								Sources in Los Angeles said last night it remained unclear if Pitt would actually take the Trask role, as he is 39 and Dean was 24 when he died.																								In the meantime, he has to be awarded the rights. Sam Pincus, the agent who handles the works of Steinbeck, said: We are in the midst of negotiations. Its ultimately up to the executors of the estate.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

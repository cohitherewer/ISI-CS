 Friday, September 19, 2003 				 Arafat shame salvo at Israelis 
																								Jerusalem, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Palestinian President Yasser Arafat told Israelis today they should be ashamed of themselves for wanting him dead and appealed to them to help restore a shattered ceasefire.																								Israeli cabinet minister Danny Naveh dismissed Arafats comments in Yedioth Ahronoth, Israels largest-circulation daily, as part of a campaign of lies.																								Just hours earlier, Israeli forces killed a senior Hamas militant in a gun battle in a Gaza Strip refugee camp..																								Arafat has launched a media offensive with a rapid-fire series of interviews in response to Israels decision to remove him after suicide bombings killed 15 people last week. The threat has touched off an international outcry and boosted his grass-roots support. 																								Arent you ashamed of yourselves? Arafat told Israelis in remarks to Yedioth, referring to a recent poll in the newspaper that found 37 per cent of Israelis favoured killing him and 23 per cent wanted him exiled.

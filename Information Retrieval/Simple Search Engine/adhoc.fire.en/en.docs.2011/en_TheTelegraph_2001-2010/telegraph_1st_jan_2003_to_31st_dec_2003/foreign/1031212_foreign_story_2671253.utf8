 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Nuke official arrest storm
 							 - Party urges scientist release IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Dec. 11: A day after the foreign affairs ministry confirmed detention of nuclear scientists for debrief sessions, the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) described the episode as tragic and shameful and demanded their immediate release.																								If these national heroes are not released we will launch a nationwide protest campaign against the highhandedness of President Pervez Musharrafs government, which has surrendered national sovereignty to the US, PML () central leader Ahsan Iqbal told a press conference.																								The foreign office had confirmed yesterday the detention of the scientists, associated with the Kahuta Research Laboratories (KRL), but termed it as a normal practice.																								Under sensitive programmes such as one related to nuclear technology, individuals may have to undergo debriefing sessions and the issue falls within the scope of this practice, the foreign ministry said in a statement.																								This is really outrageous that the Musharraf government is crossing all limits to appease the US, Iqbal said, adding: Our heads bow in shame to see insulting attitude of the government vis--vis those who successfully ran the countrys nuclear programme against heavy odds.																								The scientist, with the family name of Farooq, had been picked up for his alleged involvement in nuclear-related deals with Iran. 																								Unnamed family friends, who had been trying to find the whereabouts of Farooq had not returned to duty after the Id holidays that ended on December 1. 																								He urged the Supreme Court of Pakistan to take suo moto notice and order the government to release the KRL scientist.																								Farooqs colleagues at KRL, which is considered as the builder of Pakistans nuclear bomb and the medium-range ballistic missile Ghauri, believed their friend was detained for interrogation apparently sparked by Iranian revelations to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that they have been receiving nuclear-related information from Pakistani scientists. 																								Iqbal said Farooqs detention might be part of what he suspects an international conspiracy to gradually end Pakistans nuclear programme.																								He accused President Musharraf of pursuing a denuclearise Pakistan agenda of the US, which he claimed, was overlooking the Indian and Israeli programmes.																								Farooq is the third official of Pakistans nuclear establishment who has been arrested as a result of the war against terrorism and the mounting pressure on Iran. 																								Farooq, his friends claim, is privy to KRLs procurements abroad.																								Dr Bashiruddin Mehmood, considered as one of the founding fathers of a nuclear reactor in Punjab, central Pakistan, had been arrested and grilled for several months by Pakistani and American intelligence officials for alleged links with Osama bin Laden and his terror network.																								After months of intensive questioning Mehmood, who had taken early retirement from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission after the1998 nuclear tests, was released.

(Reuters)																								Washington, Oct. 26 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of protesters marched around the White House yesterday in the first large-scale demonstration against the occupation of Iraq by US-led forces since President George W. Bush declared an end to major combat.																								The protesters, waving placards demanding the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, gathered at a rally at the Washington Monument before moving toward the White House.																								Peace activists, joined by family members of US troops, said the mounting casualties in Iraq had helped spur the US anti-war movement into action after months of relative quiet.																								We need to make President Bush realise that our children are being killed, said Fernando de Solar Suarez, whose son, a Marine, was killed in Iraq on March 27.																								Since May 1, when Bush stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier and declared major combat in the Iraq war over, 108 US soldiers have been killed in guerrilla attacks. Many protesters said they felt the cost of the Iraq occupation in American lives was too high and the billions of US dollars being spent on reconstructing the countrys shattered economy could be put to better use at home.																								We need to quit worrying about the ills of other countries and to stop spending billions of dollars on Iraq when we need money for jobs here, said Washington resident Erik Jurek, who added that he was worried about his brother serving in the US army in Baghdad.																								United for Peace and Justice, which coordinated the protest with International ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), estimated that 100,000 people from more than 145 cities attended the demonstration. Police on the streets put the number closer to 20,000 or 30,000. Washington police do not provide official crowd estimates at public protests.																								ANSWER spokesperson Brian Becker said the demonstration was intended to send a message to the Bush administration that its position was losing ground while they were gaining.																								Polls have shown a steady slide in Bushs approval rating since May, when it was around 80 per cent. According to a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll this month, 56 per cent of Americans surveyed approved of the way Bush leading the country.																								The call to pull US troops out of Iraq was echoed in San Francisco, where several thousand anti-war protesters crowded into a plaza in front of City Hall.																								The rally, to be followed by a march to a nearby park, was peaceful, in contrast to past demonstrations in the city, which have ended with hundreds of arrests.																								We must stop the war now, get our troops home, and deny Bush any credibility so he cant take us into another war, said John Scanlon, a former Marine who served in Vietnam and came from San Diego with a group of other veterans.

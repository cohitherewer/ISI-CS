 Monday, February 24, 2003 				 No ifs and buts in J.Lo insurance policy
 ERIK KIRSCHBAUM				 	 Jennifer Lopez during the show with Thomas Gottschalk. (Reuters)																								Berlin, Feb. 23 (Reuters): Jennifer Lopez has said she hates having her private life dragged into the media spotlight, especially when journalists get the facts wrong, but added that she was now able to laugh about it.																								The 32-year-old American singer and actress also made it clear in a German television appearance that reports that her legs and bottom were insured for enormous sums were complete rubbish.																								No, my legs are not insured, Lopez said when asked by German host Thomas Gottschalk. And when he inquired whether she had an insurance policy for her famous rear end, she said an emphatic No!																								There are several rumours, Lopez said. But there are so many that three hours wouldnt be enough time to discuss them all. 																								She politely turned down his spontaneous offer to extend the length of the prime time broadcast by an extra hour to four hours.																								Lopez spent a busy day in Berlin to promote her latest film Maid in Manhattan, arriving in a private jet that local media said was filled with her clothes so she could make her mind at the last minute on what to wear.																								In an interview with Reuters yesterday, Lopez said she was sometimes disgusted by the way details about her past and present relationships got into newspaper and television reports, but had long since learned to laughed it all off. 																								Things are blown out of proportion. I have been going through it a long time. Its just kind of humorous to me now, Lopez said.																								Its sort of like you know how women are like with their bags and purses? You have all your stuff in there. Everyone knows its your purse and no one looks in it. And its like someone comes along and your bag gets dumped out in front of everyone, and everyone sees whats in there. 																								Except they misinterpret everything in there. No, its not lipstick, its a gun! Or its a secret spy weapon!																								Lopez, who appeared with Gottschalk on Europes most popular television broadcast Wetten, dass? (Wanna Bet) seen by some 20 million viewers, said she had tried hard to maintain a semblance of normality in her life despite all the media attention.

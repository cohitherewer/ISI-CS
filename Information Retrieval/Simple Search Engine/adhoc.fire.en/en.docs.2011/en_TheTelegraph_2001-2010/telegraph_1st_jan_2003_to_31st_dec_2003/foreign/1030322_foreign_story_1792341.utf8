(AFP)  Los Angeles, March 21:  The invasion of Iraq was brought live to American living  rooms yesterday night, as cable news networks CNN and Fox  aired live footage of military units making the charge through  the southern Iraqi desert. CNNs Walter Rodgers, with the  7th Cavalry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division, sent  back the ultimate reality television  live video of the  desert charge. At one point, he noted that his videophone  cameraman was riding on the hood of their vehicle. Later,  the M-1A1 Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles were  shown halted near Bedouin shepherd encampments while soldiers  stretched their legs. Meanwhile, a Fox News crew, also  in the desert and broadcasting with a videophone, showed  an American soldier seizing an Iraqi flag from a piece of  military equipment that appeared to have been abandoned  and destroyed. The live invasion coverage came  after a day in which network reporters wearing gas masks  and thick flak jackets and looking like they were broadcasting  from the set of a science fiction film began in earnest  their war coverage. Early returns showed that in the  fight-to-the-death battle among the three cable news networks,  Fox News Channel claimed the early victory, averaging 5.8  million total viewers between 9.30 pm EST Wednesday (8 am  IST Thursday) and 3 am EST Thursday (1.30 pm IST Thursday),  as compared to 5 million for CNN and 2.3 million for MSNBC. Despite their competition, cable  and broadcast networks agreed to extend for 24 hours, until  tonight, an agreement to share their footage from Baghdad.  And in some East Coast cities like Washington D.C., a few  networks went back to their regularly scheduled prime-time  entertainment programming yesterday night. CNNs medical correspondent Sanjay  Gupta in the Kuwaiti desert and Fox News Channels William  LaJeunesse were two reporters frequently on air, seen wearing  gas masks that at times made them sound like Darth Vader  from Star Wars. As the war began to accelerate,  the networks conceded what many had already suspected, that  their embedded reporters were not completely free to say  what they liked. Our reporters do not say things on air  that they do not clear with their local commanders, ABCs  Peter Jennings said of journalists embedded with, or attached  to, specific military units on the ground.

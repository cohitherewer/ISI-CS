The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Japan wont swallow US beef hardsell
																								Washington, Dec. 29 (Reuters): The Bush administration faced growing pressure today to roll out stricter regulations to prevent another case of mad cow disease as officials tried to convince Japan and other major buyers to resume buying billions of dollars worth of US beef.																								White House officials were worried about both the political fallout and the economic impact the disease could have at a time when the US economy is showing signs of strength. The White House was looking at various regulatory options, but was wary of taking a dramatic step too quickly, an administration official said.																								Consumer groups and Democratic presidential hopefuls have criticised the US agriculture departments detection system, which tests suspect animals but allows their meat to be sold before a diagnosis is complete.																								Mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a fatal disease that destroys the brains of infected cattle. Humans can contract a form of the disease, known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, by eating the brains, spinal cords and central nervous system tissue of infected animals.																								More than two dozen nations that buy US beef have stopped shipments, bringing the $3.2 billion American beef export business to a halt.																								US trade officials met with their Japanese counterparts today in Tokyo, but failed to persuade them that US safeguards were adequate and shipments should resume. Japan bought more than $1 billion worth of US beef, veal and variety meats last year.																								I replied that safety issues come first, Japanese agriculture ministry official Hiroshi Nakagawa told reporters.																								The US trade team was expected to meet with other Asian buyers to emphasise the US agriculture departments initial research showing the infected Holstein cow was imported from Canada. Canada reported its first case of mad cow disease in late May, in a Black Angus cow from Alberta.																								Canadian officials said there is no definitive evidence that the infected US cow came from Canada.																								The Bush administration was said to be considering several possible regulatory changes to boost consumer confidence.																								One option is for the USDA to launch a test and hold system to segregate carcasses of downer cattle, or those too sick to walk, until tests show their meat is safe. A leading US cattle group last week dropped its opposition to such a system.																								There also have been calls to ban all meat from downer cattle in the human food supply, to create a nationwide animal identification programme, to require labels on meat packages with the country of origin, and to dramatically boost the number of US cattle tested for mad cow disease.																								The USDA plans to nearly double the amount of cattle tested in 2004 from about 20,000 tested this year.																								US Food and Drug Administration officials said last week that they were considering a ban on the use of cattle remains as an ingredient in feed for pigs, poultry and household pets. 																								In 1997, the FDA halted the use of cattle remains in feed for cattle after scientists found that an outbreak in Britain was most likely spread that way.

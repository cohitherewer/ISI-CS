 Taipei, May 8 (Reuters):  Villagers in southern Taiwan are strapping bras to their  faces to guard against the deadly SARS virus due to a shortage  of surgical masks.																								A small bra factory is producing the make-shift masks, with workers cutting each of its colourful bras into two and sewing on extra straps to help the desperate villagers.																								Face masks have disappeared from many store shelves as Taiwans Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) infections tripled in the past two weeks to 360 cases, the third highest in the world after China and Hong Kong.

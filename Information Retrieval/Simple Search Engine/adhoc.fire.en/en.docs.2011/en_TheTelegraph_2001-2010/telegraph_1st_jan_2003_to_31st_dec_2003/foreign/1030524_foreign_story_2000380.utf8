 Saturday, May 24, 2003 				 Rock, but not at Jagger centre
 DAVID SAPSTED																								London, May 23: The Mick Jagger performing arts centre in the grounds of his old school has banned rock concerts because of complaints about the noise.																								Jagger opened the 2.2-million centre with his ex-wife, Jerry Hall, three years ago after making a generous donation. He was in London yesterday when he was told about the ban and was understood to be making inquiries about it.																								Mike Taylor, who runs the centre at the Dartford Grammar School in Kent, said the noise problem had not been caused by the bands but by their young followers.																								Some of our neighbours have complained about the noise when young people are waiting outside the centre to be picked up by their parents, he said. We have had to postpone all future rock gigs. This is not a permanent move; we hope to be able to solve the problem and eventually continue as normal.																								The centre remains committed to all types of music and rock music is equally as important as any other type.																								Paul Borrell said his two teenage sons, whose Dartford-based punk group was one of the first to be hit by the ban, were really upset that their June 7 concert had been cancelled. It is not that easy to find a venue to play a gig these days.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

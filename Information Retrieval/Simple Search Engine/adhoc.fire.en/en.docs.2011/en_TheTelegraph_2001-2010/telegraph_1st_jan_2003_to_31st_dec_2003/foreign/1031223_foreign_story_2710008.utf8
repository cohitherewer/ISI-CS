 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Father of Pak bomb grilled on Iran links
																								Islamabad, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistans atom bomb, is being questioned about reports of possible links between the Pakistani and Iranian nuclear programmes, the Pakistani government said today.																								The move follows investigations by the UNs nuclear agency. Tehran has acknowledged using centrifuge designs that appear identical to ones used in Islamabads nuclear weapons programme.																								Foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said Qadeer Khan was being questioned in connection with the debriefings taking place of several scientists working at his Khan Research Laboratories, a uranium enrichment plant near Islamabad.																								He is too eminent a scientist to undergo a normal debriefing session, Masood Khan said. However, some questions have been raised with him in relation to the ongoing debriefing sessions.																								The spokesman denied reports that Khan was under restriction and gave no other details. Several intelligence sources said, however, the scientist, who is a national hero for developing a nuclear bomb tested in 1998, had not been allowed to receive visitors at his home in Islamabad nor to leave it since last week. One intelligence official said the FBI had taken part in the questioning.																								It is a routine matter, said one of the sources, who did not want to be identified. We are debriefing every nuclear scientist, so Qadeer is facing the same formality. Diplomats in Vienna said last month the UNs International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was investigating whether blueprints for Irans centrifuge had come from someone in Pakistan or elsewhere.																								Tehran, accused by Washington of trying to develop nuclear weapons, told the IAEA it had got them from a middleman whose identity the agency had not determined, a western diplomat said at the time.																								Pakistan, a key US ally in the war on terror, denies exporting nuclear technology and specifically denies any link to Irans nuclear programme.																								Yesterday, authorities said Yasin Chohan, one of three Khan Laboratories scientists detained earlier in the month, had been allowed home after a personnel dependability and debriefing session. It said two others, Mohammad Farooq, and another identified only as Saeed, were still undergoing debriefing.																								Opposition politicians have condemned the investigations as a national insult and a capitulation to American pressure.																								It was inevitable the spotlight of the Iran probe would turn to Khan, who worked in the 1970s at a uranium enrichment plant run by British-Dutch-German consortium Urenco. According to diplomats close to the Vienna-based IAEA, the centrifuge designs used by Iran were of a machine made by the plant in the Netherlands.																								In 1983, after his return to Pakistan, Khan was sentenced in absentia to four years jail by an Amsterdam court for attempted espionage, a decision later overturned on appeal.

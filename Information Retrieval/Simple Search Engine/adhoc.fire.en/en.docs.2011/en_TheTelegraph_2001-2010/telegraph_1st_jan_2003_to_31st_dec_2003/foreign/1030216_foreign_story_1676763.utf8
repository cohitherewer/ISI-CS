 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 Iran rebels death charge revoked
																								Tehran, Feb. 15 (Reuters): Irans Supreme Court has revoked the death sentence imposed on a dissident academic which sparked the countrys largest pro-reform protests for over three years, the official news agency Irna reported yesterday.																								University lecturer Hashem Aghajari was condemned to death last November by a hardline regional court for questioning clerical rule in a speech. His sentencing set off two months of almost daily protests led by university students.																								The death sentence against Hashem Aghajari has been overturned by the Supreme Court, Irna quoted Ayatollah Mohammad Sajjadi, one of the four Supreme Court judges.

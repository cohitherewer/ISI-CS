 Thursday, November 06, 2003 				 Microsoft bounty on virus writers
																								London, Nov. 5 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp. and security organisations are set to offer cash bounties for information on the authors of the crippling MSBlast and Sobig computer bugs, industry sources said today.																								Technology news service CNET News.com reported late yesterday that the software giant would offer $500,000 for information leading to the arrest of the writers of two of the costliest computer bug outbreaks to hit the Internet. 																								Computer experts contacted by Reuters across Europe confirmed a cash reward was on the cards.																								The bugs wrecked havoc across the world in August and September, attacking computers that run on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Security experts familiar with the ongoing cyber dragnet said the trail had recently run cold. The unprecedented lure of cash was seen as a way to generate new leads.

 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Rumsfeld sees serious holiday threat 
																								London, Dec. 24 (Reuters): US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld said a threat of possible year-end terror attacks against the US was serious, while other parts of the world were also on alert on Christmas Eve.																								Washington told its citizens in Bahrain there was a terror threat in the Gulf Arab state during the Christmas holidays, Turkish police issued a similar alert to companies and banks in Istanbul, and Indonesian police stepped up patrols in Jakarta.																								Yesterday, the Pentagon carried out an exercise to prepare for a terror attack and widened warplane patrols in the US amid fresh concern about threats to nuclear power plants and other vital infrastructure.																								Two days after President George W. Bushs government raised its terror alert to the second-highest level, Rumsfeld underlined the gravity. You ask, Is it serious? Yes, you bet your life, he told a Pentagon briefing.																								One defence official said US authorities believed Osama bin Ladens al Qaida or other extremists might be planning attacks against key infrastructure sites, such as nuclear power plants, electric power stations, dams and oil industry facilities.																								They could be targets of interest, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.																								US authorities said the exercise involved Pentagon officials moving to remote locations to practice maintaining continuity of leadership over the military in case of an attack.

 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Iran meets its match on clerics website
																								Tehran, Dec 25 (Reuters): An Internet site run by a Muslim cleric may not sound like an obvious route to wedded bliss.																								But hundreds of Iranians, frustrated by traditional marriage customs and strict restrictions on mingling with the opposite sex, are turning to mid-ranking Shia cleric Jafar Savalanpour Ardabili to find their ideal match. 																								Such is the demand for his services that 38-year-old Ardabili has had to restrict access to his website www.ardabili.com to process the floods of applications from those in search of love.																								This place is like an Islamic coffee shop where people can meet each other, have a healthy relationship and finally get married, said Ardabili at his cramped office on the third floor of a nondescript building overlooking a busy Tehran street.																								In a country where many women are forced into marriages brokered by their parents and morals police often close down coffee shops and restaurants where young boys and girls flirt discreetly and exchange telephone numbers, Ardabili sees himself as a bridge between the modern and traditional world.																								We cannot forget all about our past, and on the other hand we cannot just stick to traditions because they sometimes fail to satisfy our needs, he said.																								The modern Iranian woman, he points out, typically has a university degree  more than 60 per cent of students entering higher education are women. Many have jobs or run small businesses.																								For them, traditional marriage customs  a complex, class-ridden procedure in which the families of the prospective couple first reach an agreement before the man formally proposes  are anachronistic and suffocating.																								Ardabili, whose white turban, black clerical robe and beard belie a jovial personality, has a more liberal approach. 																								It is important that women should be given the choice to choose their future husbands. I dont want women to waste their time waiting for their fate, destiny, and thousands of their sweet fantasies to come true, he said.																								A section on his website contains queries from people struggling to reconcile their sexual urges with religious beliefs or fretting over the realisation that they are gay.																								Ardabili, whose website contains links to official endorsements by senior Shia clerics, is quick to distinguish his from other Iranian sites offering love over the Internet. 																								Mine is not a friendship Internet dating service. We are using the Internet as a tool to help those who are willing to get into married life. I am not matchmaking here, he said.																								In the waiting room, fairy lights and soft music lighten the heavy, expectant atmosphere that hangs over the group of mostly middle-aged men and younger-looking women. 																								The fact that the marriage was being carried out under the supervision of a cleric gave our family a lot of confidence, said Ali, the brother of a blind chemist who was about to marry a woman he met through Ardabili.																								Since he started six years ago, Ardabili has brokered 1,000 unions. 																								His clients range in age from 16 to 82 and he receives around 30 new applicants a day.

 Wednesday, December 03, 2003 				 Anti-terror swoop nets 14 in UK
																								London, Dec. 2 (Reuters): British anti-terror police said they arrested 14 people in central and southern England today.																								Four were held in London, six in the university city of Cambridge and four near Birmingham in the West Midlands. Police said the operations were not connected.																								The arrests came as police continued to quiz a suspected potential suicide bomber arrested in the southwestern town of Gloucester last Thursday. Explosives were found in the house where he was seized.																								The raids and arrests mark one of the most eventful weeks in Britains fight against potential attacks since the country vowed to join the US in the war on terror after the attacks of September 11, 2001.																								Britain has been on its second highest security alert for two weeks after intelligence officials said they had information an attack was planned, without specifying any target.																								Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking at his monthly news conference, repeated his warning that Britons are under threat and urged vigilance.

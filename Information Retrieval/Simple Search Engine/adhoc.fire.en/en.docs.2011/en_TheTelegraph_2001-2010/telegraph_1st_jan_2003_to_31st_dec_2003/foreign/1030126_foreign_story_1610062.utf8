 Sunday, January 26, 2003 				 Packed train derails in London
																								London, Jan 25 (Reuters): Several people were injured today when a packed London underground train derailed as it pulled into a station in the city centre, a London Underground spokesman said.																								Eyewitnesses said the train, carrying 800 people, careered into the platform as it pulled into the station. The impact ripped off doors, smashed windows and lights and started a fire.																								Thankfully all the injures were minor and no one was killed, the spokesman said, adding that 32 people were taken to hospital, the most serious injury a broken wrist.																								The westbound Central Line train, heading for Londons West End shopping district, derailed at Chancery Lane station just before 1400 GMT, a rare occurrence on one of the worlds oldest underground systems. British Transport Police spokesman Simon Lubin said there was nothing suspicious at the scene, and investigations would focus on mechanical failure.

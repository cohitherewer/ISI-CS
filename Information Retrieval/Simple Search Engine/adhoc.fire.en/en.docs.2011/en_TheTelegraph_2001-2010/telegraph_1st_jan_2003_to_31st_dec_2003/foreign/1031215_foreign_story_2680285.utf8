 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Bush boost turns off Arabs
				 	 A US soldier flashes the victory sign in Tikrit. (AFP) 																								Cairo, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Arabs begrudgingly welcomed the capture of Saddam Hussein today, their satisfaction that the dictator was behind bars tinged with annoyance that George W. Bush would get the credit.																								But they also said the fight against US occupation in Iraq was not yet over for Bush, who many Arabs believe has waged a campaign against them and other Muslims after the September 11 attacks.																								It is happy news but we wish it were the Iraqi people who had captured him, not US troops, because this will give Bush a boost in the upcoming election, said Bahraini salesman Hussein Jafar.																								I only wish it was not the Americans who got him. I dont like Saddam but as an Arab I wouldnt like to see them (Americans) dragging him around Baghdad, said Syrian student Abdul-Nasser.																								For others, the capture was disappointing news. Saddam may have brutally oppressed his people, but many in West Asia saw him as the only Arab leader who stood up to the US.																								 Of course its bad news. To us, Saddam was a symbol of defiance to the US plans in the region. And we support any person who stands in the face of the American dominance, said Azzam Hneidi, an Islamist member of Jordans parliament.																								In Gaza and the West Bank, where Palestinians are fighting against an Israeli occupation, some were in sombre mood that the US, perceived as providing unswerving support for Israel, could claim victory.																								Its a black day in history. I am saying so not because Saddam is an Arab but because he is the only man who said no to American injustice in the Middle East, said Fadiq Husam, a 33-year-old taxi driver in the West Bank city of Ramallah.																								In Kuwait, occupied by Iraq in 1990-1991, the reaction was one of joy. Day of defeat: Tikrit																								In Tikrit, the hometown of Saddam, Iraqis were in a sombre mood. Residents of the town near where Saddam was born thought his arrest was the result of betrayal and a major blow.																								Today is the day that Iraq was defeated not in April, Hamid, a barber, said in Tikrit. US-led forces toppled Saddam in April and forced him into hiding. There are no longer any Muslims in Iraq because there is no betrayal in Islam...there is no Islam here, Hamid said.																								The Sunni town was very calm. Few people were on the streets and most shops were closed.																								In residential areas, many apartments and houses had their doors closed and shutters down on their windows.																								Everyone who is cheering now also clapped for Saddam, Wael, who owns a print shop, said.																								There is no honour in this country, they just sold him. Wael, who like Hamid refused to give his last name, said Saddam had been the only Arab leader who fired missiles at Israel during the 1990 Gulf War over Kuwait.																								He was the only Arab leader who ever landed a missile on the Jews for Palestine.

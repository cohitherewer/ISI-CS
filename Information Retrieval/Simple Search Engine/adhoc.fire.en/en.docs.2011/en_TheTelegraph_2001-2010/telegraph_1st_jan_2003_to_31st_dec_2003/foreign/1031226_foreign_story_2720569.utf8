 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Rockets rain on Baghdad
 Baghdad, Dec. 25 (Reuters):  Guerrillas sent more than a dozen rockets and mortar rounds  slamming into Baghdad on Christmas day, hitting hotels,  embassies and the vicinity of the US-led occupation authority  in Iraq.																								The insurgents also directed their rage at a US military camp in the town of Baquba, 65 km north of the capital. They lobbed two mortar bombs into it after nightfall and wounded eight soldiers, two seriously, a US officer said.																								The guerrilla onslaught in the Iraqi capital was the widest in scale since the December 13 capture of Saddam Hussein, and followed warnings of a wave of spectacular attacks during the holiday season.																								The US military said an American soldier had been killed by a roadside bomb in the capital yesterday, raising the death toll to four in attacks that day. 																								Two hotels used by Westerners and an Iraqi apartment block nearby were struck, as well as the area where the headquarters of the US-led administration is situated.																								Guerrillas fired rockets that hit the outside wall of the Iranian embassy, the Turkish embassy and a residential building next to the German embassy. 																								The rockets blew a hole in the front wall of the Turkish mission and shattered windows but the other blasts caused little damage, witnesses said.																								A rocket missed the interior ministry and landed in a nearby street, witnesses said. 																								Police said US troops defused a rocket aimed at the finance ministry in another neighbourhood.																								Only one woman was wounded in the attacks, which took place around sunrise. 																								Shortly after nightfall US forces using aircraft and artillery pounded suspected guerrilla hideouts in the outskirts of Baghdad for the third consecutive night as part of Operation Iron Grip, aimed at flushing guerrillas from the capital.																								The bombings added to the gloom surrounding Christmas celebrations. Baghdad churches did not hold the traditional midnight masses because of the lack of security, clerics said.																								Minority Christians however attended masses today morning, alarmed by the violence gripping their city.

 Tuesday, September 16, 2003 				 Lindh killer eludes police
																								Stockholm, Sept. 15 (Reuters): The killer of Swedish foreign minister Anna Lindh could have slipped out of the country, although there was no certain proof of this, Stockholm police said today as they widened their search for the assassin.																								Giving a downbeat review of the probe, police said initial genetic tests on a cap abandoned by the killer as he fled after stabbing Lindh in a Stockholm department store on Wednesday had not matched any of around 10,000 samples in Swedish DNA records. Theres no certainty that hes in the country, Stockholm police commissioner Leif Jennekvist said.

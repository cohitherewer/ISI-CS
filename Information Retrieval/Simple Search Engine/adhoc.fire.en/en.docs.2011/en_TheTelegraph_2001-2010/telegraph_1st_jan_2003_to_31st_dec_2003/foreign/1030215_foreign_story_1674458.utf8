				 	 A woman sells roses in a flower shop in Baghdad. (AFP)																								New York, Feb. 14 (AP): Valentines day is the holiday of love, to be sure. Its also the holiday that many singles  with ever-increasing zest  love to hate.																								Whether its organising bashes for people without sweethearts or even starting an alternative holiday, the unattached are fighting back. 																								In Chicago, for instance, several taverns will be hosting anti-Valentines day parties, complete with black balloons.On the Internet and in stores, anti-Valentines cards are widely available. Out of all my wives ... Youre the best, says one.																								Diatribes against the holiday abound on anti-Valentines websites, with particular scorn heaped on greeting card companies, florists and confectioners. The primary motive behind Valentines is money, writes Xiaoxin Lu, a pro-celibacy activist. 																								They all do this under the guise of something called love. They do this while making single people feel sad, degrading them.																								The holiday isnt popular in some spots overseas, either.																								In Iran, police this week ordered shops to remove heart-themed decorations from their windows. Advice for Valentines day outsiders is plentiful  dont feel there is anything wrong with not being in a relationship, do something kind for someone in need, treat yourself to something special during the day, hook up with other single friends for some enjoyable activity.

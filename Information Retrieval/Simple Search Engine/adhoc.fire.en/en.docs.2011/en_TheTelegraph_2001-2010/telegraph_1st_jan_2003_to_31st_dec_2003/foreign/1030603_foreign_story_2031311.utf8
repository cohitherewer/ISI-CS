The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, June 03, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Pauls home																																	 Liverpool, June 2 (Reuters): Paul McCartney got back to where he once belonged, wrapping up his world tour with an emotion-charged concert in the birthplace of the Beatles.																																	From the moment he tore into the Beatles back catalogue in Liverpool, 35,000 people leapt to their feet and clapped in unison. For ardent Beatle fans, McCartney was replaying the soundtrack of their lives and they sang along to every number.																						Its great to be home, he said, launching into All My Loving that was played out against a nostalgic video backdrop of newsreel footage of Sixties Beatlemania.																																	Since launching his tour in Oakland, California, in April 2002, the indefatigable McCartney has played to two million people around the globe, from Mexico to Japan. He performed in Moscows Red Square and brought rock roll to Romes Colosseum for the first time. But yesterday, the message waved to McCartney on thousands of heart-shaped banners said it all: Home is where the heart is.																													 																Fishy fable Los Angeles (Reuters): North American  moviegoers have fallen hook, line and sinker for the fishy  fable Finding Nemo, which has sold about $70.6 million  worth of tickets in its first three days, according to studio  estimates. The computer-animated family movie, about an  anxious clown fish who seeks to rescue his plucky son from  an office aquarium, set a new opening record for a cartoon,  surpassing the success of Monsters, Inc. in November  2001. Both films were produced by Walt Disney Co. and Pixar  Animation Studios Inc., whose partnership has now resulted  in five consecutive number one blockbusters, dating back  to their first collaboration, 1995s Toy Story. Nemo  sent the Jim Carrey comedy Bruce Almighty to the  number two slot.																													 																Spidery skill																																	 London (Reuters): Move over Spider-Man  mere mortals may soon be coming to a ceiling near you. Researchers at the University of Manchester say they have cracked the secret of one of the reptile worlds greatest climbers, the gecko, and produced a sticky tape that can mimic the lizards gravity-defying abilities. Soon, people could walk on walls like comic-book superhero Spider-Man, the university said. The new adhesive  gecko tape  contains billions of tiny plastic fibres which are similar to natural hair covering the soles of geckos feet, the university said in a statement. The research team believes it wont be long before Spider-Man gloves become a reality. Bob Full, a biology professor at the University of California at Berkeley in the United States, who was also involved, said the technology could be used for handling computer chips and could have applications in medicine.

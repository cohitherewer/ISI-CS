 Sunday, May 11, 2003 				 Friendship of Shankars girls written in the stars
																								London, May 10: The daughters of sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar  Norah Jones and Anoushka Shankar  had their first tense meeting five years ago. Now they are so close they share similar star tattoos.																								London-born Anoushka, 21, said yesterday: It has been wonderful getting to know Norah. I finally have the sister I have always wanted. The tattoos reflect a cherished friendship forged as the differences of their childhoods are overtaken by the similarities of the present.																								Anoushka and her father are about to embark on a British tour playing the sitar in the latest chapter of her burgeoning musical career that led to her being nominated for a Grammy this year.																								Norah, 23, was in New York last night performing hits from her hugely popular debut album, the jazz-influenced Come Away With Me, which won eight Grammy Awards. For the past five years we have been reconciled, and have been very close, Norah said about her father.																								Of her half-sister, Norah said: Im very proud of her  and shes proud of me. We get along really well.																								Anoushka told Londons Evening Standard: It has been wonderful getting to know Norah. She came to us when I was 16, and by the first year we were already close.																								Shankar, 83, who was given an honourary knighthood by the Queen last year, said: Norah was my first daughter, and the truth is that I lost her for nearly 10 years.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Wednesday, June 18, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Street spray																																	Marseille, June 17 (Reuters): City cleaners are spraying streets in the French port of Marseille with lemongrass perfume to get rid of the stench from piles of rubbish which have been festering under a hot sun for a fortnight. 																																	Refuse collectors returned to work today after a 14-day strike over pension reforms and city cleaners were battling to clear up an estimated 8,000 tonnes of garbage whose stench has attracted rats in droves.																																	Its been awful. The smell has been unbearable and the streets were disgusting with rotting rubbish strewn all over them. Life hasnt been very easy, said a spokeswoman at the municipal services department of Marseille Town Hall.																																	We occasionally add a bit of lemongrass to disinfecting products when cleaning up after an outdoor market, but this time were adding it in much bigger doses and using it everywhere.																													 																Porn pique Wellington (Reuters): The publisher of  a New Zealand pornographic magazine, NZX, is irked  that the New Zealand stock exchange has stripped down to  the same three letters. The 100-year-old stock exchange  changed its name to NZX Ltd last month, as it prepared to  list on its own bourse. Auckland-based Steve Crow, who has  published NZX magazine since November 2001, said  the two had agreed confusion was unlikely but he did not  want the exchange complaining later about his pornographic  films or magazines. It is a hard-core porn mag  theres  no pretence of anything else, he said. Ive written to  the stock exchange and said: I dont want to hear about  it in five years if I do something you dont like... We  were here first.																													 																Cute Kate																																	Los Angeles (Reuters): British actress Kate Beckinsale, who starred in the recent Hollywood epic Pearl Harbor, has become engaged to marry the director of her latest film, a spokesperson for the actress said on Monday.

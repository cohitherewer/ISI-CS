Briefs  War Briefs  Soldier reunites with kin  Frankfurt, April 7: Private first class Jessica D. Lynch was reunited with her family at a military hospital in Germany on Sunday as doctors said she might have been shot during her captivity.  The report contradicted a previous announcement by the commander of the hospital that she had not been shot.  Orthopaedic surgeons who examined fractures in Lynchs upper right arm and lower left leg now say there is a possibility that they were caused by a low-velocity, small-caliber weapon. The evidence of gunshot wounds had not been detected earlier because doctors were focused on a spinal injury.  Lynch underwent five hours of surgery on her spine on Thursday, a day after she was flown here from Iraq. On Friday, surgeons turned their attention to her broken bones, which also include her right foot and ankle. Hours earlier, the commander, Col. David A. Rubenstein, had said medical evidence did not suggest that any of her wounds were caused by either gunshots or stabbing injuries.  Decent prison  Washington (Reuters): US freelance photographer Molly Bingham said on Monday she was treated well by Iraqi authorities who arrested her at her Baghdad hotel and held her in prison for more than a week. Bingham, along with two Newsday journalists, said she was taken by seven Iraqi troops from her hotel late at night. The three were blindfolded and led to a Baghdad prison where she was questioned. Ive paid for worse hotel rooms in Africa, Bingham said of her cell on NBCs Today show. It was decent, it was a clean cell. I slept on a cement floor with two wool blankets, I was given three meals a day and had access to a bathroom. I will say that I was treated humanely, I think we all were, we werent physically abused in any way, she added. Bingham, who turned up safely in Jordan last week, said she and her fellow reporters heard other prisoners being beaten.  Iran protest  Qom (Iran), (Reuters): About 3,000 Iranian clerics and theological students burned US and British flags on Monday in the holy city of Qom to protest the presence of Western forces close to Shia Muslim shrines in southern Iraq. Another group of around 70 clerics and students also protested outside the British embassy in Tehran, which has become the focal point for anti-war protests in Iran. The protests were peaceful, unlike one outside the British embassy 10 days ago when several windows in a building inside the compound were smashed by stones hurled by protesters.  Copyright

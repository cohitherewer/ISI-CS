 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Come and see, we have no arms to hide: Gaddafi
																								Tripoli, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Muammar Gaddafi invited the world to come to Libya to see for itself that Tripoli was not concealing banned weapons, after promising that the country was abandoning its atomic bomb programme.																								Come and see... We dont want to hide anything, the Libyan leader told CNN in an interview broadcast today.																								Libyan and UN officials said yesterday that snap checks of Libyan nuclear sites could begin as soon as next week after Tripoli accepted UN inspections to convince the world it was giving up its nuclear weapons programme. 																								Gaddafis oil-rich state, long on the US list of sponsors of terrorism, said last week it was abandoning plans to build an atomic bomb and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It now wants trading benefits, including an end to US sanctions.																								We have no intention to make these weapons, these WMD. But there are many rumours, many accusations, (much) propaganda against Libya, particularly in this field, and we have to stop this propaganda against us, he said in English. 																								And we say: Why are you accusing us and using propaganda? You exercise terrorist policy against the Libyan people by accusing us, he said in the interview, which CNN said was conducted in a Bedouin tent 30 minutes outside the capital.																								Libyas moves to scrap its illicit weapons programmes mark an about-face for the mercurial Gaddafi, who seized power 34 years ago in the North African desert nation of 5.5 million.																								For much of his rule, Libya has been under US or UN sanctions, accused of sponsoring or carrying out terrorist acts ranging from bombing airliners to training foreign guerrillas.																								UN sanctions were lifted this year after Libya agreed to pay compensation for the 1988 Lockerbie airliner bombing, which killed 270 people. But Washington kept its embargo in place.																								The US state department said Washington would look at dropping the sanctions as Libyas policy changes, Libyas behaviour changes, Libyas circumstances change, spokesman Richard Boucher said.																								Asked what assurances he had received on sanctions being removed, Gaddafi said through an interpreter: We have good faith in improving relations between our two respective countries. This cooperation will feed our technology industry. Vis-a vis this equipment, we wish American companies and British companies to cooperate with us and to use them together for peaceful purposes.																								But he said he saw dark aspects and sometimes bright aspects in US President George W. Bush. 																								We do hope that bright aspects will be predominant because we have no interest or no benefit from the dark side.																								British and US officials had been negotiating with Libya over banned weapons for nine months and Britain said Libya may have been prompted into its surprise move after observing the fate ofSaddam Hussein.

 Thursday, February 13, 2003 				 France rejects Nato standoff compromise
																								Brussels, Feb. 12 (Reuters): France shot down a compromise today aimed at breaking Natos deadlock over planning protection for Turkey in case of a U.S.-led war on Iraq, dashing hopes for an early end to the alliances damaging crisis.																								Diplomats said France, Germany and Belgium, which vetoed broader proposals on Monday, were unlikely to budge at least until after chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix reports to the Security Council on Friday.

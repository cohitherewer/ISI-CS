The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 Media has left Mills wiped out
				 	 Heather Mills																								London, Feb. 22 (Reuters): The wife of former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney says she is totally wiped out by the negative press she has received since the start of their relationship.																								Heather Mills, a charity fundraiser and former model, told BBC presenter Michael Parkinson that her life had hit its lowest ebb when the media turned on her following the start of their relationship.																								In a television interview to be broadcast today, Mills, talking for the first time since the couples lavish wedding in Ireland in June, said: Its all just Shes the bird of Paul McCartney and its just knock, knock, knock.																								He is a fantastic, fantastic man, but the stuff that comes with it is very hard to deal with. Mills, who lost her left leg below the knee in a motorcycle accident in 1993, talked frankly about the hardships she has dealt with in her life.																								My mother left and my father abused me, then my father went to prison and I think you just slowly get chip, chipped away. In the end youre put down for constantly overcoming that and they come for you more and more.																								Now Im at the stage where I feel absolutely wiped out.																								The romance between McCartney and Mills blossomed after they met at a charity event four years ago. Mills has campaigned for 10 years to rid the world of landmines, and has her own charity, the Heather Mills Trust.																								I think the reason I get so affected now is... you feel powerless, everything Ive worked for in my life, tried to do and overcome, its just all been forgotten, she said.

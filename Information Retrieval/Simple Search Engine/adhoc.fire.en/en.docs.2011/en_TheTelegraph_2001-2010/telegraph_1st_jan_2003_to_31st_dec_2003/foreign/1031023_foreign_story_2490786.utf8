 Thursday, October 23, 2003 				 Baby Apec dies
																								Bangkok, Oct. 22 (Reuters): A baby boy abandoned in a Bangkok trash can and nicknamed Apec died in hospital today after nine short days of life, hospital officials said a day following the summit after which he was named.																								The 3.2 kg baby, named after the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit held in Bangkok, died after his heart stopped beating due to complications from oxygen deprivation. The babys 23-year-old mother, who was arrested by police on Sunday and faces a murder charge, was allowed to visit her child an hour before his death. She cried when she saw him, said Taydee Rukvanith, supervising nurse at the Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, where Baby Apec had been attached to a respirator with tiny strips of white tape.																								I have mixed emotions. I wouldnt want something like this to ever happen again, Taydee said. She said police would collect the boys body for a funeral tomorrow.																								Police said the mother would be formally charged with murder at a court appearance next week, Police Colonel Suwan Charnket said.

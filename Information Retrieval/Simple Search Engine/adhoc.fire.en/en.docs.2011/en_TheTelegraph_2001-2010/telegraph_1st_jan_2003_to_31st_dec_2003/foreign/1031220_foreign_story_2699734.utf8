 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Sharon barrier stoned by all
																								Jerusalem, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Prime Minister Ariel Sharon drew fire from all sides including the US today over his threat to sever Israelis from Palestinians within months if peace talks fail.																								The plan would deny Palestinians land they want for a state and keep them behind a controversial barrier through the West Bank, but also would involve shifting Jewish settlers away from Palestinian population centres to shorten security lines.																								The US, Palestinians and Israeli doves were concerned at the threat of breaking with the US-backed road map for reciprocal measures leading to a Palestinian state by 2005. The Right wing was unhappy at plans to shift settlers.																								Israels political middle-ground might be expected to applaud, given polls showing 60 per cent of Israelis would abandon isolated settlements in exchange for peace. But many Israelis appeared sceptical of the scheme.																								Responding to US criticism, a senior Israeli official said Sharon had kept the White House abreast of his thinking and may soon visit Washington to present the plan to President George W. Bush. No date had been set yet.																								The White House has condemned Sharons warning that Israel was ready to go-it-alone in a major policy speech yesterday and urged him to meet Palestinian counterpart Ahmed Qurie for talks on reviving the road map. Things are not being drawn out of a hat like a rabbit, the Israeli official said. If they (Palestinians) want a state according to President Bushs vision they better start working for it.

 Thursday, August 21, 2003 				 Jolie upbeat on Croft
 RICHARD ALLEYNE				 	 Angelina Jolie in London. (Reuters) London, Aug 20: Angelina  Jolie, the human face of Lara Croft, the computer game character,  attended the British premiere last night of the second film  in the action series.																								The American actress seemed upbeat as she met fans outside the Empire cinema in Leicester Square, London, despite the film Lara Croft: The Cradle of Life performing poorly at the US box office and being savaged by the critics. 																								The 57 million film, which opens in Britain on Friday, earned 26 million in its first two weeks in America. That was the same amount that the first film took in its first weekend. The studio behind the film blamed the poor box office showing on the problems that hit the recent Lara Croft game, Angel of Darkness.																								Jolie, who now lives in England, was joined at the premiere by Jan De Bont, the films director.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

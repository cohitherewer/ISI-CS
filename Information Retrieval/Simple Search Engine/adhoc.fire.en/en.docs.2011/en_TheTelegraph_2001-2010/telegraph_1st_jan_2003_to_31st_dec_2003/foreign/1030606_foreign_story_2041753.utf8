 Friday, June 06, 2003 				 NY Times top two quit over scandal
																								New York, June 5 (Reuters): The top two New York Times editors resigned today, dogged by an unrelenting scandal sparked by a former young reporter who plagiarised and fabricated dozens of stories at Americas most influential newspaper.																								Executive editor Howell Raines and managing editor Gerald Boyd emerged from a mid-morning meeting and told surprised staff in the mid-town Manhattan newsroom they were quitting, Times reporters said.																								The plagiarism scandal gripped the paper in recent weeks, as top editors traced the misconduct of reporter Jayson Blair and investigated the work of other reporters.																								It also brought to the surface brewing dissatisfaction with Raines management style, which many staff members complained was hierarchical, distant and based on making stars out of selected reporters and ignoring others.																								As the top editors spoke to the newspaper staff, Raines looked pained, while Boyd was teary-eyed and lost his train of thought, reporters said.

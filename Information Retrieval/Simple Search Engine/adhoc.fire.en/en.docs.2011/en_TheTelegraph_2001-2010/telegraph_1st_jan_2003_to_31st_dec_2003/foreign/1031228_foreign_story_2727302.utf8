																								London, Dec. 27 (Reuters): A European mission trying to find life on Mars accepted today its British-built space probe may have crashed, but scientists remained hopeful despite failing for a third day to detect a signal.																								The failure to pick up a message from Beagle 2 has raised fears that the probe, no bigger than an open umbrella, may have suffered the same fate as many craft before it and ended up as scrap metal strewn across the bleak Martian landscape.																								There are scenarios where we may have lost Beagle 2 if the landing system didnt work as expected, Professor Alan Wells, one of the projects scientists, told Sky News.																								Attempts in the last 24 hours by NASAs Mars Odyssey Orbiter and the Lovell Telescope at Britains Jodrell Bank Observatory had failed to detect Beagle 2, scientists said.																								Further attempts will be made later using the radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank and at Californias Stanford University.																								The $375 million Beagle 2 probe was part of the first fully European mission to be sent to any planet and had been hailed as a triumph for British ingenuity and for European space exploration.																								The European Space Agencys Mars Express blasted off in June from Russias Baikonur base with the British-made Beagle 2 on board and charged with the task of finding out whether there is, or ever was, life on Mars.																								Beagle 2 parted from the Mars Express eight days ago and was due to parachute down to Mars on Christmas morning, but it failed to broadcast a signal to confirm it had landed.																								Wells said they had now set up two teams, one to keep trying to communicate with the probe and a Tiger Team to investigate why it had not responded as expected on Christmas Day.																								Were far from giving up. Weve only tried five times so far, he said. What were doing is looking at any possibility where Beagle 2 is still functioning and were not able to communicate with it for some reason.																								The projects team says the best chance of making contact with the probe will be on January 4 when the Mars Express moves into a polar orbit around the planet.																								At the moment I am frustrated rather than concerned, said Professor David Southwood, ESAs director of science. With Mars Express we will be using a system that we have fully tested and understand.																								Of the previous 11 probes dropped on the red planets surface, only three have survived and it is estimated that around two in every three Russian and US missions to Mars have been whole or partial failures.																								Beagle 2s failure to make contact soured Christmas for scientists, who had gathered in London on Thursday and Friday, hoping to hear the probe broadcasting its signature tune  composed for the occasion by pop group Blur  across the 100 million km from Mars.																								ESA officials said that even if Beagle 2 was not found, the Mars Express that carried the 34 kg probe had successfully been guided on to an orbit around Mars from where it would study the planet for two years.																								For the scientists here the orbiter is the most important part of the mission, said Gerhard Schwehm, an ESA planetary mission official. The landing probe on Mars is in essence the icing on the cake.

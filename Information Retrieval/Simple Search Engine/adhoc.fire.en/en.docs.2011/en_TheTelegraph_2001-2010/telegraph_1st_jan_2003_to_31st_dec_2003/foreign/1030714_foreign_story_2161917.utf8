 Monday, July 14, 2003 				 Nepal parties extend protests
																								Kathmandu, July 13 (AFP): Nepals five main parties announced today they would extend by a month a protest campaign against the king.																								The decision was made yesterday at a meeting of party leaders, Nepali Congress spokesperson Arjun Narsingh K.C.said.																								Demonstrations against King Gyanendra began last October when he dismissed the elected Prime Minister, replaced him with royalist Lokendra Bahadur Chand and postponed elections.																								Chand resigned in May and was replaced with Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa.																								The parties have refused to cooperate with Thapas government and are demanding the reinstatement of the dissolved parliament or fresh elections.																								Narsingh said the month-long protest was to begin July 20 with the third session of the dissolved lower house of parliament, the house of representatives.																								The upper house, the national assembly, was to meet the following day.

 Politely punctual Singapore, Sept. 17 (Reuters):  Nervous brides or reluctant grooms arriving late can be  a wedding planners worst nightmare. But in Singapore, the  problem is with the guests. Infuriated by growing reports  of weddings marred by tardy guests, Singapores government  this week launched a kindness movement to encourage punctuality,  its latest attempt at social engineering to improve etiquette.  About 400,000 punctuality reminders  have been sent to hotels which usually plan weddings in  Singapore. These are passed to couples to include with invitations  and read simply: Punctuality is the politeness of kings. Older relatives often show up  late at Chinese wedding banquets to show their importance.

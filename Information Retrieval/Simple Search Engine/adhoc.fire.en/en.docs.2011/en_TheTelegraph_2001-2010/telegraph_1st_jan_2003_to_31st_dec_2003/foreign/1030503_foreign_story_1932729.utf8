 Saturday, May 03, 2003 				 Worst over in Beijing, says China
																								Beijing, May 2 (Reuters): China said today the worst appeared to be over for SARS-stricken Beijing as international experts said China faced a crucial battle in the next few months to contain the virus and stop it spreading globally.																								Liang Wannian, deputy director general of Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, told a news conference the pneumonia-like disease was peaking in the capital, the hardest hit city in the world with 91 deaths and more than 1,600 cases. 																								Officials stressed it was too early to say when SARS would be brought under control in Beijing  let alone in the vast countrys rural areas.																								Since April 21, the number of SARS patients in Beijing has entered the peak period, Liang said, adding the conclusion was based on figures released by the health ministry yesterday.

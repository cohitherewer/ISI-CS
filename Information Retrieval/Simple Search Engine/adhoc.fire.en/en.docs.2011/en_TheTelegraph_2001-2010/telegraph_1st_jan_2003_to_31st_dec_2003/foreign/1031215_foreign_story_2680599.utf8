 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 What lies ahead: Public trial and possible death
																								London, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Saddam Husseins capture today means he could face a controversial trial in a newly created Iraqi tribunal  and a possible death penalty.																								The idea of involving the UN and eschewing capital punishment, as advocated by human rights activists and others, has so far found little favour with America or with Iraqs US-backed governing council.																								We want Saddam to get what he deserves. I believe he will be sentenced to hundreds of death sentences at a fair trial because hes responsible for all the massacres and crimes in Iraq, said Amar al-Hakim, a senior member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a Shia party.																								Such sentiments are widespread in Iraq, but rights groups say it is vital that any trial aims to achieve justice, not revenge. It must be seen to be independent, impartial and fair.																								US officials have not spelled out what should be done with Saddam, but British Prime Minister Tony Blair said today it was for Iraqis to determine how their former ruler is treated.																								Saddam has gone from power, he wont be coming back. That Iraqi people now know and it is they who will decide his fate.																								A public trial could help Iraqis come to terms with more than three decades of Baathist rule that was guided by a man who became a byword for cruelty and killing on a vast scale.																								All the atrocities of this regime will be in the open, said Abdel-Monem Said, director of Egypts Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, referring to a Saddam trial.																								The Iraqi governing council set up a special tribunal on Wednesday to try Saddam and his key associates, saying the US had agreed to hand over those in its custody. Ahmad Chalabi, a senior council member, said at the time the tribunal could try Saddam for crimes against humanity and the Iraqi people, in absentia if he was not caught.																								It seems questionable that such a tribunal could also try the ousted President on war crimes charges that might be brought in relation to Iraqs 1980-88 conflict with Iran, its 1990 invasion of Kuwait or its fight with US-led forces this year.																								The process has to be consistent with certain basic principles. It shouldnt be the process of revenge. It should be the process of justice, said Aaron Rhodes, executive director of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights.																								Any court trying Saddam Hussein (in Iraq) would have to follow certain standards of due process. I think it would be important for the UN to be involved, he said.																								Some international lawyers question whether Iraqs battered judicial system could handle such weighty processes unaided.																								God knows how long it would take before normal life has resumed in Iraq and they can find competent people (for a tribunal), said Dutch lawyer Michail Wladimiroff, who was a friend of the court appointed to ensure a fair trial for Slobodan Milosevic at the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague. In theory it may be feasible. In practice I dont think they can do it. I dont think it is the right time to do it.																								Wladimiroff said the US should consider involving the UN in putting Saddam on trial in a court like the UN-backed tribunal in Sierra Leone, which has indicted former Liberian President Charles Taylor.																								Such a court would use both local and international judges and lawyers. Start a mixed tribunal and accept the involvement of the UN I do hope they allow others to come in, he said.																								An Iraqi government to be formed by June will be free to re-establish the death penalty, which was suspended by the US-led administration after the fall of Baghdad in April.																								Many countries, including European allies of the US, would feel uneasy about application of the death penalty, which is banned in the European Union. 																								But few doubt that Saddam has much blood on his hands. 																								Since his overthrow, officials have announced the discovery of 260 suspected mass graves across Iraq, which they have said could contain up to 300,000 bodies. Of the 55 Iraqis on a US most-wanted list, 39 have now been captured and two  Saddams sons  killed. Before Saddams capture, officials had said trials would begin next year with the prosecution of some of those in custody.

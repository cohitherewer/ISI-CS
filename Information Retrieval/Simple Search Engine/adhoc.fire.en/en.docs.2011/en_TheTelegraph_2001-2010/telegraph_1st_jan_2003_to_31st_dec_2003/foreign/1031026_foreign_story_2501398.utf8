The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, October 26, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																The real Meg																																	 New York, Oct. 25 (AP): Meg Ryan, known for sweetheart roles in Sleepless in Seattle and Youve Got Mail, plays a writing professor who becomes involved with a police detective in Jane Campions new erotic thriller, In The Cut. The 41-year-old actress says although shes had a great run playing adorable blondes in comedies, she isnt really like those characters.																																	 Theres the idea of me, and then theres me, and theres a gap  a huge gap, she tells Harpers Bazaar in its november issue. Ryan said in the year since production wrapped, she hadnt accepted any new film roles, mainly to keep the experience of making the movie close to her. I feel really blessed that Jane trusted me and hired me, she tells the magazine. I still think back, a year later, about what I learned from her. The Cut, also starring Mark Ruffalo,  Kevin Bacon and Jennifer Jason Leigh, is now in limited  release.  Digital tales London (Reuters): English poet Geoffrey  Chaucer made a pilgrimage to the Internet on Saturday when  the British Library published on its website the entire  first two editions of his 14th century classic,The Canterbury  Tales. The digitisation of the work, a collection of  24 stories written in Middle English and told by pilgrims  on their way to Canterbury Cathedral, coincides with the  anniversary of Chaucers death on October 25, 1400.																																	The Canterbury Tales has been a bestseller and one of the most loved books in the English language since it was first printed by William Caxton in the 1470s. They are available for study online at www.bl.uk.																													 																Gallic party																																	 Paris (Reuters): Taking its cue from the cartoon character Asterix, the plucky Gaul who defied the Romans, a French fast food chain is fighting an invasion of Anglo-Saxon Halloween products by celebrating an ancient local tradition instead. As pumpkins and cobwebs fill the windows of many French shops around Halloween, the Flunch chain instead celebrates the Gallic New Year with dishes like boar and cabbage, fit for a village feast circa 55 BC. Halloween is generally linked to Anglo-Saxon culture. We wanted to come back to our French roots with Gallic dishes, said Sophie Gilleron, marketing director at Flunch, which has around 150 branches. Gilleron said the Gallic promotion, which features stores decorated with cardboard druids, was in the spirit of French ancestors. The eve of the Gallic New Year was a big event and would be followed by weeks of parties. Its cool. We already have too many non-French dishes in France, said Fabrice Laurent, 30, after dinner at a branch in central Paris.

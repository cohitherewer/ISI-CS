The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Jackson the lover gets ready to party
				 	 Michael Jackson																								Los Angeles, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Michael Jackson is a lover, not a fighter, so as his attorneys traded jabs with prosecutors yesterday over charges that he molested a young boy, the self-declared King of Pop prepared for a party in his honour.																								Jackson, who was charged on Thursday with nine counts of child molestation, was expected to attend the get-together at his Neverland Valley Ranch in the foothills above Santa Barbara, his spokesman said.																								Its more or less just to support Michael and a homecoming, Stuart Backerman said. Its not like revelry or anything. Its also not a solemn event because we have a good feeling about what the outcome (of the case) is going to be.																								Backerman said friends of Jackson  who famously told ex-Beatle Paul McCartney during a duet that he was a lover, not a fighter  were throwing the party and that most of his large family would be there. The gathering was expected to extend into the evening.																								The 45-year-old entertainer, who has been largely in seclusion since police raided Neverland in November looking for evidence, was then expected to travel to Britain, Backerman said, a trip that required return of his passport from Santa Barbara prosecutors.																								Santa Barbara county district attorney Tom Sneddon said he agreed that Jackson could travel out of the country because the singer had a long-standing work commitment. Backerman said he was unaware of Jacksons plans while in England and a spokesman for his label, Sony Music Entertainment, said he did not know what obligations Jackson may have there.																								Backerman said it was also not clear how long Jackson would be in England or if he would spend Christmas there. The singer must be in a courtroom in Santa Maria, California, on January 16 for a formal reading of the charges.																								Jackson is charged with committing seven lewd acts on a boy under the age of 14, which according to court papers involved substantial sexual conduct. He is also accused of plying the boy, who has not been publicly identified, with alcohol to facilitate the abuse.																								He could go to prison for more than 20 years if found guilty and would be required under California law to register as a sex offender.																								But Jacksons family and his hard-charging lawyer, Mark Geragos, have gone on the offensive, accusing nearly everyone involved in the case with improprieties and predicting that the entertainer would be cleared.

 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Affleck rues Americas ignorance
 Manama, Dec. 24 (AFP):  Hollywood actor Ben Affleck, on a Christmas visit to US  sailors in Bahrain, confessed to a fascination with West  Asia and berated Americans for their ignorance of the issues.																								Ive always been drawn to the Middle East as an area of study because it always seems sort of mysterious and exotic, he said after cheering troops on the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise off Bahrain yesterday.																								Its interesting, really, that is the reason I was first attracted ... And its also one of the reasons I read about it and study about it, said the 31-year-old better known for his involvement with pop superstar Jennifer Lopez than the intricacies of oriental politics.																								Ever since the end of the First World War and breakup of the Ottoman empire, it seems to me that the Middle East and Gulf has been struggling to define itself and emerge from the colonial shadow. I think its the most misunderstood part of the world by certain people in the US.																								Affleck also dismissed common western stereotypes about Islam. There is a perception in some circles that Islam is inherently more violent than Christianity, the notion of jihad is inherent in Islam and leads Muslims to be more brutal than Christians. I think that is false.

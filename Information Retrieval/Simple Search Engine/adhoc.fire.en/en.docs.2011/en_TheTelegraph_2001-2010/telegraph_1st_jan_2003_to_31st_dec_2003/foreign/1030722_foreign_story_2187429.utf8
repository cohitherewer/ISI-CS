 Tuesday, July 22, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Wild ways																																	 Berlin, July 21 (Reuters): Germanys most famous ex-porn star Gina Wild has revealed she is doing a bit on the side in a Frankfurt brothel because she is addicted to sex.																																	Its a secret Ive carried around with me for a long time  I go to the brothel several times a week. Its not for the money, its to free my soul, Wild, 32, told Bild newspaper in an interview published today.																																	Wild, who is married, retired from the porn industry two years ago and wants to move into serious acting and modelling.																																	I need the satisfaction the way some other people need food, she admitted. Im addicted to sex.																																	She owned up to the moonlighting after a fan recognised her working in a Frankfurt establishment. 																													 																Fossil theft Sydney (Reuters): Thieves broke into  a museum near Sydney and snatched the fossil of a 110-million-year-old  midget dinosaur on loan from China, officials said on Monday.  The skeleton of the parrot-beaked dinosaur, one of only  six worldwide, was an evolutionary link between modern-day  birds and the typical Tyrannosaurus-type of huge dinosaur,  said Gavin Fry, director of the Newcastle Regional Museum.  Its the size of a dog but the skeleton is more like that  of a turkey, he said. Thieves eluded police and guards  on Sunday and carried off the skeleton within five minutes  of breaking through an armoured window, having first scaled  a spiked, eight-feet fence. The theft was probably motivated  by impulse. Apparently there is a market, but in this instance  Id suspect it was more opportunism and bravado than a professional  job, Fry said.																													 																Space dud Moscow (Reuters): It would have been  a match made in heaven, but it was not to be. Technical  and legal problems have forced International Space Station  commander Yuri Malenchenko to postpone his wedding, in which  he would have been separated from his bride by at least  380 km of atmosphere and space. The Russian Space Agency  said on Monday the cosmonaut would wait until he returns  to earth in October to tie the knot. The cosmonaut had a  tailcoat and ring for the wedding, which would have been  conducted either by phone or a stand-in taking the place  of the groom, but other preparations proved too problematic,  Sergei Gorbunov, spokesperson for the Russian Aviation and  Space Agency said. The ISS is not a cottage in a forest...  and you cant get there by plane, only by rocket, he added.

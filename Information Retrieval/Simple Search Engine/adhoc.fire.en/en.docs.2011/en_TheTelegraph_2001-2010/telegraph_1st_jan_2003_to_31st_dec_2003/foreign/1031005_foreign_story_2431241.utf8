 Washington, Oct. 4 (Reuters):  President George W. Bush has immortalised one of the key  moments of his presidency in a love poem to his wife, the  First Lady revealed yesterday.																								Laura Bush told a gathering at the US Library of Congress marking a weekend celebration of books in the nations capital that her husband had written the poem while she was away in Russia this week and had presented it to her on her return on Thursday.																								Dear Laura, the poem began, Roses are red, violets are blue, oh my lump in the bed, I miss you.																								The distance, my dear, has been such a barrier, next time you want an adventure, just land on a carrier.																								The President, wearing a flight suit labelled commander-in-chief, flew to the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in a navy jet on May 1 to make his declaration that major combat in Iraq was over.

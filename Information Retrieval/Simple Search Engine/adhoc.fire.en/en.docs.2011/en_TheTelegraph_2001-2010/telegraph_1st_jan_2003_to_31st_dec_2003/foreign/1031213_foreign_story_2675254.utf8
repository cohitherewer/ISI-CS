 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Bid to make Germans less grumpy
 Berlin, Dec. 12 (Reuters):  Germans should lighten up, according to their President  who says he is fed up with seeing his compatriots looking  grumpy and grim-faced.																								Germans sometimes leave a general impression of being broody, President Johannes Rau said today in a briefing with the Foreign Press Association. He said the looks on their faces at times makes him think theyre suffering indigestion.																								Germans walk around looking as if they have too much gastric acid, said Rau, 72, who retires in 2004 after five years as head of state. I wish theyd relax more.																								Rau has often admonished Germans during his five-year term for moaning and whining too much. He criticised his countrymen for excessive pessimism and exaggerating Germanys woes, even though it has the worlds third largest economy. I often complain there is too much self-pity in Germany, Rau said. Germans tend to pay not enough attention to what is happening in other continents and other countries. I wish wed would be more confident in a modest way.

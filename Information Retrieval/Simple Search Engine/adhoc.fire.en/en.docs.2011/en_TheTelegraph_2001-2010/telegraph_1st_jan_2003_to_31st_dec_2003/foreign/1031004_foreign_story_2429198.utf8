				 	 President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo 																								Manila, Oct. 3 (Reuters): Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo is almost certain to run in next Mays presidential election, reversing course after pledging last year not to stand, a close aide said today.																								Just hours later, vice-president Teofisto Guingona announced he was resigning from the ruling Lakas party, signalling that political manoeuvring had begun in earnest ahead of elections in one of Asias most turbulent democracies.																								I really dont know on the timing (of an announcement), but I know she has more or less made up her mind and she will run for election, Norberto Gonzales, the Presidents adviser on special concerns, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, May 16, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Crime amp; payment																						 Rome, May 15 (Reuters): Who said crime doesnt pay?																																	Two Italian sisters who 20-years-ago pilfered a diary belonging to Paul McCartney were rewarded this week with a face-to-face meeting with the ex-Beatle, Italian newspapers reported on Tuesday.																																	Francesca and Paola De Fazi were 10 and 11 when they broke into a London house where McCartney had once lived. They found a diary from the year 1970, full of notes, drawings and doodles in McCartneys handwriting. Some pages contained references to the break-up of the Beatles, which dominated headlines in Britain that year.																																	Paul tells John: Im not a Beatle either, read one entry from April 8. The sisters decided to give the diary back to McCartney while he was in Rome last weekend for two concerts. Diary in hand, they got past dozens of security staff at the stars hotel and finally got to meet their idol.																																	He told us we had been naughty girls. But then he thanked us for giving it back and signed autographs, one sister said.																													 																Close shave London (Reuters): German supermodel Claudia  Schiffer and her young son have emerged unhurt from a road  accident in London, newspapers reported on Thursday. Schiffer  was travelling with three-month old Caspar and film producer  husband Matthew Vaughn yesterday when their Range Rover  collided with a white van, her spokesman said. Their car  was being driven by Claudias assistant when they hit another  vehicle, the spokesman said. Claudia, Matthew, baby Caspar,  their nanny and assistant were all in the car. No one was  hurt in the incident, he added. Newspaper photos showed  a calm-looking Schiffer cradling Caspar after the accident  near fashionable Kensington High Street in west London.																													 																Goat grind																																	 San Francisco (Reuters): San Francisco, gateway to one of the most technologically advanced areas of the world, is turning back the clock and using an age-old method of clearing grass  goats. Dozens of goats were herded on to land close to San Francisco International Airport yesterday to chomp on the grass and reduce its potential as a fire hazard. We have some property just west of the airport here that is environmentally very sensitive and it is very difficult to get equipment or people in there, said Michael McCarron, director of community affairs for the airport. So we bring the goats in and they eat the vegetation as a fire prevention tool. The airport is turning to a private company, Goats-R-Us, to provide the goats and a shepherd for the swampy area over a period of two weeks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 The Boss is the best bet
 RANDY LEWIS 				 	 Bruce Springsteen  Los Angeles, Dec. 24: Bruce  Springsteen amp; the E Street Band will be crowned 2003s  top concert attraction by Pollstar in the magazines  annual ranking of the top 100 North American tours, a list  that will be finalised this week. 																								The New Jersey rocker grossed $115.9 million from 47 performances in 30 cities, according to Pollstar editor Gary Bongiovanni, placing him No. 2 on the list of the highest-grossing tours ever. The Rolling Stones 1994 tour remains the all-time champion with $121.2 million in tickets sold. 																								Ironically, the tour itinerary for 2003s second highest-grossing concert performer consists of just one city: Las Vegas. Celine Dion played 145 shows that grossed $80.5 million at the Colosseum, a $95 million showcase within Caesars Palace built expressly for her act. 																								The rest of the top 10 slots most likely will occupied by the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Cher, Simon amp; Garfunkel, the joint Aerosmith/Kiss tour, the Dixie Chicks, Billy Joel and Elton Johns combo tour and the Summer Sanitarium hard-rock caravan. Those arent necessarily in order, Bongiovanni said, as some tour figures wont be finalised until this week. 																								But as of late last week, it appeared certain a new high for total concert revenue was reached this year, in the neighbourhood of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion. The current record, set last year, is $2.1 billion worth of concert tickets sold. This years total is up almost 15 per cent from just two years ago. 																								The steady increase  this will be the fourth consecutive year ticket sales hit a new high  is considered particularly good news against the backdrop of steady declines in record sales during the same period. 																								You cant download a concert, Bongiovanni says. You can download a live concert recording, but you cant download the concert experience.					 THE LOS ANGELES TIMES- WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

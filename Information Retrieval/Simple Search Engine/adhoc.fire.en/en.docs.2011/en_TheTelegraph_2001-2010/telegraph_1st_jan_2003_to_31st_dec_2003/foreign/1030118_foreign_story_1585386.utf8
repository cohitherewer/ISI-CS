The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, January 18, 2003 				 Fifth Potter a hit before launch
																								Los Angeles, Jan. 17 (Reuters): Its magic! 																								The long-awaited fifth book in the Harry Potter series has become an instant bestseller less than 24 hours after the June publication date was announced, online book stores said today. 																								Amazon.com said it took only two hours after becoming available for pre-order for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to reach the top-selling spot.																								Amazon.coms British arm, Amazon.co.uk, said more than 30,000 customers had placed orders in 24 hours for J.K. Rowlings latest tale of the boy wizard and his adventures. 																								Barnes and Noble.com said orders had been pouring in since the announcement on Wednesday by Rowlings publishers that the 255,000 word book would be published on June 21. 																								Harry Potter fans have had to wait three years for Order of the Phoenix, which was delayed by Rowlings marriage and her subsequent pregnancy. 																								Amazon.com declined to release pre-order figures for Order of the Phoenix but said that Day 1 figures were 100 times those for the first day of pre-orders for the last book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.																								Goblet of Fire was the online bookstores largest pre-order in history with more than 400,000 advance orders worldwide. Our customers are loyal and rabid Harry Potter fans, and we are delighted to offer them the simplest, most convenient way to reserve their copies immediately, said Amazon.coms book division vice-president Steve Kessel. 																								Barnes and Noble, the worlds largest book seller, said that its stores across the US would remain open late on Friday night, June 20, and start selling the book at midnight.

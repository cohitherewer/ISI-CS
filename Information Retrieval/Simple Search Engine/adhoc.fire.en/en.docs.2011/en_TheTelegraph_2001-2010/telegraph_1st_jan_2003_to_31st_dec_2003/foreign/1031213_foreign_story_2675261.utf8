The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, December 13, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Sir Mick satisfied																																	 London, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger, once a scourge of the British establishment, received its ultimate accolade today when he was knighted by heir to the throne Prince Charles in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.																																	It was all rather wonderfully formal, the 60-year-old rock  roll icon said after the ceremony in which Charles tapped him lightly on each shoulder with a sword. Asked if he believed that he deserved the top British establishment accolade, the grinning Jagger replied: Yeah. The man who has fronted the legendary rock group for the past four decades, rejected suggestions that he had sold out to the establishment against which he had railed for so long.																						I dot really think the establishment as we knew it exists any more, he said with a slight toss of the head. But showing at least a residue of rebellion, Jagger shunned the traditional top hat and tails, opting for a long black leather coat, purple scarf and sports shoes. He took along his 92-year-old father Joe and two of his daughters to share the occasion. 																													 																Music union London (Reuters): British pop singer  Elvis Costello has married Canadian jazz artist Diana Krall  in a private ceremony in Britain, Costellos agent said  on Thursday. Diana Krall and Elvis Costello were married  in England on Saturday, December 6, the singer-songwriters  PR agency said in a statement. The wedding was a private  event with close friends and family in attendance. British  media said the wedding took place at a mansion owned by  Elton John and former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney was among  the 150 guests. Costello, 49, has been married twice before,  most recently to Cait Riordan of Irish punk-folk band  The Pogues.

 Monday, June 09, 2003 				 Blair aide sorry on dossier
 COLIN BROWN AND FRANCIS ELLIOTT				 	 Prime Minister Tony Blair with daughter Kathryn in his constituency in Sedgefield in Co Durham at a party to celebrate Blairs 20th anniversary as an MP. (Reuters)																								London, June 8: Tony Blairs closest adviser has written a personal letter apologising to Sir Richard Dearlove, the chief of the secret intelligence service, for discrediting the service with the release to journalists last January of the so-called dodgy dossier on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.																								The disclosure that Alastair Campbell, the Prime Ministers director of strategy and communications, apologised to the head of MI6 for the dossier, Iraq: Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation, will fuel claims that Downing Street was involved in doctoring intelligence reports before the war.																								The Daily Telegraph has learnt that Campbell put his apology in writing to end a potentially damaging row with the intelligence service over the dossier after it was revealed that parts were lifted via the internet from a 12-year-old thesis by an American student.																								Senior intelligence officers were furious that randomly assembled material had been combined with MI6 reports by the coalition information centre, a special unit set up by Campbell inside the foreign office.																								The information was not put through the normal checks in Whitehall, including the approval of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), chaired by John Scarlett, before it was published. One intelligence officer disowned the document at the time, saying: We are not responsible for this bastard offspring.																								It is not clear whether the apology to Sir Richard  known as C  was written on the orders of the Prime Minister or on Campbells own initiative. He will be questioned about the disclosure by MPs who are investigating allegations that Blair duped the country to hasten the war on Iraq, made by Clare Short, the former international development secretary.																								Senior members of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, chaired by the Labour MP Donald Anderson, said they would summon Campbell to give evidence. Blair and Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, will be called as well. We will want to question Campbell about his role in this, said a senior Labour member of the committee. Blair, Campbell and Straw will be called to give evidence by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), which is carrying out a parallel inquiry. 																								The ISC, which reports directly to Blair, will reveal in its annual report tomorrow that it called on the Prime Minister to co-operate with an inquiry into the use of intelligence reports on Iraq by Downing Street a month ago. Committee members were annoyed that Blair refused to give his approval until last week, when pressure for an inquiry became intense. quot;We asked him in early May  to co-operate. He has only replied now because of the pressure, quot;  said one MP on the committee. Mr Blair is continuing to  resist Tory demands for a full judicial independent inquiry  into claims that he misled the country with two intelligence  dossiers. In a report last September, which  was attacked by Ms Short, Mr Blair claimed that Saddam Hussein  was able to deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45  minutes. This report was cleared by the JIC and the intelligence  service remains convinced, like Mr Blair, that its assertions  will be proved to be accurate. Mr Campbell has never publicly  admitted his role in the preparation of the much more controversial  January document. That second dossier, passed to journalists  on Mr Blairs trip to Washington to discuss war plans,  said it drew upon quot;a number of sources, including intelligence  material quot;. The second dossier prompted widespread  criticism of the quality of British intelligence in the  run-up to the war in Iraq. A senior Whitehall official said:  quot;It devalued the currency, there is no question about  that. There is a dispute about who saw what. But it is clear  that the Joint Intelligence Committee was not involved.  It was a monumental cock-up. quot;					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

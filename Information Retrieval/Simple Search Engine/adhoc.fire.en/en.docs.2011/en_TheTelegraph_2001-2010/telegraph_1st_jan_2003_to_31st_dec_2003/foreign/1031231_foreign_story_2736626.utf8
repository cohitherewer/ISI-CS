 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Buy Britain for $8 trillion
																								London, Dec. 30 (AFP): Want to buy a largish island off France? 																								Slightly used, with annex. Rains a bit. Trains often late. Nice gardens. Food dubious, but lots of places to drink. 																								Yours for under 5 trillion. Or 7.1 trillion euros. Or $8.8 trillion. If the 58,789,194 occupants ever care to sell, that is.																								The Office for National Statistics (ONS) whipped up a price tag for the United Kingdom  thats Britain, comprising England, Wales, Scotland, plus northern Ireland  in a year-end tally of the nations capital assets.																								The precise figure is 4.983 trillion, or 84,760.47 for every man, woman and child as of April 2001.																								The value of buildings, vehicles, machinery, bridges, roads, shares and bank accounts are included in the total, which is based on 2002 data.																								We found that 5 trillion was the current market value of the United Kingdom, including the value of the land, said ONS statistician Ian Hill.																								That has risen a lot over the last few years because the property prices have shot up, with the value of peoples homes doubling since 1994, Hill said.																								The estimate is the first of its kind in terms of detail from the ONS, a British government agency, and is based on a much more robust system of analysing investment data, Hill said. 																								Holiday fines																								The education ministry warned parents of British schoolchildren today that they could be fined up to 100 if they took their families on holiday in term time without permission.																								Taking a child out of school for a holiday without the heads permission is unacceptable and will be treated as truancy, a junior education minister, Ivan Lewis, said in a statement.																								A law passed earlier this year gives head teachers the authority to fine parents whose children are persistently absent without reason.																								The penalty could also be applied in exceptional circumstances, for example where a parent has taken their child on holiday in term time without the schools permission, the statement noted.																								Lewis said schools were empowered to allow children to take up to 10 days holiday a year during term time but this should be the exception, not the rule.

																								Phnom Penh, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Cambodian military police fired shots in the air today and put armoured vehicles on the streets of the capital after a nationalist mob torched the Thai embassy and attacked Thai businesses, witnesses said.

The Thai ambassador to Phnom Penh, speaking by telephone to a Thai television station, said he and other staff had climbed over the wall of the embassy to escape. All 10 embassy staffers were safe.																								Elsewhere in the capital, angry crowds set fire to overturned cars and attacked Thai-owned and other foreign businesses into the night.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Islamabad, Dec. 29: Pakistan today said a few nuclear scientists are still under investigation in connection with the on-going debriefings for alleged transfer of nuclear-related technology to Iran.																								What we need is patience as it will take time to conclude the debriefings, foreign office spokesperson Masood Khan said. 																								Five weeks back, authorities began questioning scientists from the state-run Kahuta Research Laboratory set up by the father of the countrys nuclear programme, Abdul Qadeer Khan, after being approached by the UNs International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and information from the Iranian government that pointed to certain individuals.																								We are fully cooperating with the IAEA, he said, adding that A.Q. Khan had also been quizzed. However, he said he had no information if any army officials were also being questioned.

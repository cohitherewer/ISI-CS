 Monday, April 14, 2003 				 Saddam neighbours sceptical of hit
 MICHAEL SLACKMAN 				 	 US army specialist David Buchanan tries a chair at Saddam Husseins palace on Sunday. (AFP)																								Baghdad, April 13: Ask residents of Baghdads Al Mansour district if they think Saddam Husseins remains are at the bottom of a 60-foot pit blasted out of their neighbourhood last week by US bombs, and the answer will probably be no. 																								Its not that they believe the security-conscious president was hiding elsewhere. 																								The US just hit the wrong house, they say. 																								Right next to the rubble-strewn hole is a two-storey white stucco home that has become the focus of intense speculation. 																								Some neighbours believe Saddam was using it as a hide-out. No one knows for sure, of course, and it may well be a case of gossip run amok. 																								But neighbours say there is evidence to prove their suspicions. 																								Chances that Saddam was there are more than 90 per cent, I think, said Saad Waali, 51, a retired general who lives nearby. 																								Exhibit 1: The five telephone lines hooked into the house. 																								This isnt gossip. Anyone can see the five black wires running off a pole on the street and into the first floor. 																								Five lines may be extravagant even by western standards for a residence, but here, no one has five lines. 																								Thats not just extraordinary; its impossible in Iraq, said Gorgees Toma, 62, who lives next door. 																								Exhibit 2: The desk. 																								When the four, 2,000-pound bombs fell Monday in what US officials called a major strike on a leadership target, residents focused their attention on the houses that were obliterated. 																								But as days went by, and the shock began to fade, people realised that a house bordering the crater was empty. So they looted it. 																								Once people got inside, rumours started swirling that this was the house Saddam was using, and that the Americans had hit the wrong target. 																								The main reason was the desk. 																								Step inside the front door, into the modest, rectangular living room, and there is only one piece of furniture left. 																								It is a large desk at the back of the room. Its not the kind of desk an ordinary person would put in the living room, or even in their home. 																								It has a heavy wood top, about six feet long, on a rather gaudy wooden base. 																								To the residents of Al Mansour, it looks just like the desk Saddam sat behind in televised broadcasts during the war. 																								Saddam is known to sleep in a different place every night and is believed to have told only a very small circle of loyalists of his location. 																								It was known to everyone that he had a hide-out in ordinary houses, Toma said.																								Nobody knew he was here. If we did, we could have left. 																								The evidence that he was in this particular house remains circumstantial, but to the residents, it is convincing. 																								In addition to the phone lines and the desk, theres the wood dining table that seems too large for the room it was in, the fancy sofa set (which was looted) and the pile of bread and potatoes on the floor. 																								The bread, which appeared to be little sandwich rolls, looked like the kind served as military rations; Saddam always travelled with military security. 																								Locals say that some months ago  two by one account, seven by another  the residents of this house sold it or rented it out. In the days and weeks afterward, people dressed in shabby clothing  perhaps disguises  were showing up in taxis, one neighbour said. 																								Another neighbour, who was a member of Saddams Baath Party, said he had asked two men who had parked in the driveway to see their identification. 																								He thought they might be criminals, but their documents indicated they were drivers for state general security, he said. 																								Shortly after the bomb attack transformed this block into a massive hole, residents were reluctant to talk to the foreign press about the former president. 																								With Saddams government now gone, the attitude among many has changed, though there remains lingering fear.																								Even US officials say theyre not sure Saddam is dead. 																								Perhaps, residents here think, Saddam is alive and plans to come back. 																								One neighbour said a man was seen running out the houses kitchen door as the bombs struck. 																								Do you think he will come back? Mustafa, 40, a veterinarian, asked as he gaped at the crater. 																								He declined to give his last name. We cannot take anything for granted, he said.

 Tuesday, December 09, 2003  Distortion stain on Putin stranglehold
 Liberal parties wiped out
				 	 A crow flies above Lenins monument in downtown Kiev. (AFP)																								Moscow, Dec. 8 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin today hailed as a step toward democracy the poll that stacked parliament with his allies but western observers called it overwhelmingly distorted and Washington expressed concern.																								The fourth such election since the Soviet Unions collapse crushed Putins communist and liberal opponents  prompting warnings of a return to authoritarian rule  and effectively guaranteed him a second term in Marchs presidential poll.																								It could also give him enough votes to change the constitution so he can run for a third term. Putins supporters say the pro-Kremlin majority will hand the ex-KGB spy more powers to push economic reform and fight corruption. Critics fear the death of democracy after a strong nationalist showing all but wiped out liberal parties.																								The election is another step in strengthening democracy in the Russian Federation, Putin told senior officials.																								But the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a rights and democracy watchdog, said the vote was skewed by the use of state resources to promote pro-Putin United Russia.																								In this election the enormous advantage of incumbency and access to state equipment, resources and buildings led to the election result being overwhelmingly distorted, said Bruce George, president of the OSCEs parliamentary assembly.																								It is even more regrettable that the main impression of the overall electoral process is that it was one of regression in the democratisation process of this country, he added																								In Washington, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said: We share those concerns  A fact which underlines the importance of Russian legislators dedicating themselves to pushing through the political and economic reform agenda																								The leader of the Communist Party, facing a second death after its rebirth in the chaos of the 1990s, called the election a farce and accused the Kremlin of rigging the vote. You are all participants in a revolting spectacle which for some reason is called an election, Gennady Zyuganov said.																								Created by the Kremlin for the last election in 1999 to help Putins rise to power, United Russia won 37.1 per cent of the vote, the central election commission said. Its slogan was: Together with the President.																								The communists  Putins main opposition  had only 12.7 per cent, well down from the 24 per cent they won in 1999.																								Ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskys party  which backs the Kremlin on key issues  won 11.6 per cent and Motherland, seen by many as a Kremlin creation to draw off votes from the communists, had 9.1 per cent. That means the pro-Kremlin bloc could get the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution to allow Putin a third four-year term  although he ruled that out in June.																								The vote reflected widespread support for Putins efforts to restore central control since succeeding Boris Yeltsin in 2000 and ending the chaos of the early reform years.																								Yesterdays election shows what the Russian people actually think: they are stridently nationalist, want wealth redistributed and have little interest in liberal or democratic values, Aton brokerage said in a research note.																								Russian stocks closed higher as the market, still jittery over a Kremlin-led attack on Russias richest businessman, saw new hope for economic reforms.																								Former Yukos chief Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested in October on charges of tax evasion and fraud, raising fears that the Kremlin might review results of 1990s privatisations.

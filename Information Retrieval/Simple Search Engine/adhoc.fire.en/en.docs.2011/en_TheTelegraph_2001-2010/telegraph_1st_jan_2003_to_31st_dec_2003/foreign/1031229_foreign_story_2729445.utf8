 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Fraud charge lands Italy tycoon in jail
				 	 Calisto Tanzi 																								Milan, Dec. 28 (Reuters): An Italian judge today ordered the arrest of Parmalat founder Calisto Tanzi on suspicion of market rigging and false auditing, judicial sources said.																								Police picked up Tanzi yesterday for questioning under a 48-hour detention order issued by prosecutors in Parma, near the headquarters of the global food group, which is engulfed in a multi-billion-euro accounting scandal.																								Prosecutors from Milan and Parma questioned Tanzi in Milans San Vittore jail for more than six-and-a-half hours today over suspected fraud, criminal association and market rigging, judicial sources said.																								Tanzi, the wealthy head of Italys eighth-biggest industrial group until less than two weeks ago, spent the night in a jail cell after authorities detained him on a Milan street last evening and took him into custody, they said.																								The Milan judge later issued an order, requested by Milan prosecutors, to arrest Tanzi, enabling authorities to keep him in custody for questioning beyond the 48 hours in the detention order.																								Investigators tomorrow plan to continue interrogating Tanzi, who is suspected of having misappropriated hundreds of millions of euros from his family-controlled firm, the judicial sources said. Tanzi has not been charged with any crimes.																								Its a difficult time for him, but theyve arranged things well for him, Tanzis lawyer, Fabio Belloni, told reporters outside the San Vittore prison. 																								Tanzi is at the centre of a criminal investigation into suspected fraud at Parmalat, which has raised far-reaching questions about the conduct of the companys senior managers, its auditors and banks.																								The scandal erupted earlier this month when Parmalat, which has 35,000 employees in some 30 countries, revealed a hole in its accounts that investigators said could top 10 billion euros ($12.4 billion).																								Italys biggest corporate crisis in more than a decade threatens billions of euros of investments by holders of shares and bonds, as well as some two billion euros in bank loans.																								In a day of reckoning yesterday, Parmalat, now headed by a government-appointed rescue administrator, was declared insolvent by a Parma court, hours before Tanzi was detained.																								Insolvency allows Parmalat to remain in operation and to continue paying workers, dairy farmers and suppliers, putting thousands of financial creditors on hold while it draws up a recovery plan within six months.

 Wednesday, April 30, 2003 				 Bruce backs anti-war Chicks
 RAFER GUZMAN 				 	 Bruce Springsteen																								New York, April 29: The Boss has posted a brief statement on his website, www.brucespringsteen.net, supporting the Dixie Chicks, whose anti-war comments have led radio stations to ban their songs. 																								To me, theyre terrific American artists expressing American values by using their American right to free speech, Bruce Springsteen writes on the web site. For them to be banished wholesale from radio stations, and even entire radio networks, for speaking out is un-American. 																								The flap arose after Dixie Chicks singer Natalie Maines told a crowd of London concertgoers last month: Just so you know, were ashamed the President of the US is from Texas. (Maines also hails from the Lone Star State.) 																								Maines later apologised in a statement to the President, but many radio stations continue to boycott the groups songs. Sales of its Grammy-winning album, Home, have suffered. Still, ticket sales for the Chicks upcoming US tour have been brisk, with many shows selling out within minutes. 																								I dont know what happens next, but I do want to add my voice to those who think that the Dixie Chicks are getting a raw deal, Springsteen writes. I send them my support.

 Thursday, November 13, 2003 				 Zeta-Jones threatens suit on diet claims
 															- Star  condemns atkins regime 				 	 Catherine Zeta-Jones																								Catherine Zeta-Jones was the envy of many new mothers when she shed four stone with amazing speed after giving birth.																								But, fresh from two recent legal actions, the Welsh actress threatened on Tuesday to sue anyone who attributed her weight loss to the controversial Atkins diet. 																								The hugely fashionable high protein, no carbohydrate regime has been openly embraced by other glamourous actresses, including Julia Roberts, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jennifer Aniston.																								Zeta-Jones, however, denies ever following the diet and claims it is unhealthy. The actress, who found fame in Hollywood with her role in Zorro and whose latest film is Intolerable Cruelty, says she has a responsibility to young women who look up to her and admire her beautiful appearance.																								A lawyer for Zeta-Jones said: According to publications around the world, the Atkins diet has been derided by nutritionists and other health officials for decades.																								By stating that Zeta-Jones uses and/or endorses the Atkins diet, those publications are falsely representing to the average reader, including many young women who look up to my client and admire her beautiful appearance, that Zeta-Jones would recommend this diet to any person looking to lose weight. My client is being made to look as if she is more concerned about her outward appearance than she is with serious health concerns. Nothing could be further from the truth.																								The attorneys say they are currently investigating the stories and we intend to pursue claims on her behalf against each and every publication responsible for the creation and initial growth of these false and damaging stories.																								A copy of the letter first surfaced on the website www.thesmokinggun.com. Zeta-Jones attorney John Lavely, who signed the letter, could not be reached for comment.																								The statement comes a week after Zeta-Jones, 34, and her husband, Michael Douglas, 59, were awarded 14,600 damages against Hello!, the celebrity gossip magazine, which printed unauthorised photographs of their wedding. They brought the action partly because Zeta-Jones claimed the pictures made her look fat. She told the High Court: The photograph made me look large.																								From a professional point of view this is an example of a photograph I would never have allowed to be published because it was extremely important for my career that I regained my figure after giving birth.																								Although the couple won their claim that the magazine breached commercial confidence, they were awarded a lot less than the 600,000 damages they sought.																								Zeta-Jones claimed during the High Court case in London earlier this year that 1 million is a lot of money maybe to a lot of people in this room, but it is not that much for us.																								The actress is also suing Caudalie, the French cosmetics company, for 10 million, for allegedly using her name to promote its products without her permission. Reports that Zeta-Jones had used the Atkins diet were widely published after she regained her hourglass figure within three months of giving birth to her son, Dylan, in August 2000.																								She reportedly lost two stone on that occasion, and shed four stone after giving birth to her daughter Carys seven months ago. Zeta-Jones lawyer said her anger stemmed partly from the worry that the association of her valuable name with the diet could not only damage her reputation but also affect her ability to sign future endorsements with health-related products.																								The Atkins diet was invented 30 years ago by Dr Robert Atkins, who died in April after falling on ice and hitting his head. It recommends that, to achieve rapid weight loss, followers should eat high levels of meat and cheese and severely restrict their intake of bread, pasta and starchy vegetables.																								But medical experts have warned that those on the diet increase the risk of developing diabetes, bowel cancer, kidney stones, liver problems and weak bones. A spokesman for the Atkins company claimed it did not know how Zeta-Jones name became linked with the diet. Its never been our policy to seek celebrity endorsements, he said.						THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

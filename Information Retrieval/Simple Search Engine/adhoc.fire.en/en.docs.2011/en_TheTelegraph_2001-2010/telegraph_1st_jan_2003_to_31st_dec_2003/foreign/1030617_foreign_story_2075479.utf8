The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, June 17, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Potter amp; postmen																																	 London, June 16 (AFP): Britains royal mail is to make extra vans available to deliver half-a-million copies of the new Harry Potter novel next weekend, amid fears that the newest tome of the popular series could weigh heavily on the countrys postmen.																																	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the latest edition of a massively popular series, is to be published on Saturday and weighs in at a hefty 1 kg.																																	 that safety regulations allow British postmen to carry a maximum of 16 kg, officials are making plans to make sure every book reaches its destination without postal workers suffering damage to their backs.																																	A spokesperson for the Royal Mail said: Because the book is very large and heavy, we are making contingency plans so that deliveries can be made using vans. We have plans in place to ensure a successful delivery and to avoid disappointment.																																	The book, fifth in the series is 768 pages long. It recounts the magical exploits of Harry and his wizard school friends and his struggle against evil Lord Voldemort.																													 																Whale whack Wellington (Reuters): A New Zealand  man trying to free a 15-metre humpback whale ensnared in  lobster pot ropes is missing and presumed dead after being  hit by the whales tail, police said on Monday. The 38-year-old,  who has not yet been named, had gone to the aid of a whale  in waters near the popular whale-watching town of Kaikoura,  140 km south of Wellington. He was trying to cut the rope  free from the whales tail and the whale lifted its tail  and struck him, Kaikoura police Sergeant Tony Yardley said.  A four-hour search by boats and a helicopter found no sign  of the man and he was presumed dead, Yardley added. Several  species of whale are attracted to the deep, food-rich waters  off the coast of Kaikoura, which in turn attract large numbers  of tourists to the region.																													 																Pension plan																																	 Canberra (Reuters): An Australian brothel is offering pensioners a 5 per cent discount in what it boasts is a world first. Neil Campbell, owner of the Viper Room in the east coast city of Brisbane, said men in their 60s, 70s, and 80s were among regular visitors to the brothel, but many complained it was a drain on their pensions. All other businesses offer pensioners a discount, so we thought if we also offered pensioners a discount they might come more often, Campbell said on Monday. He said the offer of a 5 per cent discount on the usual hourly fee of A$210 ($140) would initially apply only on Sundays, but the offer would be extended if it proved successful.																																	Prostitution is legal in some parts of Australia but brothels need to meet certain standards to earn a licence. An Australia bordello, the Daily Planet, became the worlds first publicly owned brothel last month when it listed on the Australian stock exchange.

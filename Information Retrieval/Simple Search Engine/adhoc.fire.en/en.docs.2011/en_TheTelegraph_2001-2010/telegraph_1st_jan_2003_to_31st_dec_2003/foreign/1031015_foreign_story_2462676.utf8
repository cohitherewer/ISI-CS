 Wednesday, October 15, 2003 				 Blast near Turkish mission
																								Baghdad, Oct. 14 (Reuters): A suicide bomber killed himself and wounded 10 people when his car exploded outside the Turkish embassy in Baghdad today, the US military said.																								Colonel Pete Mansoor said a car was driven towards the entrance of the heavily-fortified mission. It blew up, killing the driver and wounding several bystanders. Local hospitals said they treated 10 wounded, one with critical head injuries.																								Turkeys parliament last week agreed to send troops to join American and other foreign troops trying to stabilise Iraq after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in April. US troops sealed off the area around the embassy with razor wire and turned journalists away as ambulances and a fire crew rushed to the scene.																								A Turkish foreign ministry official in Ankara condemned the attack. Just like the attack on the UN, this attack shows the security situation in Iraq is terrible, the official said.

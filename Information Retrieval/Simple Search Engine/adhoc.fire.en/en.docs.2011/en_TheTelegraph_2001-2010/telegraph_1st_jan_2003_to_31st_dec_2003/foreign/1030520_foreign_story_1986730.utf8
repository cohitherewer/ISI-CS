 Tuesday, May 20, 2003 				 Another suicide blast in Israel
																								Afula (Israel), May 19 (Reuters): A suspected Palestinian suicide bomber struck an Israeli shopping mall today, killing three people and extending a new wave of bloodshed that has battered prospects for a US-backed peace plan.																								It was the fifth suicide attack in three days by Palestinian militants sworn to wreck the road map peace initiative embraced by a new reform-minded Palestinian leadership but not by Israels Right-wing government, which objects on security grounds.																								In Washington, US President George W. Bush said that despite the latest bombings he would persevere with the plan for a Palestinian state co-existing alongside Israel by 2005.																								The bomber appeared to have detonated his explosives when confronted by a woman security guard at the entrance to the shopping centre in the northern town of Afula, witnesses said.																								There is no doubt our methods of security... prevented a far biggest attack, said regional police chief Yakov Borovsky.																								The guard and bomber were among the dead and 17 people were wounded in what witnesses described as a huge explosion.

Angels of action Berlin, July 9 (Reuters): Hollywood actresses Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu said yesterday they didnt care how much their film Charlies Angels: Full Throttle makes at the box office or whether it matches the success of its predecessor.It doesnt mean anything to us, Diaz said in an interview with journalists in Berlin ahead of the German premiere of the Columbia Pictures film.

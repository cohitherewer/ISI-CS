 Wednesday, July 30, 2003 				 Arnie terminates governor run
 HUGH DAVIES				 	 Arnold Schwarzenegger Los Angeles, July 29: Only  days after Arnold Schwarzenegger threatened to flex his  biceps in the political arena, the actor has decided to  stick to films.																								According to Fox News and at least one respected Hollywood columnist the actor has told friends that he will not be running for the office of California governor. Schwarzenegger, 55, who was paid nearly 20 million for his latest box office hit, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, is said to have spoken about his decision to Richard Riordan, a former Los Angeles mayor and close friend. 																								Riordan said that he would support the star in a second if he decided to run as he was a sensational candidate. The former mayor said he would enter the race if Schwarzenegger decided to drop out.																								Until last night, the actor seemed all set, especially as the recall election for the governor on October 7 would be his easiest chance of victory. Voters will decide if the unpopular Democratic governor, Gray Davis, is fit to continue in office. If not a poll will be taken of rivals.																								This would have meant that Schwarzenegger could have run swiftly as a middle-of-the road Republican without a primary contest in the party. A popular figure in California, where he has defied his somewhat primitive screen image with eloquent speeches about education, he may have been dissuaded by his wife, Maria Shriver, a veteran television news reporter.																								She was said to be worried about the exposure of her family in such a media-mad state. President John F Kennedy and his brother Robert Kennedy, both assassinated, were her uncles. The actor would have had to weather personal attacks following a magazine article that alleged he had indulged in sexual high-jinks on film sets, a claim that he has rejected as nonsense.																								However, the movie muscleman revels in putting Hollywood on hold  making A-list producers, directors and writers wait until the last moment before green-lighting one project or another. Therefore, he could still change his mind.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

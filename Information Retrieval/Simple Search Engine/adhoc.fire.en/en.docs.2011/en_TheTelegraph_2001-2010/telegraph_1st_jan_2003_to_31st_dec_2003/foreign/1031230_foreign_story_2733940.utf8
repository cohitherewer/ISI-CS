Jackson jail Washington (PTI): Pop star Michael Jackson  has said police manhandled him during his arrest last month  on child molestation charges and caused a dislocated shoulder  from the way he was handcuffed. It is hurting me very badly,  he said in an interview to CBS channels 60 minutes  aired on Sunday. After surrendering to the authorities in  Santa Barbara, California, he was released on $3 million  bail. They were supposed to go in and just check fingerprints,  and do the whole thing that they do when they take somebody  in. They manhandled me. My shoulder is dislocated literally,  he said. The pain from being handcuffed behind his back,  he said, keeps me from sleeping at night. He said he was  locked in a restroom for 45 minutes after he asked to use  the facilities.

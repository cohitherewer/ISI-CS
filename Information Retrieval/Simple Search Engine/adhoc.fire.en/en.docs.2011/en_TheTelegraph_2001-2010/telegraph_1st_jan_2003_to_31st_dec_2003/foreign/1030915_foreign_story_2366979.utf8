 Monday, September 15, 2003 				 Iran ignores nuclear hawks
																								Tehran, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Iran will continue to co-operate with the UNs nuclear watchdog, a senior official was quoted as saying today, despite hardliners calls for Iran to reject a UN deadline to prove it has no atomic arms programme.																								Using softer language than in recent days, Irans ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Ali Salehi said Tehran would not make nervous and tough reactions to a tough IAEA resolution last week on Irans nuclear programme.																								We will continue our co-operation with the IAEA as before and our clear criticism does not mean we will sever our co-operation with the agency, the state-run Iran newspaper quoted him as saying.																								But he added that Iran should not show total obedience to the Wests demands since that could pave the way for unlimited demands.																								The IAEA has accused Tehran of failing to provide full and accurate information about its nuclear programme. Iran says its nuclear facilities are solely geared to generating electricity. 																								A resolution passed by the IAEAs governing board on Friday called on Iran to clear up lingering doubts by October 31 and suspend all uranium enrichment activities. The resolution implied that if the IAEA still had concerns about Irans nuclear activities in November, it could declare Tehran in breach of international obligations and report it to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions.																								Iran insists it has no nuclear arms ambitions and accuses Washington of seeking a pretext to invade the Islamic Republic, as it has its neighbours Afghanistan and Iraq.																								Several hardline Iranian commentators have said Iran should follow North Koreas lead by expelling IAEA inspectors for good and pulling out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Irans foreign ministry spokesperson Hamid Reza Asefi today said Tehrans future co-operation with the IAEA was under review. The relevant authorities are discussing it and our decision will be made public in future. We havent made a concrete decision on how to continue cooperation with the IAEA, he said.																								Asefi described the IAEA resolution as politically-motivated and said its three co-sponsors  Australia, Canada and Japan  had made a grave mistake. 																								Diplomats in Tehran said Irans decision-making process was complicated by divisions in the ruling establishment. While the reformist government led by President Mohammad Khatami has been pushing for greater cooperation with the IAEA, powerful hardliners close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have argued the opposite.

 Thursday, October 23, 2003 				 US too prudish: Clooney
				 	 George Clooney Hamburg, Oct. 22 (AFP):  Hollywood actor George Clooney says American society is  too prudish  one of the reasons why he would not follow  his fellow actor Arnold Schwarzenegger into politics, he  said in a German magazine interview published yesterday. 																								He told Woman magazine that Schwarzeneggers win this month in the California governorship race showed that candidates could only be successful in American politics if they denied things they did earlier in their lives. 																								You read in the media that (Schwarzenegger) was already gushing about wanting to become governor of California 25 years ago  today he denies that, he said. 																								I always say you have to stand by what youve done. Yes, I smoked grass. Yes, I had sex with more than one person. In the US, they make a big deal out of everything as soon as you run for higher office. Its time we did away with this bigotry in America. 																								Clooney, a life-long Democrat, also underscored his opposition to the US-led war in Iraq. 																								I stand by that. It was the dumbest thing that my country could have done. As an actor in the public eye, I have a responsibility. I see myself as a spokesman for all those who have the same opinion, he said, in comments published in German.

 Thursday, September 18, 2003 				 Royal jugglery
				 	 Stephanie																								Princess Stephanie of Monaco, whose romantic liais- ons have often left her father Prince Rainier on the brink of despair, has secretly married a circus acrobat.																								The 38-year-old princess, a mother of three with an apparent penchant for big top performers, wed Portuguese handstand expert and juggler Adans Lopez Peres, who is 10 years her junior. Lopez Peres works for Franco Knie, a married elephant trainer and ringmaster of the renowned Circus Knie in Switzerland, with whom Princess Stephanie had an affair two years ago.																								It is Stephanies second marriage. Her first, to a former bodyguard, Daniel Ducret, came to an end when he was filmed enthusiastically enjoying the charms of a Belgian stripper by a swimming pool. Last weeks marriage was held in Switzerland and no members of the Monaco royal family were present.																								A royal family spokesman confirmed the wedding, telling The Daily Telegraph: It happened in a village near Geneva. It was a private ceremony. Neither family was present. He denied that Prince Rainier had accepted the marriage. He wants his children to be happy, he said.																								Reports in Germany that Prince Rainier agreed to the marriage because Stephanie told him she was pregnant, were not confirmed. The princess had two children  Louis, 10, and Pauline, nine  with her first husband.																								When that marriage failed she embarked on a relationship with another bodyguard, Jean-Raymond Gottlie. A third child, Camille, five, was born but the princess has never named the father.																								Stephanie is the second daughter of Prince Rainier and the late Princess Grace, for-merly the Hollywood actress Grace Kelly.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

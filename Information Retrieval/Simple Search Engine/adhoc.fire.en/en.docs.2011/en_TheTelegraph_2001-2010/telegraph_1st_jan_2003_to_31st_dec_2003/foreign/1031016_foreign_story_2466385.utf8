 Thursday, October 16, 2003 				 Data transfer record on Net
																								Geneva, Oct. 15 (Reuters): Two major scientific research centres said today they had set a new world speed record for sending data across the Internet, equivalent to transferring a full-length DVD film in seven seconds.																								The European Organisation for Nuclear Research, CERN, said the feat, doubling the previous top speed, was achieved in a nearly 30-minute transmission over 7,000 km of network between Geneva and a partner body in California.																								CERN, whose laboratories straddle the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, said it had sent 1.1 terabytes of data at 5.44 gigabits a second (Gbps) to a lab at the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech, on October 1.

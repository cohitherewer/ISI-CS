 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Author takes clown fish claim to Disney door
 KIM WILLSHER 				 	 A scene from Disneys Finding Nemo Paris, Dec. 28: A young  French author is taking on the Disney Corporation, claiming  that it copied his idea for a lovable cartoon fish in its  hit film Finding Nemo.																								Franck le Calvez says that the clown fish, whose antics are delighting children everywhere, bears an uncanny resemblance to his creation, Pierrot Le Poisson-Clown, which he claims he dreamed up in 1995. 																								He is now suing Walt Disney Pictures and its distribution company, claiming damages for breach of copyright and trademark, and demanding they withdraw Nemo books and merchandise from French shops. Disney has hired five lawyers to fight the case.																								Le Calvez, 33, who is also a marine lawyer, suspected something fishy was going on when he learned of the Disney movies release in the US earlier this year. It was not simply the uncanny physical likeness  white stripes, large, bulging orange eyes  between Nemo and Pierrot, which he created when he was a student and aspiring film-maker. 																								Considering that one clown fish probably looks much like another, he reasoned that the resemblance could have been coincidental. But the plot seemed strangely familiar, too. 																								In Finding Nemo, the fish lives in an anemone and loses his mother when she is swallowed by a predator. Pierrot also lives in an anemone and is blighted when his father falls prey to a scorpion fish. One of the characters Pierrot encounters is a cleaning prawn. A cleaning prawn also turns up during Nemos odyssey.																								Now Le Calvez is fighting to prevent his book, which has a print run of 3,000, being swallowed up by the big American fish. He claims that French bookshops have stopped stocking his work, saying it is too similar to Disneys version. There is a definite similarity between the two fish, Le Calvez said. 																								And the beginning of the story is the same, even if the scenarios then become different. Whats really upsetting is that quite a few bookshops wont sell my book because they think that I have plagiarised Nemo.																								When Le Calvez created Pierrot, he took a screenplay featuring the character to a number of production companies in France but could not arouse any interest. In 2000 he gave up, deciding instead to turn Pierrot into the hero of a childrens book. He invested 40,000 in publishing 2,000 copies, which sold out in November 2002.																								Le Calvez brought out a second book and, in February this year, registered his clown fish as a trademark in order to produce Pierrot souvenirs. 																								His lawyer, Pascal Kamina, says the author was shocked when the Nemo film came out a few months later. It is true that when Le Calvezs first book came out the film was finished, but the fact is that he had the idea of this character first. He had taken it around quite a number of film production companies after 1995 so maybe thats how the idea found its way to America. That would be the only explanation.																								Disney denies plagiarism and says Nemo is 100 per cent original. 																								An initial hearing before a French judge has been scheduled for February.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

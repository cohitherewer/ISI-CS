 Wednesday, January 01, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Sync with Spears																																	 Los Angeles, Dec.31 (Reuters): Pop star Justin Timberlake may have slammed ex-girlfriend Britney Spears in his new video, but he says he still has strong feelings for the pop princess.																																	I may not ever get over her, Timberlake, 21, said in a Rolling Stone magazine cover story. I really do still love that girl.																																	Timberlake, the most prominent member of boy-band N Sync, ended their three-and-a-half-year relationship earlier this year. Timberlake says he pulled the plug after she cheated on him. (Spears, also 21, has denied any cheating was involved.)																																	While Timberlake has since been linked with actress Alyssa Milano, the Rolling Stone story indicated that the most important woman in his life is his mother, Lynn Harless. Timberlake recently released his debut solo album, Justified. The video for the new single, Cry Me A River, depicts a guy getting even with his wayward girlfriend  a Spears look-alike.																																	 though the teen pop phenomenon is fading fast, Timberlake said N Sync plans to start recording a new album in the fall.

 Saturday, November 01, 2003 				 Streisand suits up for grabs
				 	 Barbra Streisand																								Los Angeles, Oct. 31 (Reuters): People  people who need pantsuits  are about to become the luckiest people in the world.																								Entertainer Barbra Streisand is to auction off hundreds of her outfits and items of personal memorabilia for the first time to benefit charities close to her heart.																								The initial item for sale on Ebay will be one of Streisands most recognisable outfits  the Arnold Scaasi-designed two piece evening pantsuit she wore in 1969 to collect her best actress Oscar for Funny Girl. The pantsuit will carry a reserve price of $1,000.																								The Internet auction will offer famous items from her wardrobe and other effects. It will last for at least a year, giving what organisers say is a rare opportunity for fans to buy into one of the worlds most collectible celebrities. Auctions in the 1990s by the singer-actress of some of her furniture and art established record prices, but Streisand, 61, has never before sold off her personal items. 																								While we have conducted other celebrity auctions, we have observed that the greatest market demand has been for Barbra Streisand materials and personal effects, and these have never before become available for auction, said Darren Julien, whose JulienEntertainment.com is producing the auction.																								A new Streisand item will be put up for auction every day, and will be available for bidding for 10 days. Each item will come with a certificate of authenticity. 																								The sale will last at least a year and could be extended to three years. Julien said other items would include one of Streisands costumes from the 1974 movie For Petes Sake and the hat she wore from the 1970 movie On a Clear Day You Can See Forever.

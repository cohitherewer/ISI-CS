 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Warrant for Lindh suspect
																								Stockholm, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Swedish police said today they had issued a warrant for the arrest of the man they believe killed foreign minister Anna Lindh last week.																								We have indicted a man in absentia. He is suspected on reasonable grounds of the murder, Stockholm police spokeswoman Agneta Styrwoldt-Alfheim said. She added nobody had yet been arrested.																								An indictment in absentia must be issued by a prosecutor and means law enforcement authorities have identified a suspect, intend to arrest him, but have not found him yet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, May 09, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Barney query																																	 Washington, May 8 (Reuters): Chief White House economic adviser Stephen Friedman, prepared for hardball questions about President George W. Bushs tax cut plan, was stumped.																																	Yvonne from Chelmsford, England, didnt seem to care much about double taxation of dividends or rate cuts. My 15-month-old Scottie MacGregor wondered how old Barney was and what his favourite toy was? How did President Bush come to choose a Scottie? Yvonne asked Friedman, who yesterday hosted an online question-and-answer session on the White Houses website, www.whitehouse.gov. Barney is Bushs black Scottish terrier.																																	I dont know, but please tell Scottie that Ill ask the President and well post later here on whitehouse.gov. Id ask Barney, but he never wants to talk about dividends, Friedman wrote in response.																																	After the online chat was over, the White House posted answers to Yvonnes query on its website. Barney will turn 3 on Sept. 30. But the White House had a harder time pinning down the dogs favourite toy. He loves playing with a soccer ball on the South Lawn. Hes also known to love playing with the mechanical shoe buffer in the East Wing (its black and fuzzy  just like him!)																													 																Junk junkie Hong Kong (Reuters): In  the throes of a cleanup campaign against SARS, Hong Kong  is trucking 30 tonnes of junk from the home of a woman who  hoarded castoffs, ranging from stray cats to broken refrigerators,  for more than a decade. If spread out, the rubbish would  cover up to three football courts, the Sun newspaper  said on Thursday. Packed from floor to ceiling in two adjoining  flats owned by a woman in her sixties, the material included  about 300 umbrellas, construction material and thousands  of plastic bags, the paper said. Among the corpses of cats  and rats  and the maggots infesting them  a team of 20  cleaners also turned up a rusty air-conditioner during a  week of sifting. Its hard to imagine how an old lady could  have lifted that thing by herself, a worker said.  Tatu trouble																																	 London (Reuters): Russian lesbian pop act Tatu and legions of schoolgirl fans fell foul of London police who cited ancient parliamentary laws to ban a video shoot outside the Houses of Parliament on Wednesday. The fans, dressed in school uniforms and knee-high socks, turned up for filming on Albert Embankment, opposite the Houses of Parliament, but police had already told producers to move on. Tatu shot to fame in Britain in February with their debut British single All the Things She Said.

 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Iraq attacks
																								Baghdad, Dec. 26 (Reuters): Guerrillas in Iraq staged multiple assaults that killed four US soldiers, keeping up violence that has raged on since Saddam Husseins capture, the US military said today.																								As the Americans suffered new casualties, an Iraqi tribal chief was shot dead in the northern city of Mosul, and Baghdad residents stared in disbelief at a car split in half by a bomb explosion that killed two Iraqis inside.																								A roadside bomb killed one US soldier and wounded another when it exploded by a convoy near Baquba, about 65 km north of Baghdad, early today. 																								A second soldier was killed trying to defuse a bomb outside the town, a US spokesperson said. 																								Two US soldiers were killed in a mortar attack on a US camp near Baquba yesterday.																								Guerrillas also wounded two Polish soldiers in an ambush in southern Iraq, the latest of several attacks on the forces of countries which have answered Washingtons call for troops to help it secure the country after the war to topple Saddam.																								Gunmen killed a tribal chief who sat on the US-appointed local council in the northern city of Mosul, Iraqi police said.

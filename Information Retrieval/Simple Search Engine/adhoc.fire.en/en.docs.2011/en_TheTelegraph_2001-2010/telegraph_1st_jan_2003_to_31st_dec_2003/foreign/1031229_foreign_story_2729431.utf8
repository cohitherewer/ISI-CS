 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Kuwait text books to teach moderation
																								Kuwait, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Kuwait is revising text books used at state schools to remove references that could encourage religious extremism, the Gulf states education minister said today.																								The decision comes on the heels of an agreement between Gulf states to combat the roots of Islamic militancy in a region that has suffered a spate of attacks believed to be linked to the Saudi-born terrorist Osama bin Ladens al Qaida network.																								Education minister Rashid al-Hamad said that the aim of the revision was to promote tolerance and ensure respect for other religions and opinions.																								The objective is not to change the curricula, but to develop them, he said. 																								Local newspapers quoted Hamad as saying that the new books would take into account what we present of Quranic verses and should not make the young generation adopt extremist mentalities that lead them into taking aggressive initiatives.																								Kuwait, a pro-western Gulf state, hosted last weeks Gulf Cooperation Council summit that called on member states to overhaul their education systems as a preliminary step towards regional stability.																								Gulf powerhouse Saudi Arabia has started redrafting its text books, which have been accused in the West of promoting hatred against Jews and Christians.																								The Muslim kingdoms religion-based education system came under pressure after the September 11, 2001 attacks on US cities, which were carried out mostly by Saudi nationals.																								Saudi Arabia is battling a surge in militant attacks against foreign residents and Saudis, which have killed at least 50 people since May.																								Kuwait has also witnessed assaults by Islamists with suspected al Qaida links against US and foreign targets.																								Hamad defended the ministrys decision, saying it was not the result of foreign pressure on Kuwait. The countrys vocal Islamist parliamentary deputies have criticised the revision as catering to US-interests.

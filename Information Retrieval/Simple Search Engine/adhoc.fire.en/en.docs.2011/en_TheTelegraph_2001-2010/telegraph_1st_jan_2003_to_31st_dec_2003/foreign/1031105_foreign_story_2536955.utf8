 Wednesday, November 05, 2003 				 US to settle Tripp cases
																								Washington, Nov. 4 (Reuters): The US government will pay over half-a-million dollars to Linda Tripp, a central figure in the Monica Lewinsky scandal, as part of a settlement of lawsuits that accused US officials of violating her privacy.																								Tripps secretly taped conversations with Lewinsky fuelled the sex scandal that almost brought down former President Bill Clinton. Tripp transferred to a job at the Pentagon after news of her tape recordings became public. Tripp sued the defence department for privacy violations, including a charge that officials leaked information that she was interviewing for a job at a lower rank and salary than her old job.

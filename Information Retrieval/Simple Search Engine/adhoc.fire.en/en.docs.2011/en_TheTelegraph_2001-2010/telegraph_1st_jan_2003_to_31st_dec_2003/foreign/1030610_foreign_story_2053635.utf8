 Tuesday, June 10, 2003 				 Pak radicals arrested
																								Multan, June 9 (Reuters): Pakistani police today said they had detained seven Islamic activists suspected of vandalising billboards featuring women in the central city of Multan last week.																								Around 200 members of the youth wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party smeared black paint over billboards featuring women in Multan last Friday, while police stood by and watched.																								It was the latest sign of the growing power and confidence of Islamist parties in Pakistan, a key US ally in the war on terror.																								Inspector police Saifullah Gojar said seven activists had been detained at the weekend and two more were being sought by police in Multan, 420 km south of the capital Islamabad.																								Strict instructions have also been given to all police stations in the region that they must ensure the safety of the signboards, he added. We have increased patrolling.																								Billboards showing women have also been vandalised in recent weeks in the eastern city of Lahore and in the northwestern city of Peshawar, although no arrests have been made in either city.

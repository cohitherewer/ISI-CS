 Saturday, March 15, 2003 				 Wraps off Bronte book
																								London, March 14 (Reuters): Charlotte Bronte, author of 19th century romance Jane Eyre, has just published a new book.																								Stancliffes Hotel, a 34-page novella written by Bronte in 1838 and until now read only by a handful of scholars, was printed in full in the London Times newspaper today.																								Scholars said there are more, largely unseen works still to be published from the eldest of the Bronte sisters, Britains most celebrated literary family.																								Stancliffes Hotel is very sardonic, very racy, very witty, not at all like Jane Eyre  its not a passionate story about love-lorn heroines, Heather Glen, editor of the new edition of the novella, told BBC radio today. The original manuscript of Stancliffes Hotel, kept in the Bronte museum in northern England, is a series of vignettes that mock romantic sentiment and masculine vanity.																								The stories are set in Angria, a mythical world created by the Bronte sisters when they were children, and the book is known as an Angrian novelette. A mystique has built up around these writings that you can only understand them if you know all the convolutions of the childhood sagas, said Glen, explaining why the novella  and several others  have never been published.																								But it isnt true of these later Angrian manuscripts that they cannot be understood and enjoyed. I think they will change the way in which (Charlotte Bronte) is seen, she said.																								The novella, written in a fine hand on tiny pages each containing more than 1,000 words, was taken to Ireland after Brontes death in 1855 and then shipped to the US by an American collector.																								The manuscript was eventually returned to the Parsonage Museum  the small Yorkshire rectory where the sisters were brought up  and has been occasionally displayed, but was considered of interest only to scholars. There are other stories out there and a volume of five will be published later this year, Glen said.																								The Brontes  Charlotte, Emily and Anne  wrote gripping novels such as Wuthering Heights and Villette that are still some of the most popular books written in English.

 Thursday, December 04, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Titanic menu																																	 London, Dec. 3 (Reuters): A dinner menu from the ill-fated Titanic fetched 28,800 ($49,500) at auction yesterday.																																	The menu, the size of a postcard, was thought to have been given by the ships second officer to his wife before he left Southampton on the vessels doomed maiden voyage in 1912.																																	It shows the passengers ate salmon, sweetbreads, roast chicken, spring lamb, golden plover on toast and peaches just days before the supposedly unsinkable Titanic hit an iceberg in the Atlantic and slipped beneath the waves.																																	The menu, along with other items of memorabilia from the ship, were bought by a private museum in Belfast, where the Titanic was built. It had been expected to fetch between 8,000-12,000 ($13,700-$20,600).																																	Among the other items sold was a manuscript, written by the same second officer, describing the ships last hours. There was heard a rumbling and crashing from inside the ship, like the sound of distant thunder, wrote the officer, the highest-ranking crew member to survive the disaster.																																	It was just on two clock when she assumed the absolute perpendicular and stood there for a space of about two minutes, an amazing spectacle, with her stern straight up in the air. Then first slowly, but with increasing speed, she quietly slipped beneath the water. 																													 																Super suite New York (AFP): The new Mandarin Oriental  hotel that just opened amid great fanfare in New York boasts  a presidential suite priced high enough to give most major  heads of state pause for thought. At $12,595 a night, the  suite can lay claim to the title of the most expensive hotel  room in a city that has never been particularly friendly  to the budget traveller. The 3,000-square-foot, two-bedroom,  art-laden retreat, which offers panoramic views of Central  Park and the Hudson river, edges out the Royal Suite at  The Ritz-Carlton by almost $100. The foyer, with floors  of French marble milled in Italy, leads to a large living  room that features a black-lacquered grand piano, wet bar  and control panel to coordinate lighting, sound, and temperature. 																													 																Long lecture Berlin (Reuters): University professors  and students are holding a 72-hour outdoor physics lecture  in one of Berlins busiest squares to protest budget cuts  and beat a record. In a makeshift tent in front of the high-rise  office buildings at Potsdamer Platz, 32 professors from  the citys universities have been lecturing students and  passers-by non-stop since Monday.

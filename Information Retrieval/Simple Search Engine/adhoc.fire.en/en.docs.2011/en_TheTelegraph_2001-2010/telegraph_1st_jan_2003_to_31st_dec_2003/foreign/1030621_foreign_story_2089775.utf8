 Saturday, June 21, 2003 				 Teenager takes on school over Barbie
 New York, June 20 (Reuters):  A New York teenager alleged yesterday that teachers violated  her civil rights when they suspended her from school for  wearing a Barbie is a Lesbian T-shirt.																								Lawyers who filed a lawsuit on her behalf in Manhattan federal court said 14-year-old Natalie Young is openly lesbian and that a teacher laughed at her, calling the garment and its reference to the popular Barbie doll inappropriate.																								Young alleged that the principal held her for three hours in an office at the school in the borough of Queens on April 10, 2002 and refused to allow her to return to class while she wore the T-shirt.																								A spokesman for the city education department, a defendant in the lawsuit, declined immediate comment. Young was suspended for the day and the principal threatened to send her home again if she wore the T-shirt to school in future, the lawsuit alleged. Schools cannot legally engage in this type of selective, suppression of speech, lawyer Dan Perez said. 																								If she had worn a Barbie Supports the Troops in the War in Iraq T-shirt, she would have been called a patriot.																								The lawsuit, which names the education department, school principal and several teachers as defendants, seeks a declaration from the court that Youngs constitutional right to free speech was violated. It asks the department to issue guidelines on students dress.

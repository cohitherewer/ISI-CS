 Friday, August 01, 2003 				 Paper sorry for Nicole story
				 	 Nicole Kidman London, July 31: Oscar-winning  actress Nicole Kidman has accepted a public apology and  substantial undisclosed damages over newspaper suggestions  that she had an adulterous affair with fellow star Jude  Law.																								A High Court libel judge heard that the Daily Mail alleged she had led Law, who was married with young children, to cheat on his wife, causing the breakdown of his marriage. It was also suggested in the article on March 6 this year that her repeated denials of the affair were dishonest.																								Gideon Benaim, Kidmans solicitor, told Justice Gray: The publication of this article has caused grave damage to the claimants personal and professional reputation and she has suffered considerable embarrassment and distress. 																								Associated Newspapers, editor Paul Dacre and journalist Nicole Lampert freely accepted that the allegations were untrue and without foundation. They apologised for the distress and embarrassment caused and agreed to pay legal costs as well as damages.																								The size of the pay-out was not disclosed. Law and Kidman starred together in the film Cold Mountain, to be released later this year. Law, married to actress and designer Sadie Frost, has always denied rumours of an affair.

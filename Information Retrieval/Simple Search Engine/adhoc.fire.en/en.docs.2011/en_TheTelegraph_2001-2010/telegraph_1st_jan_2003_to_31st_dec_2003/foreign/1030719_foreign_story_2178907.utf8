 Saturday, July 19, 2003 				 Conjoined twins in Pak seek urgent medical aid
																								Multan, July 18 (AP): Ten-day-old conjoined twin girls, born to dirt-poor parents in southeastern Pakistan, wont survive unless they get emergency medical treatment, their doctor said today.																								The girls share a heart and liver, and their weight has fallen from 4 kg to 3.5 kg, said Dr Munaza Batool. 																								The twins are being fed a formula they havent been able to digest.																								It wasnt known whether the twins, who were also running a high fever, could be separated, but Batool said the continued weight loss could be fatal.																								They need to go to a city or abroad, she said in a telephone interview. But the parents have taken their daughters home to their village of Chorhutta, 135 km west of Multan in eastern Punjab province.																								In Chorhutta, a village of mud houses inhabited by less than 60 families, the birth of the girls has caused a furore. Residents claim the conjoined twins are the reincarnation of the 29-year-old Iranian twins, Laleh and Ladan Bijani, who died in Singapore last week during an operation to separate them, Batool said. The family has appealed to local  charities and the government for financial help. But so  far they havent received any.

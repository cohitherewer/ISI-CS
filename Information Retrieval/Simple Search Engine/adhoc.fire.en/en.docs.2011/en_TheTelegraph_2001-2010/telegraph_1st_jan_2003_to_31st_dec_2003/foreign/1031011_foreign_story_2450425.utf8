Palestinian medics said six Palestinians were killed, including an eight-year-old boy, and more than 40 people  among them eight children  were wounded during all-night gun battles as assault helicopters flew overhead.																								On the stormy Palestinian political front, Qurie maintained his public silence in what appeared to be a dispute with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat over security powers crucial to a revival of West Asiapeacemaking stalled by violence.

 Thursday, July 17, 2003 				 Kidnapped Israeli taxi driver saved
																								Jerusalem, July 16 (Reuters): Israeli commandos today freed unharmed an Israeli taxi driver held for five days by Palestinians in a kidnapping that jolted the relative calm ushered in by a ceasefire crucial to the peace plan.																								In London, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called on Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas to disarm and dismantle militant groups to bolster the road map to peace. 																								The release of Eliahu Gurel, 61, came a day after a Palestinian fatally stabbed an Israeli strolling along the Tel Aviv seaside promenade in the first militant attack inside Israel since the truce was declared on June 29.  In a combined operation, forces  rescued Eliahu Gurel from his kidnappers overnight, an  army spokesperson said.

 Monday, February 03, 2003 				 Wesley Snipes sued over mansion mortgage payment
																								Orlando (Florida), Feb. 2 (AP): Actor Wesley Snipes has been sued for the second time in two years for allegedly failing to make mortgage payments on his 10,000-square-foot mansion in the gated community of Isleworth.																								The lawsuit, filed last month in Orange County Circuit Court by Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corp., said Snipes defaulted on his payments last October and owes the bank almost $609,000.																								No one answered at an Orlando telephone number listed in court records as belonging to Snipes.																								The bank also sued Snipes in February 2001, also for allegedly failing to make mortgage payments. The case was dropped after payments were made.																								The mansion was purchased in 1993 for more than $1 million. It is now valued at $1.7 million. 																								Isleworth residents also include golfer Tiger Woods, baseball player Ken Griffey Jr and basketball player Shaquille oneal.

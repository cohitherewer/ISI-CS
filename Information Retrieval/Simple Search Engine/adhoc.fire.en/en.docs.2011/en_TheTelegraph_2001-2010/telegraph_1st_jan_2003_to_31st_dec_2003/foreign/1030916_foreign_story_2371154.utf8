The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, September 16, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Roses by Madonna																																	 Paris, Sept. 15 (Reuters): Pop superstar Madonna reinvented herself again today, donning the mantle of childrens author to launch her book The English Roses in 100 countries and 30 languages in an unprecedented publishing blitz.																						The Material Girl has turned over a new leaf since her 1992 X-rated book of erotic photographs, Sex. Now a mother of two, Madonna is trying her hand at bed-time stories.																																	The most fun Ive had of all the things Ive done creatively has been to write these books, the blonde icon told a packed Paris news conference.																						Im not doing it to become more famous and Im not doing it to become richer and Im not doing it because I think its cool. Im doing it because I want to share something I know with children, she said.																																	Madonna said her new venture was inspired by her studies into the mystical kabbalah, an esoteric offshoot of Judaism.																																	Im actually quite proud of my journey because the Sex book was about me and saying: Hey, look at me! and the childrens books are about hopefully imparting some wisdom. The pop diva has toned down her image since the birth of her daughter Lourdes and her marriage to Guy Ritchie, trading her conical bra and raunchy stage shows for tweed jackets.

Ruff yoga 																																	 New York (Reuters): New York City dog owners who worry that their furry friends need some stress management have a new option: yoga for dogs. Ruff Yoga  a so-called doga class aimed at relaxing the canine denizens of this often un-Zen city  is being offered once a month in a downtown city park. Half-an-hour on the yoga mat makes Isaac, her cocker spaniel, a calmer dog, said doga devotee Sarah Klein. First there was a short inspirational reading about dogs and a moment of OM-ing. Then the women, following a yoga instructor, took their dogs through traditional poses, starting, without a trace of irony, by forming the furry bodies into the inverted V of the downward dog pose.Then they bent over the dogs and curled their best friends into childs pose, renamedpuppys pose.																																	As a crowd of onlookers grew, the women stretched their dogs  all of them on the small side  to the left and the right and lifted them in their arms like furry weights. From time to time, they paused to pull the wandering dogs back to their mats and shush their barks.

The class, sponsored by national fitness chain Crunch, grew out of Coaly climbing on her owners yoga mat at home, Teitelman said.Yoga came from the animals. Its natural instinct, she said.																																	Three women left the lesson with their dogs after several minutes, but those who stayed said it was worth it.																																	I feel more relaxed and I think she does too, 24-year-old Tracy Alfajora said of Tallula, an 8-month-old, 3-pound Yorkshire terrier who had just finished her first class.

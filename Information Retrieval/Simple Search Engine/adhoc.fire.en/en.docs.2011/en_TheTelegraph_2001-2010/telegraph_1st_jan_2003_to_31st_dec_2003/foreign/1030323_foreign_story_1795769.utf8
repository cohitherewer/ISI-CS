The Muslim nation also called off tomorrows National Day parade of military might, which traditionally includes its nuclear capable missiles, and a South Asian mini-Olympics because of the Iraq war.

In deference to the sentiments of the people, the Prime Minister, Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, has also decided to postpone his visit to the US, UK and and France. Officials are working to reschedule the visits.																								Pakistan has deplored the war against Iraq and almost 10,000 Muslims, some toting AK-47 assault rifles, protested peacefully in cities across the country after Friday prayers, burning American flags and effigies of US President George W. Bush.																								It is the second year in a row the National Day parade has been cancelled.

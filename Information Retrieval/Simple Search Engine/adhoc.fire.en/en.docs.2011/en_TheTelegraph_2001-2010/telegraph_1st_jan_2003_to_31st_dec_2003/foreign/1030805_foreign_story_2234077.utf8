 Tuesday, August 05, 2003 				 China trial of US-based rebel begins
																								Beijing, Aug. 4 (Reuters): China held a three-hour closed-door trial today for a Boston-based Chinese scholar on charges of spying for Taiwan, his wife said, in a case that has drawn international criticism of Beijings legal system.																								Yang Jianli, 40, a permanent US resident and pro-democracy activist, pleaded not guilty to the charges, which included illegally entering China, and while the timing of a decision was unclear, most expected the court to return a guilty verdict.																								The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate Peoples Court held the trial behind closed doors and would deliver its verdict soon, Yangs wife Christina Fu said from Washington. Fu was convinced her husband was innocent.

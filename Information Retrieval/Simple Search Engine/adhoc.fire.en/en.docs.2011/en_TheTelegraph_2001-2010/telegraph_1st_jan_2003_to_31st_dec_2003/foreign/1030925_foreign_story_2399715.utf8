 Thursday, September 25, 2003 				 Taliban chiefs meet delighted Omar
																								Spin Boldak (Afghanistan), Sept. 24 (Reuters): Taliban commanders secretly met elusive leader Mullah Mohammad Omar last week and vowed to step up attacks on Afghan government and US-led allied troops, a commander said today.																								Taliban guerrilla commander Mullah Sabir, alias Mullah Momin, told Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location that Omar appeared delighted by a recent spate of Taliban attacks. 																								At the meeting on September 17, held somewhere in southern Afghanistan, Omar urged around 50 top military commanders and former governors not to slow their activities, Mullah Momin said.																								I salute my Taliban mujahideen (holy warrior) brothers and the Afghan people. 																								They have courageously carried out their jihadi (holy war) responsibilities for the last two years to defend Islam, Omar said.																								All the Taliban commanders should carry out the duties entrusted to them as a personal responsibility, he added.																								Mullah Momin said he had started spreading Omars message to other Taliban commanders who were not present at the meeting, adding that the leaders had agreed to accelerate attacks.

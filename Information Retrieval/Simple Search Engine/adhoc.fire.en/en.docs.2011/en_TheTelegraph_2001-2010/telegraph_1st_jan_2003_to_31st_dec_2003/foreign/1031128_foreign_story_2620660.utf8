 Friday, November 28, 2003 				 Doctors rush to cure Blair stomach ache
																								London, Nov. 27 (Reuters): Two doctors were rushed to Tony Blairs Downing Street office after the British Prime Minister complained of stomach pains, officials said today.																								Blair, 50, felt unwell yesterday evening, just five weeks after he suffered a heart scare.																								A family doctor attended him but was sufficiently concerned to call in a specialist, the premiers spokesman said.																								He is fine, the spokesman said. The problem appeared to pass pretty quickly. The Prime Minister was experiencing stomach pains. A GP (general practice family doctor) came and he thought it would be useful to have another opinion.																								On October 19, Blair received electro-cardiac treatment at a London hospital after being admitted with heart palpitations. Blairs spokesman said the Prime Minister chaired his cabinet meeting as usual early today and was heading for Wales for a Labour Party policy forum.

 Friday, October 17, 2003 				 10 killed in New York ferry crash
																								New York, Oct. 16 (Reuters): The pilot of a ferry boat that crashed into a pier on New Yorks Staten Island, killing 10 people and injuring dozens, lost control of the vessel but investigators do not yet know why, officials said today.																								A federal panel was looking into the condition of the pilot and crew from 72 hours before yesterdays accident, the worst in the 98-year history of the commuter ferry that is also popular among tourists for its views of New York harbour, the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan.																								We will begin our witness interviews today, data collection and evidence, said Ellen Engleman, head of the National Transportation Safety Board.																								She said the board would also examine weather conditions. Winds were gusting at 72 kmph and the vessel was travelling at high speed before it crashed. 																								The ferry service resumed at 0900 GMT today, crowded as normal with thousands of commuters who daily make the short 8.3-km ride to work in Manhattan from the borough of Staten Island.

 Thursday, May 08, 2003 				 Cheney to be Bush running mate in 2004
				 	 Dick Cheney																								Washington, May 7 (Reuters): US Vice-President Dick Cheney confirmed in an interview published today that he will be President George W. Bushs running mate in a 2004 re-election campaign.																								The President has asked me if I would serve again as his running mate, Cheney told The Dallas Morning News yesterday. Ive agreed to do that.																								Cheney has been one of Bushs closest advisers and a major power in the White House, where he has been a leading hawk on Iraq. There had long been speculation Bush would replace Cheney, who has had four heart attacks, and take a running mate who could run to succeed him in 2008 if the President wins a second term.																								But Bush made clear last November that he wanted to keep Cheney as his running mate, quashing the lingering speculation about his plans.																								Cheney, whose most recent heart attack was in 2000, said his health would not prevent him from being on the presidential ticket. Its good enough. Everything is fine, Cheney said of his health. If I ran into problems where I felt I couldnt serve, Id be the first to say so and step down.																								Ive got a doc with me 24 hours a day who watches me very carefully, Cheney said. Theres one outside there now, he said, pointing to a nearby door. Hes part of the entourage who supports me.

 Monday, June 23, 2003 				 105 killed in Nigeria blast
																								Lagos, June 22 (Reuters): The Nigerian Red Cross today said 105 people were killed in a petrol pipeline explosion in southeast Nigeria, but that it expected the toll to rise given the number of injured with serious burns.																								The last report we received put the toll at 105, that is bodies that were actually counted, Nigerian Red Cross president Emmanuel Ijewere said.																								We are still collating casualty figures and have reason to believe that the toll could be much higher.

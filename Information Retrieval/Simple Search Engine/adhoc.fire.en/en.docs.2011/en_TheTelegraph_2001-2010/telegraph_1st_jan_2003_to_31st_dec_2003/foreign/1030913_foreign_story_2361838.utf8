 Saturday, September 13, 2003 				 CIA hears Osama voice
																								Washington, Sept. 12 (Reuters): The CIA said today further analysis of an audio recording broadcast this week indicated it probably was the voice of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, one of the worlds most hunted men.																								An initial analysis was inconclusive, but a further review of the recording determined the voice was probably that of Osama bin Laden, a CIA official said, adding however that the CIA could not determine when the tape was made as there was no time-specific reference in the message. 																								Bin Laden is Americas public enemy number one since the September 11, 2001, attacks, for which he is the chief suspect.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, May 15, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Manic mamma																																	 Rome, May 14 (Reuters): An Italian mother stuffed her 14-year-old son with so many unnecessary medicines that he ballooned to 140 kg, could not walk and eventually had to be taken to hospital, media reported today.																																	The housewife from Pavia, near Milan, kept her only child away from school for more than a year, plying him with pills and potions to protect him from illnesses she imagined could claim him. 																																	Doctors found cortisone-based drugs in his blood which can cause swelling and imbalances in metabolism in large doses. After a few months in hospital, doctors were surprised at the still-dangerously-high chemical levels in the boys blood.																																	They then discovered the mother, while pretending to deliver home-cooked food to her son, had actually been sneaking in more medicine and was slowly killing him.																													 																Gory guitar London (Reuters): Rock legend John Entwistles  prized pink guitar Frankenstein sold for almost 10 times  the expected price at auction, Sothebys said yesterday.  The pink Fender Precision guitar had been tipped to fetch  up to 7,000 but sold for 62,400 as part of an auction  of Entwistles collection of 150 guitars, exotic fish, celebrity  sketches and gold discs. Entwistle, who died of a heart  attack in Las Vegas last year, amassed the collection during  nearly 40 years as bassist with The Who  a band better  known for smashing its guitars on stage than preserving  them for posterity. Frankenstein was so called because  it was made up of the remains of five smashed basses.																													 																Public prank																																	 Tirana (Reuters): An amorous Albanian couples very public highway hanky panky mortified motorists this week in a country emerging from decades of social conservativism. The daily Korrieri newspaper reported today that travellers on an eastern highway were amazed at the cheek of a couple who emerged naked from a car, had a brief roadside romp and then scampered off before the police arrived. The couple came out of their car completely naked and started making love on the asphalt, taxi driver Vangjush Poci told Korrieri. After a few minutes, they kissed and walked back to their car. Korrieri said police had confirmed the incident but said no actions would be taken against the wild sex couple. Albanian social behaviour has become more libertine since the collapse of Communism over a decade ago, but the asphalt intercourse incident is anecdotally considered a first.

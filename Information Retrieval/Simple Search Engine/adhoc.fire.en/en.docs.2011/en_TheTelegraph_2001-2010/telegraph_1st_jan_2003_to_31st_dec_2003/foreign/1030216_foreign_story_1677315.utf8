The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, February 16, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																News in nude																																	 Toronto, Feb. 15 (AP): A news programme featuring announcers reading the news while disrobing makes its Canadian debut on a Toronto cable television channel today.																																	Naked News is styled on cable newscasts and will initially feature just female broadcasters presenting news, weather, sports, entertainment and travel segments while stripping.																																	The news right now is sombre and morbid; there is a lot of stress and tension in the world and this makes the news a little more carefree, said David Warga, an executive producer for the Naked News network.

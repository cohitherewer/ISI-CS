 Monday, June 16, 2003 				 France weighs peacekeepers
																								Paris, June 15 (Reuters): France said today it would discuss with EU colleagues the possibility of sending peacekeeping forces to West Asia if they could help to halt Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed.																								Speaking after a week of violence that threatens a US-backed road map for peace, French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin said peacekeepers would only be sent with the backing of the international community. 																								Lets see what such a force could contribute on the ground, Villepin told French radio station Radio J.																								If it appears that all the parties want it and that a peacekeeping force would halt movements of terrorists or act in such a way as to avoid raising the stakes, then lets do it.

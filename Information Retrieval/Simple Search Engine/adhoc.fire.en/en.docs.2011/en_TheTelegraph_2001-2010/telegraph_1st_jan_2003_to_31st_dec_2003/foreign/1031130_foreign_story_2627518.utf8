 HILARY ALEXANDER																								London, Nov. 29: Jonny Wilkinsons multi-million pound career as the nations favourite pin-up boy has begun.																								Englands record rugby points scorer appears as you have never seen him before. Stripped of his taut Number 10 shirt and shorts, he is wearing, instead, the timeless, traditional garb of the English gentleman in full fig.																								Wilkinson stars as the cover-boy of the new Formal Wear catalogue, produced by the menswear specialists, Hackett, official suppliers of formal wear to the England rugby team.																								Wilkinson will wear the black morning coat, buff linen waistcoat, dark stripe trousers and white cotton shirt, accessorised with cotton pocket handkerchief, discreet woven silk tie and felt top hat, when he goes to Buckingham Palace on December 10 to receive his MBE from the Queen.																								Fans wishing to emulate Wilkinsons immaculate style can buy into the look at any one of the eight Hackett stores in London.																								The black wool morning coat costs 375, the top hat 195, the striped trousers also 195, the waistcoat 125, the shirt 79, the tie 59 and the pocket handkerchief 3. 																								This appearance, however, is only a foretaste of the Jonny-mania to come.																								On December 8 the first official Jonny Wilkinson calendar 2004 will go on sale nationwide at W H Smith, Clintons, HMV, Sainsburys and Tesco. Priced at 7.99, the calendar, produced by Danilo, the countrys biggest calendar company, features Wilkinson in 12 poses, one for each month. 																								The shots, taken by a variety of photographers, show the worlds most famous fly-half in action, practising his kicking and simply relaxing.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

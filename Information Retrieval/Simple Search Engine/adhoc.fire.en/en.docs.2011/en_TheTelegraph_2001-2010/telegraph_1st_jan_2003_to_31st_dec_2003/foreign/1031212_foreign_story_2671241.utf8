The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, December 12, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Rags to riches																																	 Chicago, Dec. 11 (AFP): James Gatzke was struggling with depression, and living off handouts and charity, with only his seven cats for company, when he hit the jackpot.																																	Three weeks ago, the unemployed 44-year-old was eating beef stew out of a can, and scraping by on food and cash donations from neighbours and charities. His water and power supply had long been cut off, he hadnt worked since August when he was laid off from his job as a cab driver, and he hadnt bathed in months.																																	All I wanted for Christmas was to have dinner with my parents in heaven. Thats how down and depressed I was, Gatzke said.																																	A gamble on the Illinois state lottery changed all that, turning the down-at-heel Gatzke into a multi-millionaire overnight when he netted $5.5 million in a November 26 draw. I still cant believe it happened, he said this week.																																	With no immediate living relatives, Gatzke called on a longtime friend, J.R. Bramlett, to help him manage his new-found funds. Within a day, Bramlett helped Gatzke open a bank account and buy a car  a black 1991 Cadillac with 155,000 miles on it. Bramlett also took Gatzke for his first full meal since November 20  a prime rib dinner with all the trimmings. 																													 																Sick slice Manila (Reuters): An irate Filipino  housewife sliced off her husbands penis while he slept  after she discovered text messages from another woman on  his mobile phone. A local radio station reported the woman  rushed her husband to hospital in Manila on Thursday when  large amounts of blood flowed from his wound, but that she  forgot to bring the severed piece of flesh. Doctors were  able to restore his manhood after she raced home to collect  the missing piece. The man, a welder, told the radio station  he had forgiven his wife. Callers to the station, reacting  to the news, offered helpful hints to wayward husbands such  as never sleeping on their backs and always keeping mobile  phones tucked under the pillow.																													 																Size matters																																	 Valletta, Malta (Reuters): Not content with being the smallest country to take its place in the EU next year, Malta can claim another yardstick: its women are the shortest among current and soon-to-be EU members. Men, too, are short by European standards, taller only than the Portuguese. A survey by the Malta National Statistics Office published on Thursday found that women on the Mediterranean island are the shortest in Europe, averaging 159.9 cm compared to the 164 cm average in the EU.

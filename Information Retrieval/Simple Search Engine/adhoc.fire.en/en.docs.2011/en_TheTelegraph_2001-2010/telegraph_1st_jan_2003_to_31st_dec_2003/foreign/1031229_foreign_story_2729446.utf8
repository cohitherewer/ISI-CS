 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Identity crisis for Bam
 BEHZAD FARSIAN 				 	 An Iranian cries amid the ruins of his house in Bam. (Reuters) 																								Bam, Dec. 28: The lines of blankets with feet poking out stretched as far as the eye could see as I walked the crumpled streets of Bam yesterday.																								All around the city, there were scenes of devastation and despair as the impact of the earthquake, which by last night was thought to have claimed more than 25,000 lives, became apparent. Families of the dead circled the bodies shouting and beating their chests and heads, while the unidentified corpses lay huddled together as the wind swept rubble across them.																								For a brief moment an eerie silence descended, before an ambulance drove past with its siren blaring, briefly raising the hopes of local rescuers, who are using their hands to dig for survivors. 																								It was probably too late: the near-freezing weather the night before had given the trapped victims little chance to hold on to life. As the dead lay covered beside the narrow roads and mud-brick buildings, the only hope for relatives was to find the bodies of their missing family members in time to give them a proper Islamic burial, which is meant to take place within 24 hours of death, after the body has been cleansed with water. 																								With water supplies cut off, this was difficult even for those who managed to prise bodies from under the mud and rubble, and they were forced to leave the corpses in piles at the roadside. Priority is being given to the injured, increasing the pain for the relatives of those who have died. 																								As I scanned the horizon, there was a further distressing sight. Dominating the skyline of this ancient city should have been the historic citadel of Arg-e-Bam but it, too, has been flattened. A few locals climbed over the ruins to see what had become of their heritage. 																								It was all we had, said one. The earthquake has taken our families, lives and businesses. I feel I have lost my identity.																								It is true. The city has lost its identity, its people have lost a way of life and, in just a few hours, thousands upon thousands of families have experienced a loss that no one here will ever forget. Toll at 22,000																								Top foreign rescuers today warned hopes were fading for any more survivors. 																								The toll has risen to 22,000 dead, an official from the government of the Kerman province where Bam is located said today evening. State television said 13,000 bodies had been recovered so far while aid workers estimated more than 100,000 people may have been left homeless.																								Bam airport was converted into a sprawling, makeshift hospital and rubble-strewn pavements were lined with injured, some on intravenous drips.																								We are beginning to smell the stench of death. If we havent cleared the area by the end of the week there will be a threat of epidemics, an Iranian rescuer said.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AND REUTERS

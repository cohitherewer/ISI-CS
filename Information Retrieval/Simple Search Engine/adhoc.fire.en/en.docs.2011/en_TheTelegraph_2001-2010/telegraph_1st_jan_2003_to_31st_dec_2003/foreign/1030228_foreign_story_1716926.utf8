The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, February 28, 2003 				 Suicide by French chef 
																								Paris, Feb. 27 (Reuters): The pronouncements of Frances mighty food guides have always been able to make or break a restaurant in this food-obsessed country.																								But the critics themselves faced criticism on Tuesday after top chef Bernard Loiseau was found shot dead in an apparent suicide following the decision by the renowned GaultMillau guide to cut its rating for his flagship restaurant in Burgundy.																								A self-styled perfectionist who once said he wanted to be to food what Pele was to soccer, 52-year-old Loiseau was found dead at his home in the Burgundy town of Saulieu on Monday afternoon, his own hunting rifle at his side. Police provided no immediate details.																								While few doubted any other conclusion than suicide, GaultMillau defended itself saying Loiseau had other problems.

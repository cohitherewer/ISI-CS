 Tuesday, May 13, 2003 				 Fizzer bugs computers globally
																								London, May 12 (Reuters): A new computer virus, the Fizzer worm, spread rapidly across the internet today, infecting computer users in Asia, Europe and the US, anti-virus officials said.																								Businesses in Asia were the first to report the attack. By mid-day in Europe, tens of thousands of computer users had been hit, with more cases expected in North America as the business day wears on. UK-based virus detection firm MessageLabs recorded 17,765 cases in 24 hours to 1530 GMT. Weve upgraded it to high-risk just for the fact that weve seen so many in the last day, said a virus analyst.																								The worm, which carries random subject lines, disables computer users anti-virus and firewall software, but is not a threat to users personal files.

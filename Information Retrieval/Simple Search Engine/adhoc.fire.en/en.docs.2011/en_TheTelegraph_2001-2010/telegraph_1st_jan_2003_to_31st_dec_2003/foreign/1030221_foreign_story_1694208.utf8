The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, February 21, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Singapore to loosen up 																																	 Singapore, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Squeaky-clean Singapore plans to get a little messy.																																	The strictly controlled city state, where spitting is illegal and pornography is a crime, said it would tolerate some untidiness in a new office and residential area designed for creative and scientific industries. Work began on the project, called Fusionopolis, today as part of a masterplan to build a city-within-a-city that Singapore hopes will transform its economy into a hub for biotechnology, information companies and the media. Singapores city planners, known for fastidiously maintaining one of Asias cleanest and safest cities, are under pressure in tough economic times to loosen up.																																	The aim of the 15-20-year masterplan is to inspire a more creative and entrepreneurial streak in an often complacent population. This is really about vibrancy, creativity and we believe there will be some untidiness there, said David Lim, acting minister for information, communication and the arts. He did not give details.																													 																Free Robbie needs wife																																	 London (Reuters): British pop superstar Robbie Williams sent out a message on Thursday that was likely to send female pulses racing at home: He is single again and searching for a wife. The cheeky popstar, in his first interview since breaking up with model Rachel Hunter, also had some bad news for female fans in Britain: He is carrying out his search in the US. I am currently in the mode of looking for Mrs Williams, the former Take That star told the Daily Mirror newspaper. Williams, whose Escapology was the fastest selling UK album of 2002, had been dating Hunter for nine months. But last week, newspapers reported that the couples lifestyles had led to a rift. Im currently: free, single, pop star, straight acting, needs wife, he said.

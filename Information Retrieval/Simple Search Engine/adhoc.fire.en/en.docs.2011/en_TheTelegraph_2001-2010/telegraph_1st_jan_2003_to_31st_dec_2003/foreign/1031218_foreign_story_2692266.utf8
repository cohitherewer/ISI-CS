 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Halliburton must repay overcharge: Pentagon
				 	 Dick Cheney																								Washington, Dec. 17 (Reuters): The Pentagons chief financial officer said today even if Vice-President Dick Cheneys former firm Halliburton mistakenly overcharged for work in Iraq it would still have to repay the US government.																								Last week the Pentagon said a draft audit found Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root may have been overcharged $61 million by a Kuwaiti sub-contractor it chose to bring fuel into Iraq from Kuwait.																								Halliburton, whose close ties to the White House are an embarrassment to the Bush administration just a year before a presidential election, strongly denies wrongdoing. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton from 1995 to 2000.																								Dov Zakheim, the Pentagons comptroller, said it did not look as if KBR had made a big profit out of the fuel deal but said the company would be held responsible for paying back any money it might have overcharged.																								If they cannot recover (overpaid money)  if auditors determine that there was X dollars in overpricing, then its the company that will be out (of pocket), not the taxpayer, he said at a breakfast with reporters.																								Last Friday, one day after parts of the draft audit became public, President George W. Bush also said he expected the company to repay taxpayers if the Pentagon probe determined it had overcharged for fuel deliveries.																								Zakheim said the Pentagon had not yet found any evidence of concealment by KBR, which was awarded a no-bid contract in March to repair Iraqs shattered oil sector. I have no basis whatsoever to see anything nefarious, said Zakheim, adding nothing had been concluded yet.																								Zakheim pegged some of KBRs problems to an antiquated accounting system, which he said the company was trying to rectify. So far, the company has billed $2.26 billion under its no-bid March deal and more than $2 billion under a separate 10-year logistics deal with the military.

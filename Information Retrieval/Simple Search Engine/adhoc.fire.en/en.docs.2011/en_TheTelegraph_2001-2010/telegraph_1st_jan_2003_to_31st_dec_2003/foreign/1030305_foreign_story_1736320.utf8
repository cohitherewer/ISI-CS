The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, March 05, 2003 				 Jackson practised voodoo on Spielberg
 															- singer does not like being black				 	 Michael Jackson: Whos bad? (AFP)																								Embattled pop star Michael Jackson wears a prosthetic nose and once paid $150,000 for a voodoo curse to kill director Steven Spielberg despite being deep in debt, Vanity Fair magazine reported on Monday.																								Vanity Fair, in an article for its March 11 edition, also reports from Los Angeles that Jackson bleaches his skin white because he does not like being Black. The 44-year-old singer sometimes refers to Black people as spabooks, the magazine said. Jacksons manager did not immediately return phone calls and a faxed request for comment on the article. Jacksons London publicist could not be reached for comment.																								The one-time King of Pop has been dogged by controversy for months, first over his odd appearance in a California courtroom last November. That same month, Jackson stunned fans in Berlin by briefly dangling his young son from a hotel balcony. And in February a British television documentary that aired to blockbuster ratings both in England and the US caused a stir when Jackson told his interviewer that he slept in the same room, and sometimes the same bed, as young boys.																								Vanity Fair reported in the article that in 2000 Jackson attended a voodoo ritual in Switzerland where a witch doctor promised that Spielberg, music mogul David Geffen and 23 other people on the entertainers list of enemies would die.																								Jackson, who underwent a blood bath as part of the ritual, then ordered his former business adviser Myung-Ho Lee to wire $150,000 to a bank in Mali for a voodoo chief named Baba, who sacrificed 42 cows for the ceremony, the magazine reported.																								Vanity Fair reported that Jackson wears a page-boy wig and a prosthesis that serves as the tip of his nose. The magazine interviewed a source close to Jackson who said that, without the device Jackson resembles a mummy with two nostril holes.																								According to the magazine, Jacksons extravagant lifestyle and declining record sales have left him $240 million in debt.																								The article, which relies in part on court filings in a $12 million lawsuit against Jackson by Lee, said that since the mid-1990s the reclusive entertainer has relied on a series of multi-million-dollar loans to cover his expenses.																								In addition to the lawsuit by Lee, Jackson is also enmeshed in a $21 million court battle with German concert promoter Marcel Avram over cancelled Millennium concerts and has been sued by Sothebys auction house for $1.6 million.

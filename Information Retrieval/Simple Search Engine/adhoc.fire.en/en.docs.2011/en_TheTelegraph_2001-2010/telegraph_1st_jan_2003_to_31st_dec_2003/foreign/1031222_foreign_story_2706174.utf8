 JOBY WARRICK 																								Vienna, Dec. 21: Evidence discovered in a probe of Irans secret nuclear programme points overwhelmingly to Pakistan as the source of crucial technology that put Iran on a fast track towards becoming a nuclear weapons power, according to US and European officials familiar with the investigation. 																								The discoveries prompted a decision by Pakistan two weeks ago to detain three of its top nuclear scientists for several days of questioning, with US intelligence experts allowed to assist, the officials said. The scientists havent been charged with any crime, and Pakistan continues to insist that it never wittingly provided nuclear assistance to Iran or anyone else. (One of the three scientists detained was allowed to return home, the Pakistan foreign ministry said).																								Documents provided by Iran to UN nuclear inspectors since early November have exposed the outlines of a vast, secret procurement network that successfully acquired thousands of sensitive parts and tools from numerous countries over a 17-year period. While Iran has not directly identified Pakistan as a supplier, Pakistani individuals and companies are strongly implicated as sources of key blueprints, technical guidance and equipment for a pilot uranium-enrichment plant that was exposed by Iranian dissidents 18 months ago, government officials and independent weapons experts said. 																								Although the alleged transfers occurred years ago, suggestions of Pakistani aid to Irans nuclear programme have further complicated the relationship between the US and Pakistan, a key ally in the war against terrorism. China and Russia also made significant contributions to the Iranian programme in the past, IAEA documents show. 																								By far the most valuable assistance to Iran came from still-unnamed individuals who provided top-secret designs and key components for uranium-processing machines known as gas centrifuges, the officials said.																								Centrifuges are technologically complex machines that spin at supersonic speeds to extract the small amounts of fissile material present in natural uranium. The blueprints, which the IAEA has reviewed, depict a type of centrifuge nearly identical to a machine used by Pakistan in the early years of its nuclear programme, according to US officials and weapons experts familiar with the designs. 																								When IAEA inspectors discovered 160 working centrifuges during their first visit to the Natanz plant in February, Iran initially claimed to have designed and built them alone. But Irans story began to unravel when inspectors found traces of highly enriched uranium at Natanz and at a second, now-defunct pilot plant in Kalaye. 																								Iran, which insists it has never made highly enriched uranium, admitted receiving substantial foreign help, including numerous secondhand centrifuge components that were imported from an unnamed country. 																								Officially, Irans leaders maintain they bought the components on the black market, and they still dont know where the parts came from. But to the inspectors and independent experts on centrifuge design, the machines offer abundant clues. 																								A draft report by the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington research group, describes it as a modified version of a centrifuge built decades ago by Urenco, a consortium of the British, Dutch and German governments. The machine is about six-foot high and is made of aluminum and a special type of high-strength steel. The design is one of several known to have been stolen in the 1970s by a Pakistani nuclear scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, who later became known as the father of the Pakistani bomb. 																								Pakistan modified the Urenco design and manufactured a number of the machines before abandoning the centrifuge for a sturdier model. The blueprints obtained by Iran show distinctive modifications similar to the ones made by Pakistan.																								The evidence supports a view widely held among nuclear experts and non-proliferation officials that Iran obtained castoff parts and designs from a centrifuge no longer needed by Pakistan, said Gary Samore, a former adviser on non-proliferation on the Clinton administrations National Security Council. 																								Some experts see Pakistans detention of its scientists as a hopeful sign, suggesting it is preparing to increase its cooperation with IAEA investigators. The Pakistanis know the Iranians have fingered them, said Samore. They know the IAEA is asking questions. 																								But doubts are already being voiced regarding whether the IAEA, or anyone, will be able provide definitive answers about Irans nuclear history and future intentions, said Henry Sokolski, a former defence department adviser on non-proliferation. What is most worrying is not what the Iranians did in the past, but rather, what theyre going to do, he said. 					 THE LOS ANGELES TIMES- WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

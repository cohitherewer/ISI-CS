 Sunday, November 23, 2003 				 Shia leader escapes attack
				 	 Abdul Aziz Al-Hakim																								Tehran, Nov. 22 (Reuters): A rocket attack failed to kill a leading member of Iraqs US-appointed governing council, Shia leader Abdul Aziz Al-Hakim, in a Baghdad mosque yesterday, his son said today.																								Mohsen Al-Hakim said the attackers fired a Russian-made rocket from gardens near the mosque but it failed to explode. The missile missed its target and wrecked a car parked a 100 metres away. No one was injured.																								It was a terrorist attack on his life by remains of Saddams regime and those who want instability in Iraq. They are pursuing the same goals as those who killed Mohammad Baqer al-Hakim, Mohsen Al-Hakim said in Tehran.																								The attack took place on the same day that guerrillas fired Russian-made Katyusha rockets from donkey carts at Iraqs oil ministry and two Baghdad hotels used by Westerners.																								Guerrillas have launched increasingly audacious attacks on US-led occupying troops, foreign organisations and Iraqis working with them. Many foreign organisations have quit, following suicide car bomb attacks.																								Abdul Aziz warned earlier this month that Iraq was becoming a hotbed of terrorism that was spilling over into neighbouring countries like Saudi Arabia.																								He succeeded his slain brother Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim as leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI)  one of the main Shia groups in Iraq but which has been criticised by some for its readiness to work with the US-led administration.																								Iran-backed SCIRI campaigned for years against Saddam Husseins rule and its leaders returned from Iran in May after Saddam was toppled.																								In August, Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim was killed along with 82 others in a devastating car-bomb blast outside the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf. An audio tape purportedly from Saddam denied he had any part in the bombing.																								Akila al-Hashemi, a member of the Governing Council, was killed in September when gunmen fired on her car in a Baghdad suburb. Her assassination was blamed on followers of Saddam.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, October 23, 2003 				 Four Sunni militants held for raid on Shias
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Oct. 22: Police today arrested four activists of the banned Sunni militant outfit Lashkar-e-Jhangvi for the attack on a bus in Karachi earlier this month. Six people including four Shias were killed in the incident.																								We have recovered huge quantity of arms including Khashnikovs, hand grenades and pistols from the terrorists, who were arrested in the thickly -populated area of Saeedabad, the Sindh inspector general of police Syed Kamal Shah said.																								He described the arrests as a major achievement and added that the militants were also involved in several other cases. 																								Relatives of the victims killed in the bus attack had blamed the Karachi killings on the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, which has been locked in running feuds with its Shia counterpart Sipah-e-Mohammad. 																								The outfits were among six parties, which were banned in January 2002 after Pervez Musharraf declared a crackdown against them.																								On October 6, Sunni leader Maulana Azam Tariq was gunned down by three unidentified assailants on the outskirts of Islamabad with three body guards and a driver. Border fencing																								Pakistan said today it had started fencing parts of its western border with Afghanistan to stop cross-border movement of al Qaida and Taliban guerrillas.																								New searchlight towers and checkpoints were also being set up along the Afghan border in southwestern Baluchistan province, military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan said. We are erecting the security fence as part of our counter-terrorism efforts, he said. We are taking these measures to stop illegal cross-border movements.																								He did not say how long the fence would be. The Baluchistan border accounts for about half of the 2,450-km frontier.																								The move comes after growing calls from the US and Afghan officials for Pakistan to take steps to stem the flow of the militants back and forth into Afghan territory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, January 24, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Police pilfers																																	 Bangkok, Jan. 23 (AP): Two policemen fell unconscious and were robbed by two young women after taking pills they were told would enhance their sexual prowess, officials said today.																																	The women, thought to be in their teens, had promised the men sex. They stole the two sergeants guns, a gold necklace, and cash, the police said. The officers had been drinking at a nightclub on Tuesday night and were invited by the women to go to a nearby motel.																																	Motel employees discovered the men, in their 40s, unconscious yesterday after they failed to check out. The police Somjet said the pills were probably strong tranquilisers.																													 																Music magic 																																	 London (Reuters): Bee Gee Robin Gibb spoke on Thursday of his need to immerse himself in music following the death of his twin brother Maurice. He said work had become a therapy after the unexpected loss of his brother, aged just 53, less than two weeks ago. One just has to sit down and think about it all the time and go crazy, or throw yourself back into work again and that was what I had to do, he told BBC Radio. I buried myself in work as a therapy... because to me (Maurices death) is still very, very fresh. It was just so quick, so quick to the point that I still cant believe it now.																																	Maurice Gibb died from a cardiac arrest during emergency abdominal surgery at a Miami hospital on January 12. Maurice and Robin with older brother Barry made up the Bee Gees -- a musical trio who had chart topping hits across four consecutive decades.																													 																Poet honour																																	 St Petersburg (Reuters): St Petersburg on Wednesday unveiled a shortlist of 24 sculptures competing to honour poet and native son Joseph Brodsky, the Nobel literature prize winner thrown out of the Soviet Union in 1972. Experts selected the sculptures from more than 100 submissions as part of celebrations marking the 300th anniversary of Russias second city. Entries from Bangladesh, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia and the US portrayed the poet in a cafe, atop a suitcase, or by one of St Petersburgs many embankments. Brodsky, who died in 1996 in the US, was one of many persecuted Soviet poets. He left school at 15 to work as a labourer, was tried twice by courts and spent time in a psychiatric institution and in exile in Russias far north. Expelled from the Soviet Union in 1972, his works gained popularity in the West, though they were largely unknown to the broad Soviet public. He won the 1987 Nobel prize for literature.

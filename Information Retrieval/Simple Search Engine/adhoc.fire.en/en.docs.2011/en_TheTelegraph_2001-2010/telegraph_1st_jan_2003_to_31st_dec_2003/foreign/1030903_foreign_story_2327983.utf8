																								London, Sept. 2 (Reuters): A giant asteroid is heading for Earth and could hit in 2014, US astronomers have warned British space monitors.																								But for those fearing Armageddon, dont be alarmed  the chances of a catastrophic collision are just one in 909,000.																								Asteroid 2003 QQ47 will be closely monitored over the next two months. Its potential strike date is March 21, 2014, but astronomers say that any risk of impact is likely to decrease as further data is gathered. On impact, it could have the effect  of 20 million Hiroshima atomic bombs, a spokesman for the  British Near Earth Object Information Centre said.

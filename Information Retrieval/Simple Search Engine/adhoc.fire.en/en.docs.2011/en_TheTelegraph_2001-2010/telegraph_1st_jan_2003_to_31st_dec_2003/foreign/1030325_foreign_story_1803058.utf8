Allied airstrip																																	 Near Najaf (Iraq) (Reuters): US Army engineers put the finishing touches to a new desert airstrip in central Iraq on Monday to help US-led forces spy on Iraqi forces and plan an assault on Baghdad. Earthmoving equipment and rollers worked through sandstorms to turn a patch of bumpy desert and scrub into a one-km flat strip that will allow unmanned spy planes to patrol the skies around Baghdad. 																													 																Healing touch																																	 Bahrain (Reuters): A number of Iraqi prisoners of war are being treated for wounds on the US hospital ship, Comfort, in the Gulf, the US military said. It said it was respecting their privacy in line with the 1949 Geneva Convention on POWs. We are treating all injured from either side and giving them the best quality care we can, said navy Lieutenant Garrett Kasper, a spokesman for the Bahrain-based naval component of the US Central Command. 																													 																Morocco talks																																	 Rabat (Reuters): Morocco, a moderate Muslim kingdom which has seen widespread protests against the war in Iraq, is set to postpone talks with the US on a proposed free trade agreement. We are on the verge of announcing the postponement of the second round of talks, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said. She declined to elaborate. The talks were initially set to resume in Rabat on Monday. 																													 																Chirac letter 																																	 Paris (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac, the leading political opponent of the war on Iraq, has thanked Pope John Paul II for his outspoken opposition to the US-led attack and suggested that France and the Vatican work together for peace. In a letter published on Monday, he told the Pope that both should work to ensure the primacy of international law, justice and dialogue over armed conflict.																													 																Islamic alert																																	 Paris (Reuters): Frances top Islamic leader has warned in an interview that the Iraq war would polarise the large French Muslim community and could hurt government efforts to promote moderate Islam in the country. The warning by Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, upset a quietly growing consensus in Paris that President Jacques Chiracs anti-war stand and inter-faith dialogue would help shield France from Iraq-linked tension.

 Saturday, September 06, 2003 				 Anti-Blair worm raids UK website
 San Francisco, Sept. 5  (Reuters): A new Internet worm has surfaced that criticises  British Prime Minister Tony Blair and launches an attack  attempting to knock a UK government website off the Internet,  anti-virus software provider Sophos Plc said yesterday. 																								The worm, dubbed Quaters, spreads via e-mail using a variety of subject lines, such as Your Account Information, and spreads in Internet chat relay systems posing as an attempt to break an Internet chain mail world record.																								It overwrites files on a users computer and displays a message that accuses Blair of wasting taxpayer money on immigrants instead of spending it on the national health service and schools. 																								Think about it Mr Blair. Your career depends on it, weve had enough, the message says in part.																								Quaters also tries to launch a denial-of-service attack on the website of the Prime Ministers office, http://www.number-10.gov.uk, Sophos said.

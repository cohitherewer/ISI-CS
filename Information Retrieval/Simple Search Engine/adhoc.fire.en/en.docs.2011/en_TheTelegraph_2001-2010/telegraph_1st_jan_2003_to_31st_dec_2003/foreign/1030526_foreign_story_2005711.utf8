The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, May 26, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Breathe easy																																	 Cremona (Italy), May 25 (Reuters): How far would you go for fresh air? Would you leave home, job, and even dry land? An Italian couple whose son suffers from an acute type of asthma have adopted a radical solution: to live at sea, where the clean air improves the boys condition. They sailed away, down the River Po, from the northern Italian city of Cremona yesterday in a 26-metre boat they built themselves. 																																	 they reach the sea they will make for the waters near Sicily, where they plan to stay. This is the best way to improve our sons quality of life. The boat will be our home, our workplace and the means for our son to get better without having to stuff himself with medicines all the time, said Paola Frascisco, mother of six-year-old Niky. 																													 																Cheesy tales London (Reuters): This year, ankles  will go unbroken and heads will go ungashed, because the  perilous cheeses of Gloucestershire will, alas, go unrolled.  For centuries, residents of the English county of Gloucestershire  have practised the timeless and surprisingly dangerous springtime  ritual of chasing large, speeding, round cheeses down steep  hills. The winner gets to keep the cheese. This years event,  scheduled for Monday, was cancelled as emergency crews who  volunteer to help clear the tumbling casualties down the  hillside were summoned to Algeria to rescue quake victims,  organisers said.																													 																Vampire vow																																	 Sighisoara (Romania), (Reuters): Bloodied fangs painted on their T-shirts and silver bats dangling from their ears, they swoop to the heart of Transylvania to feed their hunger for the occult. Folklorists, historians and scientists seeking the origins of the legend of Dracula joined amateur vampirologists for the third World Dracula Congress, held this month in Romanias medieval town of Sighisoara. Vampire films, including cheap B-movies, comedies and classics such as Francis Ford Coppolas Bram Stokers Dracula, followed Hollywoods first silver screen Dracula, starring Hungarian Bela Lugosi, in 1931.

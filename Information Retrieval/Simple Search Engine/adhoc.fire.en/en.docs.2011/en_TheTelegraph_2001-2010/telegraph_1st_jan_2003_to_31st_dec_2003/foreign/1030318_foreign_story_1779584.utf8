The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, March 18, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Wedding bounce																																	 Washington, March 17 (Reuters): Most newlyweds experience a brief emotional bounce after their wedding, but they eventually return to the same outlook they had on life before they tied the knot, according to a new study. 																																	We found that people were no more satisfied after marriage than they were prior to marriage, the researchers said.																																	The study, published in the March issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, tracked more than 24,000 people from 1984 to 1995, asking participants every year to rate their overall life satisfaction from zero (totally unhappy) to 10 (totally happy).																																	The average boost from marriage was small  one-tenth of one point on the scale, researchers said.																						The study, which took 15 years to complete, also found that people who were already satisfied with their lives before marriage were more likely to stay married longer.																													 																Sad saint 																																	 Dublin (Reuters): St Patrick is best known for driving snakes out of Ireland, but even he would be hard-pressed to deal with the countrys growing compensation culture that threatens to undermine his annual festivities. While the bigger cities will go ahead as usual with their celebrations to mark the feast day of Irelands patron saint on March 17, spiralling insurance premiums have forced smaller towns and villages across the country to scale back or even cancel traditional parades. Its very disappointing as we believed this was going to be our best St Patricks parade ever, said Peter Considine, the mayor of Ennis in the west of Ireland, which abandoned its annual parade after being told that each individual group and float taking part would need separate insurance.

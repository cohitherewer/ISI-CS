The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Monday, December 01, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Dress for diplomats																																	Washington, Nov. 30 (AFP): Concerned that sartorial scofflaws may be sullying the professional image of the US, the US state department has introduced a diplomatic dress code, according to an internal memorandum seen yesterday.																																	Although diplomats are not often associated with the kind of outerwear favoured by Madonna or Britney Spears, the memo bars US envoys and their charges from sporting midriff-baring clothing, halter tops and plastic sandals at work. While the rules do not mandate morning coats, striped trousers or top hats, they do remind members of the US foreign service that clothes still make the man (or woman) in the halls of diplomacy.																																	As the leading US foreign affairs agency, the department of state is in the front line of customer service to the public at home and abroad, says the directive, titled Department of state guidelines on appropriate dress.																													 																Weird walk London (AP): A man attempting to walk  the length of Britain naked to promote the right to go without  clothes in public has been arrested, hours after being released  from jail. Stephen Gough  wearing only a pair of boots,  socks and a knapsack was arrested on Saturday for breach  of the peace after complaints from residents in Evanton,  a village in the Scottish highlands. Gough, from Eastleigh  in southern England, has endured multiple arrests since  setting out in June to walk 1,363 kms from Lands end in  southwest England to John groats in Scotlands far north.  Im just doing this walk and Im not doing anybody any  harm and I get arrested all the time, Gough said before  the latest arrest.

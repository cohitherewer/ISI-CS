Record row																																	 Rio de Janeiro (Reuters): A man in tropical Brazil who claims to have beaten the world record for staying submerged in ice said on Tuesday he would not bother to seek recognition from the Guinness Book of World Records. I am deeply disillusioned with the Guinness Book for disqualifying my two other records. I dont care about them any more, so I wont even send my record proofs  this is my challenge to them, Gilberto Cruz said. Cruz, 40, who teaches marketing in Sao Paulo state and says the Guinness Book had been his inspiration for decades, on Monday spent 67 minutes in a transparent box full of ice cubes in the main square of the city of Ribeirao Preto. The previous record for full body ice contact endurance, registered in the Guinness Book, was set by Dutchman Wim Hof, who remained inside a tube full of ice about one minute less.

 Wednesday, September 10, 2003 				 UK, Iran in embassy row
																								Tehran, Sept. 9 (Reuters): Britain protested strongly to Iran today after a second drive-by shooting around the British embassy in Tehran in under a week, amid already fraught ties over Britains arrest of a former Iranian diplomat.																								A British diplomat in Tehran said three or four shots were fired at or near the embassy early today and said witnesses saw them coming from two men on a motorcycle. He did not say if the embassy was hit but said there were no injuries.																								In a similar incident last Wednesday, gunshots also apparently fired from a passing motorcycle pierced windows in the embassy building that stands near a busy street.  Weve protested strongly to the  Iranian ministry of foreign affairs that security precautions  taken by themafter last weeks shooting did not prevent  this incident, a foreign office spokesperson said in London.

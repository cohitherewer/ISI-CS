The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, April 24, 2003 				 Cry to name Hamburg Veggieburg
																								New York, April 23 (PTI): Replacing hamburger with veggieburger is said to be good for the heart but an animal rights group has gone a step further by urging Hamburg authorities to change its name to Veggieburg.																								In a letter, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has suggested that Hamburg change its name as the word conjures up images of dead cows. The towns name, it says, conjures up visions of unhealthy patties of ground up dead cows and offered non- meat patties for $15,000 for school children as an incentive.																								Our offer is as serious as a heart attack, the Peta spokesman said. But the idea did not amuse the supervisor who said hamburgers are a delicacy in the town and we are proud of our name and heritage.																								The town claims to be the birth place of the hamburger and holds a burgerfest every year to commemorate its gift of food to the world. The town, a suburb of Buffalo, was established in 1812. Earlier, Peta had suggested that the town of Fishkill change its name to Fishsave as its current name conjures up images of dead fish.

 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Bush signs law placing curbs on nuisance mail
				 	 President George W. Bush (seated) at the White House before signing the anti-spam bill on Tuesday. (AFP) 																								Washington, Dec. 17 (Reuters): President Bush signed the first national anti-spam bill into law yesterday, outlawing some of the most annoying forms of junk e-mail and setting jail time and multi-million-dollar fines for violators.																								The law also lays the groundwork for a Do Not Spam registry similar to theDo Not Call anti-telemarketing list that went into effect earlier this year.																								Bushs signing marks the final legislative step in a six-year struggle to curb the unsolicited commercial offers that threaten to overwhelm the e-mail system.																								But the law is unlikely to provide much of a Christmas present, at least this year. Experts say it will not immediately stop the torrent of unwelcome e-mails touting unbelievably low mortgage rates, get-rich-quick schemes and sexual enhancement offers that now account for more than half of all e-mail traffic.																								Sceptics say it will only encourage businesses to send out more unwanted e-mail, as the new law allows marketers to send messages to anyone with an e-mail address as long as they identify themselves clearly and honour consumer requests to leave them alone.																								Supporters say the law sets a helpful framework for acceptable e-mail practices, but acknowledge it will need to be enforced aggressively to have any impact. This will help address the problems associated with the rapid growth and abuse of spam by establishing a framework of technological, administrative, civil and criminal tools and by providing consumers with the options to reduce unwanted e-mail, said White House spokesperson Scott McClellan.																								The new law requires pornographic e-mail to be clearly labelled, and commercial text messages to cell phones will be prohibited unless users expressly permit them.																								It encourages but does not require the Federal Trade Commission to allow Internet users who dont want to receive any unsolicited marketing to place their e-mail addresses on a list that marketers would be required to check. FTC officials have said on several occasions that a do-not-spam registry would be difficult to enforce.																								The law will override some tougher state laws, such as one in California that would prevent all unsolicited commercial e-mail, and will prohibit consumer lawsuits.																								Internet marketers have begun to feel the heat as the skyrocketing volumes of spam have strained computer networks and outraged consumers. Prosecutors in New York and Virginia have used state laws to arrest a handful of spammers, and large Internet service providers like Time Warner Incs America Online and EarthLink Inc. have sued dozens more for damages.																								Microsoft Corp. and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer are expected to announce another anti-spam action tomorrow. At the national level, the Federal Trade Commission has used deceptive-business laws to go after spammers, though settlements generally involve promises to avoid spamming in the future rather than fines or jail time.																								Large Internet service providers and marketing and technology trade groups praised the new law, though many said it would need to be coupled with better filtering methods.																								Forrester Research analyst Jim Nail said the law would have little effect as spammers would simply move offshore and come up with new ways to evade filters and cover their tracks. 																								A better solution would be to force all e-mail users to pay a fraction of a penny for each message sent, as a way to discourage indiscriminate mass e-mailings, he said.																								Civil-liberties advocate Ari Schwartz said the bill would likely make it easier for Internet service providers and prosecutors to go after spammers, though it was not without flaws.																								Spammers who already violate existing fraud laws are unlikely to honour opt-out requests, and the anti-pornography provisions could prove difficult to enforce, said Schwartz, an associate director at the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Bit of a surprise for Libyans
				 	 The reconstructed remains of the Pan Am Boeing 747 jumbo jet that crashed into the Scottish village of Lockerbie on December 21, 1988. (Reuters) Tripoli, Dec. 20 (Reuters):  Most Libyans only found out their country had weapons of  mass destruction programmes when the government said it  was scrapping them, with announcements in the tightly controlled  official media.																								State radio and television broadcasts yesterday evening and throughout the night carried the same announcement, read by foreign minister Mohamed Abderrhmane Chalgam: The Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah... decided on its own free will to... be free of all internationally banned weapons.																								It was difficult to gauge if Libyas population was as surprised as the rest of the world seemed to be at the decision of their leader Muammar Gaddafi. A local journalist said today in a typical comment that most surprise was at the fact that there had been no leaks from talks with the United States and Britain that began in mid- March, just days before the US-led Iraq war.																								The people received the news with satisfaction, the policy of the leader makes them satisfied, the journalist said. People know were trying to develop good relations (with London and Washington) but this looked a bit like a surprise, said another local journalist, on condition of anonymity. It was business as usual today in the sleepy capital Tripoli and throughout the North African country of 5.5 million people, ruled by Gaddafi for the last 34 years. 																								Gaddafis comments, first carried by the official Jana news agency, were to highlight Libyas wise decision, which showed his country plays an international role in building a world free of weapons of mass destruction and all kinds of terrorism.																								But, true to his reputation for flamboyance and quirkiness, Gaddafi added that Libyas goal was to face the ecological challenges so that the colour green covers the whole world.																								Gaddafis political philosophy written in the 1970s, his Third Universal Theory  a vision of society neither capitalist nor communist, with a dose or Arab nationalism  was recorded in his Green Book. Gaddafi came to power in 1969 in a bloodless coup and for years was castigated abroad for supporting foreign guerrilla movements and groups responsible for hijacks and killings, as well as for his defiance of the West. Few national leaders since World War Two have attracted such abuse. Ronald Reagan called Gaddafi a barbarian and mad dog, and Egypts late President Anwar Sadat described him as 100 per cent mad.																								But Gaddafis efforts have encountered some snags, like at a Europe-North Africa summit earlier this month in Tunis. Wearing a flowing brown robe, Gaddafi sat back, sulked and did not applaud a speech by French President Jacques Chirac, in an apparent snub over a dispute about compensation for victims of the bombing of a French airliner in 1989. Chirac quipped: Relations with Libya are always very complicated.

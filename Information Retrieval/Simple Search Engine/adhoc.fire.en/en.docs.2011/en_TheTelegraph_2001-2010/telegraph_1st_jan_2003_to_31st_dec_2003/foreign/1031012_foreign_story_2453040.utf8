 HUGH DAVIES				 	 Emma Thompson London, Oct. 11: Emma Thompson  is to join the all-star cast of the third Harry Potter film,  The Prisoner of Azkaban, which is in the final stages  of production and is due for release on June 4.																								The actress is to play Sybill Trelawny, the ethereal and eccentric professor of divination at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.																								Alfonso Cuaron, the Mexican director of the film, said he had chosen Thompson because she brings such life and spirit to the characters she portrays.																								Her role completes an intriguing new line-up for the third Potter film, with Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Julie Christie as Madam Rosmerta, Dawn French as The Fat Lady and Sir Michael Gambon taking over the part of Prof Albus Dumbledore after the death of Richard Harris.																								Thompson, 44, was awarded an Oscar for her performance as Margaret Schlegel in Howards End a decade ago.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

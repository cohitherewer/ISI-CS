The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Benin crash toll put at 111
 Cotonou (Benin), Dec. 26  (Reuters): Rescuers battled high waves today to free bodies  from the wreckage of an airliner which crashed into the  sea off the West African state of Benin, killing at least  111 people.																								The Beirut-bound Boeing 727 was carrying many Lebanese passengers heading home for the holidays on Christmas Day. It clipped a building at the end of the runway, exploded and smashed into the Atlantic Ocean.																								Through the night, rescuers toiled with steel cords and a tractor to try to lift large sections of the wreckage from the shallow waters, while police used belts to beat back thousands of onlookers thronging the beach.																								As soon as we took off, I saw the whole plane crumple and people were pushed towards me by the pressure of the crash, said Khodor Farhat, who was sitting at the back of the plane. Then I woke up in the water. I pushed myself to the surface and swam to the beach where some men pulled me out and took me to hospital, he said from his bed.																								Lebanese foreign minister Jean Obeid flew into Benin today on board a plane chartered to take home bodies and survivors. The Lebanese guerrilla group Hizbollah said in a statement it had sent an envoy on board the plane to console the sons of the Lebanese community.

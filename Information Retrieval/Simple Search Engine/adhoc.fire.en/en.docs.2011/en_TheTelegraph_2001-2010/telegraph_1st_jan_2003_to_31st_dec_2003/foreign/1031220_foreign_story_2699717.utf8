 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Cherie to Pope: Get rid of sexism
 JONATHAN PETRE				 	 Cherie Blair London, Dec. 19: Cherie  Blair last night called for half the posts in the Vatican  to be filled by women and criticised the Roman Catholic  Churchs record on human rights.																								In surprisingly outspoken comments for a Prime Ministers wife, Cherie Blair said that the Pope should make it a priority to rid the Church of sexism and see women as thinkers as well as workers.																								Cherie Blair, a practising Catholic and a senior lawyer, argued that successive Popes had promised to introduce equality and respect for all but this had not been achieved across the Church.																								Her intervention will anger traditionalists, who will feel that such criticism should not come from the spouse of a senior political figure on the European stage. Cherie Blairs remarks follow her private visit to Rome earlier this year with her husband, an Anglican. After the trip she expressed her disappointment at the lack of women working in the Vatican Curia, the Churchs equivalent of the civil service.																								Delivering a lecture for The Tablet magazine last night, she said that the Church had to introduce human rights internally if it wanted to be credible on the global stage. The Vatican Curia needs to learn from the Diocesan Curia throughout the world and open its doors to female participation. There is little reason why half of all Vatican curial positions could not be filled by women. It should be a main priority of the Church at all levels.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

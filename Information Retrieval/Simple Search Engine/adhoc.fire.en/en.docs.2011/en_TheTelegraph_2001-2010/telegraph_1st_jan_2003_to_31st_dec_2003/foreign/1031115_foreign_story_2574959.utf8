 Saturday, November 15, 2003 				 Pak denies aiding Iran
																								Islamabad, Nov. 14 (Reuters): Pakistan today reiterated its denial of reports that it had assisted neighbouring Irans nuclear programme, calling them a reflection of anti-Muslim bias.																								A foreign ministry statement issued after a meeting in Islamabad yesterday between Irans deputy foreign minister Gulam Ali Khoshroo and Pakistans acting foreign secretary Tariq Osmal Hyder said both sides had rejected a report in that days London Times as totally baseless.																								These unsubstantiated reports occur periodically in some sections of the Western media and they reflect their long-standing anti-Muslim bias, the statement said.																								The statement said that in Islamabad, Khoshroo had detailed Irans efforts to resolve outstanding issues with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UNs nuclear watchdog. Pakistan said it hoped these would be amicably resolved.																								Earlier this week, Iran brushed off an IAEA report that it had engaged in activities linked to atom bomb making, saying that violations it was accused of by the UN agency were insignificant.																								The IAEA said no evidence had so far been found of a bomb programme in Iran, but Tehran had dabbled in possibly linked activities like plutonium production and uranium enrichment.																								The Times report quoted unnamed sources familiar with the negotiations as saying that Iran had told the IAEA in the past two weeks that it received crucial help from Pakistan for its controversial nuclear programme.

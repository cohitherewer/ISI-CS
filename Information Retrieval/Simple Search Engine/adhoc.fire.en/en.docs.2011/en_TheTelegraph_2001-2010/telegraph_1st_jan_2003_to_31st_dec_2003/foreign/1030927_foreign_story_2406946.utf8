(AFP)																								Islamabad, Sept. 26: Pakistani security forces arrested an al Qaida suspect and his Afghan colleague from an Internet cafe in Peshawar.																								In a separate raid in Karachi, three members of an outlawed Sunni group were arrested.																								One of the suspects arrested in Peshawar, Khaled, was nabbed by Pakistani secret agents at the Internet cafe where he introduced himself as Habib. 																								Khaled, believed to be a Yemeni, and the Afghan were later handed over to military intelligence for questioning. Interrogations are usually carried out by a team comprising Pakistani civilian and military intelligence personnel and US officials.																								Authorities did not reveal the circumstances which led to the arrest of the two suspects in Peshawar today. However, the vast network of informants the FBI is using to track down Taliban and al Qaida men may have played a major part in the arrest of the two suspects.																								In Karachi, the police said the detained militants belonged to the anti-Shia, Sunni terrorist group Lashkar-e- Jhangvi (LJ). The extremists were planning to carry out suicide attacks in Karachi. 																								The Sunni group has close links with the Taliban who had provided sanctuary to their leader Riaz Basra.																								 He was killed in a police encounter last year.																								The police identified the three militants as Hamid Murad, Hafiz and Faizullah. We have recovered bombs, pistols and other ammunition, the police said. They also recovered literature urging people to wage jihad against the enemies of Islam. Hamid Murad was the ring leader of the group and was trained in al Qaida camps in Afghanistan.																								The arrests come less than a week after the police picked up 19 Indonesian and Malaysian students from Islamic seminaries in Karachi. 																								Among those arrested was Gun Gun Rusman Gunawan, the brother of Hambali who has masterminded many bomb attacks in southeast Asia and is currently in US custody.																								Police claimed the six Indonesians and 13 Malaysian students were part of a Jamia Islamiah sleeper cell.

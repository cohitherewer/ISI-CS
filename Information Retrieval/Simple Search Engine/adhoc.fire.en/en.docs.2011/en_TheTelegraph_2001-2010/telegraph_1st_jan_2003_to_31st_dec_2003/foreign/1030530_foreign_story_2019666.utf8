The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, May 30, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Super sperm																																	 Berlin, May 29 (Reuters): The worlds best bull lives in Germany and breeders are lining up to buy his sperm, valued at about 180,000 euros ($213,000) a litre.																																	Lancelot, a four-year-old, 900-kg, black and white Holstein-Friesian bull, came top in international rankings compiled by the Interbull Centre in Uppsala, Sweden. His sperm was shown to produce the best milk-producing cattle in tests on 130 dairy cows he has sired, the Osnabrueck Herdbook Co-operative said.																																	One 0.25 millilitre portion produced from his sperm costs 45 euros. Andreas Kandzi, of the Co-operative, said Lancelot produces 2,500 portions of sperm a month.																																	Apart from years of comfort in a luxury stall, Lancelot can expect little long-term reward for his sought-after sperm. He faces slaughter when he reaches six or seven. Once they reach that age, the potency dips, Kandzi said.																													 																Cafe crisis Amsterdam (Reuters): Dutch coffee shops  famous for selling cannabis are about to see business go  up in smoke. Officials have just put the finishing touches  to a measure banning smoking in cannabis-selling cafes.  Due to get government approval soon, the law aims to protect  employees of all companies from passive smoking. Any coffee  shop that has employees will be affected too, said Trudy  Prins, director of Dutch anti-smoking group Stivoro. Although  cannabis is formally illegal in the Netherlands, its use  and sale are tolerated under strict government conditions.  Coffee shop owners were aghast. The whole point of going  to a coffee shop is to smoke, said Arjan Roskam, chairman  of the Union for Cannabis Retailers. Smoking a joint in  an Amsterdam coffee shop vies with canal boat tours and  trips to the flower market for a place on tourists itineraries.																													 																Turner twist																																	 London (Reuters): Two brothers who shocked the art world by re-working etchings of Spanish master Francisco Goya were shortlisted on Thursday for the controversial Turner Prize. Jake and Dinos Chapman were nominated along with Irish video artist and photographer Willie Doherty, sculptor Anya Gallaccio and Grayson Perry, who creates satirical works using pottery, drawings and embroidery. The 20,000 prize has been widely criticised because of the outlandish nature of some entries. Last year, Britains culture minister Kim Howells condemned them as conceptual bullshit. The Chapman brothers have ruffled purists feathers with their work Insult to Injury where they added comical and grotesque faces to figures in works by Goya.																													 																Wed in jest Rome (Reuters): Getting married in Las  Vegas is no laughing matter, Italys highest court has ruled,  rejecting a womans appeal against bigamy charges. The woman,  named only as Cristina M, was found guilty in 1996 of bigamy  and sentenced to eight months in jail after magistrates  discovered that she got married in Las Vegas in 1988 before  her first marriage in Italy was annulled. She told the high  court that the Las Vegas service had been a joke, but  the judges on Wednesday ruled that a quick-fire marriage  in a Las Vegas registry office was as valid as a full-blown  church wedding.																																	A court official said she would not have to go to prison because a statute of limitations meant too much time had passed to warrant a jail term.

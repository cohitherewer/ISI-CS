 MATT BORN				 	 Sophie Dahl																								London, Feb. 27: Sophie Dahl has turned her talent for posing provocatively in the nude into an eye-catching draw to raise cash to relieve world poverty.																								She agreed to pose for a picture  inspired by the image from the film American Beauty  to promote the charity Comic Reliefs Red Nose Day on March 14.																								The picture, to appear on billboards across the country, is also reminiscent of her notorious nude appearance in a poster for the perfume Opium, which has been the most complained about advert of the past five years.																								Dahl, 24, the grand-daughter of the novelist Roald Dahl, said she was honoured to be fronting the Red Nose Day campaign.																								Im a huge fan of Comic Relief and the amazing work they do, she said.

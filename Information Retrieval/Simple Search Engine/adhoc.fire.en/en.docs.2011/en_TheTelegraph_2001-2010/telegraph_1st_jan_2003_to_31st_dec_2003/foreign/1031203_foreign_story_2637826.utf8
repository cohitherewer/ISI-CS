 Wednesday, December 03, 2003 				 Women for President, says Ebadi
																								Tehran, Dec. 2 (Reuters): Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi said today women in Iran should be allowed to run for President despite the fact that they have been barred from standing for the post since the 1979 Islamic revolution.																								Irans constitution says the President should be an Iranian, a Muslim and a rejal, meaning an eminent person. Although the gender of rejal is ambiguous, Irans clerical rulers have said it refers only to men. Women are allowed to run for the presidency and rejal refers to both sexes, Ebadi said. Irans next presidential vote is in 2005.																								The Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body dominated by hardline clerics, disqualified women who registered to run in previous presidential elections. Women in Iran enjoy better rights than in some other West Asian countries. There is a female vice-president and 13 deputies in the 290-member parliament are women.																								But Ebadi, Irans first female judge before the Islamic revolution, said women should seek a greater share of power and keep fighting for equal rights.

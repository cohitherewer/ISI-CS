 Friday, July 04, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Pure holy water																																	 Oslo, July 3 (Reuters): European church leaders boiled holy water for a riverside ceremony in Norway this week because local officials feared it might otherwise kill fish when poured into the river.																																	The danger was probably small but we had to be cautious about pouring water brought from around Europe into a salmon river, Johan Aurstad, senior advisor at the Norwegian Animal Health Authority, said today.																																	A gathering of 126 bishops and other Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox Christian leaders in the Norwegian city of Trondheim boiled flasks of holy water for 10 minutes to kill any bacteria before pouring it into the Nidaros river yesterday. 																													 																Rod relief Los Angeles (AFP): Rocker Rod Stewarts  estranged wife Rachel Hunter appears to have had second  thoughts about divorcing her famous husband of 13 years,  court documents showed Wednesday. Supermodel Rachel Hunter  dropped divorce proceedings against the British star just  two days after filing them in Los Angeles on June 17, the  papers showed. But Hunters petition was dismissed without  prejudice, leaving her free to file for divorce again at  any time. No reason was given for why Hunter withdrew the  petition. Hunter, 34, had cited irreconcilable differences  for her break-up with the 58-year-old rock star, with whom  she has an 11-year-old daughter named Renee and an 8-year-old  son, Liam. The New Zealand-born Hunter reportedly had a  fling with British pop star Robbie Williams, while Stewart  has been much photographed with his reported girlfriend,  blonde photographer and model Penny Lancaster. 																													 																Free flight																																	 London (AFP): A British homing pigeon which took a wrong turn on its way from France to England and ended up in New York arrived back home on Wednesday  with a little help from British Airways. Billy the pigeon was supposed to fly from Calais in northern France to his home in Liverpool, north-west England, in a race three weeks ago. Instead, he took a remarkable 4,800 km detour and ended up in the US. Discovered in an exhausted state, he was taken to a pigeon fancier, who recognised his identification ring. Saving Billy another marathon journey over the Atlantic, British Airways agreed to bring him home for free. A spokesperson for Britains national carrier said: He had a pleasant flight. It was a pleasure to have a VIP  a very important pigeon  on board.

The Nobel peace laureate and other Opposition leaders, who had been touring northern Myanmar, were detained following clashes between supporters and opponents of her National League for Democracy (NLD) in which four people died.																								Government authorities brought her back to the capital today from the north, where she was visiting supporters, the sour ce said.Suu Kyi had been on a month-long tour visiting supporters and party offices in the north of the country.																								An education ministry source said the ruling military had also closed universities. The government has closed universities and colleges indefinitely, he said. Most universities and technical colleges began the second semester of the academic year on May 1 and others were due to start tomorrow.																								Universities have been closed and reopened several times since the 1988 pro-democracy uprising, which began with student riots.

The junta, which described Suu Kyis detention as protective custody, closed off the party headquarters in Yangon, and a party official said its offices had been closed elsewhere in the country. Other top NLD party members have been confined to their homes and their phonelines have been out of order since Friday night.																								The UN has expressed concern on the whereabouts of the democracy campaigner.

 Detroit, Dec. 11 (AP):  More than 200,000 computers spent years looking for the  largest known prime number. It turned up on Michigan State  University graduate student Michael Shafers personal computer. 																								It was just a matter of time, Shafer said. His number is 6,320,430 digits long and would need 1,400 to 1,500 pages to write out. It is more than 2 million digits larger than the previous largest known prime number. 																								Shafer, 26, helped find the number as a volunteer on an eight-year-old project called the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search. 																								Tens of thousands of people volunteered the use of their PCs in a worldwide project that harnessed the power of 211,000 computers. 																								Shafer ran an ordinary Dell computer in his office for 19 days until November 17, when he found the new Mersenne Prime found.																								 A prime number is a positive number divisible only by itself and one. Mersenne primes are expressed as 2 to the p power minus 1, where p also is a prime number.

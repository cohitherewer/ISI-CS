The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Wednesday, May 28, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Daring dates																																	 London, May 27 (Reuters): Single Britons looking for love are being offered a new way of finding a partner  by advertising their charms on a billboard.																																	The first hoarding depicting 16 hopefuls went up in Birmingham this week, alongside the slogan Who Dares Dates and a telephone number for passers-by to call.																																	People just love the glamour of having their face shown on a big billboard, said Dan Monteigh, Billboard Dating managing director.																																	Dating by hoarding is more expensive, at 125 a shot, than finding a partner online. But Monteigh is convinced the billboards will be a hit because they are in prominent places, such as outside railway stations.																																	Over 50 people have signed up so far, with women slightly keener than men and most interest from people in their 20s. The practice is the latest US dating technique to cross the Atlantic and follows speed-dating, in which groups of men and women meet each other for just a few minutes. 																													 																Puff pangs Bangkok (AP): Parents caught smoking  while waiting for their children in Bangkok schools will  face stiff fines, the latest restriction in Thailands strict  anti-smoking regime, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. The  new rule will come into effect in about 2,000 public and  private schools in Bangkok from tomorrow, the Bangkok  Post newspaper said. Violators will be fined up to 2,000  baht ($50), the Post said, quoting city officials.  According to the World Health Organisation, 23.4 per cent  of Thailands 64 million people smoke, which is comparable  to the US. Thailand has one of the toughest anti-smoking  laws in Asia. Last November, it became illegal to light  up in virtually every indoor public place including air-conditioned  restaurants and barber shops. Businesses violating the law  face fines of up to 20,000 baht ($465) and the smokers are  hit for 2,000 baht ($46). Thailand is also trying to prevent  youngsters from taking up the habit. The public health ministry  says 95 per cent of smokers in Thailand start before theyre  24. 																													 																Gutsy Liza Bologna (AFP): As all famous entertainers  know, the show must go on. So legendary US singer Liza Minnelli  will still take to the stage for an Italian charity concert  despite a leg immobilised in plaster, her agent said on  Tuesday. The 57-year-old entertainer slipped and fell when  leaving her hotel in the central Italian city of Bologna  on Sunday, injuring her right kneecap. Her leg was plastered  from the ankle to the knee and she will undergo an operation  on Wednesday. But Minnelli will take to the stage with Luciano  Pavarotti to sing a duet of New York, New York.

 Tuesday, August 05, 2003 				 Hasina, former naval chief charged in graft case
																								Dhaka, Aug. 4 (PTI): Former Premier and opposition leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed was charged in a graft case involving the purchase of a naval frigate from South Korea at a loss of $88 million. 																								After a year-long investigation, the anti-corruption bureau filed the charges against Sheikh Hasina and former navy chief Nurul Islam at a court in Dhaka yesterday.																								The bureau has charged Hasina and Islam for their involvement in the purchase of a DW-2000H frigate for the Bangladesh navy from the Daewoo Corporation during the opposition leaders tenure as Prime Minister from 1996 to 2001.																								The bureau alleged that the accused were instrumental in handing the deal to the Korean company even though it was not the lowest bidder. 																								Daewoo was the fourth lowest bidder at $99.97 million and were awarded the contract to supply the unproven design frigate. As a result of this, the bureau alleged, the country suffered losses of more than 5 billion taka ($88 million).																								The frigate was delivered six months ahead of schedule towards the end of Hasinas tenure as Prime Minister. However, authorities in February detected some irregularities in its construction and decided to decommission it from the navy.

 Saturday, November 08, 2003 				 Concorde parts up for grabs
				 	 A Christies employee hugs the nose cone of a Concorde airliner in Paris. (Reuters) Paris, Nov. 7 (Reuters):  Want to plant the Concordes pointed nose in your garden  or turn the captains seat into your living room chair?  Over two hundred souvenirs of the supersonic passenger jet  are up for grabs in Paris this month.																								Concorde was put into retirement last month as already high running costs escalated after an Air France Concorde crashed in July 2000, killing 113 people. Plane-maker Airbus this year sealed the jets fate, saying it would stop supplying parts and maintenance.																								Christies auctioneers will sell everything from the planes instruction manual to the engine at an auction on November 15. From tomorrow, the curious can wander around exhibits which will include wheels and doors as well as the china place settings which the worlds rich and famous used while crossing the Atlantic at over 2,000 kph.																								We hope this landmark sale will contribute to the memories of this human and technological adventure as well as raising funds for good causes, Air France president Jean-Cyril Spinetta said.																								The proceeds of the sale will go to the charitable Air France foundation, which supports various childrens causes.																								The cabin mach-meter, which allowed passengers to track the speed of the jet as it broke through the sound barrier, is estimated to sell at 1,500 euros ($1,700) to 2,000 euros, while the engine could raise over 100,000 euros, Christies said.																								It was quite difficult. Some pieces are very heavy, others are very large, Emmanuelle Vidal, business director at the auction house, said. We had to make sure to set up all these things in a harmonious way.

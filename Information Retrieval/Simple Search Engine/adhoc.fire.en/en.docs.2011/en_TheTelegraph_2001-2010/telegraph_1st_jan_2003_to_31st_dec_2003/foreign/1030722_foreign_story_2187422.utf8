The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, July 22, 2003 				 Fiery Crowe to be a father
				 	 Danielle Spencer and Russell Crowe. (Reuters)																								Sydney, July 21 (Reuters): Fiery Oscar-winner Russell Crowe and his wife Danielle Spencer are expecting their first child in January, the actor and part-time rock singer said today.																								Its a lot of fun and shes feeling all the effects of it, Crowe told Nine Network television.																								Crowe and long-time girlfriend Spencer were married on his 39th birthday at his cattle property at Nana Glen in northern New South Wales state in April.																								He said Spencer, a singer and actress, was 14 weeks pregnant.																								I dont think we were ever really thinking in terms of a gigantic amount of kids. Shes sort of thinking one or two, maybe three. Well see, Crowe said.																								Before his marriage, the New Zealand-born, Australian-raised actor developed a reputation as a hard-drinking, brawling star in the mould of other Hollywood greats like the late Richard Harris.																								Crowe has led a quieter life since his marriage and is touring Australia with his band Thirty Odd Foot of Grunts.																								Crowe won the 2001 best actor Oscar for the Gladiator epic and was nominated again for the same award the following year for A Beautiful Mind. 																								He said he had been trying to moderate his acting schedule since his marriage.																								I think the fact that shes pregnant is because of that, its because I havent really been running around doing the schedule at other peoples beck and call, he said.

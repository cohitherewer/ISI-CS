The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, October 28, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Fellini museum 																																	Rome, Oct. 27 (AFP): A museum devoted to the great Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini who died 10 years ago is to be opened next month in the house in the Adriatic resort of Rimini where he was born. 																																	Handwritten sketches, snatches of footage hitherto unseen, forgotten interviews, books with the directors personal annotations, even the black cap worn by the magician in La Dolce Vita, will feature among the many exhibits, said Vittorio Boarini, director of the museum foundation. 																																	One of the highlights of the exhibition when it is finally complete will be a section devoted to Fellinis masterpiece Eight and a Half. It will include the ending envisaged by Fellini, which was different, said Boarini. 																																	The foundation will also buy from the family of Fellinis widow Giulietta Masina a two-volume Book of Dreams, in which the director noted and drafted his private dreams, musings and inspirations. It is currently kept in a strongbox in a Rome bank. 																													 																Rocky sport																																	Toronto (Reuters): The competitors, in glitzy, off-the-wall costumes, call themselves professional athletes. Some even bring along team doctors to supervise their nutrition and take them through intense warmups. This is serious stuff to the 320 competitors who shook their fists early into Sunday morning at the World Rock, Paper, Scissors Championships at a nightclub in downtown Toronto. The man who won  and netted himself a purse of $3,825  was Torontos Rob Krueger. To achieve the lofty title of World RPS Champion, he threw a combination of rock-paper-paper, defeating his opponents offering of three rocks. Douglas Walker, managing director of the Toronto-based, 700-member World RPS Society, is more realistic about the so-called sport he promotes. We take rock, paper, scissors about as seriously as you take something like rock, paper, scissors. We have a lot of fun with the concept. 																													 																School sulk																																	 Nairobi (Reuters): Kenyan students set fire to their school, ransacked the kitchens and looted computers in a three-hour orgy of destruction after teachers banned video shows and discos, newspapers reported on Monday. Police using tear gas dispersed teenagers at the Kinyui Boys School in eastern Kenya after many of its 760 pupils went on the rampage on Saturday night in protest at the ban, which teachers said was designed to give them more time to study. I wanted the Form Fours to have time to concentrate on exams, school principal, Herman Kasini, told The East African Standard daily, which carried pictures of a gutted dormitory and a collapsed corrugated iron roof.

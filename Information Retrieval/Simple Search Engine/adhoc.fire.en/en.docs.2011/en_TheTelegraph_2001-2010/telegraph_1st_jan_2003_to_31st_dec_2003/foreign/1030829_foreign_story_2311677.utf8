The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, August 29, 2003 				 Nuke-free Korea mooted
																								Beijing, Aug. 28 (Reuters): China said today all six countries meeting in Beijing to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis had agreed on a mutual goal of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula as they prepared to announce another round of talks.																								Such an agreement after the second day of negotiations in Beijing to end a 10-month stand-off would amount to a major concession by North Korea, which has said it has the right to a nuclear deterrent to fend off what it regards as US hostility.																								But Japan warned that differences remained between the parties in the three-day meeting, which has been seen as just the first in a series of tough rounds of negotiation. It said no decision had been made on whether to hold another round of talks.

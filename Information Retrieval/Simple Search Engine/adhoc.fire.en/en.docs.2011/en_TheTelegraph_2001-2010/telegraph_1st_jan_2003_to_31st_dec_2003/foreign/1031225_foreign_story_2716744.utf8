 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Investors gore McDonalds
																								Washington, Dec. 24 (Reuters): The US battled the fallout today from its first case of mad cow disease as the worlds leading importers slapped bans on American beef and nervous investors punished fast-food giant McDonalds.																								In a huge blow for the $27-billion US cattle industry, Japan and South Korea, the top two buyers of US beef, swiftly halted imports along with Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Russia, Ukraine and South Africa.																								Further, Verns Moses Lake Meats, a small slaughter company in Washington state, where the diseased cow was found, recalled more than 10,000 pounds of raw beef due to concerns the products may contain meat tainted with mad cow disease.																								US agriculture secretary Ann Veneman urged Americans not to panic, saying the risk to their health was extremely low.																								I plan to serve beef for my Christmas dinner, she said.																								Europe, whose herds were devastated by the brain-wasting disorder in the 1990s, said it was keeping a close eye on the case, but it was not considering tightening protective measures already in place for years.																								The 15-nation European Union has long banned the import of most US beef because of health concerns over cattle treated with growth hormones, allowing in a limited quantity of the meat from the US.																								Britain offered the US its expertise in battling the disease which forced British farmers to destroy about 3.7 million cattle in the 1990s to try to rid the food chain of material infected with BSE or bovine spongiform encephalopathy .																								Alarm over the disease pressured share prices of fast-food companies today, fanned fears humans could become infected, and raised the spectre of mass cattle culls similar to those carried out in Europe. 																								McDonalds, the worlds largest fast-food company, said in a statement its supply chain has no connection whatsoever to the farm in Washington state where a sample of a diseased cow tested positive on December 9. But that didnt stop shares in McDonalds Holdings Co Ltd (Japan), Japans biggest restaurant chain, taking a big hit. 																								Shares of McDonalds fell more than 5.6 per cent to $23.85 near midday on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier hitting a three-month low of $23.50. Shares of Wendys International Inc, the number three burger chain, fell 4.5 per cent.																								Operators of steakhouses also suffered. Shares of Outback Steakhouse Inc. fell 4.5 per cent, and Rare Hospitality International Inc., operator of LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants, lost 7.79 per cent.																								Industry analysts said there could more pain to come for McDonalds and other fast-food outlets if consumers decided to cut back on eating beef. McDonalds has been hurt before by a consumer backlash in both Europe and Japan after they reported mad cow cases. It is a big deal, said Joe Kropf, livestock analyst with Kropf and Love Consulting. Consumers cut back on consumption and countries, for safety reasons, embargo beef from affected countries.																								US beef exports totalled $3.2 billion last year and the US cattle industry has long feared an outbreak of the disease. An outbreak in neighbouring Canada in May this year has cost it billions of dollars.

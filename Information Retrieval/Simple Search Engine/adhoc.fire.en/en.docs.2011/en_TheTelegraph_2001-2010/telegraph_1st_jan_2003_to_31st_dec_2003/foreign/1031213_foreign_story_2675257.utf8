 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Hungary bar on camera phones
																								Budapest, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Hungary moved today to stop users of new camera mobile phones from taking and sending snapshots of people without their permission.																								Hungarys data protection ombudsman ruled that mobile users transmitting pictures of people who are unaware of being photographed could be liable to prosecution  as could the mobile service providers.																								Ombudsman Attila Peterfalvi said he started an investigation after one of Hungarys three mobile providers ran an advertisement saying: If you see a good-looking girl or guy on the street, dont hesitate to share the aesthetic experience with your friends via MMS.																								Mobile phones, fitted with small cameras used in multimedia messaging (MMS), are selling fast in Hungary, where mobile penetration is a high 75.2 per cent. Taking and transmitting recordings without legal or personal accord is unlawful data handling and can lead to civil, or in some cases penal, responsibility, Peterfalvi said.																								Regulators around the world are trying to get to grips with the spread of camera phones and their invasion of privacy.

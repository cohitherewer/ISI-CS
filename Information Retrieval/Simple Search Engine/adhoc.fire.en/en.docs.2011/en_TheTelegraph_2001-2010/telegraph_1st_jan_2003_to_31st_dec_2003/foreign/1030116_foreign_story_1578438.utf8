The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Thursday, January 16, 2003 				 In a polished pop world, Lavigne is unvarnished
 															- britney killer zooms to the top				 	 Avril Lavigne during the MTV Video Music Awards in New York. (AFP)																								Shes plopped on a sofa backstage, looking bored to the point of catatonia, her only vital sign the non-stop jiggling of a pink-sneakered foot. The unfocused stare, her barely audible voice  it all says shed rather be anywhere but in this tiny room, hashing over her life, her music, her family and her seemingly instant rise from small-town obscurity to big-time Britney killer for the zillionth time.																								The only topic that interests her in this interview is how little she enjoys interviews.																								No offence or anything, its just, like, weird when someones, like, So how does it feel? she murmurs. You just shake someones hand, sit down and spill your guts. And they just want to know so much and youre just, like: Why do you care? Why do we care? Well, girlfriend, lets start with your debut album, Let Go, which has sold more than 4 million copies and is hovering at number three on the charts 31 weeks after its release. Lets move on to the five Grammy nominations, including nods for best song of the year (Complicated) and best new artist.																								No offence or anything, but that sort of cannonball grabs the attention of everyone in the pool. According to fans, this 5-foot-1, 18-year-old Canadian is leading a counteroffensive against factory-made teen pop. Lavigne (its pronounced AV-ril La-VEEN) co-writes the songs, plays an instrument and doesnt dance. She dresses in baggy pants and T-shirts, like any sophomore skipping third-period French. Shes tomboyish but cute, feisty but somehow indifferent, naughty enough to swear and flip the occasional bird.																								She certainly seems real enough during the interview, if only because theres no point in faking so much apathy. Its charming, paradoxically. Lavigne has been perfectly packaged, right down to the punky type font on her album, but she and the character shes playing onstage are the same person, and after all the beauty-pageant blankness of the midriff crowd, a kid so unprogrammed that she wont perk up for a chat is refreshing.																								Lavigne comes from a town in Ontario called Napanee, population 5,000. Her parents are strict Baptists, and Avril spent far more time at church than playing records. Actually, she never owned any LPs or CDs growing up. Aside from a couple of cassettes  the Beach Boys, Dixie Chicks  she rarely heard any pop music. Last week she bought her first Ramones album. There was always music at the church, she says. Thats where I got my start.						LAT-WP

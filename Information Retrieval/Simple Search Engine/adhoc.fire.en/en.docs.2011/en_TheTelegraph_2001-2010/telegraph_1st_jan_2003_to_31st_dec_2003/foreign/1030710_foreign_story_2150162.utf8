 Three-sided clash erupts in Tehran 
 Tehran, July 9 (Reuters): Hundreds of Iranian hardline Islamic vigilantes, police and pro-democracy youths fought three-sided running street battles near Tehran University today on the anniversary of 1999 student unrest.A witness said police had fired tear gas at groups of youths near the campus and also fought fist fights with plainclothes Islamic militiamen to prevent them from engaging in further running battles with youths.Earlier witnesses said armed Iranian Islamic vigilantes seized three student leaders as they left a news conference where they announced they had cancelled protests to mark the anniversary of 1999 university unrest.Authorities have banned off-campus rallies, closed campus dormitories, postponed summer exams and vowed to deal strictly with any unrest after arresting 4,000 people during 10 nights of sometimes violent protests across the country in June.The cancelled demonstrations had been planned to mark the day four years ago when hardline vigilantes fiercely loyal to conservative clerics attacked a Tehran University dormitory, killing one person and sparking five days of mass protests.UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei said today he had agreed with Iranian officials to send a team of experts to Tehran next week to clarify Iranian concerns over tighter nuclear inspections. Iran has so far resisted calls to sign the additional protocol to the nuclear Non-Proliferation  Copyright

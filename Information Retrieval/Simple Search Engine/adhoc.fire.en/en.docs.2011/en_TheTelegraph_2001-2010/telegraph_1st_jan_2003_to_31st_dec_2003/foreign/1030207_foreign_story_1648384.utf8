The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, February 07, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Stolen life vests																																	There are many flights from which 16 to 20 life vests have been stolen, the head of Vietnam Airlines security department Hoang Duy Khanh was quoted by Thanh Nien newspaper as saying. The carrier spends $50,000 a year replacing the missing vests, which are usually stolen on flights to beach destinations such as Danang, Nha Trang or Haiphong, the paper said.																													 																Rap for Ice-T 																																	Hearing officer David Kirschblum issued the order after Ice-T waived his right to a paternity trial when Kirschblum said DNA tests proved the rapper-actor was the father of Kevin Ice Marrow. Ice-T, whose real name is Tracy Marrow, initially denied he had an affair with Linda Marie Sanchez, 27, from the New York City borough of the Bronx. Sanchez, a Board of Education clerk, earns $589 every two weeks. She had asked for $8,000 a month in support.																													 																Job fear																																	The working population neglects their health due to the economic downturn, said the study issued by Watsons, a chain of chemist stores. They dont wish to affect the evaluation of their boss. Over 70 per cent of the 600-plus respondents who suffered from cold or flu in the past three months said they did not take sick leave despite feeling ill. Hong Kongs unemployment stood at 7.2 per cent in the last quarter of 2002.																						Cleese bone																																	Cleese sued the Evening Standard after it wrote a story which pondered whether his recent move to the US had resulted in him becoming a humiliating flop. His lawyers told Londons High Court the article last April, headlined: So, has John Cleese lost his funny bone? was a thinly veiled, gratuitous and vitriolic attack. Among other things, the article said: The American nation has rightly turned upon him... Such humiliation is richly deserved because of his arrogance and presumption.

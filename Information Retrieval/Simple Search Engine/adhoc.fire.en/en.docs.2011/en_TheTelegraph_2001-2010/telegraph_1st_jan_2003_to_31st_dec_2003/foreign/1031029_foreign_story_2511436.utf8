 Wednesday, October 29, 2003 				 Bias boot for Oxford professor 
 Tel Aviv, Oct. 28 (Reuters):  An Israeli student today welcomed the suspension of an Oxford  University professor who rejected his application for graduate  studies in a protest against the Jewish states treatment  of Palestinians.																								Nuffield professor of pathology Andrew Wilkie was suspended for two months without pay yesterday after an investigation by the British university into an e-mail in which he refused to consider accepting Amit Duvshani, an Israeli military veteran, into his research group.																								I am satisfied that a decision has been made to take action against him, Duvshani, a researcher in Tel Aviv Universitys department of cellular and developmental biology, said. 																								This is not a matter of personal vendetta, but of exposing academic boycotts against Israel as part of anti-Semitic trends in the world and specifically Europe, said Duvshani, 27. 																								Israeli academics have at times been subject to hostile scrutiny at foreign universities since a Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in September 2000. Responding to Duvshanis query in June, Wilkie wrote: I am sure that you are perfectly nice at a personal level but no way would I take on somebody who had served in the Israeli army.

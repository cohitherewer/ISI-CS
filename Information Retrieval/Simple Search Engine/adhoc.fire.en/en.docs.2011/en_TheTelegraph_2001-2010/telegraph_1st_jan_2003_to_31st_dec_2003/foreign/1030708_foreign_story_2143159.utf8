 Tuesday, July 08, 2003 				 Suu Kyi sowing chaos: Junta
				 	 Aung San Suu Kyi 																								Yangon, July 7 (Reuters): Myanmars ruling military accused detained pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi today of sowing chaos and squandering chances to engage the government in talks on the countrys political future.																								The comments, made in the third instalment of a commentary carried in all state-run press, said Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi was detained after trying to stir up unrest while touring the country.																								The real aim behind the trip was to confuse the political situation all along the way, and to further inflame and confound it to cause chaos, the commentary said.																								Suu Kyi was arrested on May 30 following a clash between supporters and pro-junta groups as she visited supporters outside the capital, Yangon.																								The government has so far refused to bow to international pressure to release her.																								Witnesses to the violence who fled to Thailand, say hundreds of pro-government supporters set upon a convoy in which Suu Kyi was travelling, killing dozens of people.																								 The junta denies the claims, blaming Suu Kyi for the clash in which it says four people were killed.																								The newspaper commentaries today were accompanied by undated photos of Suu Kyi meeting junta chief General Than Shwe and other military leaders and said Suu Kyi had failed to make the most of opportunities for talks with the government.																								Suu Kyis National League for Democracy, which won 1990 elections in Myanmar but has never been allowed to take power, says the government has refused to begin substantive dialogue.																								Official newspapers quoted General Khin Nyunt, chief of military intelligence, on yesterday as saying international sanctions to press Myanmar to release Suu Kyi were acts of bullying and a violation of international law.																								The general said every nation had the right to prevent unrest, hinting that Suu Kyi would not be released any time soon.																								International anger with the regime has mounted in recent weeks, with the European Union and the United States threatening harsher sanctions and key donor Japan suspending new aid.																								Myanmar has responded by sending its foreign minister and deputy foreign minister on a tour of Asian capitals, showing pictures of Suu Kyi in detention in efforts to allay concern.

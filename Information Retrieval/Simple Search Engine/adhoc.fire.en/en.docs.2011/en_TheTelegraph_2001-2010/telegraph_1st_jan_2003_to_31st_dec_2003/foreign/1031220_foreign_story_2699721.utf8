 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Japan missile jitters for Asia
																								Tokyo, Dec. 19 (Reuters): Japan said today it would buy a US-made missile defence system and conduct a review of its defence capabilities in a move that could unnerve other Asian countries.																								Domestic support for the introduction of a missile defence system, mooted since North Korea sent a ballistic missile over Japan in 1998, has grown over the past year because of Pyongyangs nuclear programme.																								Chief cabinet secretary Yasuo Fukuda announced the decision to endorse a defence agency proposal on missile defence after a meeting of Japans Security Council. There is no intent to harm other countries. This is a completely defensive system, Fukuda said.																								The government planned to complete the defence review and a medium-term defence equipment plan by the end of 2004, he said, giving no details on the review, other than to say it would take into account the current security environment.																								One topic may be Japans self-imposed ban on arms exports, which must be modified if Tokyo wants to push ahead with its joint development of a next-generation missile defence system with the US. 																								The first stage of the two-part missile defence system Japan intends to buy consists of Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) systems that could be fired at missiles in mid-course from Japans four existing high-tech Aegis destroyers. 																								The second line of defence would be provided by ground-to-air Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles, upgrading the PAC-2 system Japans armed forces already possess.

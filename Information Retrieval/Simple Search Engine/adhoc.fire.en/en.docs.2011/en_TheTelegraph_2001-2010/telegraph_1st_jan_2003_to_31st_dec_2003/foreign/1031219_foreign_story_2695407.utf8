 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Internet sting to nab paedophiles
																								London, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Police from Britain, North America and Australia launched a crackdown on Internet paedophiles today with a sting using fake, child-porn websites.																								They said Operation Pin is the largest international drive yet to curtail the growing online marketplace for child pornography. At a London news conference, detectives provided grisly details of a brisk international trade. The most extreme sites charge visitors to view adults abusing children in actual time and encourage them to type in suggestions on torture tactics. 																								With investigators across the world swamped by child porn cases, Operation Pin represents a new twist with police taking the offensive by warning both hardcore paedophiles that they are committing a crime.																								What we are saying is the Internet is now a hostile place. If you are a paedophile and you are out there, we are going to make it much more difficult to operate, said assistant chief constable Jim Gamble. As part of the sting, police are to set up sites that purport to contain child porn images. Visitors will be given the choice of proceeding through a series of web pages that leads to a law enforcement site where they are informed their details have been captured and that they could be prosecuted.

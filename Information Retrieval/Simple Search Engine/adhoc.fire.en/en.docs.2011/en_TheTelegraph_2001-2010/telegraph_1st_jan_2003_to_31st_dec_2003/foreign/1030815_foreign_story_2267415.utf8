 Friday, August 15, 2003 				 US threat sparks Saudi response
				 	 Crown Prince Abdullah																								Riyadh, Aug. 14 (Reuters): Crown Prince Abdullah said Saudi Arabia would triumph over evil powers in its war against terror after warnings by the US and Britain of new terror threats in the kingdom.																								The de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, birthplace of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, warned people not to back terrorists. In the decisive battle between powers of good and powers of evil, there is no room for neutrality or hesitancy... He who protects or sympathises with a terrorist is himself a terrorist and will receive his just punishment, the crown prince said in remarks carried by the official Saudi Press Agency today.																								His comments followed warnings by the US and Britain yesterday of new terror threats in Saudi Arabia, a key regional US ally and the worlds largest oil exporter.																								A Saudi security official said that authorities were still chasing suspected militants linked to al Qaida  blamed for the September 11, 2001, attacks on US cities. We will continue to uproot evil terrorists and expect to accomplish something soon, he said. Facing US accusations of failing to rein in militants, Saudi Arabia has cracked down on Islamists suspected of links to al Qaida after triple suicide bombings at housing compounds in Riyadh in May killed 35 people, including nine Americans.																								There have been several arrests and bloody clashes in which at least 16 suspects and 11 Saudi policemen have died.

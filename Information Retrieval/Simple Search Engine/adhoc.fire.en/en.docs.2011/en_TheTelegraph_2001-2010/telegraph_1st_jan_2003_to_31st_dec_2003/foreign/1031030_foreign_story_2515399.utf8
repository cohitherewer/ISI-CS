 MARCUS WARREN				 	 Jessica Lynch New York, Oct. 29: A journey  to the home town of Jessica Lynch by the Iraqi lawyer who  helped to free the young American soldier ended in embarrassment  for all concerned when she snubbed him.																								Lynch, portrayed as a heroine of our times for her courage while a prisoner of war, was too busy to receive the visitor, her familys lawyer said. Her saviour, Mohammed al-Rehaief, was outwardly understanding of her failure to appear during his trip. I know she had a very difficult time in Iraq and she takes rest, he said.																								However, Al-Rehaief, who has been granted asylum in the US for fear of revenge attacks in Iraq, was reported to be disappointed by her failure to meet him on his visit to Palestine, West Virginia.																								The Lynchs lawyer, Stephen Goodwin, denied that rivalry between the 20-year-old former soldier and her Iraqi benefactor over competing media projects was to blame for her absence. Absolutely not, he said. Lynchs book, I Am a Soldier, Too, the fruit of a 600,000 publishing deal, will be released next month and the countdown to her first television interview in two weeks time has already begun.																								But she has been beaten into print by Al-Rehaief, whose own work, Because Each Life is Precious, was published earlier this month. 																								In it he describes how he braved bullets to reach the advancing American military and tip them off about the young female private lying wounded in a hospital in the city of Nasiriyah. She was rescued by Special Forces  a week after beinginjured and captured in an ambush. Her  ordeal briefly overshadowed the armys march on Baghdad  as the story of the war. Mr al-Rehaief was given a heros  welcome during histrip to Palestine and named an honorary  West Virginian. But the misunderstandings were  not confined to Miss Lynchs refusal to attend any  of the ceremonies. Local people laid on an impressive spread  at a reception to greet the al-Rehaiefs, only to discover  that the family was fasting for Ramadan. Even if the guests had been hungry  they would have been unlikely, as Muslims, to tuck into  the ham sandwiches on offer.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

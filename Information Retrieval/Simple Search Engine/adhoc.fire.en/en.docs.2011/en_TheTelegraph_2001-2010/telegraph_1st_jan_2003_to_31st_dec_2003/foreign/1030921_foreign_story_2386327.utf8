																								Karachi, Sept. 20 (Reuters): Pakistani security officials detained 15 southeast Asian Islamic students in Karachi today, saying they had ties with Muslim militants and were involved in activities damaging to Pakistans interests. Interrogators wanted to determine  if the suspects had links with Osama bin Ladens al Qaida  network and if they were plotting attacks, an intelligence  official said. Thirteen of the suspects are Malaysian and  two are Indonesian, an official said.

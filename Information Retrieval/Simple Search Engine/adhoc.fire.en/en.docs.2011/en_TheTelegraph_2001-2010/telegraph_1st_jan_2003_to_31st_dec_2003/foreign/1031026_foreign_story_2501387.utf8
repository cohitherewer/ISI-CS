 Sunday, October 26, 2003 				 First ruling against spam in California
																								San Francisco, Oct. 25 (Reuters): California won its first anti-spam judgment yesterday when a court fined a marketing firm $2 million for sending out millions of unsolicited e-mails telling people how to spam, the states attorney general said.																								Attorney general Bill Lockyer brought the case against PW Marketing of Los Angeles County and its owners Paul Willis and Claudia Griffin in 2002 under a 1998 state anti-spam law. The law was strengthened last month to make it easier to sue spammers.																								Lockyers spokesman Tom Dressler said while this case was decided under the original statute, the attorney generals office expects in the future it will be easier to try cases under the updated, tougher law. PW Marketing and Willis and Griffin were charged with sending out millions of e-mails advertising how to guides on spamming and long lists of e-mail addresses. The judgment forbids PW Marketing from sending unsolicited commercial e-mail.

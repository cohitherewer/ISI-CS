Ice trouble																																	 Rome (Reuters): Ice cream proved too tempting and ultimately troublesome for one Italian under house arrest. The man, in his 40s, popped out to get a gelato but bumped into the tax police as he left the shop in the northern town of Lecco, Ansa news agency reported on Sunday. The police asked to see his receipt as part of a spot check carried out across the country to make sure shopkeepers ring up all their sales and pay the right taxes. The man didnt have the crucial slip of paper and during further questioning police discovered he had broken his house arrest and hauled him off to prison.																													 																Anna talk																																	 Toronto (Reuters): Ice hockey star Sergei Fedorov has admitted that he and tennis player Anna Kournikova were married but are now divorced and no longer talk. The 33-year-old, rated as one of the top players in the National Hockey League, confirmed his relationship with 21-year-old Kournikova in the Hockey News. They are true, said Fedorov, when asked about rumours concerning their wedding. We were married, albeit briefly, and we are now divorced. Fedorov has had a long-running relationship with the Russian dating back to the time when she burst onto the tennis scene as a teenager. His mother told reporters back in 2001 that they had been married in a Moscow registry office. Kournikova has also been linked with several other high-profile athletes and entertainers.

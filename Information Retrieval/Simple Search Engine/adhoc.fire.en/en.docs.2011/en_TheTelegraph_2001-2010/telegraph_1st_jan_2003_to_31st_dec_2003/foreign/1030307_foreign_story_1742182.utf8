The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, March 07, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																All night long																																	 Singapore, March 6 (Reuters): Singapore, trying to shatter its prudish image, may let pubs stay open 24 hours and allow bar-top dancing, a newspaper said today.																																	Most bars in the tightly controlled city state are licensed to serve until 3 am, while table-top dancing is banned and bar owners must ensure any dancing is kept to well-marked areas. The government was likely to accept recommendations by a public advisory board allowing bars to stay open 24 hours if they met regulations on noise, public safety and the environment, the Straits Times said.																																	Next month the government will unveil the first review of its famously conservative censorship laws in 10 years. These now snip racy scenes from movies, prohibit the sale of Playboy and Cosmopolitan magazines and ban the US television sitcom Sex and the City.																													 																Jazz greats																																	 Montreal (Reuters): Norah Jones, Ray Charles, Mark Knopfler and Ben Harper will headline the 24th edition of the Montreal Jazz Festival, one of the worlds largest musical gatherings, organisers said on Wednesday. The festival, which overtakes Montreals downtown core, runs from June 26 to July 6. Jones will perform on July 2 while rhythm-and-blues elder statesman Charles and his big band appear on June 26.

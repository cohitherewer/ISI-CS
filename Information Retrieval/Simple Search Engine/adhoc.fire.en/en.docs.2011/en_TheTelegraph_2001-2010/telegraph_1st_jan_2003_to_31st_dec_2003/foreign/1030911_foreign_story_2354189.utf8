(AFP) Gaza, Sept. 10 (Reuters):  The military wing of the Islamic militant group Hamas threatened  today to change tactics by attacking Israeli houses and  buildings after Israel tried to kill a Hamas political leader  in his home in the Gaza Strip.																								The targeting of civilian houses is a violation of all red lines. Therefore the Zionist enemy will have to shoulder responsibility for the targeting by us of houses and Zionist buildings everywhere in occupied Palestine, the Izz el-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas military wing, said in a statement.																								Hamas is sworn to the destruction of Israel, which it says is built on occupied Palestinian land. It has spearhead a suicide bombing campaign that has killed hundreds of Israelis since a Palestinian uprising began 34 months ago. We reiterate that in the past we have avoided targeting houses and Zionist residential buildings but the enemy was the one to initiate it and the enemy has to harvest what it has sown, said the statement, which was sent to news organisations.																								An Israeli missile today flattened Hamas political leader Mahmoud al-Zahars house in the Gaza Strip.																								It was the latest in a series of air strikes that have killed 12 Islamic militants since a Hamas suicide bombing killed 22 Israelis in Jerusalem on August 19. 																								Our painful operations were to tell the enemy that we have struck you when your security arrangements reached a climax yesterday. Our response came, and has not been completed yet, the statement by the Hamas military wing said.																								We sent this message to tell the terrorist (Israeli Prime Minister Ariel) Sharon and his Nazi government that we are able, by Gods will, to achieve our goal in a time which we will determine, it said.

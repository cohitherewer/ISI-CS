Walt Disneys most famous round-eared creation, whose face and silhouette are familiar to generations of children across the world, first appeared on November 18, 1928 in the animated short film Steamboat Willie. 																																	And now Disney is adapting Mickey to 21st-century digital technology, with the release next year of Mickeys twice upon a Christmas, which for the first time features him in three-dimensional computer-generated images.																																	The secret to his longevity, according to Dave Smith, Disney archive director, is his sunny disposition. Mickey Mouse has fun all the time. He is drawn by artists who keep him young, and he never ages.

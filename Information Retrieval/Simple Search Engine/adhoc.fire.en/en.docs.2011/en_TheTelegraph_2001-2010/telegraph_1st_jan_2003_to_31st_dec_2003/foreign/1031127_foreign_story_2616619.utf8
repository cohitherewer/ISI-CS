 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 Jackson legal torrent threat
																								Los Angeles, Nov. 26(Reuters): Michael Jacksons lawyer charged today that child molestation accusations against the pop star were driven by greed and threatened a legal torrent against anyone who besmirched Jacksons reputation.																								If anybody doesnt think ... that the true motivation of these charges and allegations is anything but money and the seeking of money then they are living in their own Neverland, attorney Mark Geragos said, in reference to Jacksons Neverland Valley Ranch near Santa Barbara in central California.																								Geragos also said Jackson yesterday sued the owners of a private jet that last week brought him to Santa Barbara to be arrested and fingerprinted by police  claiming that someone with the XtraJet company had planted video cameras on the plane and then tried to sell the tapes to news organisations.																								As Geragos spoke, prosecutors announced that they would not file formal charges against the one-time King of Pop until mid-December because they needed time to create a website where the documents could be posted online.																								Geragos took no questions and directed his remarks almost entirely at those who, he said, were trying to profit from Jacksons misfortune. Michael Jackson is not going to be abused. Michael Jackson is not going to be slammed, is not going to be a pinata for every person who has financial motives, he said.																								We will land on you like a ton of bricks, Geragos said. We will land on you like a hammer if you do anything to besmirch this mans reputation.																								The high-profile lawyer said Jackson had obtained a temporary restraining order against XtraJet which prohibited it from showing, distributing or selling the videotape. 																								We will put XtraJet out of business for this outrageous act, he said. 																								Michael Jackson is no longer going to be on the receiving end of every scurrilous accusation known to man.

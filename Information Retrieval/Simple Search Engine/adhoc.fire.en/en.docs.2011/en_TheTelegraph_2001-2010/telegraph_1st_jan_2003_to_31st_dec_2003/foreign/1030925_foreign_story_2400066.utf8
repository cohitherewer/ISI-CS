 Thursday, September 25, 2003 				 Chinese publisher alters Hillarybook
																								New York, Sept. 24 (Reuters): Senator Hillary Clintons publisher today demanded the recall of the Chinese language printing of the senators autobiography, calling it an inaccurate version which omits several passages critical of the countrys human rights record.																								In a tersely worded statement, Simon amp; Schuster said the Chinese edition of Living History included unauthorised changes and demanded government-owned publisher Yilin Press remedy the issue by publishing an unaltered version. Yilin has yet to reply to the request.																								At issue are 10 pages in the book, where the Chinese publisher deleted passages detailing Clintons views on China and her travels there. Simon amp; Schuster called the omissions a breach of contract and made the offending passages available on its website in both English and Mandarin. We were shocked to learn of this problem and wanted to provide a quick and accurate way for Chinese readers to read the missing passages while we sort out the legal issues with Yilin, said Carolyn Reidy, president of Simon amp; Schuster.																								The book has sold 200,000 copies in China in its first month of release there, making it the best selling foreign political memoir in Chinese history.

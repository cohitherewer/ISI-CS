The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Pope moved by Gibsons Christ
																								Vatican City, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Pope John Paul has seen Mel Gibsons controversial film The Passion of Christ about Christs final hours and was moved by it, a Vatican source said today.																								He said the pope saw the film with his long-time Polish secretary, archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, about 10 days ago. The source also confirmed reports that the pope told his secretary after viewing the film: It is as it was, meaning he considered it an authentic portrayal of Gospel accounts of the last hours in Christs life.																								The movie, which covers the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ, has come under fire from some Jewish groups who fear its story could foment anti-Semitism because it portrays Jewish authorities as largely responsible for Christs death.																								But Catholic and other Christian groups, as well as biblical scholars, have defended the film.

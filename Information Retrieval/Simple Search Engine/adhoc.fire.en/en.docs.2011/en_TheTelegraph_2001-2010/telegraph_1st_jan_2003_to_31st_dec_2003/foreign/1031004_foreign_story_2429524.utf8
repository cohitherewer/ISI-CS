Snap stamp Tokyo (Reuters): Snap-happy Japans  love affair with the camera has reached new heights people  can now put their face or favourite picture on a stamp.  Japan is the birthplace of the wildly popular Print Club  booths, where customers have their photo taken and turned  into tiny stickers used to decorate everything from mobile  phones to school notebooks, and this takes that technology  a step further. The customers photo is taken by a special  machine and printed on stamp sheets, a process that lasts  only a few minutes. Each stamp also features a design of  roses, cherry blossoms, a heart or cats, according to the  customers choice. Those wishing to show off their own photographic  skills can take a favourite snapshot down to the local post  office and order stamps made from it. These take about three  weeks to process and cost 1,000 yen per sheet of 10 stamps,  said an official at the Communications Museum in Tokyo.  A Japan Post official said both services were proving popular,  selling a total of 100,000 sheets of stamps since they began.  Royal row																																	 Paris: The Comte de Paris, the head of the Orleans family and pretender to the throne of France, has lost a legal battle to change his surname to Bourbon on the grounds that his family dropped the name 350 years ago. Henri, Duc dOrleans, 70, had argued in the Paris court of appeal that it was his legal right to call himself Henri de Bourbon. As head of the House of Bourbon-Orleans, he is regarded by many French legitimists as King Henri VII. He is a direct descendant of the last king of France, Louis Philippe. But the court ruled yesterday that he was not entitled to the Bourbon name as his forebear, Philippe dOrleans, the youngest son of Louis XIII, abandoned it in the mid-1600s.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Sunday, November 30, 2003 				 Chandrika offers Ranil post
 																											- Government says proposal worsens political crisis																								Colombo, Nov. 29 (Reuters): Sri Lankas President has offered her rival Prime Minister a role in the defence ministry, state media reported today, but the government said her proposal had only complicated efforts to resolve the political crisis.																								President Chandrika Kumaratunga fired the defence, interior and media ministers in early November. She accused the Prime Minister of compromising security by conceding too much in his efforts to end 20 years of war with Tamil Tiger rebels, who are seeking a separate state in the north and east.																								Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe  who was elected separately and from a rival party  responded by saying he could not carry on the peace process without control over those portfolios. The Prime Minister will nominate to the President a suitable candidate who can work cordially with the President for the post of minister assisting defence, said Kumaratungas proposal, published in the state-run Daily News.																								But a government official who is part of a committee the two sides established to try to resolve their power struggle expressed confusion over the offer.																								We (the committee) had agreed on a different formula to which both the President and Prime Minister had agreed, Malik Samarawickreme, chairman of Wickremesinghes United National Party, said.																								We were looking forward to going forward with that  we just had to work out the details. But this is something totally new, he said. He would not comment on the nature of the proposal the committee had agreed.																								Kumaratungas blueprint also said Wickremesinghe should remain in charge of the peace bid  which has been thrown into limbo by their feud  but proposed a Joint Peace Council to be co-chaired by the two to oversee and manage the overall peace process.																								Norway, which brokered a truce holding since February 2002, suspended its role until it was clear who was handling the process, but the Presidents proposal said Oslo should continue to act as peace broker.																								There was no immediate comment from the rebels on Kumaratungas draft.																								Other elements of the proposal include an Advisory Council on Peace composed of representatives of all parties, clergy and other civil society groups, which would provide ideas and suggestions on the peace process.																								Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe were expected to meet next week for a third time since the crisis began.																								Velupillai Prabhakaran, reclusive head of the LTTE, blasted the political leaders on Thursday for endangering efforts to end the war. He said the rebels were committed to peace but repeated his warning that the minority Tamil people would have no alternative but to secede and form an independent state if they continued to face oppression.

 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 War cloud on Minnelli party
				 	 Liza Minnelli																								New York, March 17 (Reuters): Liza and David regret...																								Plans for what was being billed as the showbiz party of the year have been put on hold because of the gathering Iraq war clouds.																								We held off sending our invitations out because we want to have our party when the world is at peace and people can come and enjoy themselves, said singeractress Liza Minnelli. She had planned the celebration of the first anniversary of her marriage to producer David Gest for April 15 at New Yorks Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square.																								With the threat of war imminent and considering more than 1,200 guests would be travelling from many different parts of the world, Liza Minnelli and David Gest have decided to postpone their anniversary party, spokesman Warren Cowan said.																								The couple feels that it is not an appropriate time for a celebration until after the resolution of the problem with Iraq, when a new date will be announced, he said.																								Minnelli and her fourth husband, Gest, married last March in New York in a starstudded ceremony whose guest list included Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Jackson and Diana Ross.

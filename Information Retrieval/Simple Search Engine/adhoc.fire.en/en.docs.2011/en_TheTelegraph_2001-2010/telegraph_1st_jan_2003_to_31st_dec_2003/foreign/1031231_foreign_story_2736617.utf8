 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Israel orders settlement eviction 
																								Ginot Arye (West Bank), Dec. 30 (Reuters): Israeli soldiers posted eviction orders today at four unauthorised Jewish outposts in the West Bank slated for removal under a US-backed road map for peace.																								Israel says the planned removal of four settlements built without government approval is in line with its commitment to the plan, but Palestinians dismiss it as a publicity stunt. Only one of the outposts in occupied territory is inhabited.																								Eviction orders were taped on doors at the West Bank outpost of Ginot Arye, a cluster of a dozen caravans one km from the the established settlement of Ofra. Settlers are outraged at Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, for long their champion, over plans to remove any of them.																								Road signs																								Police were not amused by a British Airways advertising campaign that placed hundreds of road signs in Israeli cities directing drivers to Buckingham Palace and other London landmarks.																								They look like official traffic signs and we think they may confuse drivers, a police spokesperson said today.

 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Democrat wants French fries back 
																								Washington, Sept. 16 (Reuters): To get international help to rebuild Iraq, Congress may have to eat some French fries and French toast, according to Representative Sheila Jackson Lee.																								Saying it is time to put aside differences with France, the Texas Democrat circulated a letter yesterday urging the US House of Representatives to put back the word French in fries and toast on House cafeteria and dining hall menus.																								Lawmakers ordered them renamed freedom fries and freedom toast last spring, reflecting anger at France for its opposition to the US-led war to topple Saddam Hussein as Iraqs President. 																								But times have changed, Jackson Lee said, and now the Washington is trying to get France and other members of the UN to contribute money and troops to stabilise Iraq and rebuild its devastated infrastructure.																								President Bush is now urging that all parties put aside past bickering, she said in her letter. 																								A symbolic start to that effort would be reinstating foods on the House menus with their traditional American names  French toast and French fries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International
 Tuesday, July 01, 2003  Fine Print				 				 				 																Potter spell																																	 Paris, June 30 (Reuters): Harry Potter has cast such a spell over the French that they are snapping up JK Rowlings latest book in English, rather than waiting for the translation.																																	The latest adventure of the child wizard became the first English-language book to top Frances best-seller list this week as parents and children decided they could not wait for the French translations release in December.																																	Its not exactly going to please the anti-globalisation movement, noted literary magazine Livres Hebdo, which compiles and publishes the bestseller charts. A spokeswoman for Livres Hebdo said Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix hit the top of chart on a preliminary estimate of 16,000 copies sold since June 21.																													 																Trauma time Vienna (Reuters): A woman lay awake during  surgery for 45 minutes, unable to move or call for help,  after staff forgot to hook up the machine pumping out anaesthetic,  Austrian daily Kurier reported on Monday. The woman  was temporarily paralysed because she had been given a muscle  relaxant, and her ordeal ended only after a replacement  doctor who entered the operating room saw tears in her eyes  and noticed the machine was not connected properly. The  woman is suing for 70,000 euros in damages.

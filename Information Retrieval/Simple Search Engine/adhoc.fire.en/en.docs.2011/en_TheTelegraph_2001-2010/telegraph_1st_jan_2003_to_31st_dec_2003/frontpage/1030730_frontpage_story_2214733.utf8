 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AMP; YOGESH VAJPEYI																								New Delhi/Lucknow, July 29: The BJP-BSP alliance teetered on the brink through the day after Atal Bihari Vajpayee rejected Mayavatis call for Union minister Jagmohans resignation, but the crisis appeared to blow over in the evening when she withdrew the demand.																								The Uttar Pradesh chief minister rushed to Delhi to meet Prime Minister Vajpayee and his deputy, .K. Advani, to clear the air. Emerging from the two-hour meeting tonight, Mayavati said the coalition would run very well and that her party would have a tie-up with the BJP for the general elections.																								In the morning, Vajpayee had rejected Mayavatis demand in the BJP parliamentary party meeting. Later, the partys Uttar Pradesh MPs met him and sought withdrawal of support to the Mayavati government. The BJP and the BSP have been allies in the state for over a year.																								The BJP high command, so far indulgent towards the chief minister, indicated it would seriously consider their demand. 																								Mayavati then withdrew her demand and expressed regret for the conduct of her MPs, who stalled Parliament, at a press conference in Lucknow. 																								It was never my intention to disrupt our alliance in UP and since Vajpayee and Advani have assured me that my grievances would be redressed, I have withdrawn my demand, she said. Mayavati has had a good rapport with Advani since he attended a BSP rally in Lucknow last year.																								However, BJP sources said we are still keeping our options open and a decision would be taken in a meeting of the partys parliamentary board tomorrow. BJP spokespersons were asked by party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu not to welcome Mayavatis change of heart.																								Before meeting Mayavati, the BJP brass went into a huddle at 7 Race Course Road. Advani, Naidu, finance minister Jaswant Singh and human resources development minister M.M. Joshi were present.																								Sources had then said that depending on how repentant she sounded, a decision would be taken on holding the parliamentary board meeting. But the BJP was in a mood to keep the chief minister on a leash, if only for a night, so that she would not take the party for granted.																								BJP sources wondered what provoked Mayavati to shout for Jagmohans resignation after welcoming a CBI inquiry into the Taj corridor controversy. Mayavati had yesterday accused the minister of trying to tarnish her image using the Taj controversy.																								The days drama had started in the BJP parliamentary party meeting, where Vajpayee said he had told Mayavati last night that Jagmohan would continue to hold office as long as he wanted him to. He warned her it would be improper to raise the matter in Parliament. But BSP MPs forced repeated adjournments  in the Lok Sabha and floor leader Rashid Alvi went on TV  to iterate the demand. Mayavatis climbdown may have saved  the coalition but observers see this as the beginning of  its end.

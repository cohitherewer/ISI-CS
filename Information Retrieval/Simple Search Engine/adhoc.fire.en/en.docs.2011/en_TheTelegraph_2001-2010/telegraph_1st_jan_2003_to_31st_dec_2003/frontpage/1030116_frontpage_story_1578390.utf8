 Thursday, January 16, 2003 				 Tragedy in safety week
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 15: On the third day of the Road Safety Week today, a minibus crushed three persons to death against the pavement barrier at the Park Street-Chowringhee crossing.																								The death toll in road accidents since Monday has now touched seven.																								The deaths occurred 48 hours after police commissioner Sujoy Chakrabortys look-before-you-cross sermon to educated Calcuttans with a mental block.																								Brothers Sanatan Pal, 45, and Nitai, 35, and an unidentified bystander were standing on the road  not on the pavement waiting to cross it.																								Two were injured  one of them a passenger whom the driver had ticked off a few minutes before the accident for daring to teach him how to drive  and rushed to SSKM Hospital.																								The mishap, according to injured passenger Yasin Sheikh, occurred when the driver was trying to overtake several other buses from the left  as he was doing through the entire journey.																								The drivers aim was to reach first the large number of people waiting a few metres ahead of the southern gateway of the Park Street Metro Railway station  a few metres from the designated bus stop.																								Traffic police constables and sergeants at the spot  one of the busiest intersections in the city  were apparently doing nothing to stop the people or the drivers from flouting traffic rules.																								The deaths have turned the spotlight on how traffic and pedestrian management are largely left unattended, even at busy intersections.																								Officials later admitted that a mad rush for passengers  and an equally crazy rush among passengers to catch the first bus in  was a daily occurrence at the spot.

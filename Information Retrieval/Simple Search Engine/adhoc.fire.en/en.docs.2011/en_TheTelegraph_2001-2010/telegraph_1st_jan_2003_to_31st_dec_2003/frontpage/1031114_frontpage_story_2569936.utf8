 Friday, November 14, 2003 				 PSC fulfils Munda wish
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Nov. 13: The Jharkhand Public Service Commission today finally announced the results of the jinxed primary school teachers recruitment test.																								This will help Arjun Munda fulfil his wish of distributing appointment letters on the states third foundation day on Saturday.																								The JPSC has announced a list of candidates to fill 9,323 vacancies in all 22 Jharkhand districts.																								The chief minister said the commission had informed him that the results had been declared and a copy of the results has been sent to the government. JPSC chairman P.C. Hembrom said the results had been sent to the personnel department and newspapers for publication.																								Uncertainty has surrounded the teachers appointment ever since the Babulal Marandi regime announced plans of holding written tests in early 2002. But the unemployed trained teachers unions and Opposition parties instead wanted direct recruitment, resulting in controversy and a waste of time.																								When the government finally went ahead with the appointment process, the appointment rules were challenged in Jharkhand High Court, causing another delay.																								After the matter was resolved, the court restricted the commission from announcing the results till the JPSC was constituted with five members, including the chairperson. The fifth member was appointed last Saturday.																								Marandi wanted to distribute the appointment letters on Independence Day last year, but this did not happen. A number of distribution dates were announced and fell through  Teachers Day, Jharkhands second foundation day and Republic Day 2003.																								The results have finally been announced just two days short of the states turning three, and under a new chief minister.																								Munda said deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani would not be coming to Ranchi on foundation day. It is certain he (Advani) is not coming. He had himself said that he would come, but when I talked to him on phone, he expressed his inability due to some urgent work in the Northeast. He said his trip to Arunachal (Pradesh) had been cancelled thrice, so his visit there on (November) 15 was necessary, the chief minister added.																								Munda said Jharkhand had made special arrangements for the foundation day. Union labour minister Sahib Singh Verma will be the chief guest at the function. Union ministers Nitish Kumar, Digvijay Singh and Rajiv Pratap Rudy will also come, he said.

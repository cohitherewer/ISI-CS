 Sunday, November 30, 2003 				 Mob thrashes minister son for kidnap bid
 JOY SENGUPTA																								Ranchi, Nov. 29: Forest and environment minister Yamuna Singhs son Dilip Kumar was today thrashed by a mob and handed over to police after he allegedly tried to kidnap a girl.																								Though a formal complaint is still to be lodged by the victim, the ministers son has been detained at the Lalpur police station. 																								Dilip, reportedly started chasing the girl  who was riding pillion on a motorcycle  in a forest department Gypsy from Kutchery Chowk and tried to pull her into his vehicle near Lalpur Chowk. He was accompanied by Khunti-based forester Vinod Jaiswal. While Dilip was caught by the mob, Jaiswal managed to escape.																								Police sources said when the girl reached Apsara Hotel on Circular Road, Dilip tried to pull her into his car. Eyewitnesses added that the Gypsy occupants also thrashed the boy who was riding the motorbike when he tried to resist.																								Timely intervention by passers-by and residents saved the girl. The ministers son and his friend had a scuffle with the public. As the skirmish was intensifying, a patrol party from the Lalpur police station reached the spot and took Dilip in its custody. 																								The news of Dilips arrest spread like wildfire. Several BJP leaders started making a beeline to the police station. Nirbhay Singh was the first BJP stalwart to arrive at the station.																								Dilip, however, said: I have nothing to do with the incident. The charges levelled against me are baseless. I was sitting inside the Gypsy, when a couple on a motorcycle tried to overtake us. Their vehicle hit our Gypsy. The couple began abusing us.																								The Lalpur police did not lodge an FIR, saying none of the complainants had turned up to report the matter. An official said: We are still waiting for the victims to come to the station and lodge a complaint. If they register a case, necessary action will be taken. But, if they dont come, we would not be able to do anything.																								Nirbhay Singh said he did not know anything about the incident. I had no idea about the incident. I came to the police station to meet the officer in-charge in connection with some personal work. Singh refused to say anything more on the incident.																								DGP R.R. Prasad said Dilip is being questioned on charges of eve-teasing. Dilip, the ministers younger son, is known for his rowdy behaviour.																								On August 27, Yamuna Singhs elder son Sashi Shekhar had reportedly killed his aunt, Harauna Devi, 45, by hitting her with a chair in his native village of Baradih in Latehar district. Sashi Shekhar was in an inebriated condition when the incident took place. He has gone missing since the incident.																								A few months ago, Sashi Shekhar had picked up a fight and forced his parents out of the house, sources said, adding that the minister remained incommunicado after the incident. 																								They said Sashi Shekhars unruly behaviour had embarrassed the minister, whose image has taken a beating since the incidents. 																								Picture on Page 8

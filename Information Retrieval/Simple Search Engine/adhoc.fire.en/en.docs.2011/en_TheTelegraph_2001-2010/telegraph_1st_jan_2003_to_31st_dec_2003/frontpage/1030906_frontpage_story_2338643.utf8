 Saturday, September 06, 2003 				 Amarmani and 39 desert Mayavati
 YOGESH VAJPEYI																								Lucknow, Sept. 5: Within hours of the BJP ordering its legislators to oppose Mulayam Singh Yadav at Mondays trust vote, the Bahujan Samajwadi Party split with over 40 MLAs breaking away and regrouping as the Loktantrik BSP.																								We had no hand in it, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh beamed as hordes of BSP legislators drove into his partys Vikramaditya Marg office.																								This is the second wave of defections from Mayavatis BSP and comes a day after the party sought the disqualification of an earlier group of 15 under the anti-defection law. The deserters included former minister Amarmani Tripathi, whose alleged involvement in Madhumita Shuklas murder had given the Samajwadi a handle to expose the Mayavati regimes misdeeds.																								We have crossed the one-third mark (of 37) for a valid split and more are coming, Haji Yakoob, the leader of the breakaway group, said. The group plans to call on Speaker Kesari Nath Tripathi tomorrow to seek formal recognition.																								Amar Singh said the BSP was splintering due to its inner contradictions. But BSP legislator Rashid Alvi held both the BJP and the Samajwadi responsible. He criticised Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri for giving Mulayam Singh 14 days to prove his majority, alleging this had encouraged horse-trading.																								Sources said tonights drama was planned. The SPs original plan was to present the breakaway group on the floor of the House at the eleventh hour, but the BSPs petition for disqualification forced its hand, an insider said.																								The second split has reduced Mulayam Singhs dependence on the Congress and fringe allies. The BJPs whip to its legislators to vote against him has posed no problem either. This will disprove the charge of a BJP-SP collusion Mayavati has levelled against us, Amar Singh said. Earlier, the BSP filed a caveat  before the Speaker to block the breakaway group from getting  recognition. Legislature party leader Swami Prasad Maurya  said: There has been no split in either the state or the  national unit of the BSP, and hence the move of some party  MLAs who have been lured by the ruling Samajwadi Party to  form a separate political outfit is against the law.

 Friday, July 11, 2003 				 Policy change after scam
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 10: Shaken by the scandal of a revenue officer trying to buy a posting in Mumbai, the government has drawn up a new transfer policy. 																								Under the policy  for Group A officers of the Indian Revenue Service which mans tax collection arms of the government  all transfers will be ordered by or take place on the recommendations of a specially-constituted placement committee. 																								The panel will send transfer proposals to the finance ministry for posts of commissioners and chief commissioners. For all officers below the rank of commissioner, it has been authorised to place officers at the disposal of chief commissioners (Central Board of Direct Taxes) and commissioners or directors-general (Central Board of Excise and Customs) for further posting. 																								Announcement of the new transfer policy comes a day after the accused in the cash-for-transfer scam were released on bail. The trio  Anurag Vardhan, the tax officer who tried to bribe his way to a transfer to Mumbai, R. Perumalswamy, who was personal assistant to former minister of state for finance Gingee Ramachandran, and the go-between, A. Krishnamurthy  was freed as the CBI failed to make a case for their continued detention. 																								The CBI told the court that it had been unable to complete the probe within 60 days of the arrests, which is a signal how serious various government arms are about bringing their corrupt colleagues to book. 																								For whatever they are worth, though, the revised procedures class various cities as A, B and C. An officer cannot be posted for over six years in a Class A station, four years in a Class B station and two years in a Class C station. All posts will be categorised as sensitive and non-sensitive with the stipulation that the normal tenure of an officer in a sensitive post should not exceed three years. 																								The policy also provides for mandatory rotation between classes of stations and between sensitive and non-sensitive posts. It says all transfer orders will be issued by April 30 every year. It takes into account compassionate and humane considerations like requests for postings on medical grounds or for working couples. 																								Vardhan was seeking transfer citing the better medical facilities available in Mumbai for his autistic child after having come from there to Delhi offering the same reason.

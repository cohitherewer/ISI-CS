 New Delhi, Nov. 29: Indias  largest trading partner, the European Union, today said  tensions with Pakistan are an obstacle to Delhi playing  a bigger role in world politics, reports our special correspondent.																								Welcoming the ceasefire and other steps the neighbours have proposed to normalise relations, the EU has urged India and Pakistan to sort out their problems. The EU stand indicates that there is widespread expectation that the current peace process would soon lead to resumption of dialogue.																								India is a giant, not only in terms of its growing economy but also in terms of the role it could play in world politics, EU president Romano Prodi said. But he added: Indias lingering tension with Pakistan is one of the biggest obstacles to the role Delhi could play in strengthening regional cooperation and peace in the Asian continent. ( )

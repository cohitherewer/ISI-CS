 Monday, July 21, 2003 				 Bangalore expert foreign to Citu
 BARUN GHOSH																								Calcutta, July 20: Citu, the ruling CPMs labour arm, is on a collision course with the government over the appointment of a Bangalore-based expert to help the ailing Calcutta State Transport Corporation make profit.																								Citu today said it would force the corporation to cancel the appointment of B. Shamba Shetty, a retired general manager of the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation. 																								Shetty was hired on the governments advice in April to improve service and help tide over a financial crisis. He was to oversee work at the corporations central workshop in Belgachhia and its 11 depots across the city. 																								Narayan Saha, general secretary of the Citu-affiliated CSTC Employees Union, today said all engineers would be asked to stop reporting to Shetty. He said since the expert arrived, many of the corporations engineers have been without work. 																								We are absolutely against the appointment of a retired chief engineer from Bangalore. This is a sheer wastage of money when the corporation can very well find someone from the outfit itself to do the job. 																								The Citus next course of action will be decided after leading a deputation to Bhattacharjee on July 30. If we dont have our way, we will go on a month-long agitation which would include gheraoing CSTC managing director G.P. Konars office and preventing Shetty from entering CSTC depots and the Belgachhia central workshop, Saha said. 																								Konar defended the appointment, saying it was made on the recommendation of Central Institute of Road Transport and RITES, a technical consultancy. 																								Shettys first assignment was to oversee improvement of productivity at Belgachhia and some of his suggestions had already helped the corporation reduce expenditure on spare parts, he said.																								The man at the centre of the controversy appeared unconcerned. In Bangalore, we have an Aituc-affiliated union in the transport sector and they are very co-operative. I dont know anything about Citus game plan here, Shetty said.

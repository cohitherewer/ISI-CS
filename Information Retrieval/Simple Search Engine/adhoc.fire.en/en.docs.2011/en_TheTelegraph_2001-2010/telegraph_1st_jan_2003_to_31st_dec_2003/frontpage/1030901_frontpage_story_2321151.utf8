 Monday, September 01, 2003 				 Mumbai blast detentions
																								Mumbai, Aug. 31: In a stealthy operation, Mumbai police have found what could be the biggest lead in the conspiracy behind the twin blasts of August 25.																								The police have detained two men and a woman from the suburbs of Goregaon for questioning. 																								The detentions raise the possibility that the trio may have the key to the plot which caused the death of 52 people in two car-bomb explosions occurring almost simultaneously in Zaveri Bazaar and the Gateway of India.  They could be the family that  planted the bomb in the boot of the taxi which blew up at  the Gateway.

 Friday, August 15, 2003 				 Shakespeare or Vajpayee?
																								If you can look into the seeds of time/And say which grain will grow and which will not,/Speak then to me.																								Banquo to the witches in Macbeth																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee could not be reached for comment, but he might not be too unhappy to learn he has failed to displace William Shakespeare from the textbook of an Indian university.																								Choudhury Charan Singh University of Meerut was planning to pull Macbeth and Twelfth Night off the English syllabus for undergraduate students and replace them with Vajpayees books of poems, No War Again and We Shall Never Bend.																								But for an Independence Day-eve meeting of the universitys council of wise men who rejected this suggestion, the change in the English syllabus would have gone through. The universitys working committee had made the modification on August 2.																								If Shakespeare can be replaced by Vajpayee, why not George Bernard Shaw by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam? That was also the universitys intention. Arms and the Man had been thrown into the dustbin of history in favour of the Presidents Patriotism Beyond Politics and Religion. Neither will now presumably happen  if vice-chancellor R.P. Singh is to be believed. Such recommendations  which defy logic will not be allowed to become a reality,  he said.

 Wednesday, October 29, 2003  Mamata's time of rally reckoning
 - Every July 21, Trinamul holds mammoth meetings. Families  of that days victims cant any more tell why
 SUNANDO SARKAR AND SANJAY MANDAL Trinamul Congress leader Mamata  Banerjee has decided not to attend Wednesdays all-party  meeting called by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  to reach a consensus on imposing rally discipline in Calcuttas  streets. Without Mamatas support  Trinamul being the main  Opposition  a code of conduct on rallies will not work.  When the court restricted rallies, the government opposed.  When the government wants to do the same, the Opposition  opposes. If the common people and the Opposition dont  hold rallies, who will? Mamata is asking.  Calcutta, Oct. 28: Remember  July 21, 1993, when 13 men died in police firing on a rally?																								The families that lost their men  often the only earning members  remember, only too clearly, the day they were bereaved 10 years ago. The anger  against a heartless police force  is not yet spent but, somewhere down the line, rallies have ceased to appear like a vehicle to voice that anger.																								Three of the four families  among the total of 13  living in the city proper were spoken to and all said they were yet to forgive the government that took away their men. But, simultaneously, the families that contributed standard-bearers for the Trinamuls annual rally view the organised shows of strength as soulless phenomena achieving nothing.																								Ask Kalyan Banerjees mother (Juthika) or elder brother (Bikash), who survive him since the July 21 of a decade ago. The family bridged the political gap between the Left and the Opposition  then represented by the Congress and its youth wing that Mamata used to lead. Bikash was a regular at every big CPM do whereas Kalyan would make it a point to respond to every one of Mamatas calls.																								Kalyan died. But it was not only the Opposition that lost a regular at its rallies. Bikash, too, stopped going to them. I cringe at the sound of the word rally, he said. 																								The very word brings back so many emotions I would rather not feel, he explained, expressing his fear of sarbanasha (destructive) political programmes.																								Arun Ray and his mother, Ashalata, are another set of people for whom rallies conjure up unpleasant associations. The family, staying at an address on Swinhoe Lane, lost Pradip to the rally that tried to move towards Writers Buildings and was fired upon by a police force then described variously as on the edge and trigger-happy.																								Even now, when I hear someone from my neighbourhood going to attend a rally, I start praying, the elderly Ashalata said. If it was within my powers, I would have stopped every single rally called by self-serving individuals now called leaders, she added.																								The family of Shrikanta Sharma is, perhaps, even worse off. After his death in the Youth Congress rally, the household  comprising four daughters and Shrikantas wife Renu  eked out a living on their neighbours sympathy.																								One of the daughters has married a neighbour, Purnendu Mridha, but things have not changed much. Purnendu is the only earning member  he teaches students at home  and the family is left ruing what happened at a rally 10 years ago. In Renus words, that rally took away everything and gave back only suffering and poverty.																								She added that she had heard about a controversy over the right to rally which started over a court order.																								But she does not know that Mamata is declining to enter into a compromise with the ruling party over imposing rally discipline  one Trinamul argument questions how the party can surrender the right to hold its July 21 rally.

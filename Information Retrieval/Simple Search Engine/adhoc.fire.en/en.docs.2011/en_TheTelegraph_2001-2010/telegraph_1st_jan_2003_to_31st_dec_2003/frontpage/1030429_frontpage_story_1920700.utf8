 Tuesday, April 29, 2003  Pressure to pull out patient
 - Virus victim turns medical reject 
 OUR BUREAU Asitabhas sister  Shibani Dattachaudhuri at the hospital on Monday. Picture  by Amit Datta  Calcutta, April 28: Two  days after he was diagnosed to be Bengals first SARS victim,  Asitabha Purakayastha found himself turned into a pariah.																								As his hospital  the Advanced Medicare and Research Institute (AMRI)  and the government played tug-of-war over the middle-aged man, Purakayastha himself spent most of the day wondering where he would spend the night.																								I am not feeling well, believe me, Purakayastha is reported to have told attending doctors. I do not want to stay a minute longer than necessary, but please do not ask me to leave now, he pleaded.																								As the government found itself saddled with another confirmed SARS case (Radheshyam Gupta), besides the suspect (Jamil Ahmed) found yesterday, pressure groups emerged out of nowhere and combined to ostracise the Purakayastha family fallen into hard times. The hospital union and the party claiming to represent most of the hospitals neighbourhood did not want him at AMRI. The hospital management, frustrated at the outflow of patients the moment he stepped in, was only too eager to agree. 																								The state government, too, ferreted out some World Health Organisation SARS guidelines that show he can leave. And an entire neighbourhood at suburban Madhyamgram pressed his landlords family to tell him at the hospital that he was unwelcome till he was fit.																								The family, finding itself hemmed in from every side, tried to remind everyone that Purakayastha had a severe cardiac condition as well.																								Ultimately, the apparently weak won. AMRI decided, keeping family concerns in mind, to keep Purakayastha for the night, at least.																								The day started with the Indian National Trade Union Congress and the Trinamul Congress demonstrating for Purakayasthas eviction.																								We want the patient to recover, councillor Dibyendu Biswas said. But the waste that is taken via the road in front of the hospital is used by thousands of poor people staying in the neighbouring slums. What happens if they get the disease from the medical waste? he asked. 																								A little after noon, he went in to speak to the hospital management. He left after extracting a promise that Purakayastha would be released before sunset.																								Before the sun set, the union took over. We are fighting against the decision to keep a SARS patient here without adopting precautionary measures, union working president Ramen Pandey said.																								Amid the turmoil  and in the backdrop of the downward graph of the number of in-house patients (it came down to 80 against Sundays 86)  the hospital management kept up its parleys with the government to get Purakayastha out. 																								Just before sunset, chief executive officer Jose Verghese, accompanied by Purakayasthas doctors (S.K. Todi and Shubhasis Ghosh), told the media that the patient did not have any fever or respiratory discomfort.																								By the evening, the government was by the hospitals side. The WHO discharge and follow-up protocol makes it clear that if a SARS victim has not been running a temperature for 48 hours, has no dissolving cough and a series of six clinical tests and X-ray of the chest shows improving changes, he is safe, the director of health services, Prabhakar Chatterjee, said. 																								Purakayastha, going by all these parameters, is out of danger, he added. 																								They forget he is a cardiac patient, a family friend, Nanigopal Saha, said. Unless the hospital says his cardiac state is okay, we are not taking him back. 																								Shibani Dattachaudhuri, Purakayasthas sister, claimed: They are constantly pressing us to take him back. Hospital authorities denied the allegation.  They are saying that they have  an ambulance ready to take him to his Madhyamgram residence,  she added.

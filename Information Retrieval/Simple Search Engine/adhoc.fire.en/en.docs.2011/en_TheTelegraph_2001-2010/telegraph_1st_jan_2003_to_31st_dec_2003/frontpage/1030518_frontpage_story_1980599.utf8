 Sunday, May 18, 2003 				 Aishwarya wave swamps Cannes beach
 															- Snappers lap up beauty in black as she accompanies Chadha on film promotional AMIT ROY				 	 Gurinder Chadha and Aishwarya Rai at Cannes. (AFP) Cannes, May 17: Not since  Brigitte Bardot did her sex kitten act on the beach at Cannes  some four decades ago has an actress caused as much of a  stir as Aishwarya Rai did today.																								Aishwarya, Aishwarya, the massed ranks of the worlds snappers called out repeatedly as she got perilously close to the waters edge with film director Gurinder Chadha.																								Ostensibly, the reason for her appearance at the DAlbion Beach restaurant was to promote Chadhas next movie, Bride and Prejudice, an adaptation of Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice. Aishwarya will play the female lead.																								By and by, the photographers, who are more used to dealing with tabloid blondes, got bolder.																								Show us a leg, they pleaded.																								Not a chance. Aishwarya wore a demure black dress, with chappals. Her foot still hurts from her accident, she told The Telegraph (Im still in pain).																								I wish she wouldnt wear black, complained a well-known showbiz hack from a Fleet Street newspaper.																								She smiled. The snappers melted to a man.																								If Aishwarya was not going to reveal a leg or anything else for a Bond movie, it was unlikely she was going to do it for an army of frenzied photographers. Proudly watching Aishwarya was her mother, who has accompanied her daughter to Cannes.																								The rumours about her being approached about being Bond girl are not entirely untrue, it seems, although at this stage she was not willing to say anything more.																								Asked how she was going to combine Hollywood and Bollywood, she responded partly in Hindi: Jo bhi hai  you hear about it (the rumours) but please dont jump the gun. Wait until announcements are made.																								 This hints that announcements might ultimately be made. Aishwarya has dealt with all  sorts of press to say anything other than the anodyne but  she always says it with great charm and usually accompanied  by gales of laughter. The French waiter, of Spanish and  Greek extraction, who served her lunch and has presumably  seen a beautiful woman or two, admitted he thought she was  quite something.																								 quot;Its the eyes, quot; he said wistfully. The trip to Cannes, she said  politely, quot;is a great pleasure and it is a memory I  am going to cherish for a long time. quot; Asked if she had seen any films,  she burst out into laughter. quot;Yes, I am a member of  the jury; evidently I am doing my duty with all sincerity  -- what better than to watch movies. quot; There was a mock up poster of  Bride and Prejudice which Chadha had knocked up for the  distributors. In America, the film has already been taken  by Harvey Weinsteins Miramax group which will ensure  wide and efficient north American distribuition. Aishwaryas male co-star,  the New Zealand born Hollywood actor, Martin Henderson could  not make it to Cannes but the Indian actress was welcomed  by Chadha as quot;my leading lady quot;. While Chadha will direct, her  producer, as was the case with Bend It Like Beckham, will  once again be the Los Angeles based Indian, Deepak Nayar  (a nephew of the Indian journalist Kuldip Nayar). He said the film will be shot  in Britain in July, followed by sequences in Los Angeles  and Bombay. Chadha is having second thoughts  about calling her adaptation Bride and Prejudice, which  she feels might give the impression her movie is a parody  of the Jane Austen novel. She sees the film as Bollywood  taking the Indian genre into the west. She said she had  been inspired by such musicals as Grease, Seven Brides for  Seven Brothers, My Fair Lady and Fiddler on the Roof. While Jane Austens novel  was partly based on tensions in class, her English language  movie would seek to explore east-west conflict.  She told Aishwarya: quot;You  are the right person to take Bollywood across to the hearts  and mind of millions of people across Europe and America  and Asia. quot; Aishwarya has got a first as  an Indian actress. A Oreal poster -- Aishwarya promotes  the cosmetic firm -- adorns the Croisette, the main beach  avenue, in Cannes. quot;I havent seen it  yet but I have been told about it, quot; she said. Then,  childlike, she asked: quot;Did you recognise me? quot; At this rate, Aishwarya is becoming  the best known face at Cannes this year. And, to be fair,  she is not doing a bad job representing India. For better  or worse, people know Bollywood is big.

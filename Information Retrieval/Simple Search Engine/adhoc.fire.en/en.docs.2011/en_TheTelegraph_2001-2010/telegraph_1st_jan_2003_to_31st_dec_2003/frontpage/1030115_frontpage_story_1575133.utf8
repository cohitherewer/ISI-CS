 Wednesday, January 15, 2003 				 Muted mutiny with wife on guard
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 14: Wife Nadira was at hand to rein him in, still Vidiadhar S. Naipaul bristled  but more at cellphone-ring interruptions than at the BJP-led governments lack of graciousness in its handling of Tehelka.																								The Nobel laureate expressed his disappointment with the way the government had treated the news portal after it exposed corruption in defence deals involving politicians. But he hoped that the government would step aside from the sorry state of affairs.																								Naipaul appeared to be trying to use his credential as a BJP sympathiser to urge the government to withdraw what many consider to be the harassment of Tehelka. 																								Admitting that he retained some goodwill towards the government, the author, accompanied by Nadira and Tehelka CEO and chief editor Tarun Tejpal, told reporters that the Tehelka episode had become a bad story because of the lack of graciousness and perhaps even gracelessness on the governments part. 																								Naipaul is a member of the Tehelka board, a post he said he accepted because of his faith in the integrity of Tejpal and his team. I am profoundly disappointed over what happened to Tehelka which can damage the country, he said  very restrained for someone known to give a sharp tongue freer play.																								He snapped only once. Im not a tap. I think before I speak  the words flashed out like a whiplash as cellphones sprang to raucous life all around, or people in the media exchanged loud whispers. 																								Naipaul said it was a mistake on the part of the government to have done what it did to Tehelka and expressed dismay that the controversy which should have been resolved by now had unfortunately not ended.																								Nadira sought to assist her husband by trying to paraphrase him without quite revelling in the task. She was protective and often tried to answer the tricky political questions, wary that her husband might say something controversial.																								In the process, she described deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani as a suave politician and a good journalist. Nadira said she and her husband were satisfied with their meeting with Advani who had promised to look into the Tehelka episode. 																								Tejpal said Tehelka, now almost defunct, would return, maybe in the form of a magazine or a paper.

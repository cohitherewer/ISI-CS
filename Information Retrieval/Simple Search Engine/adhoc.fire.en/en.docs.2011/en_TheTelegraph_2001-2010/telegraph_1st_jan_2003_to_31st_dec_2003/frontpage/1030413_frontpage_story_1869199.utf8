 Sunday, April 13, 2003 				 Privacy battle bares public property
 															- British daily digs up pictures of keen-on-exposure Zeta-Jones AMIT ROY				 	 Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas: Courting publicity?																								London, April 12: A newspaper in Britain has published raunchy pictures of Oscar-winning actress Catherine Zeta-Jones to drive home the point that once upon a time, she would do almost anything to get publicity but that she reinvented herself after marrying Hollywood star Michael Douglas.																								Meanwhile, in the high court case brought by the Douglases against Hello! for publishing sneak wedding photographs promised to the rival OK!, both sides are claiming victory.																								Todays Daily Mail has published pictures of Catherine, in the days when she was happy to be public property. Just so that no one misses the significance of the pictures, taken in 1995 for a mens magazine called Loaded, the Mail explains: This is the photo-shoot that shows Catherine Zeta-Jones wasnt always quite so protective of her image. Posing in fishnet tights, boots, PVC hotpants and a black basque, she seems extremely keen on exposure.																								The paper adds that for one of the Loaded shots, she straddled a television set with a bottle of champagne in one hand and a remote control in the other.																								The Mail has published the picture and even hunted down the photographer, Derek Ridgers, who took it. She was up for whatever ideas we had, he recalled. She would try anything. At one point, we had her crushed up on a ledge between the bath and the wall, with me standing up in the bath with my tripod because it was so cramped. She didnt complain.																								But Zeta-Jones and her husband certainly did complain when their wedding pictures, taken by a paparazzi, appeared in Hello! and not exclusively in rival OK!, which had agreed to buy them for 1 million. The Douglases demanded 500,000 in damages from Hello!, while OK! sought 1.75 million from its rival.																								According to the Daily Mail, the Douglases have lost their case. Its headline 																								on page one, which has nothing on the war, screams: quot;Hollow victory over her 																								wedding photos: Catherine Privacy claim is kicked out. quot;																								 The Daily Mirror agreed that the Douglas had won quot;a hollow legal victory quot; and 																								the London Evening Standard trumpeted, quot;Zeta-Jones loses her claim for privacy quot;.																								 The judgment isnt as simple, though. The judge, Mr Justice Lindsay, has 																								thrown out nine of the 12 claims by the Douglases, including invasion of 																								privacy, but he did rule that Hello! had broken the quot;commercial 																								confidentiality quot; of the Pound1million deal between the Hollywood couple and OK!																								 The damages and costs are to be determined later.																								 The Mail itself admitted that quot;the ambiguity of the judgment left both sides 																								claiming victory quot;.																								 The implications of the ruling will be studied carefully by media lawyers and 																								many newspapers and magazines whose existence depends on the coverage of 																								celebrities. The latter do want coverage but only on their terms while there is 																								a big market for invasive journalism.																								 Some in the media fear that the British government will introduce some kind of 																								a privacy law. Todays editorial in The Guardian comments: quot;It is hard to feel 																								any great sympathy for a fabulously rich Hollywood couple who never sought to 																								disguise the fact that they had sought to control -- for money -- the images of 																								their fashionable New York wedding in December, 2000, and were miffed that a 																								rival magazine managed a spoiler. It would have stuck in the gullet if the 																								judge, Mr Justice Lindsay, had used this case, of all cases, to create a 																								privacy law in this country. quot;																								 But there were nuggets buried in the judgment, it added, quot;which should stop 																								the press shrugging it off as a tiresome fuss about nothing quot;.																								 The Douglases may privately calculate there is no such thing as bad publicity. 																								She is due to give birth to her second child any day now and may well be 																								looking for an exclusive deal for the baby pictures.

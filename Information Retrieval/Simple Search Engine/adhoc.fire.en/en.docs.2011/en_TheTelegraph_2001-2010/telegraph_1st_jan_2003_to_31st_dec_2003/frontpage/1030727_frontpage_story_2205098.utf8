 - East Bengal sheds caution, stuns heavyweights in surprise  win  Free-Kick / P. K. Banerjee East Bengals Bhaichung  Bhutia during the Asean Club Championship final on Saturday.  (AFP)  History will say East Bengal of  India beat Thailands BEC Tero Sasana 3-1 in Saturdays  Asean Club Championship final. It will also record that  the victory made East Bengal richer by $50,000. What it  will not say is this triumph made Indian football richer  by much more  it handed the sport the lifeline it was desperately  seeking. It was a victory of grit, fierce  self-belief and strategy. East Bengal had started preparing  for this at least a month ago, knowing that they stood a  decent chance in this tournament featuring clubs from Southeast  Asia. What the special invitee didnt, perhaps, believe  is it would outclass a club that is quite a heavyweight  in Asian football these days. Most stunning was the ease with  which East Bengal dismissed the Thai champions who have  reached the Asian Champions League final, beating crack  teams from South Korea, Japan and China. Having overcome  these Asian giants, Tero Sasana couldnt possibly believe  it would be slapped on the face by a team it had beaten  earlier in the tournament. Arrogance marked East Bengals  performance. Shrugging off the cautious approach in previous  games, East Bengal came out with a devil-may-care attitude.  Many expected the Indians to be defensive after the first  goal by Mike Okoro, but Bhaichung Bhutias urge to make  a mark at the Asian level put East Bengal 2-0 up shortly  after half time. The determination of this team  and its hunger to touch the trophy became evident when Alvito  DCunha rifled in the third after Tero Sasana had made it  2-1. This indomitable spirit and scant respect for reputation  was the hallmark of East Bengals triumph.  If one individual deserves credit,  it is East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick. He was combative  in his playing days and has succeeded in instilling this  attitude in his boys. They have dared to dream and stare  the rival in the eye. And you need that in good amount to  win on foreign soil. Its somewhat coincidental that  Indias last gold in Asian Games football came at the same  stadium in Jakarta. Yours truly was part of that team, and  it was nostalgic to see the players waving the Tricolour  after the match. But instead of getting nostalgic,  we should be pragmatic and make capital of this victory.  It proves that India can still be a force in Asia if we  work hard and work methodically, with complete focus. It  also proves we can dream. Thank you, East Bengal, thank  you Subhas Bhowmick.

 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, April 25: Finance minister Jaswant Singh today bowed to pressure and as good as announced postponement of the implementation of VAT.																								The finance minister, nudged by party leaders worried about the impact VAT would have on the BJPs poll prospects, told the Lok Sabha that he would prefer the measure to be introduced by all states simultaneously and not in a patchwork fashion.																								VAT is an important initiative which must not and cannot be defeated through faulty implementation, he said in a speech made just before debate on the budget began in Parliament.

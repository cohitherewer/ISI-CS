 Monday, September 15, 2003 				 BJP strikes back over Modi attack
																								New Delhi, Sept. 14 (PTI): BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu today launched a counter-attack on the Congress and the Left, saying they had no moral right to demand Narendra Modis resignation.																								The Opposition had called for the Gujarat chief ministers resignation after the Supreme Court told his government to quit if it could not protect the weak in the context of the Best Bakery trial.																								These people who have shown a contempt for the courts have no right to run a vilification campaign against Modi taking the Supreme Court comments, Naidu said. 																								He said the court had not given a judgment, but as and when it does the Gujarat government would implement it as the BJP has the highest regard for the judiciary. 																								The Opposition, he added, had not bothered to respect court judgments in cases like the one relating to Shah Bano in the eighties and its more recent observations on a uniform civil code.

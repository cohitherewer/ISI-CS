 Monday, June 30, 2003 				 Stalins comrades go red and repent
 															- Critical appraisal of dictator in party mouthpiece puts CPM in a flap  SUNANDO SARKAR AND TAMAL SENGUPTA Calcutta, June 29: Well  and truly dead for 50 years and abandoned by the communist  world (or whats left of it), Comrade Josef Stalin has managed  to find a place  several thousand kilometres from his native  Russia  where he is still living enough to kick up a storm.																								Nandan, the CPMs monthly magazine in a part of the world where some still swear by Stalin, has done the unimaginable by publishing an essay that takes a closer  and not unalloyedly hagiographic  look at the Stalin era. 																								This has raised dust within the CPM, with very few caring to read between the lines and see how the essay has tried to explain Stalins rough methods and unrefinedness by portraying his working-class background and difficult childhood.																								From plans to publish several letters criticising the article to printing an apology in the July issue, the party is now in the midst of an orchestrated campaign to undo the sin its magazine has committed on the occasion of Stalins 50th death anniversary.																								Admitting to the controversy fuelled by the article, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas  himself known by a sobriquet (the education czar) that derives much of its flavour from a tongue that was native to Stalin  said the party would decide on appropriate corrective steps needed to set things right. I have read this months issue and we are going to decide on what needs to be done very shortly, he added.																								The article  Josef Stalin Stalin Jug (Josef Stalin and the Stalin Era)  however, tries to maintain a fine balance between reporting the excesses and explaining their historical background. Making a case out for the man who ruled the USSR with an iron hand by mentioning his working-class origins and rough childhood and the bureaucracy that worked overtime to take advantage of the situation, the essay mentions several excesses like the sham Moscow Trials that led to the elimination of Stalins rivals within the organisation and the murder of Trotsky.																								Details like Trotskys assassin (Ramon Mercader) being awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title pepper the article, though the author makes it clear that, in the circumstances, someone else would have done what Stalin did if the man himself was not there. But Stalins poor grounding in theory and his mediocre writing skills  and the elimination of the Left Opposition and his followers efforts to paint him in brighter-than-truthful colours  get a closer look than what they have got in the CPM canon.																								All these have succeeded in ruffling feathers. Nandan, like Ganashakti, is directly answerable to the partys state committee in the organisational hierarchy and  if the events of the past week are anything to go by  the editorial board, the two branches managing Nandan and the author himself (Anindya Bandyopadhyay) have a lot of answering to do.																								Both branches running the magazine have been told to be ready to face the state committee, a Nandan branch committee member told The Telegraph. We have been asked to explain how the article went to press, he added. The state committee, say insiders, is meeting members of several allied branches on Monday.																								Ditto for Bandyopadhyay, who penned the essay. He has been asked to give a written explanation and, most probably, it will be printed in the July issue.

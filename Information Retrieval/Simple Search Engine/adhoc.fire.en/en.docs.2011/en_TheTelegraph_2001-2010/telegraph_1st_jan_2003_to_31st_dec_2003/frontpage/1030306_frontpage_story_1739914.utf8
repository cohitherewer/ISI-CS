 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Cape Town, March 5: The Board of Control for Cricket in India president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, has initiated a move to explore the possibility of rescheduling the World Cups March 20 day-night semifinal at Kingsmead into a day affair.																								While Sourav Ganguly is already on record saying such a crucial match ought not to have been a day-night one  conditions can adversely affect the team batting second  South Africas experience on Monday appears to have opened more eyes.																								India beat England in a day-night league game in Durban, but the boot could have been on the other foot if it had to chase.																								Kingsmead will host the semifinal featuring the second and third-placed teams at the end of the Super Six. Given Indias form (and the eight carried-over points), its likely that India will finish No. 2. 																								In that event, Sourav and Co. will have to head for Durban and not Port Elizabeth, which is to stage the first semifinal  a day affair, on March 18. 																								I havent made a formal representation to the Event Technical Committee, but have spoken to four of the five remaining countries in the Super Six. Their response has been pretty positive, Dalmiya said from Calcutta. 																								He exchanged notes with Australia, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and Kenya. Dalmiya said a representation will be made if all six countries agree to call for a change and, more important, its possible for the ETC to do that. I dont wish to make an issue.

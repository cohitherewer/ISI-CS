 ARUN KUMAR THAKUR																								Ranchi, Nov. 14: The countrys first international centre of mobile and wireless communication will kick off on April 24 next year at the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra.																								The centre, sponsored by the European Commission, will be set up 18 km outside Ranchi under the new global initiative known as the Euro-Asia Link Programme.																								One of two such centres in Asia, it will train people for advanced research in mobile and wireless communication in close interaction with industry. This also has the potential of making the state capital a major centre besides encouraging small-scale industries in this field of wireless communication, Ramjee Prasad from Denmarks Aalborg University said.																								In four to five years, at least three to four small-scale industries in wireless communication will come up as this programme will initiate good growth in the host society, he added.																								That would be possible because post-graduate researchers in this field would be able to patent their research products, aimed at improving wireless communication. Their collective effort would also push India to the forefront of this technology sector.																								Wireless communication has a great role in development activities. Moreover, researchers at the BIT centre of excellence would be able to conduct their research projects at the (centres of the) four other collaborators in this unique initiative, institute vice-chancellor S.K. Mukherjee said.																								To begin with, 15 engineers will be selected for the advanced Master of Engineering course and two or three for doctoral research, he added.																								The other Asian centre will be opened at Institut Teknology in Indonesias Bangdung, Prasad said. The other three institutions that are partners in the venture are Aalborg University, Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and Universita di Roma Tor Vergata in Italy.																								At a daylong international workshop on wireless communication, hosted by BIT, companies such as Tata Consultancy Service, Tata Telecom, Alcatel of France and IBM showed keen interest in the project, Mukherjee said. Once the centre is launched, others like Nokia are expected to come, he added.																								Susan Vonsild of Denmark and Ignas Niemegeers of the Netherlands said the emphasis would be on structural relationship between the industries engaged in wireless communication and the five countries and the chosen institutions.																								Suhatono Tjondronegiro and Andriyan Bayi Suksmono of Institut Teknology attended the workshop where the details of the Euro-Asia programme were formalised.

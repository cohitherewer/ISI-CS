Story  Mayavati builds mud mountain 
- 135 cases slapped on Mulayam YOGESH VAJPEYI  THE HIT LIST
- 179 Ccases filed against Mulayam Singh and supporters; 135 against Mulayam Singh alone- FIRs filed in 40 districts- Cases include distribution of concocted CDs, misuse of funds and abusing political opponents- Inquiry against Congress leader and former Governor Motilal Vora on charges of funds misuse Lucknow, April 14: For every annoying CD, there are nearly 70 counter-assaults.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati today hit back with vengeance against Mulayam Singh Yadav, saying that till date 135 criminal cases have been registered against the Samajwadi Party chief.Another 44 have been filed against his supporters, taking the total number against the party to 179 in 40 districts.There are nearly 35,000 such cases and all will be probed, she told a huge gathering of Bahujan Samaj Party supporters at the pardafash (exposure) rally as the war over the two videotapes climaxed under a scorching sun.The latest case against Mulayam, his general secretary Amar Singh and leader of the Opposition Mohammed Azam Khan was registered in Lucknows Hazratganj police station on a BSP complaint hours before the rally.It accused them of concocting and distributing tampered CDs of Mayavatis address to party workers to tarnish the image of BSP leaders. Yeh pahla pardafash hain (This is the first revelation). You will continue to get more such news, Mayavati said to cheers from the crowd at the sprawling Ambedkar maidan.Mulayam, apparently unfazed, dared the administration to arrest him. He dismissed as baseless the 29 cases of alleged misuse of the chief ministers discretionary fund while he was in power.It is political vendetta. The cases registered against me are baseless. The comptroller and auditor general, the high court and the state Assembly have already given a clean chit to my decisions, he told reporters in Goraya, 50 km from Jalandhar.Mulayam said Mayavati was present when the allegations on misuse of funds were cleared in the Assembly and added that the cases against him were just to take revenge for the CDs.Mayavati had called the rally following the release of the CDs by the Samajwadi. The first, in which she allegedly exhorts her MPs and MLAs to divert a portion of their constituency development fund for party work, was released in March. The second, which shows her allegedly asking BSP workers not to squander money on idol worship, was handed over to Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri last week. Yain Dalit ki beti chhote mote tape sein darne wali nahin. (This daughter of a Dalit cannot be scared by a couple of tapes.) They will vanish into thin air, she thundered to applause. I had challenged Mulayam Singh to prove the charges he had levelled against me through the CDs, but he has failed. He should tender an apology to the BSP supporters for trying to tarnish my image through the CDs, she added.In Goraya, Mulayam challenged Mayavati to get the tapes probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and said he would quit politics if they were found to have been doctored.While Mulayam was her main target, Mayavati did not spare the Congress. Congress leader Motilal Vora had distributed Rs 18 crore in the same manner during his eight-month tenure as the Governor. My government is probing those cases and he will not be spared. If her fiery tirade kept pace with the mercury, which touched 43 degrees Celsius, the evening ended in tragedy. Two persons died when the podium collapsed as a thunderstorm broke.  Copyright

 Sunday, April 27, 2003 				 Gang of 10 pulls off midnight murder
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 26: Robbers killed a businessmans wife and looted nearly Rs 2 lakh in cash and jewellery last night in Rajarhat before escaping into the darkness, hurling bombs at a patrol van that tried to give chase.																								Additional superintendent of police Ajay Nand said around midnight, a group of 10 men attacked the house of Suresh Jaiswal in Hatiara with double-barrel guns and bombs. The dacoits forced open the main door and then had a free run for the next 30 minutes, firing and hurling bombs.																								Jaiswal, who owns a small factory nearby, his wife Bimala and two sons, Deepak and Hemant, were sitting in front of their two-storeyed house, a stones throw from the mega city project, when they saw the group approaching. Suddenly, we saw a group of around 10 men, armed with guns and faces covered, approaching our house, said Hemant.																								The panic-stricken family tried to close the main door but the dacoits forced a hole in it with a stick and fired through the hole. One bullet hit Bimala, 42, who slumped to the ground but not before warning the others to flee. She saved the lives of the other family members, said Vedmitra Jaiswal, a relative.																								Bimala was later rushed to a nursing home by local residents and police personnel, but died on the way.																								Deepak and Hemant hid inside the water tank on the roof while the dacoits were on the rampage inside the house. Deepaks two infant daughters were in bed while his wife Sweta fled.																								Jaiswal tried to resist the dacoits by throwing bricks and bamboo sticks from the roof. But the dacoits threw a bomb at him and he climbed down and escaped, Nand said. Jaiswal then called Md Basiruddin, a neighbour, who informed the police.																								Two constables on a mobile van appeared at the scene but could not stop the dacoits. Police officials said the dacoits hurled bombs at the constables, who fired six rounds in retaliation. Later, more forces from Rajarhat and Baguihati police stations launched a search but were unable to trace the gang.																								Both police and residents said the dacoits fled towards the Rajarhat mega city project. We apprehend that they had parked a vehicle and fled in it. There is a huge vacant area, so the gang could escape easily, a police official said.

 Sunday, June 15, 2003 				 Tantrik sent to judicial custody
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Guwahati, June 14: The chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup, today remanded Amritlal Mazumdar, the tantrik who had made an abortive bid to sacrifice his 18-month-old daughter at the Kamakhya temple, in judicial custody. He has been booked by Jhalukbari police under Section 307 of the IPC for attempt to commit murder. 																								An unfazed Mazumdar  who had described himself as a seeker of truth  told his interrogators today that Ma Kali was to be blamed for the bizarre ritual. He had slit the throat of his baby daughter yesterday, attempting to propitiate the goddess for divine powers. The babys wails alerted devotees in the temple, who overpowered the father and rushed the infant to the temples dispensary. 																								The girl, Taramai, was later admitted to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. She was shifted to Shishu Bhavan, an orphanage run by the Missionaries of Charity.																								Additional city superintendent of police Bibekananda Das said Mazumdar denied trying to murder his daughter. Some forces are wanting to kill the girl. I have only done what Ma Kali wanted, the police official quoted Mazumdar as having told his interrogators. However, the accused had yesterday told the police and newsmen that he was indeed trying to sacrifice his daughter to acquire divine powers.																								Jhalukbari police, where the case has been registered, said Mazumdar was incoherent. He seemed under the effect of intoxicants like bhang yesterday and said many things. But today he gave a different version, a police official said. Mazumdar has not applied for bail. 																								Sources said the remand period could go up to three months given the serious nature of the offence. Legal experts said Mazumdar could be sent to a mental hospital if he is proved insane. So far, he has not been examined by a psychiatrist, though doctors of the GMCH have attended to him. Mazumdar, who hails from erstwhile East Pakistan, was a resident of Nagaon town.

 Sunday, October 19, 2003 				 2000 saline bottles past expiry
 Calcutta, Oct. 18: SSKM  authorities have found that a consignment of 2,000 bottles  of saline meant for use in the hospital have gone past their  expiry date, says a staff reporter. Worse, a few bottles  from another batch that were well within their shelf life  had fungus growing inside them. Had this fungus-laced saline  been administered to patients, it could have led to death.																								A staff nurse noticed the lapse on Thursday, but it was kept under wraps till today. Surgeon superintendent Debdwaipayan Chattopadhyay said: All the bottles have been isolated and I will recommend to the health department that the supplier be blacklisted.																								Anup Majumdar, head of SSKMs radiotherapy department, said a bottle with fungus was among the 12 kept aside for free-bed patients. The expiry dates pasted on them was December 2005.

 Sunday, January 26, 2003 				 George amp; Ram on Atal Ayodhya mission
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, Jan. 25: The government is preparing to resolve the Ayodhya issue in favour of the Sangh parivar by clearing the hurdles in the way of constructing a temple at the site.																								Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee has asked NDA convener George Fernandes to find out how the allies will react if the government can get the Supreme Court to vacate the stay on transfer of 67 acres of acquired land to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas. 																								The government might rope in former law minister Ram Jethmalani to file a petition seeking vacation of the stay order, sources said.																								Sources said the defence minister is in favour of moving court and the feeling in the government is that the allies will not object. The allies have often said the matter could be solved either through a court verdict or political consensus. While most are expected to fall in line, the reactions of key allies, the Telugu Desam Party and the DMK, are seen as most crucial. 																								Fernandes tried to line up some alliance leaders over dinner tonight to discuss the issue, but the move did not fructify. Sources close to Desam parliamentary party leader K. Yerran Naidu said he received a call from Fernandes for the dinner meeting but declined to attend, saying he had to visit his constituency.																								Though the government might secure the silent approval of the allies, Muslim bodies are unlikely to support the move because if the apex court agrees to vacate the stay, construction of a mosque in the disputed area  in the event of the court finally allowing its construction  would become meaningless.																								Once the nyas takes possession of the undisputed land in Ayodhya, it would construct temple buildings, gates and pillars, sandwiching the mosque (if constructed) from all sides, an NDA leader said, adding that the apex court knows this, which is why it directed the government last year to ensure status quo on the acquired 67 acres.																								The VHPs dharam sansad is scheduled for February 22 and the outfit is firm that the government hand over the undisputed land for temple construction before February 21.																								The Prime Minister, sources said, had last week asked the VHP to move the Supreme Court for vacating the stay on the undisputed land. But the outfit rejected the suggestion, though RSS leaders were not averse to the idea.																								Reacting to the proposal, senior VHP leader Acharya Giriraj Kishore yesterday said: There is no question of our going to court to get the stay vacated. The ball is in the governments court. We will abide by the dharam sansad decision.																								VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia today issued a threat, saying if the issue was not resolved before the dharam sansad, there will be an earthquake.

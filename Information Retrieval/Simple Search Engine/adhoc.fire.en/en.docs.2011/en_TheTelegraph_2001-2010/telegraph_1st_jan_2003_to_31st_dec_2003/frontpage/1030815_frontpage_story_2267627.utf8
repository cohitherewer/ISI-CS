The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Friday, August 15, 2003 				 Golfer pays, cricketer does not 
 															- Amandeep was asked to fork out Rs 36 lakh as duty for Lexus LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Amandeep Johl Calcutta, Aug. 14: Besides  a huge appetite for runs, Sachin Tendulkar doesnt compromise  on sea food and the over-200-kmph cars. In this off season,  its the latter obsession which has pitchforked him into  the headlines.																								Of course, one has to wait till Tuesday for Delhi High Courts next move but, till then, the Union governments Rs 1.13 crore customs duty waiver on Sachins Ferrari  presented 13 months ago by Formula One king Michael Schumacher (on behalf of Fiat)  will continue to be debated.																								[Late this evening, though, Fiat India volunteered to pay the duty. A spokesman told PTI: We feel it is the right thing to do considering the recent developments. The gift was meant to felicitate and honour our brand ambassador for his achievement (of surpassing Sir Don Bradmans 29 Test centuries). We believe that this gesture on our part, of paying the import duty, is in keeping with the spirit in which the gift was given.]																								While few actually oppose the exemption, there definitely is unhappiness over the government not treating all sportsmen on a par. 																								A shade over four years ago, for instance, leading pro golfer Amandeep Johl was asked to pay Rs 36 lakh for importing a Toyota Lexus that was his for winning the Thailand Open.																								Johl, who spoke to The Telegraph from Chandigarh this afternoon, declined and is today happy driving a Skoda Octavia. He is currently Asias No. 11.																								I won the tournament in November 1998 and, within a few days of returning from Bangkok, approached the finance ministry for a waiver. 																								In my application, I cited the example of Vijay Amritraj (a Volvo) and Ravi Shastri (an Audi 100 CD), both of whom didnt have to pay for individual prizes, and pointed out that I didnt have the means to fork out such a steep duty.																								Well, it took the ministry five months to respond in the negative. According to the under-secretary in the department of revenue, an exemption wasnt possible because of a recent amendment to Section 25 (2) of the Customs Act, 1962. It was suggested that a fresh application may see a reduction in duty. However, after so many months, I was fed up and didnt make another request.																								Not being familiar with officialdom, Johl actually had to engage an agent to facilitate his visits to the ministry. That gentleman had a pass or whatever, which allowed me access to the officials. How much did I pay him? Somewhere between Rs 15-20,000.																								Commenting on the Sachin issue, Johl said: As a fellow-sportsman, Im happy that the government waived the duty --- even though the Ferrari is a gift. At the same time, different yardsticks ought not to be applied. Rather, across the board, every sportsman should get the same benefit. Today, if theres a controversy, the government must be blamed.																								Indeed, Johl had another sorry tale to relate.																								Last year, he was featured in leading sports equipment manufacturer Wilsons calendar and, as a gesture of goodwill, was sent a consignment of 50 for distribution among family/friends. Only, when Johl sought to clear that, a duty of Rs 4,000 was levied.																								He preferred to gift that entire lot to Mumbai customs!																								While Johl talked of Shastri in his application, fact is that the 1985 World Championship of Crickets Champion of Champions didnt even have to apply for an exemption.																								Contacted in Mumbai, he had this to say: Neither did I speak to anybody, nor was I asked to seek a waiver (for the Audi) After all, I had won the car in a mega international event That Audi is still with me and wont ever go anywhere else. 																								Shastri, however, declined to comment on the Ferrari controversy. Dont drag me into this, he requested.																								Incidentally, Kapil Dev didnt get an exemption on the BMW gifted during Indias maiden tour of South Africa, in 1991-92.																								A lot of people had things to say during the match-fixing scandal, three years ago, but I paid Rs 12.5 lakh as duty and have the documents to substantiate that, he maintained, while speaking exclusively from New Delhi.																								Like Shastri, Kapil didnt talk on the Sachin issue. He did speak about Johl, though.																								The Lexus would have remained with Amandeep but, then, every Indian ought to have been proud of his achievement That car wasnt a gift, but the reward for a lot of hard work. A waiver, therefore, would have been in order, Kapil added.																								Earlier this year, the Union government (again) amended the relevant Customs Act to allow ad-hoc exemptions in circumstances of an exceptional nature. Now, perhaps, even that could be further amended.

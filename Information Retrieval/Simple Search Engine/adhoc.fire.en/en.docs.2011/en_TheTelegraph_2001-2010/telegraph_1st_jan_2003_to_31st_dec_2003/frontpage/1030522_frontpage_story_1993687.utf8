 Thursday, May 22, 2003 				 Bengal nun dies in Valley attack
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar May 21: A nun from West Bengal was killed today when militants attacked a Christian school in Anantnag in the first such incident in Kashmir.																								Sister Kamlesh died when a grenade exploded near the main entrance of the Saint Lukas Convent School in Nai Basti in Anantnag town, 50 km from Srinagar.																								Sister Mary, another teacher who also comes from Bengal, was injured in the explosion this evening. Sister Mary was initially admitted to a local hospital but was later shifted to Srinagar for better treatment.																								Police said the militants hurled the grenade at the gates of the school when the two women were returning from a market. 																								The grenade was hurled from a lane and exploded near the school, critically injuring the two school teachers. We rushed to the spot and shifted the two teachers to the sub-district hospital here. However, Sister Kamlesh succumbed en route, an officer of the Anantnag police station said on the phone tonight.																								Sources said the area was tense after the local media carried reports that conversions were being carried out in the two south Kashmir districts of Anantnag and Pulwama. But no one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.																								This is the first time that a Christian-run school has come under attack in Kashmir after the flare-up of the insurgency.																								The attack came as militants singled out an officer of the Intelligence Bureau and killed him by ambushing a vehicle in Pulwama this afternoon.																								The police said two officers of the bureau and another employee were travelling in a private vehicle when militants opened fire, killing one and critically injuring two.																								The Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen, a pro-Pakistan militant outfit, claimed responsibility for the attack. Atal hope																								Asserting that the time has come for a final decision on resolving the Indo-Pak issues, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said he was sure Pakistan would change its stand on the 20 fugitives that Delhi wants Islamabad to hand over.  Though there has been no change  in their (Pakistans) attitude in this regard, I am sure  it will change, Vajpayee said in Lucknow.

 Friday, April 25, 2003 				 Stay connected, even on Everest 
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, April 24: If youre thinking of climbing the Everest, carry your mobile phone along.																								Chances are youre not that ambitious but there are climbers and climbers. The China Mountaineering Institute is organising an expedition to Mount Everest and the team members are expected to carry Motorola phones which can send short text messages (SMS) and multimedia messages, or MMS  the new craze. 																								China  ahead of India in many things  is also getting to the top of Sagarmata, the Nepalese term for Everest, first. Its vehicle for this technological marvel will be China Mobile, a large cellular service operator in the Communist country, which is establishing a GSM (global system for mobile communications) base station on Everest. GSM is the technology used in mobile phones.																								GSM will attain the pinnacle of achievement by providing mobile coverage on the worlds tallest peak. We expected the mobile to work wonders and this proves it, says T.V. Ramchandran, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India.																								But its not that China has no competition at all. And who but the Americans to take it on  Cisco, the US multinational, has decided to establish the worlds highest and most remote wireless data communications network on Everest.																								There lies the story of a hot telecom tussle on the icy slopes of the worlds tallest peak at 29,035 feet because the technology Cisco is using is Wi-Fi, which is still nascent but is gaining popularity because it provides Internet link to the laptop or a hand-held device like the palmtop, even a cellphone.																								This means the expedition to mark the 50th anniversary of Tenzing and Hillarys climb to the top on May 29, 1953, can technically surf the Net if it carries a laptop computer and a net-enabled mobile phone.																								Tenzing and Hillary had no way of telling the world that they had been where no one else had been before once they reached the top at 11.30 that morning. 																								They returned to the lower camp and sent a message through wireless radio. 																								The team that will follow in their footsteps  taking the same route and aiming to reach the top on the same date and at the same time  can now have access to technology that will allow them to send their pictures to their wives or mothers standing on top of Everest instantly. 																								There is a niggling suspicion in some quarters that Chinas bid to go up the Everest with a state-of-the-art communication system might raise security concerns for India.																								An industry expert said: It is indeed a technological advancement but security issues will have to be examined irrespective of whether the technology is GSM or wi-fi.

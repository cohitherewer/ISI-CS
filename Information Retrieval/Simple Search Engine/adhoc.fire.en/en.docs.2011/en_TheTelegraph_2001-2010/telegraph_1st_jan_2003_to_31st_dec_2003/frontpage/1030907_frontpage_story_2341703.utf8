 SOUMI BHATTACHARYA 																								Suri, Sept. 6: Police claimed to have established the identity of Tiger Singh, the man behind the night-long hostage drama at Suri sub-divisional hospital on Wednesday, after finding similarities between him and a Jharkhand-based criminal, Angur Khan. 																								We have got a lot of information after cross checking the facts provided by Tiger. We are confident of cracking the missing links soon. Unless we interrogate Tiger more thoroughly, which may be possible in a day or two, it is not possible for us to come to a conclusion, said K. Harirajan, deputy inspector-general, Burdwan range. A team of Birbhum police has rushed to Jharkhand to confirm the sleuths finding. 																								The standoff at the hospital in Birbhum, bordering Jharkhand, came to an end on Thursday morning after Tiger killed Sadananda Mondal. He was hit in the chin during the police operation to flush him out. 																								Doctors treating Tiger in Burdwan Medical College and Hospital have referred him to the R. Ahmed Dental College in Calcutta for dental surgery. 																								Police came across Angurs name and description during day-long raids at Khairasol and Dubrajpur in Birbhum. 																								We showed Tigers photograph to the local people and they identified him as Angur Khan, who used to live in the village. Tigers statement  that he wanted to kill Sadananda to take revenge  coincides with that of Angur. We are interrogating more villagers to confirm his identity, said an investigating officer. 																								Police said Angur is the son of Noor Mohammed Khan, a notorious criminal of Bikrampur in Jharkhand, who was involved in several murder and dacoity cases. Noor and his two sons shifted to Banbadra village in Khairasol in the nineties and took up coal smuggling. 																								In 1996, a rival group killed Noor and Angurs brother, the sole witness to Noors murder. 																								Two years later, Angur returned to Jharkhand. Though he went back, he kept in touch with the coal mafia. When he came to know that Sadananda, an employee of Eastern Coalfields Limited, was involved in his father and brothers killing, he decided to avenge their murders, an official said. 																								Angur joined the mafia and hatched a plan to kill Sadananda. Sleuths said Angur went to Mumbai a few months ago to buy a 9-mm pistol, the one he used on Sadananda. 																								From the statements of the villagers and preliminary investigation we have learnt that Tiger Singh and Angur Khan are the same person. He had changed his name to fool the police, officials confirmed.																								But Jharkhand home secretary J.B. Tubid said tonight he had no information about Angur and his father being involved in criminal activities.

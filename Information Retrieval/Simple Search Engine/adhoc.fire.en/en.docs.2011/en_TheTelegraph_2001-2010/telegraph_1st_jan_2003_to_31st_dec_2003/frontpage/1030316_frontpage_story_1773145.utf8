  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, March 15: National oil companies today hiked petrol and diesel prices for the second time this month. Petrol will now cost Rs 35 a litre in Calcutta  dearer by Rs 1.39 paise  while diesel will be priced at Rs 23.51 paise a litre, an increase of 91 paise. The prices have gone up elsewhere by up to Rs 1.50 and Re 1 a litre, respectively, depending on local taxes. Todays hike comes on top of the Rs 1.50-per litre increase announced on budget day. Earlier this year, petrol and diesel prices were raised by up to Rs 2 a litre in three phases. The oil firms said international crude prices have been climbing in the face of the threat of war in Iraq and the Indian basket of crude imports had crossed the $30-per barrel mark this month. After the last price hike, the companies had claimed that they did not pass on the entire burden to the consumer. Sources said the oil companies have asked the government to raise LPG and kerosene prices, untouched since last March.Though they are losing money on these two cooking fuels, the government is asking them to continue in view of the Assembly elections.

 Monday, September 29, 2003 				 Remix catches up with platinum Lata
 															- Potpourri of politicians and repackaged music at 75th birthday celebration OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 LK Advani felicitates Lata Mangeshkar in Mumbai on Sunday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Sept. 28: Yash Chopra was not there. But remix was, right from the beginning.																								Chopra eventually made it to the stage that was paying a tribute to Lata Mangeshkar on her 75th birthday  when someone remembered that his films are still not complete without a Lata song.																								An unusual mix of politicians and remixes swung the baton on stage with the singing legend remaining a picture of poise in a white saree.																								Deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani led the power parade at the Andheri Sports Complex Stadium, cajoling her to his favourite Lata song.																								She did. Two lines from the song Jyoti Kalash Chhalke  and referred to Advani  two years older to her  as dada.																								Advani was graceful enough to suggest that the occasion was not one of bhashans but of sangeet and step back from the limelight.																								Remix then stepped in. The spectacle kicked off with the remixed rendition of Hawa mein udta jayen mera lal dupatta and Main chali, main chali by Bombay Vikings.																								It was a beginning with a ring of irony. Lata is known to have frowned in the past on the remix wave sweeping the entertainment industry.																								The Band of Boys  Indias first such group  took over from the Vikings. The subsequent singers  Vasundhara Das, Hariharan, Suresh Wadkar or Shankar Mahadevan, with many to follow  could not keep the audience transfixed. Many left early.																								If others grumbled about the quality of music, Lata did not. She listened to the songs, sharing a sofa with her sister Usha and  at one point  turning misty-eyed as emotions overwhelmed her.																								When she spoke, she did reminisce about the golden years when remixes had not invaded Hindi music. If Mohammad Rafi, Talat Mahmood, Kishore-da, Hemant-da were present today, they would have celebrated the occasion in great style, she said.																								Expressing gratitude to all well-wishers, the Nightingale of India said she did not like the idea of celebrating her birthday. Earlier, she had always run away from the city on the occasion, but, this time, she decided to be present because of the enthusiasm of her brother Hridayanath Mangeshkar and his son Adinath.																								Her presence at the function was a break from her family tradition as well, as the Mangeshkars usually celebrate their birthdays at the stroke of midnight.																								She said Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray wanted to be present but could not attend because of ill health. She had called on him yesterday, after telling him that they will not discuss politics.																								Not that there was any shortage of politicians. Keeping Advani company were Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, his deputy Chhagan Bhujbal, Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshi, Sharad Pawar and the Shiv Senas Uddhav and Raj Thackeray. Shinde handed over a letter to Lata from Sonia Gandhi.																								The show had its hiccups, too. Host Sonu Nigam called on stage an industrialist who was not present but Yash Chopra was overlooked. Nigam later apologised profusely and invited him to speak.

 Saturday, June 21, 2003  Seer letter on Lucknow table 
 Hawks caged on either side
 RASHEED KIDWAI AND YOGESH VAJPEYI Bhopal/Lucknow, June 20: The  fate of the Ayodhya dispute now lies in an envelope that  arrived in Lucknow today from Kanchi containing what is  believed to be the Sankaracharyas formula for a negotiated  settlement.																								The sealed envelope cannot be opened because Maulana Rabey Nadvi is out of town and is expected to be back tomorrow. The envelope will be opened on Saturday, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said.																								Nadvi heads the board and had a meeting with the Kanchi seer who visited Lucknow a couple of weeks ago. Maulana Sajjad Nomani said the Sankaracharya had sought confirmation of receipt of the envelope.																								He did not say how soon the formula would be put before the board. The future course of action would be decided by the boards president.																								The board finds itself in a stronger position now to deal with the Sankaracharyas proposals, having succeeded in isolating the hawks.																								Board office-bearers claimed two key achievements. First, the countrys most influential Muslim organisation has kept its unity intact. Second, the so-called gang of four lawyers  Syed Shahabuddin, Zafaryab Jeelani, Yusuf Hathim Muchala and Abdul Raheem Qureshi  which has openly attacked efforts at a negotiated settlement has found itself in a minority.																								Our vision is clear and we want the issue settled either through court verdict or negotiations, Nomani said.																								Jeelani, the most outspoken of the hawks, continued the shrill tirade, arguing that the seers effort was a cover-up for the VHPs unwillingness to accept an adverse court verdict.																								Unlike in the past, the moderate Muslim voice is coming out strong. Maulana Kalbe-Sadiq dismissed Jeelanis charge: I believe that a religious head like the Sankaracharya will have no mischief to play.																								For, perhaps, the first time, hardliners on either side are finding themselves marginalised and on the same side  opposed to a negotiated settlement.																								VHP leader Giriraj Kishore today rejected the move altogether. Any formula that gives Muslims a right to Mathura, Kashi or any premises under Archaeological Survey of Indias supervision is unacceptable, he said.																								For the hawks on both sides, an end to the Ayodhya dispute  possibly with a Ram temple at the site with a mosque nearby, Kashi and Mathura settled and handover of 100-odd mosques to the Muslims  represents an existential crisis, stripping them of any purpose in life.

 Wednesday, January 29, 2003 				 CBI traces Soren cash 
 DALIP SINGH New Delhi, Jan. 28: The  CBI has tracked down the assets JMM leader Shibu Soren purportedly  acquired with the alleged bribe paid before the infamous  confidence motion of 1993 that saved the Narasimha Rao government.																								The agency has completed its investigation into the disproportionate assets case against Soren, one of the three MPs accused in the JMM bribery case, and has uncovered unaccounted for assets of Rs 40.89 lakh linked to him.																								The CBI is now waiting for sanction from the Lok Sabha Speaker to prosecute him. 																								Once it gets the go-ahead, the agency will file the chargesheet in a city court under the Prevention of Corruption Act. It had filed chargesheets against the other MPs  Suraj Mandal and Simon Marandi  on November 21 last year.

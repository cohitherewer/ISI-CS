 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT			Calcutta, Oct. 4: Launching  a blistering attack on Justice Amitava Lala for restricting  rallies on weekdays, the Left Front today decided to defy  him by taking out processions to Mahajati Sadan on Wednesday  for a mass convention.																								The convention will finalise the date for a massive protest demonstration throughout the state, including a mass rally and sit-in demonstrations. This is likely to be before October 27, the day Calcutta High Court reopens after the Pujas. Till a division bench decides otherwise, the order banning rallies from 8 am to 8 pm on working days stands.																								CPM-affiliated organisations like the Students Federation of India (SFI) and the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and similar Leftist bodies will also bring out a huge procession from Calcutta University to Rani Rashmoni Avenue on October 13 in a show of defiance to the order.																								The protest decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the Left Front today. Announcing its plans to take on the judiciary head on, Front chairman and CPM politburo member Biman Bose said: Let us make it very clear that we are not going to abide by Justice Lalas verdict. We are ready to go to jail for defying it. We may even raise slogans urging Justice Lala to go back.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was not invited to the meeting, presided over by Bose. We are announcing a political programme which does not necessitate the presence of Bhattacharjee, a member said.																								Briefing reporters later, Bose spoke up for the tribals, whose rally had held up Justice Lala on the way to court and spurred the order. 																								There are 48 lakh tribals in Bengal and they are very much a part of our culture, he said, adding that an undesirable order was being imposed on the people.																								The ruling implies that rallies and processions can be held in the metropolis only at night on weekdays. This is not the practice in Calcutta. I have heard that in Kerala rallies are held at night, Bose said.																								He wondered why the high court had issued a directive on holding rallies on holidays only at the Brigade Parade Grounds, Shahid Minar and Rani Rashmoni Avenue when the government had already named the same spots as venues.																								I am ready to go to jail, Bose said, asked about possible contempt proceedings for his remarks today. Justice Lala declined comment on Boses outburst.																								Later in the day, the chairman of the Bar Council of West Bengal, Amiya Kumar Chatterjee, condemned the outburst. He said an emergency meeting of the council would be held tomorrow to take stock of the situation.																								What Bose has said is condemnable and we shall not take lying down his decision to take on the judiciary, Chatterjee said. At tomorrows meeting, our executive committee will decide how best to counter this shameful outburst.																								Todays Left Front meeting came in the wake of a Calcutta High Court division bench refusing to stay Justice Lalas order after the state moved a petition against it. All major Front partners attended the meeting.																								While the CPM was the most vocal against the order, followed by the RSP and the Forward Bloc, the CPI felt the Front should show some restraint. I think we should wait till we get a copy of his order, CPI state secretary Manju Majumdar said.																								RSP leader Sunil Sengupta dubbed the order draconian. Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh said even the British raj had not dared to curb the peoples fundamental democratic rights in this manner.																								The Congress and the Trinamul Congress, both of which have condemned Justice Lalas ruling, refused comment on Boses outburst and the Left Fronts agitation programme. 																								We shall decide what to do next only after Mamata Banerjee holds our partys working committee meeting, said Pankaj Banerjee, senior Trinamul member and leader of Opposition in the Assembly.																								Congress spokesman Manas Bhuniya said: We shall first have to take a look at the order before we decide on anything.

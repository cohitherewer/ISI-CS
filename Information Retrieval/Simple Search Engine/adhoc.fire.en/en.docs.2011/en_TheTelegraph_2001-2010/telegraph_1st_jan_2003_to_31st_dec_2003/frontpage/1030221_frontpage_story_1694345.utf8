 							 - BJP polishes off-court game  RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 20: Murli Manohar Joshi today assured VHP leaders that a suitable formula would be worked out if the Supreme Court delays vacating its stay on religious activity on the Ayodhya site or takes an adverse view of the Centres plea to lift the ban.																								The assurance, on the eve of a meeting of the VHPs apex steering committee  the Marg Darshak Mandal  came when the human resources development minister met the organisations leaders, including working president Ashok Singhal.																								Sources close to Joshi said the formula would be to make out a case that it was tenable  legally and otherwise to restore the undisputed land purportedly in the possession of the Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas.																								For the first time, the government has also got down to the task of demarcating the undisputed land.																								The Centres case rests on an observation made by a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court in its 1994 judgment, which upheld the acquisition of the Ayodhya land by the government after the demolition of the Babri Masjid. The court had said the undisputed owners must be handed back the area found to be superfluous after making provisions for the land needed to construct either a temple or a mosque.																								In this case it is the Nyas, which was given a part of the undisputed (or superfluous) land by the Uttar Pradesh government, then headed by the BJP, in 1992.																								If this legal route is choked, government sources said they would have to resort to what Rajiv Gandhi did when he overturned the apex courts verdict in the Shah Bano case. This means bringing an executive order allowing the Centre to give the undisputed land to the Nyas. But this would be the last option, the sources stressed.																								The BJP hopes the tone and tenor of the VHPs three-day dharma sansad, which begins on Saturday, would be less rancorous than last year when the Prime Minister came under attack at a public meeting by the sants.																								Asked what could have changed in a year, a source said: The governments application before the court and, more important, for the first time the government went on record to state in Parliament that the court must expedite the settlement and give an early record. 																								Earlier, the governments stock response was it should be resolved through negotiations or the court but it never committed itself to a time frame.																								The other reason was the decision to steer clear of the usual VHP-Muslim dialogue, which yielded nothing. Indeed, the VHP gave a veiled warning to Kanchi Sankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati not to fall into the dialogue trap and undermine his credibility.																								Joshis involvement as the Centres chief mediator was also welcomed. Unlike the Prime Minister and the deputy Prime Minister, he has been faithful to the Hindutva agenda without being apologetic, a VHP functionary explained.																								The BJPs aggressive posture on cow slaughter has also given the VHP hope that it is returning to its Hindutva agenda. The BJP has urged the Centre to bring in a legislation banning cow slaughter.																								Sources indicated that while it may not be possible to introduce the Bill in the budget session, it could be brought in the monsoon session.

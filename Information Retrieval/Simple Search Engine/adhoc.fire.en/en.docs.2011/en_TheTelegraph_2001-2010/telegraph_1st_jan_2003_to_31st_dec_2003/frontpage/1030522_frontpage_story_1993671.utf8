 Thursday, May 22, 2003 				 Citu strains at leash, city gasps
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 A car being stopped at the gates of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on Wednesday. Picture by Pabitra Das Calcutta, May 21: New Left  took a forced holiday, allowing Old Citu to work overtime.																								The CPMs labour wing  held on leash of late by the pro-reform hand of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  picked out a string of soft targets today to enforce the industrial strike that became a Bengal bandh and reassure restive ranks that the union is still fighting fit.																								The day started with supporters of the bandh targeting the railway track. Three passengers standing by the door of a local train were admitted to a hospital after being hit on the head by stones.																								In Calcutta, a senior South Eastern Railway official was pulled out of his car and roughed up by suspected Citu activists near Phoolbagan while on his way to office. His fault: he had tried to explain that he was working for a public utility service and had to attend office.																								Next, it was the turn of a pilot who was to take an Indian Airlines flight to Guwahati. He was intercepted a few hundred metres from the airport on VIP Road and asked to turn back. Senior airport officials rushed to the spot to reason. Reason, however, was the last thing on the minds of those who were bent on stopping anything that moved towards the airport.																								An army vehicle, too, was sought to be stopped but the strong-arm tactics did not pay off there.																								The desperate attempt today at muscle-flexing has capped a series of events that have led to a steady erosion of the support base of what was once the most militant face of Indias labour force.																								Some of the Central policies, like closure of sick units, being opposed in todays strike are pursued by the Left Front government, too, pushing the Citu on the back foot before its rank and file and often standing in the way of more pronounced protests.																								The state governments decision to shut down over a dozen loss-making state public sector units has forced us to adopt an unusually docile posture even vis--vis the Centres decisions, a senior Citu leader admitted. Besides, the unions are forced to play second fiddle to the management in many sectors and that has dented the forces morale, he added.																								The impact was telling on the ground: the Citus loss of the prestigious Hindustan Motors trade union in Hooghly to a more aggressive Left outfit  unprecedented in the state  and the Naxalite unions growth in almost every sector (always at the CPM unions expense).																								North 24-Parganas CPM district secretariat member Amitava Nandi admitted that what happened today was not desirable. We will look into the specific complaints, he said.																								Journalists, usually given right of way during bandhs, did not escape surveillance and some were blocked from covering incidents. Explaining the occupational hazard, Citu general secretary Chittabrata Majumdar said a right was not a gift and had to be acquired.																								Police also had their share of shame. A traffic sergeant was filmed by a television channel crew while deflating a tyre of a taxi on Park Street. 																								The police have sought the footage to identify the sergeant and take action if it is proved that he really deflated the taxis tyre.

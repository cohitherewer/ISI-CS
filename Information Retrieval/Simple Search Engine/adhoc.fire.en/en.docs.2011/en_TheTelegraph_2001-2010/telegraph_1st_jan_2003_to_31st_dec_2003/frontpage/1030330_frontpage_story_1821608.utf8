A large posse of police, Tripura State Rifles and CRPF jawans under Dhalai superintendent of police Saurav Tripathi has launched a combing operation to nab the militants. However, no arrest has been made. 																								Senior railway officials in Guwahati will arrive here tomorrow to work out a contingency plan following the killing.																								The construction of the 110-km railway track between Kumarghat and Agartala has been peppered with militant attacks and abduction of workers.

 Tuesday, May 20, 2003 				 Sequel: Shilpa sari amp; Shetty tapes
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, May 19: Movie Mafia Tapes, Part II, is just out.																								The sequel to the so-called Sunjay Dutt-Chhota Shakeel conversation debuted today when police leaked transcripts of tapes allegedly recording threats made on behalf of actress Shilpa Shetty to the owner of Prafful Sarees, Pankaj Agarwal.																								There is no way of independently authenticating the conversation. Even the police will vouchsafe authenticity only off the record.																								Agarwal had accused Shilpas father, Surendra Shetty, of taking the underworlds help to force him to pay dues to the actress who had featured in an advertisement for Prafful Sarees.																								In the transcript, there are conversations between Malaysia-based don Fazlur Rehman, his henchman Uday Shetty and Agarwal, and between Agarwal and Surendra. Even Shilpas mother Sunanda figures in it.																								The transcript quotes Rehman as saying: Apko unko do khokha dena padenga (You have to give them Rs 2 crore).																								Agarwal: But I dont have any payments to make																								Rehman: No, you will have to pay up.																								In his complaint, Agarwal has accused Surendra, who is out on an anticipatory bail till May 28, of trying to extort from him Rs 2 crore. 																								Agarwal claims to have cleared all payments amounting to Rs 22 lakh for the ad Shilpa did in 1997.																								It appears that the Shettys asked for the extra payment because there was no agreement on the period for which the ad was to run. Prafful Sarees used it until last year. The Shettys served Agarwal a legal notice also. 																								Claiming that they have a strong case against the Shettys, police sources said Shilpa would be interrogated once she returned to Mumbai from the Cannes film festival where she is scheduled to perform a dance number.																								Mother Sunanda is travelling with the actress who is going to Cannes from Johannesburg.

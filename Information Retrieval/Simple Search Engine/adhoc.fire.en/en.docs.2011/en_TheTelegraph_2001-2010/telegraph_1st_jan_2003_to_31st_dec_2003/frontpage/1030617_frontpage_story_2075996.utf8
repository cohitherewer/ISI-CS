 Tuesday, June 17, 2003 				 Bribe to feast, Sangh sniffs Ayodhya plot
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 16: Stung by the Centres decision to keep it out of a negotiated settlement to the Ayodhya dispute, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad today accused the government of bartering away the Ram temple to make peace with jihadi forces.																								The Sangh outfits triumvirate of Ashok Singhal, Acharya Giriraj Kishore and Praveen Togadia addressed the press today and spewed vitriol, not sparing the Prime Minister and his deputy, though indirectly.																								The reaction came a week after the Kanchi Sankaracharya, Swami Jayendra Saraswati, who is the Centres unofficial mediator with Muslim representatives, publicly said a solution was in the offing.																								An agitated Singhal said: I urge the people of India to see how those who occupy seats of power are playing around with their sentiments. People should give them a fitting answer in a democratic way.																								He then demanded to know which Central representative spoke to Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Delhis Jama Masjid, and the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board. Bukhari had disclosed that the Sankaracharya recently approached him for secret talks.																								Is the state kowtowing before jihadi forces? People have a right to know and the Centre should clarify, so that they can take a considered opinion on the Ram temple, Singhal said.																								Next, Singhal accused the government of offering a bribe of Rs 50 crore to a board member. Asked about the basis of the charge, Togadia said: Why does someone resign and then withdraw it after a week? Is there some horsetrading or not? 																								He was referring to board vice-president Maulana Kalbe-Sadiqs recent resignation  which he withdrew yesterday  over the organisations refusal to keep doors open for negotiations.																								According to Singhal, even the Sankaracharya was being kept in the dark about many important things by the Centre. The government has made him a tool and he, too, has realised that. I spoke to him and he said he had no idea what was going on in the government.																								Singhal trashed the Centres reported formula of the VHP giving up its claim on Kashi and Mathura shrines in exchange for the Ayodhya land, and restoring several mosques  in the care of the Archaeological Survey of India  to Muslims.																								He likened it to a fine feast of halwa, puri and kheer, which was unfortunately served in a commode and, therefore, not to be touched even by a dog.																								Claiming that the Sankaracharya agreed Kashi and Mathura were not negotiable, Singhal said: The self-respect of Hindus cannot be bartered away.																								The VHP appeared to be sending a veiled message to the Sankaracharya not to strike a deal. The Sankaracharya wont fall into this saudebaazi (wheeling-dealing) trap. He respects the feelings of Hindus and unless he talks to the entire sant samaj, he will not move an inch, Singhal said.

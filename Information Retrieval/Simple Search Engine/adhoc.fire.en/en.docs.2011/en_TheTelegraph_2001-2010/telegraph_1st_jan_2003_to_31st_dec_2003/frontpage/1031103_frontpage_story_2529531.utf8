 Monday, November 03, 2003 				 Jailbreak Binod back with broken leg
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta/Dankuni, Nov. 2: The 39-day free run of Sheikh Binod, one of the citys most-feared criminals, ended before daybreak this morning when South 24-Parganas police raided a house in Hooghlys Dankuni and caught up with him. 																								Also taken into custody were wife Naseema, three-year-old son Ashique and Rambabu Naskar, an accomplice who had escaped with Binod from Dum Dum Central Jail on September 25. 																								Naseema, police learnt from interrogation, took on rent the ground floor of a two-storeyed house at Dankunis Nandankanan on September 10, 15 days before the jailbreak. 																								Spinning an elaborate yarn about her husband, Akhtar Khan, and his brother who are goldsmiths in Mumbai, Naseema presented herself as Seema and forked out Rs 5,000 as advance for the two-room accommodation she was renting for 11 months. Landlord Basudev Mudi fixed the rent at Rs 1,200.																								Binod and the others who had broken out with him stayed together for a few weeks before parting ways. 																								He moved in with Naseema and their son in the last week of October, South 24-Parganas superintendent of police Deb Kumar Ganguly said.																								Unknown to the Criminal Investigation Department, publicly assigned to probe the escape, South 24-Parganas police were asked to launch a parallel probe, officials said.																								The scent started getting stronger for the sleuths after Chaitanya Pal  the contractor who left behind a ladder in the jail to help Binod escape  was arrested on October 28.																								Informers told police that Naseema was shuttling between her mothers place in Baruipur and Dankuni and mobile firms traced the calls Binod was making to Dankuni.																								The third clue  that a man resembling Binod was seen moving with a limp in Dankuni  encouraged police further. 																								The final confirmation came on Saturday, officials said. A 22-member team arrested Binod who did not put up resistance.																								Binod and four others had scaled Dum Dum Central Jails 15-foot wall and leaped to freedom. 																								But this jump proved to be the gangsters downfall as he broke his leg and was rendered immobile. He had to cancel plans of moving out of the state.

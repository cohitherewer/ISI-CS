 Thursday, April 24, 2003 				 House sanctity for talks offer
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, April 23: Its official now.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today elevated his last weeks speech in Srinagar to the status of government policy when he told the Lok Sabha that India had indeed made a gesture of conciliation to Pakistan.																								We have extended our hand of friendship, Vajpayee said, expressing the hope that a new beginning can take place between India and Pakistan. 																								The Prime Minister said Pakistan can open the door for talks by stopping cross-border infiltration and destroying terrorist infrastructure in its territory. Talks, he added, can take place on all issues, including that of Jammu and Kashmir.																								In Islamabad, President Pervez Musharraf said he was glad to see positive indications from India which could be pursued to greater interacting process.																								Pakistan wishes to resolve all its issues with India peacefully, he said, speaking for the first time since Vajpayees statement. Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed  Mehmood Kasuri pitched in with his share of new-found bonhomie  by making a fresh offer to Delhi to participate in a multi-billion-dollar  pipeline project from Turkmenistan. Kasuri said the offer  was made in the spirit of reconciliation displayed by Vajpayee.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani publicly threw his weight behind Vajpayees peace effort by affirming the talks offer. 																								Let them abandon the path of terrorism and dismantle the terrorist infrastructure. I am sure not only the Government of India but the people are willing to respond, he said in the Rajya Sabha.																								In an interview with an Indian TV channel, Kasuri responded: We are committed to combating terrorism. 																								In a statement on his two-day visit to the Valley, Vajpayee spelt out his governments changing policy on Pakistan. Since September 11, the National Democratic Alliance government has been ruling out talks unless Pakistan stopped sponsoring what it calls cross-border terrorism.																								Today, recalling what he had said in Srinagar, the Prime Minister talked about a new beginning.																								Both countries should resolve that we need to live together in peace, Vajpayee said.																								In Kashmir he had also said that we should take lessons from Iraq in a throwaway remark that figured indirectly in the House today.																								Accused by the Opposition of acting under Washingtons pressure, foreign minister Yashwant Sinha said: Compulsive hostility to the US is a baggage we should leave behindthis is not suited to our national interest.																								Embedded in the statement is a clear acknowledgement of the reality of unchallenged US supremacy and acceptance that Delhi cannot possibly go on stonewalling Washingtons calls for talks with Pakistan. There has been speculation in  the media about a possible dip in Indo-US ties after Parliament  passed a resolution deploring the war on Iraq. In the House  today, a BJP member described the resolution as a national  irrelevance, which should gladden President George W. Bushs  heart.																								On his Kashmir trip, Vajpayee said: I stressed that the gun can solve no problem; brotherhood can. Issues can be resolved if we move forward guided by the three principles of insaaniyat (humanism), jamhooriyat (democracy) and Kashmiriyat (Kashmirs age-old legacy of Hindu-Muslim amity).

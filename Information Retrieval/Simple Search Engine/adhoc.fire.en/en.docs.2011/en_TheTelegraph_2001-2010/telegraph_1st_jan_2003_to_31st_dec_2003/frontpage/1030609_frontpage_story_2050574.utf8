 Monday, June 09, 2003 				 Babri tale of injustice
																								Lucknow, June 8: The five accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case who took on top BJP leaders yesterday cited injustice as the cause for their accusations.																								Its not politics but a sense of injustice that made us speak out, said R.. Das, one of the five who accused deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani and other BJP and VHP leaders of instigating them on December 6, 1992. Das, who was a priest at the Ram  Lala Sthal, said: I was a witness to a meeting held by  Advani and others in Ram Katha Sangrahalaya on December  5 night. Later the same night, officials supplied more than  100 belchas (pointed spades) and gaitis (sharp-edged  iron rods) to the demolition squads.

 Monday, August 04, 2003 				 BJP put on election alert
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 3: A day after deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani floated the idea of simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections across the country, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu pushed it forward.																								He told the party to be prepared for polls anytime now and seek a renewed mandate based on Atal Bihari Vajpayees performance and his ability to lead a coalition government.																								At a BJP state council meeting in Hyderabad, Naidu said by the end of 2003, party activists should complete their mass contact programme called the gaon, gaon chalo, ghar, ghar chalo abhiyaan (go to every village, every home). 																								His call  coupled with the trial balloon floated by Advani  was construed by his colleagues in Delhi as a sure indication of Lok Sabha polls by February. 																								BJP sources clarified that the issue had yet to be discussed formally in the parliamentary board or the national executive, but an influential section believed that in early polls the party can: Take advantage of the good  monsoon.  Cash in on the NDAs unity  as against the Oppositions divisions. 																								The sources said the selling point would be that given the inevitability of coalitions, it was safer to vote a tried, tested, trusted combine like the NDA.  Pre-empt plans of the VHP  to rake up Ayodhya. Swim with the positive  outlook for the five states going to polls in November. 																								Even the BJP sources, however, felt implementing Advanis idea was impractical for the moment given that most Assemblies have a term extending far beyond that of the Lok Sabha and the BJP and its allies were in power in too few states to be able to bring polls forward. 																								Only three states (other than the five going to poll in November), Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, will have elections any time soon. That is why Advani said he had sounded the poll panel and the Telugu Desam, a BJP ally ruling in Andhra.																								The sources wondered how  assuming the Desam is brought around  the Congress, in the saddle in the other two states, could be persuaded. 																								For such an idea to work, it would have to be accompanied by a proposal Advani has mooted in the past: a fixed term for the Parliament and Assemblies.

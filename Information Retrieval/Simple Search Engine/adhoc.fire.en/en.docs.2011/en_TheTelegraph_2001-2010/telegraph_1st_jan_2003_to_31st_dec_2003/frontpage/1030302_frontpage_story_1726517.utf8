 Sunday, March 02, 2003 				 Anatomy of a great innings
																								A blow-by-blow account of Sachin Tendulkars 98																								1st over  Wasim Akram. Third ball. Driven to cover fence																								2nd over  Shoaib Akhtar. Fourth ball, six over third man. Next ball, flicked to square leg for four. Then, straight drive to the long-on boundary. End of Shoaibs first spell: 1-0-18-0																								3rd over  Plays five dot balls off Akram																								4th over  Waqar Younis. Last ball, flicks to square leg for four. 39 for no loss																								5th over  50 without loss.																								6th over  Waqar. Sehwag goes. Next ball, Sourav goes.																								7th over  Akram. Third ball, slices it to mid-off. Razzaq leaps, but cant hold on. Life at 32, just as against Namibia																								8th over  Waqar. Punches it to mid-on, runs four, adding injury to Shoaibs insult																								9th over  Akram. Checked off-drive through mid-off. Arguably shot of match																								10th over  Waqar, with short cover and short mid-wicket. Gets to 50 off 37 balls, with a drive between cover and mid-off. 7 fours, 2 sixes (one a couple, plus an overthrown four). 88 for 2.																								11th over  Shoaib back. Faces the last ball, despatches it to the mid-off boundary, again. Nine off the over.																								13th over  Shoaib ends second spell. 3-0-35-0.																								15th over  120 for 2																								16th over  Shahid Afridi. Develops cramps.																								17th over  Abdul Razzaq. Straight drive, the ball passes the stumps where Akram, bowling over the wicket, would be in delivery stride.																								18th over  Afridi. Plays and misses outside off. 136 for 2.																								20th over  Afridi. Crosses 12,000 runs in One-Day cricket, with a four to mid-on. Shoaib runs to ropes, in vain.																								21st over  Straight drives, Razzaq puts right hand down, stops the ball but splits his bowling finger and starts bleeding. 150 for 2.																								22nd over  Afridi. 100 partnership with Kaif, off 97 balls, Kaif goes.																								25th over  Razzaq. Drives between cover and mid-off. 93 off 66 balls. (Is limping, but refuses a runner, despite Sehwags exhortations from players gallery.)																								26th over  Shoaib returns for third spell. Shoulders drooping, looking lost, goes for only two runs.																								27th over Afridi. Takes a single, to reach 98. In obvious pain, sits on haunches, winces, possibly saying he cant continue. Andrew Leipus runs out for the second time.																								28th over  Shoaib. Sehwag comes in as the runner. Limps from square leg to take guard. Shoaibs ball of the tournament. Just short of a length, jumps up and jags back at his face. Fends off. Balloons to point. Younis Khan dives to bring off a brilliant catch. 																								Begins to hobble off SuperSport Park. Pakistanis rejoice around Shoaib. Younis Khan hurls a parting abuse at Sachin. Poor Younis, he didnt know how close he was standing to greatness.

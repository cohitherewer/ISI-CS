 															- Shakespeares heroes held up as corporate world models CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Othello, one of the plays taught in management schools, being performed in New York. (AP/PTI)																								In peace theres nothing so becomes a man																								As modest stillness and humility:																								But when the blast of war blows in our ears,																								Then imitate the action of the tiger																								Thats Shakespeare, the management guru. 																								Thats also King Henry V in Shakespeares play charging his countrymen up on the eve of the Battle of Agincourt, in which the tiny English army licked the gigantic French one. 																								The battle took place in 1415 and the play, Henry V, was written in 1599  to become an important case study in B-schools around the world circa 2003.																								How do you take up a new leadership role and be self-assured? How can you unify a diverse team?																								What can you do to inspire your team to overcome difficulties?																								Richard Olivier, son of the late Laurence Olivier  arguably, Britains finest stage actor  and an actor himself, says Henry V has an answer to all these.																								It was the kings rousing speech and his battle strategy in the name of God that won the English the day. 																								He says that overcoming obstructions, weathering the dark night of the soul, inspiring the troops and achieving victory in the face of overwhelming odds, Shakespeares hero offers a unique insight into the ways of leadership.																								Olivier, a visiting fellow at the Cranfield School of Management, has made a regular profession of teaching Henry V at business schools and corporate houses in the UK. He has also created a repertory called Olivier Mythodrama Associates to enact Shakespeare  Henry V mainly and some others  in business schools.																								Olivier has written a book: Inspirational Leadership: Henry V and the Muse of Fire.																								Columbia University, US, also offers business courses based on Shakespeares works.																								In India, too, at least one business school teaches Shakespeare. The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, offers an elective course in its post-graduate programme, titled Leadership, Vision, Meaning, Reality. It features a number of Shakespeares plays  Othello, Richard II, Richard III and Henry V  as models of corporate behaviour.																								S. Manikutty, who conducts the course, says: I teach Othello as a model of portraying innocence and intrigue in the organisation.																								Literature is like a long case and when the students analyse it, they get to understand people and the various facets of interpersonal relationships, says Leena Chatterjee, of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta (IIMC). 																								Be it a lecture on leadership or managing conflict, Chatterjee draws heavily from literature in her behavioural science compulsory course in the first year of the two-year MBA programme.																								It stimulates interest and poses a creative challenge for the students. Some of them find it difficult, but they like it.																								Stimulation can take many forms, even anti-establishment. We dont need no education, we dont need no thought control  this anti-authority anthem of Pink Floyd spices up behavioural science lectures. 																								So does Upamanyu Chatterjees novel English, August as a case study to drive home the point of occupational dilemma facing young executives. 																								In the West, people use Shakespeare to drive home various issues like leadership and how a leader should actually lead from the front. Along the same lines, I use Kautilyas Arthashastra to discuss how a leader should define vision for his organisation, explains Panduranga Bhatta of IIMC.																								If there is Henry V elsewhere, Bhatta talks about Kalidas Meghdoot in his optional course on management, culture and creativity offered in the second year. 																								Focusing on the importance of imagination in the marketplace, where ideas seem to matter most in developing new products and services, he uses Kalidas works. He even organises management development programmes for working executives by drawing examples from ancient Indian literature. 																								At IIMA, Manikutty admits to using Henry V the most, but he also teaches films and plays  mostly contemporary versions of classics  that are built around a powerful character, a hero, maybe eccentric, failed, or even successful, but someone with a vision, because in the corridors of power, as everywhere else, it is important to have a mind of your own.																								So there is the film version of Don Quixote and of George Bernard Shaws play Saint Joan. There is also Shyam Benegals film on Gandhi, The Making of Mahatma, and Girish Karnads play Tughlaq.																								At IIM Bangalore, two elective courses conducted by R. Narayanswami stress on the performing arts, not so much on literature. Narayanswami believes management is a performing art, and he wants to build an interface between the two disciplines.																								The wicked might say there is more than an interface by citing Othello, Shakespeares tragedy of jealousy about the man who loved not wisely but too well. Surely, Iago, the man who manipulates both Othello and Desdemona, is a familiar figure in many organisations.																								If not Iago-like, villains of different demeanour are not hard to find in this season of the decline and fall of the mighty CEOs.																								But until they crumple, bosses will always be searching for the inspirational high. In management its not enough to say come on guys. Thats why Henry V:																								Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,																								Disguise fair nature with hard-favourd rage;																								Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;																								Let it pry through the portage of the head																								Like the brass cannon; let the brow oerwhelm it																								As fearfully as doth a galled rock																								Oerhang and jutty his confounded base,																								Swilld with the wild and wasteful ocean.																								All it means is pummel the competition.																								With inputs from Devadeep Purohit

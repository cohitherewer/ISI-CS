 Friday, August 22, 2003 				 Leander not in distress: hospital
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Aug. 21: Leander Paes is no longer experiencing headaches and his vision is normal, the US hospital where he is being treated for a brain lesion said tonight.																								Leander remains in excellent spirits and is physically active, Dr Clarence H. Brown, the president and CEO of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Orlando, Florida, said.																								The countrys top tennis player was admitted to the hospital, among the best in the US, on Tuesday after complaining of severe headache for three days.																								Vece Paes, Leanders father and a doctor himself, said it is unlikely that the next course of action in his sons treatment will be known before Monday. 																								Dr Paes, who was in touch with Dr Anthony Scarcella, coordinator of the three-member medical team attending to Leander, left for the US this evening after missing the Jet Airways flight to Mumbai last night. 																								He will be in Orlando, where Leander is based in the US, on Friday evening. 																								The hospital listed his condition as stable, a routine description which should not be taken to mean that it was unstable earlier. Dr Brown said his doctors are treating him with antibiotics for a possible brain abscess. 																								While not yet proven in Leanders situation, one rather common infection in India causing such a brain lesion is cysticercus granuloma, caused by the larval form of a tapeworm, he added.																								Dr Brown is the chief of cancer and tumour research and completes the panel with Dr Miya Razzaq, spine and brain neurosurgeon.																								Since all possible tests have been done yielding negative results, theres no option but to repeat those tests, the fresh results of which are expected by the weekend. The doctors will then meet on Monday and, depending on what the results are, we will take a decision, Dr Paes said before leaving. 																								The fact that Leander has been having light gym sessions and a game of volleyball or two augurs well but, as Dr Paes stressed, nothing will be known for sure till the next set of results comes in.  With inquiries continuing to flood  the Paes household, Sahara India has volunteered to open  an information centre from where they will monitor Leanders  progress in Orlando and issue medical bulletins.

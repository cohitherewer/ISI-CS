 Tuesday, March 25, 2003 				 Americas pride down
																								In what could have been a scene from the movie Blackhawk Down, which showed US troops under fire in Somalia, farmers with grubby rifles were on Monday filmed swarming over one of the worlds mightiest attack helicopters, sitting impotent in a lush field in Iraq.																								The AH-64D Apache Longbow of the US Cavalry was somehow brought down after running into a storm of ground fire during a combat mission by up to 40 of the formidable flying tanks.																								The loss of such an advanced weapons system, capable of knocking out tanks at long range, came as a fresh blow to US military pride after Iraqi irregulars killed and captured members of their invasion force on Sunday.

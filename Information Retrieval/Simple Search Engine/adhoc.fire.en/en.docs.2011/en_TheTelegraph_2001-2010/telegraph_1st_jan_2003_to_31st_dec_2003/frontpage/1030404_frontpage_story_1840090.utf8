 Friday, April 04, 2003 				 Ashs toe keeps Vivek on his toes
 															- Hurt in left foot and arm, actress advised bed-rest by doctors  OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Aishwarya at the hospital. Picture by Vikas Khot																								Mumbai, April 3: The small toe on her left foot has hairline fractures, but Aishwarya Rai has already walked  with support, of course.																								And support there was in strength  mental and physical  in the shape of a strapping young man whose body and soul cant bear to leave the 15th floor of the Hinduja hospital here.																								Its just for a good friend, though, as Vivek Oberoi would like the world to believe, that he spent most part of last night in the hospital. The world would like to believe he was at Aishwaryas bedside and, when not there, pacing up and down the lonely corridor worrying about her small toe. And the injured left arm and the sore waist.																								Hurt in an accident during the shooting of Khaki yesterday evening, the actress was certified by doctors as being in no danger but has been advised bed-rest. She could miss work for a couple of months.																								Aishwarya was brought from Nashik, where the accident occurred, to the hospital just after midnight. As there are no flights from Nashik to Mumbai, Amitabh Bachchan, who stars in the Raj Kumar Santoshi movie as well, is believed to have used his networking skills to rush in a chartered helicopter to fly home the actress.																								Vivek, who had only a day before accused senior colleague Salman Khan of picking on him allegedly for being Aishwaryas latest love interest, was at the old airport in Vakola to receive Bollywoods leading lady, as she was flown in from Nashik.																								He accompanied Aishwarya to the hospital and left only at the crack of dawn, only to return again, according to hospital sources.																								At the airport was also a concerned Subrata Roy with his wife. The Sahara couple went along with the actress to the hospital, as did Amitabh and Akshay Kumar, also her Khaki co-star. Aishwarya is on Saharas advisory board.																								Vivek, who made his name in Company and Saathiya, told reporters he would help any friend in need. The whole industry knows that I will be there for my friends, whatever the circumstances, Vivek said, dodging questions why after making allegations against Salman he didnt file a police complaint. 																								Right now this is more important, the actor said before rushing back into the hospital.																								Whoever said it is not more important?																								He did, after all, gift her a cuddly teddy bear recently, didnt he? 																								Dr Sanjay Agarwal, who is attending on Aishwarya, announced that she was out of major pain and that he even made her walk with support in the morning.																								It seems its not Salman alone that is a thorn. After being hit by a jeep during the shooting, Aishwarya fell on a cactus and thorns pierced her translucent skin. The thorns have been removed but there are abrasions on her elbow, waist and back.																								Doctors have used fibreglass bandage, which, they said, would help heal the hairline fractures faster. Her foot and arm will be in cast for some time.																								Aishwarya is recuperating in a well-guarded special room to block the stream of well-wishers. But the flowers do not stop coming. Nor the queries from industry colleagues and fans.																								Has Salman enquired after her? Well, its not known.																								Trade analysts said the forced lay-off would not hit her projects, which may at the most be postponed for some time.																								It doesnt seem likely that her projects will be affected, industry expert Taran Adarsh said. Anyway she has only a selected few films lined up.																								Other than Khaki, Aishwarya is starring with Vivek in Sameer Karniks Kyon Ho Gaya Na? which also stars Amitabh. Shooting for the Rituparno Ghosh-directed Bengali movie Chokher Bali is complete.

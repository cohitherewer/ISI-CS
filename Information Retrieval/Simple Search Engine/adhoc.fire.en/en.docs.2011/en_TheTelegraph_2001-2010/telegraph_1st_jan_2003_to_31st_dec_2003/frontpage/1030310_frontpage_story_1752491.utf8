 Monday, March 10, 2003  For a berth in semis its not a laugh  match
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sourav during practice  in Johannesburg. (Reuters)  Johannesburg, March 9:  Given the occasion, the teams photo shoot on the SAS Outeniqua,  last month, encouraged much bonhomie among the World Cuppers.  Muttiah Muralidharan, specially, was warmer than usual and  greeted Sachin Tendulkar with I hope you score five-six  hundreds. Of course, Murali didnt envisage  an India versus Sri Lanka shootout early into the Super  Six. Otherwise, he probably wouldnt have hoped for five-six  hundreds: Sachin has already scored one (152 against Namibia)  and missed another (98 versus Pakistan). Tomorrow, he may  well set sights on ODI hundred No. 35. That will neither suit Lanka nor  Murali. Sachin and Murali havent had a confrontation for  some years. Given the equation, Lanka must win to give itself  a chance of making the semifinals. For India, four points  will confirm a berth in the last four. No quarter will be given in a  contest where emotions will have a place. Unless both teams  advance, it will be the last India-match for Aravinda de  Silva, who made his first appearance in 1985. Today, Aravinda didnt really  get the time to reflect on the past, but did say the occasion  has always been special. The pressure is there... Better  cricket will carry the day, he said.  Asked whether another fine knock  (following the 92 and 73 in the last two games) would compel  a rethink on retirement, Aravinda laughed: No... But its  possible I could again face India... In the semifinals,  or even the final. Lanka will need Aravindas confidence  if they are to put it across India. The build-up has seen Lanka battle  with captain Sanath Jayasuriyas fitness. Clearly the cynosure  at this afternoons workout, Sanath announced he was 80  per cent fit. The Brett Lee-inflicted bruise on his arm  is better, but the hairline crack on the left thumb remains  a worry. It wont surprise, though, if  that 80 per cent becomes 100 per cent. A source revealed  Sanath would definitely play. The Indians too are assuming  he will be available. Despite five victories in succession,  captain Sourav Ganguly chose to be cautiously confident.  Well have to play good cricket... That has no substitute...  The Lankans are a good side. Last Septembers Champions  Trophy would have given a current flavour to the head-to-head  bit, but the elements ruined both the scheduled final and  the replay. In the NatWest, however, India  was far superior. But, then, the Lankans will argue Murali  wasnt around. As both teams are familiar with  each other, innovation could make a difference. Only, given  what is at stake, the captains may prefer conventional cricket  to risking tonnes of criticism. This afternoon, the wicket  had moisture and with rain being a pretty regular feature  in these parts, the toss could become more crucial than  it ought to be. With the bowlers consistent and  the key batsmen (save Virender Sehwag) among the runs, the  Indians are actually without a real worry. Its a luxury,  though the fielding against Kenya was atrocious. Just one  bad day in office is how Sourav, who completed three years  as captain today, tried to explain it. Hopefully, year No. 4 will begin  without Sourav having to offer any explanation.

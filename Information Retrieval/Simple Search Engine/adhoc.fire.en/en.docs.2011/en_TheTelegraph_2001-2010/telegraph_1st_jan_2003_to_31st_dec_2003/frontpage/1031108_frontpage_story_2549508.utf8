																								Calcutta, Nov. 7: Police today removed from the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital campus junior doctors and medical students protesting against the punishment meted out to four interns and two junior doctors following unruly incidents a week ago.																								The relay hunger strike continued in front of the hospitals main entrance even as three of the suspended interns  of the SUCI-affiliate All-India Democratic Students Organisation  finalised plans to go to court against the unjust, illegal and partisan government order.																								Critics of the state government said the RG Kar controversy had swung the focus away from the more important issue of the healthcare crisis.

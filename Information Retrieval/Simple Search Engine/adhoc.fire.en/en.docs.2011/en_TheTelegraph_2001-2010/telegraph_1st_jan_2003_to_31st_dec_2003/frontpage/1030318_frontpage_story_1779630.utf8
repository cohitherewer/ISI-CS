The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
Story  More than just a match
- australia or lankA: Can sachin see what others cant? LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sachin Tendulkar lies on the ground while playing volleyball with his teammates at Durban. (AFP) Port Elizabeth, March 17: Come tomorrow and South Africas oldest Test ground, St Georges Park, will host the newest edition of a recent cricket rivalry: Australia versus Sri Lanka.At stake, of course, is a spot in the March 23 World Cup final. Yet, ever since Muttiah Muralidharan got the Darrell Hair treatment, in 1995-96, an Australia-Lanka contest hasnt been about points on the field only. For the Lankans, specially, it has meant much more.Indeed, over the years, our players have produced outstanding performances, acknowledged coach Dav Whatmore, born in Lanka but having worn the famed green baggy. While the champions have a handsome head-to-head lead, the Lankans came off better in two of the biggest matches  the 1996 World Cup final (Lahore) and last Septembers Champions Trophy semifinals (Colombo).However, had India not defeated New Zealand last week, the Lankans would have been home. Im thankful to India, Whatmore told The Telegraph but, grinning, quickly added: At the same time, New Zealand should be thanking us.... If we didnt tie the South Africa game, they wouldnt have made the Super Six.All that, though, is history. And, with Australian coach John Buchanan declining to label his team predominant favourites, a closer finish than most anticipate is on the cards. If anything, Lankas chances have improved with the dependable Damien Martyn out with a fractured right index finger.Martyns injury  which should rule him out of the final as well  makes it three down for Australia. First, Shane Warne went home in disgrace. Then, Jason Gillespie couldnt continue and, now, Martyn. That the Australians have remained unbeaten is a tribute to their character and the quality of their reserve bench.Theres been considerable speculation over the wicket but, for a change, the Australians seemed satisfied. Semifinal No. 1, after all, wont be on the wicket used for the Australia-England and Australia-New Zealand matches. Given Australias record-rewriting run (15 ODI wins in succession), the pressure is appreciably more on them. Predictably, while Whatmore concurred, Buchanan didnt quite agree.We are a better team, he pointed out, while Whatmore maintained: Its a one-off game and so a bad day and Australia will be out. But, yes, theyve been playing breathtaking cricket.In fact, Whatmore took a swipe at those who dont regard Lanka as a powerhouse of cricket. In the coachs opinion, its the perfect opportunity to do much more for the country. He confirmed, then, it would be more than a battle between Sanath Jayasuriya and Brett Lee or Ricky Ponting and Muralidharan.Australia, typically, are sky-high on confidence. So much so, todays nets was optional. Matthew Hayden, who hasnt got as many runs as he should have, is one of those who availed of the option. Speaking exclusively, he declared: For us, the business-end of the World Cup begins now.... Its down to two matches and we intend winning both.Buchanan, at least, is convinced a different Hayden will take guard here. Its cliched, but the first 15 overs  in both innings  will have a huge bearing. As, too, the fielding throughout. The Lankans have often been tardy and, by Whatmores own admission, that can turn a game on its head.Incidentally,  Copyright

Story  Virus bride courts epidemic
- Marriage party quarantined for fear of infection ANAND SOONDAS A nurse with a mask at the Pune hospital. (Reuters) Mumbai, April 22: A Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) patient rushed out of a Pune hospital last evening, got married and came back to the isolation ward, with her brand-new husband and 30 invitees.In a late reaction to the wedding that has put the lives of the groom and the guests  several children among them  at risk, state health minister Digvijay Khanvilkar said he was shocked. It should not have happened.Julie DSilva, her mother Vimla and brother Stanley, who had returned from a trip to Indonesia in time for the wedding, had tested positive for the disease that has spread panic across the world and sent large numbers of people into self-imposed quarantine. The three were isolated in Siddharth Hospital and Khanvilkar, who announced the SARS cases yesterday, had said the wedding was postponed.But the bride rushed to the citys Methodist Church, said her vows with 29-year-old Shailesh Suryavanshi  a tehsildar in Ratnagiri district  and came back to the hospital. The groom and all the guests have also been quarantined now.Doctors in Mumbai are horrified. We are taking this whole thing too damn lightly, said Dr Satish M. Gaekwad, an epidemiologist.

It could not be confirmed if the bride and the groom kissed.Subhash Salunke, director general, public health, said the government was monitoring those who had attended the wedding. He had no explanation why the marriage was allowed. All contacts made by the DSilvas would be traced and put under surveillance, Salunke said.The family returned to India on April 8 and appeared to have interacted with a lot of people since. They spent time with relatives and friends in Ambernath, Thane, and also stayed with a 10-member family in Pune for a few days. Stanley was admitted to hospital on April 17 and his mother and sister followed two days later.Simon Alhat, with whom the DSilvas stayed at their Bibvewadi residence, however, said they are not worried as everyone slept separately.Khanvilkar said a state alert was sounded for the virus last night and a contact-tracing drive had been launched to find out all those who had come in touch with the family. The patients were in an isolation ward and 11 persons who were close to the Ambernath family have been kept in quarantine, he said. Twenty doctors and paramedical staff of the Siddharth Hospital have also been isolated, the minister added. The only silver lining is that the family appears  Copyright

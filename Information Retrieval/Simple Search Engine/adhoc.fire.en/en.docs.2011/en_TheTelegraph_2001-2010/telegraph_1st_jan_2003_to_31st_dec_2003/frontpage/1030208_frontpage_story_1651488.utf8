 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Cape Town, Feb. 7: The flavour of this season, quite clearly, is the World Cup.																								Step out of any airport in South Africa and you cant miss Shaun Pollocks smiling visage. Nor can you miss South African Airways brilliant promo line superimposed on the captain: Dear Polly, well get them here... Its up to you to send them back.																								If that hasnt bowled you over, sample this: We promise some early departures. The backdrop, by the way, is a typical Allan Donald portrait  furiously appealing for one more victim.																								Actually, you cant miss anything. That theres a huge emotional pitch for the South Africans. That the disgraced Hansie Cronje continues to be talked about  reverentially and with disgust, depending on whom you are speaking to. That the after-effects of September 11 are, for the first time, visible in a cricket event.																								Theres much, much more that cant be missed. Indeed, Capetonians are quick to remind, one cant even afford to miss tomorrows opening ceremony, which promises to be ethereal, at bedecked Newlands. The romantic chalets have gone, but the ground has retained its special feel.																								Among others, South African President Thabo Mbeki is going to be present. Also in attendance will be his cricket-loving predecessor, Nelson Mandela.																								Reputations will surely be made, enhanced and marred during the biggest and longest World Cup ever, yet the Ali Bachers are keeping their fingers crossed for the Newlands show. A hiccup-free launch, after all, will set the tone for the eighth edition. The 1996 event, for example, was superbly hosted by the subcontinent, but people still talk about the opening ceremony gaffe.																								First-day-first-show, therefore, is as important for a mega sporting spectacle as it is for the box office.																								The build-up, of course, has been anything but controversy free. The row over the patently absurd Player Terms, Englands reservations over playing in Zimbabwe, New Zealands refusal to play in Nairobi... And, then, whispers about match-fixers targeting the World Cup, though the International Cricket Council believes it has done enough to cleanse the sport.																								Theres also been talk about terrorists striking during the event, especially gunning for the many tourists from the UK. If nothing else, that threat has upped the security a couple of notches. Be it in mufti or formal attire, security personnel seem to be all over breathtaking Cape Town, in any case a favoured tourist destination.																								Obviously, the team hotels and Newlands remain a prime area of concern. Movement is restricted and every vehicle screened  the boot, bonnet, the seats... Never before has cricket seen such a security-centric focus. Incidentally, September 11 not only forced a review, it made Bacher (the World Cups executive director) enhance budgetary allocation appreciably.																								Cricket itself has changed in the four years between the last edition and this. While the match-fixing scandal left ugly marks, off the pitch, there has been a more pronounced surge towards professionalism. Even smaller nations, like Bangladesh, have opted for specialised coaching and consultants.																								If theres one constant, though, its that champions Australia have kept intact their enviable hold on limited overs cricket. Steve Waugh wont be leading them, but Ricky Pontings men have consistently shown just how much they value the green baggy. On form, they will be hard to beat.																								Predictably, the other truly hot side is South Africa. Yet, barring Sri Lanka (a co-host in 1996), no host/co-host has ever won the event. Playing at home can work both ways, but as top gun Herschelle Gibbs pointed out in a signed column, Were ready for the big rumble.																								Only, Donald and Lance Klusener will be praying theres no repeat of the most tragic of all mix-ups, during that 1999 semi-final. Its not insignificant that the chance to make amends, that too at home, is what has kept Donald going.																								On form, not many may root for India. Equally, everybody accepts that, potentially, Sourav Ganguly has a near-unbeatable side. If injuries are avoided and the captain himself fires, at the very top, India can go the distance.																								For a cricketer, theres no bigger stage... Speaking for myself, Im desperate to come out tops... The boys too are hungry, Sourav told The Telegraph, a shade emotionally, promising that yesterdays appalling show (in a warm-up game) wont even remotely be repeated.																								For now, weve got to believe him.

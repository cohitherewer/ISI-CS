Story  CM on assault front foot
  OUR BUREAU May 6: A day after the attack on Union minister Tapan Sikdar by CPM supporters, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee went into an overdrive to deflate criticism.He phoned deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, also overseeing home, and narrated the circumstances that led to the assault and expressed regret.Advani said in Delhi: I expressed my distress and unhappiness to the chief minister. I have asked him to ensure that such incidents do not recur.Free and fair elections have taken place even in states with problems of terrorism, he told Bhattacharjee in an obvious reference to Kashmir.

He said he was himself unhappy about what had happened and promised to take action and bring the culprits to heel, an aide said.Bhattacharjee informed the party that he told Advani: Please do not think we are not sensitive to the situation.

I have no doubt that they will take proper action. The attack on me was instigated by a few local comrades.Sikdar conveyed the same sentiments to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he called from Delhi to enquire after his health. Sikdar will be released from the clinic tomorrow. Sources said the chief minister was very critical of the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police, Basudeb Bag, for failing to protect a Union minister.There was prior information with the SP about Sikdars movement in the area but police arrangements were inadequate. The assault on Sikdar has caused embarrassment to the government, said an official.In Delhi, CPM members of Parliament were privately incensed at the attack. It was a stupid thing to do.

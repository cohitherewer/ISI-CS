 															- Agarkar wipes off five ducks with six wickets LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Ajit Agarkar celebrates after Justin Langers dismissal in Adelaide on Monday. (AFP) Adelaide, Dec. 15: Five  consecutive ducks on the last tour made Ajit Agarkar an  object of ridicule. Nobody, it seemed, could stop laughing  in Australia. Four years on, the Mumbaikar has had the last  laugh: his career-best six for 41 in the second Test has  given Team India the chance to chisel history at the beautiful  Oval.																								Actually, after an extraordinary (almost unbelievable) fourth day, India was 193 runs from taking a 1-0 lead in this four-match series. The theatrics matched Saddam Husseins capture in Tikrit and, now, Sourav Gangulys team has all of six hours and 90 overs to hit the 230 target. That too with every wicket in hand. Not since 1993-1994, against South Africa, has Australia fallen behind at home.																								Dont do anything silly.... Time isnt a factor and, so, get the boys to play their natural game.... Its a big opportunity, was former England captain and a self-confessed India admirer Geoffrey Boycotts advice to Sourav, when they met at the team hotel in the evening.																								The Indians dont need to do anything beyond that. Not after having rallied from 85 for four while responding to Australias 556. Incredibly, despite both teams posting 500-plus in the first innings, one will still be defeated.																								Really, India can only emerge second best if they lose it in the mind. Of course, being on edge somewhat is understandable and the fire alarm at the hotel (around 9.30 pm) couldnt have helped, but...																								Significantly, in almost half-a-century of touring Australia, India has won just three Tests  twice under Bishan Singh Bedi and once with Sunil Gavaskar as captain. The last victory was almost 23 years ago, at the MCG.																								A good many runs remain to be collected, but everybody agrees the odds more than favour India. Even Australian coach John Buchanan acknowledged that and added: Our batting was immature, with the shot-selection leaving much to be desired.																								After forcing a 33-run lead by restricting India to 523, Australia crashed to 196 in under 57 overs. Justin Langer became an Agarkar victim in the third over itself and, thereafter, the wickets didnt stop. There were some good deliveries, great catches and awful shots. Moreover, Souravs field placements were smart.																								However, the captain isnt getting carried away. Our job isnt complete.... The target isnt going to be easy, but we arent lacking in self-belief. What will I be telling the players? Nothing. After all, its time to deliver, Sourav told The Telegraph.																								The wicket has played a few tricks, as Buchanan put it, but batting is unlikely to be the most demanding task of the season. That two double centuries have already been scored suggests the batsmen shouldnt imagine Les Burdett-planted demons will surface.																								Incidentally, the second double centurion, Rahul Dravid (233), has emerged Indias highest single innings scorer overseas. His career-best effort took him past Gavaskars 221 at The Oval, in the summer of 1979.

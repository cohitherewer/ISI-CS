 New Delhi, Aug. 8: Pepsi  has gone to court. So has Coke, but not against an environment  groups finding that its drinks contain pesticide residue  in excess of globally-accepted limits.																								Pepsi today filed a petition in Delhi High Court, seeking to restrain the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) from publishing its report that details the amount of pesticide residue in soft drinks. It also sought a direction from the court to the Union government not to act on the basis of the CSE report.																								We will be happy to see them in court, said Sunita Narain, director of the CSE.																								In Bombay High Court, Coke only challenged the Maharashtra governments confiscation of a huge stock of soft drinks from its Pune plant.																								A Coke official said: We have initiated our legal action.																								The petition challenged an official notice prohibiting sale and distribution of the seized goods.

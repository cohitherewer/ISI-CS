 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Guwahati, Feb. 23: Suspected Ulfa militants today targeted the Indian Air Force for the first time since launching the guerrilla campaign, firing a mortar on the air base at Borjhar on the outskirts of the city.																								Fifteen airmen having dinner at their mess had a narrow escape when the mortar pierced the roof and fell on the verandah before exploding. The incident took place around 8.30 pm.																								The mortar not only caused considerable damage to the building but also dented the confidence of the Congress government, which had been claiming an improvement in law and order since it assumed office. City superintendent of police said the mortar was fired from a range of 1.5 km from the air base. ( )

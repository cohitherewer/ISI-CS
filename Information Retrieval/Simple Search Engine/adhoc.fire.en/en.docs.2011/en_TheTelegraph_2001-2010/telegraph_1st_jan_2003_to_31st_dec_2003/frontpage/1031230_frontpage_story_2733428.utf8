 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Melbourne leaves a pain in the neck
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Melbourne, Dec. 29: Sourav Ganguly, made to wear a neck brace after being hit by a 137 kmph Brad Williams delivery which didnt rise as anticipated, may not take the field tomorrow, the last day of the third Test, when Australia set about achieving a modest target of 95.																								While a scan at the Victoria House Hospital didnt reveal a major injury, the bruise in the right lower skull region is quite visible and the area has turned blue.																								Though its early to say anything definitely, the Team India captain should be fit for the Sydney Test, from January 2.																								For a moment, it seemed I would collapse. But, then, that wouldnt have sent the right signal. However, the pain was such I had to come off, Sourav told The Telegraph. He added: Its not that I took my eyes off the ball. It just didnt climb and I was helpless.																								Sourav, of course, came back to post a courageous and stroke-filled 73 before playing-on Nathan Bracken. He was on 16 when he went off (39 for two) and resumed battle after the dismissals of Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman, with the score 160 for four.																								Yesterday, Steve Waugh had to go off for extensive icing after being struck on the left elbow by Ajit Agarkar. His return, though, wasnt as productive. Clearly, the drop-in wicket at the MCG hasnt been kind to the captains.																								While a somewhat pensive Sourav himself didnt want to talk much about the injury, wife Dona was very concerned. Yet, its a question from her  matha theek aache (your head is okay)?  which relieved the tension growing in the suite.																								Fortunately, I havent taken many blows on the head. Only, this hit me where the helmet ends. Within seconds, I was dizzy, Sourav recalled. In fact, he was speaking while watching the South Africa-West Indies Test in Durban and recoiled on seeing Ramnaresh Sarwan struck (almost identically) by Makhaya Ntini.																								Oh, no... the captain groaned, before switching channels. Having undergone two surgeries (in October), before todays mishap, its been a demanding season  in the mind and physically  for him.																								Sourav, by the way, was wearing a new (Albion) helmet, having discarded the earlier one after being hit by Brett Lee in the first innings. That cracked. In any case, if you get a blow on the helmet, its best to change. Apparently, the mechanism gets disturbed, he explained.																								While the new helmet has been designed differently  more suited, really, for an infantry regiment  theres no basic difference in its utility value. The brand used by Sourav, which is quite popular, is manufactured in Sydney.																								Incidentally, Williams had no regrets. When a batsman is struck, my first reaction is that Im on top. But, yes, I didnt realise Sourav was badly hit, that he needed to go off. I didnt expect that when he took the blow.

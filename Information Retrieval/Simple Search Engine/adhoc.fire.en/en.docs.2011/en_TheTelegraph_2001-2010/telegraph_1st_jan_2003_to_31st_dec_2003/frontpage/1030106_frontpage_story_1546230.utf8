 Monday, January 06, 2003 				 Advance Naga team for talks
 							 - Jamir warns against high expectations NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND PRADEEP PAREEK 																								Kohima/Phek, Jan. 5: A 10-member NSCN (I-M) delegation is headed for New Delhi to assist their leaders, Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, in the next round of negotiations with the Centre. 																								The delegation comprises kilonsers (ministers) and members of the outfits steering committee and ceasefire monitoring cell. The team will be led by A.Z . Jami. The convener of the NSCN (I-M)s ceasefire monitoring cell, Pungthing Shimrang, and its principal secretary, Samson Jajo, are already in New Delhi. 																								With expectations of a breakthrough rising with each passing day, Nagaland chief minister S.C. Jamir today asked the people not to hope for an instant solution. 																								He said the problem of insurgency would remain unless all sections of the Nagas were involved in the peace process. 																								Members of the NSCN (I-M) are, however, sure that the much-awaited breakthrough in peace talks is round the corner. Though our general secretary, who is also the ato kilonser (prime minister) will have one-to-one talks with Prime Minister A. B. Vajpayee, leaders from the home front (Nagaland) will provide inputs, the outfits information and publicity secretary, V. Horam, told The Telegraph. 																								As Muivah and Swu are not expected to venture beyond New Delhi, several senior citizens and Church leaders are planning to meet the duo in the capital.																								Horam said the two NSCN (I-M) leaders would be accompanied by their personal aides and bodyguards. Though it was mutually agreed that the government of India would provide security to our leaders, we will make our own security arrangements for them. 																								As NSCN (I-M) functionaries made plans for their leaders visit, Jamir cautioned against any agreement like the Shillong Accord, saying such a pact would lead to more bloodbath.																								If all factions of the underground unite and bring about a settlement better than the 16-point statehood agreement, we are ready to step down to pave the way for a new political arrangement, he said. 																								The chief minister was speaking at the inauguration of an office at Khuza, 18 km from Phek.																								Jamir claimed it was the Congress that initiated the peace talks and turned the Naga issue into a national one.

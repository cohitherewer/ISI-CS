The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Saturday, July 05, 2003 				 Set-top shelved till September
 SUJAN DUTTA New Delhi, July 4: The  set-top box regime for cable television is being deferred  by around 45 days to September 1.																								But even the pilot of the conditional access system (CAS), information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad  who was sure he will need a set-top box in his house and office from July 15  now cannot say when he will need to instal the equipment that will decode pay channels.																								For August, all cable subscribers in the metros will have to pay not more than Rs 72 (plus taxes) to view all channels. (In Calcutta, consumers will have to pay the existing rates for the rest of July.)																								Prasad was called in to make the formal announcement after spending a full working day in the Prime Ministers Office, during which broadcasters and cable operators brainstormed at a meeting called by trouble-shooter Sudheendra Kulkarni, officer on special duty in the PMO and I amp;B media adviser.																								Both the minister and the PMO officer briefed deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani on the proceedings.																								Prasad said he was happy a consensus had been reached in accordance with the Prime Ministers wishes. The sum of his announcement is: sect;CAS will  not be implemented from July 15. sect;Each  of the four metros will be divided into four zones with  CAS being implemented zone-wise from September 1. A zone  each will be taken up for CAS coverage every month from  September 1, the last being on December 1. Calcutta will  be divided into north, south, central and southeast-southwest. sect;Pay channel  broadcasters will waive their fees for August and for  zones where the CAS coverage does not extend to popularise  set-top boxes. sect;From  July 15-31, broadcasters, multi-system operators (MSOs)  and cable operators will conduct an awareness campaign to  popularise set-top boxes.																								Prasad was largely kept out of todays negotiations, attended by STARs Peter Mukerjea and Sameer Nair, Discoverys Deepak Shourie, Sonys Kunal Dasgupta, ESPNs Manu Sawhney, Zee/Siticables Jawahar Goel, and representatives of MSOs Hathway (Wincable) and the Hinduja-owned Incablenet. The PMO apprised him over phone.																								The Indian and foreign-owned channels were clearly divided with the latter extracting CAS deferment against a promise to waive pay-channel fees till the systems implementation.																								Indian broadcasters such as Aaj Taks G. Krishnan, SABe TVs Markand Adhikari, Sahara TVs Sumit Roy and Eenadu TVs J. Venkat  who were not present at the meeting  denounced the arm-twisting tactics of foreign broadcasters who are keen on deferment of CAS implementation in the country.																								Their public statement said: By submitting to the rollout planthey (politicians) would be opening the Indian airwaves to a foreign invasion.

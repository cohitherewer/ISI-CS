Story  Its just another game, well, not quite
- Sourav warns against dangers of emotion, Waqar talks of maturity before crunch match LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sourav at the nets. (AP) Pretoria, Feb. 28: Sydney. Bangalore. Manchester... Come tomorrow and Sourav Gangulys Team India would like to add Centurion. No Indian side, after all, has lost a World Cup game to Pakistan and this bunch is determined not to blot that record.Yet, not having played each other for 32 months (last was in Dhaka in 2000), and the emotional upswing guaranteed to be high, a conscious effort is being made to stay calm. Despite Shoaib Akhtars provocation of seeking to target all 11 Indians.At the end of the day, its going to be another match.... However, it will be important for both teams not to show much emotion as theres the danger of that being carried off the field, cautioned Sourav, adding: If we keep talking about it as a big game, we will only be inviting pressure on ourselves.And, when somebody drew the Indian captains attention to the Shiv Sena warning, via banners, that his side shouldnt return if they cant beat Pakistan, he countered deftly: Let them do their job, we will do ours.... Were here to do well in the World Cup, not just against one country.In much the same vein, vice-captain Rahul Dravid declared it wasnt the players job to either make statements or gestures for peace. He did add that the team was looking at their final Pool A match as having eight points. Four for winning at the SuperSport Park and four by way of carried-over points, if Pakistan also made the Super Six.Pakistan captain Waqar Younis said: Its another game and, at the same time, not so.... We havent hit form, but hope to do so in what has become such a crunch match. Our dream of regaining the World Cup is alive. Waqar, though, differed on the emotions issue. We are mature players and, then, the Match Referee (Mike Procter) will be around. As for the hype, weve got no control.Waqar will have one eye on the weather. There was a half-hour downpour in neighbouring Centurion this afternoon, sinking Pakistans plans for a workout, and cloudy conditions have been forecast for the morrow.An Indian victory will confirm a Super Six berth, while Pakistan needs the four points to stay in contention for the next stage. The do-or-die effort, then, has to come from the Pakistanis. Their form has been indifferent but, as Sourav pointed out, they can blow hot and cold and he wouldnt like to be caught at the wrong end. Pakistan, perhaps, is most dangerous when cornered. Only, Waqar is no Imran Khan and Wasim Akram is 11 years older. Its another matter that tomorrow could be the last chance for quite a few (Akram included) to make an impression. So somebody may produce the innings or spell of his life. As its going to be a needle match, theres a good chance that veteran Anil Kumble will replace Harbhajan Singh. The experience of 240 ODIs carries its own weight  and, it isnt excess baggage.Not that there has been a slip-up in security but, given the nature of Indo-Pak games, the fine-tuning will definitely be more. The Security Directorate is in regular touch with the police and Im confident nothing untoward will happen, Dr Ali Bacher, executive director of the World Cup, told The Telegraph.Usually,  Copyright

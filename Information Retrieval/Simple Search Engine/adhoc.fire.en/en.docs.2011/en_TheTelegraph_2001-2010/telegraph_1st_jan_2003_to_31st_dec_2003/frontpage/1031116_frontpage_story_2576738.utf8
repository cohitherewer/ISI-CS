 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Nov. 15: A galaxy of NDA and BJP bigwigs today played to the gallery and doled out gifts for the state during the third birthday celebrations of Jharkhand at Morahbadi Ground.																								Having fulfilled his commitment to give 32,000 jobs on the third foundation day, chief minister Arjun Munda promised to fill up the remaining vacancies by August next year. Munda also announced the governments decision to end the unaided education policy in the state and promised to complete panchayat elections by February next year.																								Railway minister Nitish Kumar conducted the online inauguration of the Ranchi-Yeshwantpur (Bangalore) Express, the Ranchi Model Railway Station, eight new counters at Ranchi station and two road overbridges at Kadru and Dibdih. 																								He said he had fulfilled last years promise. Direct trains to Mumbai and Bangalore have started, while the Tapeswani Express has been extended to Hatia. We have decided to electrify the new railway tracks between Ranchi and Koderma. We will make Jharkhand the state with maximum electrified tracks, he said. Rajdhani will run twice a week from December 19, he added.																								Minister of state for civil aviation Rajiv Pratap Rudy gifted Rs 50 crore for extension of the Ranchi airport and construction of a new building, apron and passenger amenities.

If you (rebels) have any ideology, compete with politicians by fighting an election instead of resorting to violence. Ballot is better than bullet, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 Players sign with protective gear on
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Jan. 10: Although all 15 selected for the World Cup conditionally signed the Player Terms today, the document will only be forwarded to the International Cricket Council (ICC) once the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is sure of where Sourav Ganguly and Co. stand.																								In the context of the present standoff, merely signing the terms doesnt have much value. The BCCI wont part with the document till it is convinced that this conditional exercise will hold good (legally) and, secondly, the players wont get compromised, a source said.																								The source added: For administrative reasons, it was important for the BCCI to physically have the signed document before the January 14 deadline.																								[An agency report from Auckland quoted Sourav as saying after the signing: We have made it clear that this is what we can do and this is what we cant It now depends on them (the ICC) to come to a solution There has got to be an adjustment from both sides  we have been ready and I hope the ICC is ready as well.]																								The BCCI is likely to issue a formal statement tomorrow, but the adjustment Sourav spoke about cannot be any different from what is already known: No conflicting advertising during the tournament (February 8March 25, inclusive of the two reserve days for the final) and the use of player images for two months till after the final.																								To keep its commercial partners happy, the ICC has been insisting on imaging rights for three months and the no-conflicting-endorsements restriction to be effective from 30 days before the World Cup till five days (20 for the finalists) after the title clash. The 30daysbefore bit is mystifying as players can sign till January 14, just 25 days before the tournament.																								To return to todays signing, questions are bound to be raised whether such conditional putting of pen to paper  specially when time and money are central to the agreement  can hold in law. If not, the Auckland exercise is meaningless. Perhaps, the BCCI will clarify this quickly.																								While the terms for Septembers Champions Trophy werent strictly redrafted, Sourav and Co. signed after the I CC made India-specific concessions. To clear any ambiguity, a clause on ambush marketing was added.																								The scenario now is different.

 Monday, August 04, 2003 				 Hansie Cronje murder theory
																								London, Aug. 3 (PTI): Disgraced South Africa captain Hansie Cronje, killed in a plane crash last year, might have been murdered, a news report claimed today. 																								Cronje, who was banned from cricket after admitting to match-fixing three years ago, might have been killed to make sure the complete truth behind the scandal never came out, the Observer website reported. 																								A lot of people wanted Cronje dead, an investigator close to the case was quoted as saying. They feared that he would one day tell the full truth, and then many more would be implicated.																								I understand police have found evidence of sabotage, but theyre reluctant to go public on this, he added.

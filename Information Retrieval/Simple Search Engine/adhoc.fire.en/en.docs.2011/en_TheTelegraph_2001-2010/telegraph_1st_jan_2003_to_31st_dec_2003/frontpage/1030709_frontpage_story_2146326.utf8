 Wednesday, July 09, 2003 				 Meru does what Rio could not
 RAJEEV BHATTACHARYYA AMP; NISHIT DHOLABHAI																								New Delhi/Kohima, July 8: After blocking Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rios peace mission to Bangkok, the Centre has finally allowed state tourism and land revenue minister Vatsu Meru to travel to the Thai capital to meet the NSCN (I-M) leadership. 																								Meru is likely to have a consultative meeting with the Naga leaders ahead of the next round of talks between the Centre and the NSCN (I-M) from July 15. 																								Rios proposed Bangkok date was cancelled last week, a day after he announced that the Union home ministry had cleared the trip. The NSCN (I-M) accused the PMO of scuttling the move. It would have allowed the state government to directly participate in the peace talks. 																								Meru, who left for the Thai capital yesterday, will try to salvage the setback caused by the cancellation of the chief ministers visit, a source said. 																								NSCN (I-M) deputy information kilonser (minister) Karaiba Chawang said Merus meeting with the outfits collective leaders  Isak Chisi Swu and Th. Muivah  would be consultative in nature. 																								He said the discussions would centre on issues pertaining to reconciliation of various warring Naga militant groups. 																								He, however, insisted that the state governments role in the peace process would remain that of a facilitator. 																								Meru, during his meeting with the militant leaders, is likely to highlight the initiatives taken by the state government for fostering unity among the various militant groups. 																								The reconciliation moves of the Naga Hoho had suffered a setback recently when the NSCN (I-M) refused to co-operate with its reconciliation commission, questioning the integrity and impartiality of some members of the panel. 																								Meru was entrusted with the role of the state governments emissary since he is non-controversial and low profile. His visit would not attract as much media attention as Rios would have, sources in Nagaland said. 																								The next round of talks between the Centre and the NSCN (I-M) is crucial in terms of the issues that are likely to come up for discussion. 																								Matters should be expedited as there has been a tendency to delay over trivial issues that can be settled with ease. The sooner theres a solution the better for the state, Rio said. 																								He emphasised two points that could hasten the peace process  the appointment of a political emissary and charting a blueprint for the integration of all Naga-inhabited areas into a single administrative unit. 																								The ceasefire with the NSCN (I-M) expires on July 31. Rio, during his visit to the capital, said the three conditions laid down by the outfit for the extension have been amicably resolved. 																								One of the conditions, he said, was withdrawal of the Disturbed Areas Act, which the group views as being incompatible with the ceasefire. 																								The Disturbed Areas Act and the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, if they are not allowed to lapse, could send a wrong message. These are contradictory to the peace process, Nagaland home minister T.M. Lotha said.

 Wednesday, July 02, 2003 				 Visa hope for Lahore bus 
 prospective travellers at the Ambedkar  Terminal in New Delhi. AFP picture																								New Delhi, July 1: Pakistan has granted visas to seven Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) drivers, but is yet to respond to Indias proposal to start the Delhi-Lahore bus service from July 11.  Already, prospective travellers  have flooded the DTC office with enquiries about the service.  The neighbours had agreed in principle  to resume the service from today, but some technicalities,  including non-availability of visas, delayed resumption,  DTC officials said. The two countries are now focusing on  July 11, in the hope that all formalities would be completed  by then.

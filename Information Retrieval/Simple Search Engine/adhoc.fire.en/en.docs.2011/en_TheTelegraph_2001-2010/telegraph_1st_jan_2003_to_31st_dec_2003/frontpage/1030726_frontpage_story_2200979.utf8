 Saturday, July 26, 2003 				 Varsity relents, students dont
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, July 25: Ranchi University today came half way to meet the demand of agitating final-year post-graduate students to postpone final examinations to November.																								The varsity deferred the date by a fortnight from September 5 to 20. This was decided at a meeting of post-graduate heads of departments, presided over by vice-chancellor S.S. Kushwaha.																								The students of final-year MA, MSc and MCom, however, were in no mood to relent on their demand for a November schedule.																								The protest was sparked after the varsity announced exams for September, cutting short the academic session by three months, in a bid to regularise the session. The session had a delayed start in July though the results for first-year finals were declared in April.																								A group of agitating students said today they would continue with their protest till the varsity relented to a November schedule. About 50 of them had protested at the university headquarters yesterday, demanding the rescheduling.																								Kushwaha, however, was firm that it is not possible (to reconsider exam date), for it will invite a number of complications in our academic calendar.																								Asked how the 15-day deferment would help students cover the syllabi, Kushwaha said: Students had misrepresented their case yesterday. Heads of most of the departments today informed that theory part of the syllabi had been completed and whatever remained would be completed within two-and-a-half months.																								Heads have also confirmed that classes for most of the subjects had started as early as March and April. Only science students may have problems and that too with practical papers. However, heads have assured they would take care of the practical papers after examination for theory papers were over.																								A student countered Kushwahas claim. One or two departments would have started classes in March and April, but when examination dates are announced, each subject is to be taken into consideration. Even if we take the V-Cs claim to be true, let the post-graduate heads honestly tell how many classes had been conducted and what happened to summer vacation and other holidays?																								A department head concurred with the students contention: But the fact remains that entire courses of study could not be completed within short span of time.

 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: Are you irritated by the noise on your fixed line when the mobile phone rings nearby? Relax, it will end soon.																								The department of telecommunications (DoT) has directed all manufacturers of electronic push-button telephones to make changes in the instrument to cut the noise. A directive sent to all handset manufacturers also directs them to upgrade the existing instruments through their retail outlets.																								Following a series of complaints from consumers, DoT had asked the Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC) to examine the issue.																								We were asked to examine all the parameters before allowing an instrument to be cleared by us to be procured by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. It was found that an electromagnetic interference was creating this disturbance and this could be plugged using a small semiconductor chip, said a senior officer of the TEC.																								The report has been sent to DoT and they have informed the manufacturers. Henceforth, any new fixed-line telephone instrument installed by BSNL and MTNL should not have any interference problem, said the official.																								However, if you have purchased an instrument from the market and installed it on your own, you may have to approach the manufacturer or dealer to rectify it.																								Y.S. Choudhury, managing director of Exicom that makes phones, said: The disturbance is to do more with interior circuit design and the directives will be complied with.																								There are no foreign manufacturers whose telephones meet the TEC parameters.

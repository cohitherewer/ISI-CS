 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Vaiko dumps Vajpayee
																								Chennai, Dec. 29: Vaikos MDMK today pulled out of the BJP-led coalition at the Centre, robbing A.B. Vajpayee of another Dravidian ally.																								Parroting the DMK, which had walked out of the coalition a little over a week ago, the MDMK cited the BJPs subtle attempts at a rapprochement with Jayalalithaa as one of the reasons for the pullout.																								Another factor was the Centres indifference to the prolonged incarceration of Vaiko by the Tamil Nadu government under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. 																								He was arrested in July last year for openly supporting the banned LTTE at a public meeting near Madurai.

 Tuesday, November 18, 2003 				 Poster threat to vocal minister
 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA																								Ranchi, Nov. 17: Posters threatening to eliminate industry minister Ravindra Kumar Rai have prompted the ministry to request the home department to beef up security.																								The special branch confirmed that suspected Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) activists have stuck handwritten posters in remote areas of Giridh, especially in Tisri block, claiming that their efforts to eliminate former chief minister Babulal Marandi and the industry minister will be intensified further.																								They have also threatened the Tisri police station officer- in-charge and others who accompany Marandi and Rai during their tours to the area with dire consequences.																								The two leaders had recently told a public meeting in Teesri that the rebels will have no place to hide even in the dense forests, if the people became aware of their rights and duties.																								Sources said the extremists have held a series of meetings in different parts of Giridih during the last few days. They have resolved to teach the residents of certain villages, who have been participating in Marandis public functions, a lesson. Rai has been accompanying Marandi to almost all the programmes.																								Although police pickets have been posted in the sensitive villages, you never know their real strategy, an officer said.																								Industry minister Rai regretted that most public representatives rarely speak out against the rebels. I have always been on the hit list because I opposed their activities even much before I became an MLA, he said.

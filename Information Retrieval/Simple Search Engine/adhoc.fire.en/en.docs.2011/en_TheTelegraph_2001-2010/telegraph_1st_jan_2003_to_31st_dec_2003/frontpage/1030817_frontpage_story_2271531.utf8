 Sunday, August 17, 2003 				 Petrol pump strike
																								Calcutta, Aug. 16: The West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association has called a 72-hour strike from August 27 in protest against imposition of sales tax by the state government and lack of security.																								Association president Jaydeb Sarkar today said all 1,850 petrol pumps in the state will remain closed for three days. The decision is unfortunate but we cant help it. We placed our charter of demands in front of the government but nothing has been done so far, he added.																								Besides petrol pumps remaining dry for three days, another ordeal awaits commuters. Private buses, mini buses and taxis have called a three-day strike beginning August 26 in protest against a hike in motor vehicles taxes.

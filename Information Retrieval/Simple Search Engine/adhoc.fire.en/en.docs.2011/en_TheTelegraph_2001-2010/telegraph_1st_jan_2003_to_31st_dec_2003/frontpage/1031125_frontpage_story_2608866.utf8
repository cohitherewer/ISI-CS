 Tuesday, November 25, 2003 				 Laloo lash for backlash theory
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Guwahati, Nov. 24: Barely a few hours after RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav arrived in Assam on a goodwill mission, police today recovered three more bodies of Bihari persons from violence-racked Tinsukia district.																								Tinsukia police said the three persons  identified as Rajdeo Yadav (65), Suraj Yadav (55) and Prakash Yadav (30)  were missing since Friday. Their bodies were recovered from the Talap area.																								Even as the toll in the ethnic flare-up continued to rise, Laloo Prasad today rejected the saffron brigades theory that the present unrest in Bihar and Assam were engineered by Bangladesh and the ISI. He, however, blamed the BJP and the Shiv Sena for the unrest.																								Laloo Prasads accusation came a couple of hours after RSS chief S. Sudarshan claimed that the attacks on Biharis by Ulfa were engineered by the ISI, which he said, unfolded a nefarious design under which space vacated by Bihari Hindus is sought to be occupied by Bangladeshi infiltrators. 																								Central minister C.P. Thakur also dubbed the present unrest as a part of big game engineered by Ulfa backed by Bangladesh. 																								The RJD chief, however, refused to buy the theory and accused the NDA government and the RSS of putting the blame on the ISI to cover up their own failures and misdeeds. 																								Whenever something happens in the country, the government passes the buck to the ISI and Pakistan. If the ISI has succeeded in carrying such activities then whose failure it is? What were the intelligence agencies doing? Laloo Prasad asked. 																								He claimed that attacks on railway passengers from Assam and other Northeastern states were carried out by Shiv Sainiks. He said the attack on Assam Bhavan in the capital was carried out Bihar MP Pappu Yadav, who is an ally of the ruling NDA. In Maharashtra also, Shiv Sainiks had attacked Biharis over the issue of railway recruitment issue, he said.																								The former Bihar chief minster also came to the aid of the Congress government in the state and joined chief minister Tarun Gogoi in flaying New Delhi for not providing adequate forces to deal effectively with the prevailing situation. 																								The nine-member parliamentary delegation led by Laloo Yadav held discussions with Gogoi at his residence.

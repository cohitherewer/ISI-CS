 Wednesday, April 09, 2003 				 Formidable way to protest
																								If French fries can become freedom fries, its OK to replace okay with formidable. Or is it?																								Ja, say German linguists who have called on fellow Germans to use French words in place of their popular English equivalents to protest the war, the British Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.																								A campaign launched by the group, Language in Politics, proposed swapping English words such as ticket with billet or briefing with communiqu.																								English words and phrases are increasingly used by Germans who value the languages efficiency. 																								Among the words proposed to be pushed aside in favour of French are driver for chauffeur, playboy for bon vivant and  guess what  okay for formidable. 																								If formidable as a substitute for okay sounds distinctively un-okay, what do you make of Americans renaming French fries as freedom fries when French fries are really Belgian?																								No one has yet talked of renaming or replacing French leave or French kiss.

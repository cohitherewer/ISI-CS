 Saturday, August 30, 2003 				 Hospital under Writers reign
 															- Bureaucratic rules take precedence over health norms SUNANDO SARKAR Calcutta, Aug. 29: A year  ago, a red-faced Bengal government  exposed to a renewed  cycle of health-sector blues by the multiple deaths at the  B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital for Children  tried to shut  the hospital from inside, seeking to prevent a peek into  the conditions there.																								A year later, the administration has made B.C. Roy look more like an extension of Writers Buildings. Archaic rules rule over health-care logic and one-year-olds are made to share beds with 10-year-olds even as other (paying) beds lie vacant, waiting for the odd kid whose parents are willing to pay for a stay in the states only paediatric referral hospital.																								The Writers look-alike features extend beyond the rules are rules stance. Most of the promises made by the government to the beleaguered hospital last year remain on paper; and one remains on a vacant plot on the hospital campus, where an annexe was to be built.																								Officials say the negative publicity the hospital received last year is responsible for the half-empty state of the lone paying ward (No. 11). They admit that on most days, the occupancy is about 50 per cent.																								But those who do not have the money to go to private nursing homes still fill up the other eight free-bed wards. And these wards still have something seen last year and which the government promised would not occur again: two babies  and their two mothers  sharing a three-foot-wide hospital cot.																								Officials, however, say they cannot do the most logical thing  shift some of the vacant beds in the paying ward to the cramped free wards  because of rules. Who is going to risk doing this revolutionary act which, in a less bureaucratic set-up, would be the most natural thing to do? a doctor working in the hospital asked. 																								A health-care institute has been usurped by the bureaucracy, making this hospital appear like Writers Buildings, he regretted.																								Rules, however, do not prevent the administration from doing something far more insidious: asking a one-year-old to share a bed with a 10-year-old, and both their mothers.																								Infants are always susceptible to infections as they do not have the immunity of older children, a doctor said. What this hospital does is criminal, he admitted, adding that doctors tried  as far as possible  to keep apart children with a double-digit gap between their ages. 																								But this is easier said than done and a nine-year gap is as undesirable as 11 years between two children sharing a bed, he said.																								The government, however, has made some changes for the better. An X-ray machine arrived last year but, already, the pictures it gives are blurred, say technicians. An ultrasonography machine, too, has been arranged from SSKM Hospital; but the cash-strapped government has not been able to appoint a trained technician.																								Results of investigations done by both machines, therefore, are not very reliable, an official said.																								There is no CT scan machine yet. So, a four-year-old girl (Priyanki Ghosh from Debagram in Nadia) had to be physically carried by her father to Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday, when there was a transport strike.																								The list of nos remain as long as last years  there is no ventilator, no working incubator, no blood-gas analyser. But there has been one change for the better. Piped oxygen is now a reality but the valves, installed a year ago, connecting the pipe to some of the beds are already missing.

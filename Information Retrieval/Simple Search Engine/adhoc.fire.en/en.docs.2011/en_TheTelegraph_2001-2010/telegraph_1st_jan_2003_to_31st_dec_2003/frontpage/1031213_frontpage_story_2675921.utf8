 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Iraq bill fudge cloud 
																								Washington, Dec. 12: An auditor has found that US defence conglomerate Halliburton overcharged the Pentagon by at least $61 million for fuel supplied to Iraq since the war.																								Halliburton was earlier headed by Vice-President Dick Cheney and it was awarded Iraqi contracts worth several billion dollars without competitive bidding soon after the war.																								The disclosure came as the White House tried to defuse a growing tide of criticism over its decision to ban countries like India from contracts in Iraq. Pentagon auditors also revealed  that Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root submitted  a proposal for cafeteria services in Iraq inflated by a  whopping $67 million. But the mismatch was discovered and  the proposal rejected.

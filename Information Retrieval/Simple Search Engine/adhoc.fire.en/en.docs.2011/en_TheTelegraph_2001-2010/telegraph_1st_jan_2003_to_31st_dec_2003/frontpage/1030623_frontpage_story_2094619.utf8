We took a ball along and told him (Sandip) we were not getting into the pool, Mithilesh said.Sandip was bent on taking a bath and went wrapped in a gamchha. Once at College Square, he got in while his friends played football on the path around the pool. But unlike many others who ventured far out, Sandip stuck to the pools edge.A few minutes into their game, Sandips friends saw the policemen approaching. Hey there, get moving, the policemen shouted, waving their sticks.All of us, who were playing on the edge of the pool, had no difficulty in evading the police cane, Mithilesh said. Even those who were swimming clambered up the edge of the pool far from the cops but we could see that Sandip, who did not know how to swim, was moving away towards the middle.The boy apparently panicked on seeing the men in uniform.When the police left after a few minutes, Sandips friends returned to see his body, without the wraparound towel, floating in the pool. His friends saw what happened, Pushpalata wailed as neighbours and relatives tried to console her.A relative, Gopal Panda, asked: How can we go against all the accounts which corroborate each other? He was referring to the descriptions of the event given by Sandips friends and onlookers at the pool.Ravi said: Our men were on a routine drive to keep the pool free of unwanted elements. They went there after the mishap and left as the body was still to float up.Ravi said Sandips death was an accident, with which the police had nothing to do.  Copyright

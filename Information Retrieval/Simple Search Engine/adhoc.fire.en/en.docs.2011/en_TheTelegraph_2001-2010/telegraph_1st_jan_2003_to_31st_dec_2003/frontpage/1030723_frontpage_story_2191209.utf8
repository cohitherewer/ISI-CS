 Wednesday, July 23, 2003 				 Kalyan offers to expose Advani 
 															- Ex-CM says he was told to wait for kar sevaks to finish  YOGESH VAJPEYI Kalyan, Advani:  Phone trouble  Lucknow, July 22: Former  Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh today confirmed  that L.K. Advani had telephoned him from Ayodhya when Babri  Masjid was being demolished and asked him not to resign  till the kar sevaks had finished the job.																								I am prepared to come clean and tell everything if the special court in Rae Bareli summons me, said Singh, who has of late repeatedly accused the deputy Prime Minister and other top Sangh parivar leaders of conspiring to demolish the structure.																								Singh scoffed at Union law minister Arun Jaitleys contention that the CBI did not include the offence of criminal conspiracy in the supplementary chargesheet submitted in the Rae Bareli court on May 31 this year because it did not figure in the original one. The original chargesheet was filed by the state CID in 1993.																								He said the CID chargesheet was based on incomplete investigation and the CBI itself had sought the courts permission for further probe before subsequently charging Advani and the others with hatching a criminal conspiracy to demolish the mosque.																								Is the CBI now trying to belie evidence unearthed during its own investigation and give more credence to the CIDs incomplete investigation? Singh asked. He added that there was no bar on any law enforcement agency supplementing an earlier chargesheet if it dug up fresh evidence.																								This is not the first time the former chief minister has spoken out against Advani and other Sangh leaders. But legal experts say the confirmation of his telephone conversation with Advani is likely to add to the CBIs embarrassment following accusations that the bureau dropped charges of criminal conspiracy against Advani, M.M. Joshi, Ashok Singhal, Giriraj Kishore, Uma Bharti and other leaders in its May 31 chargesheet.																								In the joint chargesheet filed against Advani and the others in the Lucknow court in 1997, the CBI had specifically referred to the deputy Prime Ministers telephone conversation with Singh as proof of the conspiracy.																								The CBI had quoted Advani as saying aaj kar seva ka akhiri din hai, kar sevak aj akhiri bar seva karenge (today is the last day of kar seva, the kar sevaks will finish the work today) on the morning of the demolition. The investigation also disclosed that as and when the demolition was in progress, L.K. Advani, in fact, advised the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Kalyan Singh not to tender his resignation till the structure was completely demolished, the bureau had added.																								The state BJP said Singh was among the 21 discharged by the Lucknow court after Allahabad High Court held that it was not competent to try case 198 against Advani and the others due to a defect in the state governments notification.																								But Singhs stand could prove damaging. The CBI has now gone to the high court challenging the discharge. The issue is to come up before its Lucknow bench on August 5.																								In the high court, the CBI has consistently stood by the conspiracy theory. If it changes its stand now, this is bound to affect its reputation for fair play and impartiality, legal experts say.

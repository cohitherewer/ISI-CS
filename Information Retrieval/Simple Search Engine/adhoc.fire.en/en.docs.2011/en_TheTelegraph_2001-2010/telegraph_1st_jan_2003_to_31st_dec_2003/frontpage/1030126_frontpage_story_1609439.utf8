 JAHANSHER FIROZE 																								Dimapur, Jan. 25: With the Nagaland poll scene hotting up, the NSCN(K) has accused its rival, the NSCN (Isak-Muivah), of issuing death threats to non-Nagaland Peoples Front candidates, particularly those belonging to the ruling Congress. 																								The NSCN(K)s home secretary Hokato Vushe told The Telegraph: At least seven Congress candidates around Dimapur had been telephoned by a deputy kilonser (minister) of the NSCN(I-M) on January 22 and 23, who warned them of dire consequences if they did not quit the Congress and join the NPF. They were warned that their hands and legs would be smashed if they contest for the Congress  meaning death. 																								The outfit has also warned prospective candidates of other parties like the Nationalist Democratic Movement (NDM), he said.																								According to Vushe, the deputy kilonser has promised his total support to Congress candidates who join the NPF, an offshoot of the states oldest Opposition party  the United Democratic Front. Nagaland goes to the polls along with Tripura and Meghalya on February 26.																								When contacted, a senior intelligence source said such charges should not be taken at face value. The NSCN(I-M) rejected the allegations as baseless. 																								V. Horam, deputy kilonser of the parallel government run by the NSCN(I-M), told The Telegraph: Probably the people have decided to instal a government supportive to the ongoing peace process. Everyone knows that the present state government has not been supporting the peace process. When people have decided, then why should we bother threatenting the people and candidates. This is baseless. We have decided to stay away from the polls this time. 																								Horam alleged that the NCSN(K) was so concerned about the Congress that it had started reacting even before the party. They have already started canvassing for it, he added. 																								Vushe, also a member in the joint Centre-NSCN(K) Ceasefire Supervisory Board, said political talks with New Delhi could begin by August-September. But this will depend on the overall situation and the decision of our apex collective leadership and the council of kilonsers, who are congregating somewhere in Eastern Nagaland (Naga territory in South-West Myanmar) for a crucial conclave to discuss all important issues. The outcome of the meet will be known in February, he said. 																								Asked if the talks would take place in Delhi, he replied: No. It is likely to be held in Kohima, Mon or Mokokchung  very much in Nagaland. 																								Ibobi happy																								Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh today described the trip of the all-party delegation to Delhi on Manipurs territorial integrity as a successful mission, our Imphal correspondent adds.

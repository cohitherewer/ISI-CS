 Tuesday, March 04, 2003 				 Rollback cry to greet Jaswant
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 3: The BJP parliamentary party will ask finance minister Jaswant Singh to reconsider the hike in urea and fertiliser prices at its meeting tomorrow.																								Almost every sector has benefited from the budget except farmers. The message has not gone down well with our rural voters, said a member from Madhya Pradesh, where polls will be held in November.																								If a rollback is not possible, BJP sources said the party has thought of two proposals. First, the benefit of the fertiliser subsidy should go directly to farmers and not the manufacturers as is the case now.																								The other face-saver is for the government to pay a subsidy directly to the farmer to meet the gap, if any, between the price at which he sells his crop in the market and the official procurement price.																								A market-driven relationship is the most viable solution, the sources said.

																								Calcutta, April 9: The first suspected SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) patient landed at the city airport this evening and, after a brief examination, was whisked off to the Beliaghata infectious diseases hospital, says a staff reporter. 																								After a flight from Bangkok landed, officials spotted a young man with a toxic look wheezing and coughing intermittently as he walked towards the newly-opened health counter at the airport. He was taken to an isolated enclosure where doctors examined him and agreed he had all the symptoms.

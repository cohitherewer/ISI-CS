 Tuesday, April 29, 2003 				 Big brother comes to sisters aid
 															- Prime Minister visits cancer patient in hometown Gwalior, gets her airlifted to AIIMS RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Atal Bihari Vajpayee comes out of the hospital in Gwalior on Monday. (PTI)  Gwalior, April 28: For  today, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was Big Brother first and Prime  Minister next.																								Informed last night that his younger sister Urmila Mishra was not in very good condition, Vajpayee dashed here this afternoon and had her airlifted to the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences.																								Seventy-two-year-old Urmila is suffering from breast cancer, diabetes and hypertension. She was being treated at the local Jayarogya Hospital.																								Official sources said her son Anoop called up Vajpayee last night and told him she was not keeping very good health. The Prime Minister is believed to have immediately decided to fly to Gwalior, a couple of AIIMS doctors in tow, and shift Urmila to Delhi for better treatment and medical facilities.																								After touching down around 2 pm, Vajpayee  looking grim and worried  drove straight to the Jayarogya hospital, where Urmila was in the intensive care unit. He stayed there for an hour and 45 minutes, supervising matters as the Delhi doctors took a look at his sister.																								The three Gwalior doctors  P.C. Mathur, P.K. Jain and Puneet Rastogi  who had been attending to Urmila said there was no reason for panic as her condition was stable.																								But the creases on Vajpayees forehead told a different tale. Looking as helpless as any relative of a cancer patient, he came out to greet the media before leaving, but refused to take questions. Anoop  a BJP legislator  said he was too distressed to talk politics.																								For friends and acquaintances, Vajpayees concern for his family  living in Sindhi Colony  is nothing new. Although termed a loner in Delhis political and social circuits, Vajpayee has regularly taken time off his pressing schedule to renew links with his family.																								Sources said Vajpayee has rarely skipped the Gwalior trade fair or stayed away during Raksha Bandhan. Some family members recalled how he gave them pocket money and gorged on chaat from a particular vendor.																								Before he became Prime Minister in 1998, Vajpayee used to spend a lot of time with his family  comprising almost 55 members  at his ancestral home in Shinde ki Chavni. He is also believed to have prepared special meals and recited his favourite poems at family get-togethers in winter.

 Sunday, February 09, 2003 				 Fresh row erupts on border
 PROBIR PRAMANIK																								Siliguri, Feb. 8: The Border Security Force today foiled an attempt by Bangladesh Rifles to push in about 500 Bangladeshis into India at the Baro Madhusudhan border outpost at Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar district.																								Around noon, villagers and BSF personnel at the outpost spotted the BDR herding a large number of people across the India-Bangladesh border. Around 2.30 pm, the BDR tried to chase the Bangladeshi nationals into India, BSF additional deputy inspector general Prem Prakash Gupta said.																								Tension ran high when the BSF tried to push the infiltrators back and the BDR protested, claiming they were Indian nationals. The situation almost reached a face-off with both the forces trying to push back the would-be infiltrators, Gupta, who rushed to the spot, said.																								The group remained stranded on no mans land, in a replay of the Satgachhi incident involving 213 snake-charmers, as the standoff continued for over five hours. It was resolved after a commandant-level flag meeting between the two forces. The BDR agreed to take back the group after the meeting, Gupta said.

 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Sourav ahead on Sachin request
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Melbourne, Dec. 28: Australias captain-designate Ricky Ponting today became the first to score back-to-back double hundreds against India, but the talking point at the MCG was Sachin Tendulkars decision to drop down the order.																								In arrears by as many as 192, India had to face 11 overs before stumps. Given that anything could happen in that brief high-pressure session, the short-on-runs Sachin informed the captain, Sourav Ganguly, that he wouldnt like to bat at his customary No. 4 if two wickets fell before the third day was over.																								That many did fall and, so, out walked Sourav himself. Look, Sachin had a reasonable point.... He hasnt been striking the ball well and, with good reasons, didnt want to take guard with only a few overs in hand. That was fine with me and I decided to move up from No. 5, Sourav told The Telegraph.																								Whatever, he has yet another chance to lead from the front as Indias 1-0 lead now appears tenuous.																								Despite his awesome reputation, thus far in the series, Sachin has just managed 0 (Brisbane), 1 and 37 (Adelaide) and 0 in the first innings here. Some, perhaps, will be critical about his having to be protected, but no team operates in a vacuum. Moreover, the horses-for-courses theory is applicable everywhere.																								Still, the move showed a diffident Sachin and surprised the Australians too. 																								Im not saying whether that decision is right or wrong, but it probably wouldnt have happened in our team... Having said that, I can understand Sachin is under a lot of pressure, observed Ponting.																								He added, tongue-in-cheek: Weve got to get him at some point or the other.... It would have been nice if that was achieved this evening itself. Incidentally, its been a poor 12 months of Test cricket for Sachin and the second innings will be his sole opportunity to regain some of the sheen before 2003 becomes history.																								Of course, if Sachin does fire, India may quickly get out of a seemingly losing position.																								Replying to Indias 366, Australia reached a staggering 558  thanks largely to Pontings career-best 257  and, then, evicted openers Akash Chopra and Virender Sehwag.																								Chopra, however, was more a victim of David Shepherds incompetence. 																								Its time he put in his papers.

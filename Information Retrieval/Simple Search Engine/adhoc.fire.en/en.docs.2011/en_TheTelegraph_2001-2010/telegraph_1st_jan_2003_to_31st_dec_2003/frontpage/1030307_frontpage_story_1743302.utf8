 Friday, March 07, 2003 				 Kenya, handle with care
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 GET IT RIGHT: Sachin with Sehwag in Cape Town on Thursday. (Reuters)																								Cape Town, March 6: The World Cup 2003 format is such that Kenya could make the semi-finals without winning even a single Super Six game  assuming, of course, that New Zealand and Zimbabwe both lose two of their three matches. 																								Sounds bizarre, but with 10 carried-over points (from the league stage), Kenya actually take to the Super Six with a muscular look. Reason enough for India to treat tomorrows game with care. Indias carried-over total is eight. 																								Its an all-gain situation for Kenya and, so, we cant afford to take them lightly. Doing so will be a big mistake, acknowledged Sourav Ganguly, the Indian captain. In any case, the Kenyans  currently coached by the debonair Sandeep Patil  have upset India twice in recent years. 																								Patil, who has ensured his team has enough candies for player-turned-commentator Navjyot Singh Sidhu to lick, is looking at adding to the statement already made. Talking to The Telegraph this morning, Patil said: Be it Holland, Namibia or Canada, all are delighted that weve made a statement on their behalf as well... That weve proved a point. 																								Yet, Patil (Indias coach for six months in 1996) is aware of the big ask that lies ahead. We would like to take that half-step forward, but the Indians pack too many guns... That weve beaten the 1996 champions (Sri Lanka) has upped our confidence, but... 																								The presence of that doyen among coaches, Bob Woolmer, at the morning nets must have enhanced the Kenyans confidence. A Capetonian for a number of years, Woolmer had customary words of advice, but also picked India as second favourites (behind Australia) to take the World Cup home. 																								Asked whether his tips were specific or general, Woolmer guffawed: I just told (captain) Steve Tikolo that he and his players should enjoy themselves and give it all they have. They have nothing to lose. Woolmer, by the way, has been associated with an ICC (high-performance) programme aimed at sharpening the emerging countries skills. 																								Sourav, for his part, is convinced full (four) points and Indias path towards the semi-finals will be facilitated. Already within sniffing distance, the team looked mean and hungry at this afternoons workout. Left to coach John Wright, he would have described the session as not lacking in intensity. 																								Indeed, the one point he has been drilling home over the past few days has been simple: Respect Kenya and treat the match as you would a knockout game. 																								The last India-Kenya meeting (Bristol) in a World Cup, though, had seen little respect from either Sachin Tendulkar (140 not out) or Rahul Dravid (an unbeaten 104). So destructive was their partnership that W.G. Grace, whose statue adorns the ground, would have applauded up in heaven. 																								A similar effort and the Patil-Tikolo combine will have to begin heading towards the nearest sorcerer. 																								According to the tournaments executive director, Ali Bacher, the second (day-night) semi-final in Durban on March 20 wont be rescheduled into a day affair.																								There are good reasons why a change cant be effected, he informed today.

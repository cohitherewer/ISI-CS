 Saturday, June 07, 2003 				 Tower tag amp; iron man rise to bury furore
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN			New Delhi, June 6: Ruffled  by the dent made in the BJPs image by M. Venkaiah Naidu  playing the development man against the iron man, party  veterans have stepped in to correct the impression that  the equation between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy  is under strain.																								A senior leader close to deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani has proposed that from now Prime Minister Vajpayee should be projected as a shikhar purush (towering man) rather than a vikas purush during the BJPs campaign.																								It is an all-encompassing label which would do justice to the Prime Ministers achievements on his recent foreign tour. It is also comparable to the term lauh purush (iron man) used for Advani, he said.																								Another old-timer, J.P. Mathur  also close to Advani  had egged on the BJP to felicitate Vajpayee on Wednesday. Advanis sympathisers also advised him to speak in favour of Vajpayee to counter the perception that he was deliberately letting the controversy linger.																								Accordingly, Advani broke his silence before embarking on his 12-day US-UK trip and blamed the media. Sometimes I feel like laughing about how controversies are made (in the media) without any basis. I didnt comment and I dont want to comment.... There is absolutely nothing in it.																								Sources said Advani was extremely unhappy with Naidu for dragging him into the saga. He probably thought he could please Advani with his comments but in fact it has backfired, a source said.																								The BJP chief has reportedly been advised by Advani and RSS patriarch H.V. Seshadri to stay away from the media for a while.																								But Seshadris counsel was bypassed by his own spokesperson Ram Madhav in a news conference today in which he kept calling Vajpayee vikas purush and left the election leadership issue ambiguous. 																								Although Madhav was mandated to speak on anti-conversion only, he took every question willingly. Lauh purush or vikas purush is not significant.... Both are equal in the RSS eyes and we have the same respect for both.																								When prodded, he said: Society has given Advani the title of iron man for over 10 years because he led the Ramjanmabhoomi andolan. In the last four years, he took unprecedented measures to combat terror.																								As for Vajpayee, his stand was: For the last 50 years, he got his identity from being a liberal. When you run the government for five years, you get identified as a vikas purush.																								On leadership, he said: Elections are over a year away, so where is the question of who will be the next PM? In any case who are we (the RSS) to decide? Who should lead the country for the next five years will be decided by the party. The party has said it would be Vajpayee and we dont have any objections to that.

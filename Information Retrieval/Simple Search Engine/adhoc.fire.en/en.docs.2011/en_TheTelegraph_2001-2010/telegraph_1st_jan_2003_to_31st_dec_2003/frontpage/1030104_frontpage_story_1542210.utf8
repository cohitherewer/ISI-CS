 Saturday, January 04, 2003 				 Trains stranded in bandh
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Jan. 3: Large-scale violence and severe disruption in train services, including many bound for and leaving Howrah and Sealdah, marked Bihar bandh today.																								The 12-hour bandh was called by the NDA and Left parties to protest the killing of three youths in an alleged fake encounter in Bihar on Saturday. The bandh resulted in trains being stopped since morning. The journeys resumed after the bandh was lifted and the trains are expected to start arriving at their destinations early on Saturday. Sources said long-distance trains would be over 10 hours late.																								The Rajdhanis to Howrah and Sealdah were over 10 hours late. The Poorva Express, scheduled to leave Howrah at 9.10 am tomorrow, has been cancelled. The Patna Shatabdi Express, scheduled to leave Howrah this morning, was also cancelled.																								The Sealdah-Varanasi Express has been rescheduled to start from Sahibgunj tomorrow instead of Sealdah.																								Delay resulted in the Howrah-Kalka Mail leaving at 8.35 pm instead of 7.40 pm.

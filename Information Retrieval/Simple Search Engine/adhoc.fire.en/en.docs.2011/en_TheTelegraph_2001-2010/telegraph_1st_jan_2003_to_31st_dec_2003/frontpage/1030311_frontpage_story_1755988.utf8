Story  Win machine mows Lankans
  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Srinath appeals successfully for an lbw decision against Aravinda de Silva in Johannesburg. (AFP) Johannesburg, March 10: Spicy, emotional and ruthless: Its an Indian Summer and, now, just a small matter of winning two games for the Sourav Ganguly-led team to repeat 1983.At the Wanderers, India smashed a diffident Sri Lanka by 183 runs to confirm a semifinal berth. The batsmen, inspired by Sachin Tendulkar, did their bit to reach 292 for six. Later, with the brilliant Jawagal Srinath showing the way, the bowlers fired out Lanka in 23 overs.Srinath, whose opening spell (7-1-24-4) settled the issue, was adjudged Man of the Match. He dedicated the recognition to a dear relative, Hemant, who passed away in Mysore last week. This is for him, Srinath announced, remembering a relative who was more a friend and died young (in his late 30s).While Sourav interrupted Srinath to insist his mind wasnt made up, about the future, the senior pro himself told The Telegraph that he stood by what he said the other day. Basically, that he didnt have much cricket left. Complete retirement, therefore, is on the cards. All for naught: (Clockwise  from left) 
 Atapattu, Mubarak, Jayawardene, De Silva and Nissanka That is something for the future. Today, so destructive were the new ball bowlers that Sourav didnt have to call upon Harbhajan Singh. Its rare for established teams to be packed off inside 25 overs. Even more rare for a side with Sanath Jayasuriya and Aravinda de Silva.Their capitulation surprised Sourav, who is now credited with the biggest win (runs-wise) over the Emerald Islanders.Though not unexpected, given the manner of Pakistans annihilation 10 days ago, the Indians still scripted an amazing performance. Long after the defeat, Jayasuriya was probably scouring the neighbourhood for a place to hide. His decision to insert India bombed and it will be difficult for Lanka to move up.We played very well... close to a perfect game, remarked Sourav. Its been a hard campaign but, as he pointed out, the tiredness goes when the semifinal of a World Cup is reached. He added: Cricketers dream of playing in a semifinal or the final... as I havent played either, this is a dream come true.Weighed down by the loss, Jayasuriya could say little beyond dismissing a suggestion that his batsmen cracked under pressure. He also didnt quite agree India should have been set a target.More upset than the captain was the coach, Dav Whatmore. He declared: The players are responsible for the situation we find ourselves in. Now, its up to them to get us out....This evenings victory was the sixth in succession  a first in 29 years of ODIs involving India. The previous best was five in-a-row, both in the 1985 World Championship of Cricket and the 1987 World Cup.That the Lankans were short on confidence became evident at the toss itself. Given their requirement, Lanka ought to have batted and then banked on the Chaminda Vaases for quick breakthroughs. Perhaps, they were wary of Srinath, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra. Batting second didnt help. Srinath and Co. bowled a great line and varied the length to tease and torment.Earlier, Sachin and Virender Sehwag cut the Lankans to pieces and added 153 for the first-wicket. For a change, Sehwag actually capitalised on a start to get his maiden fifty (66) of the World Cup, while Sachin fell three short of his 35th century.Sachin, it may be recalled, tripped on 98 against Pakistan. He now has nine 90s in ODIs. Had Sachin got the three runs, he would have emerged the No.1 century-maker in World Cup history. Currently, he is tied with Mark Waugh, on four.Sehwag departed first, bringing Sourav and Sachin together. They continued the excellent work till Sachin exited to an attempted paddle-sweep. Souravs (48) departure sparked a procession. At one stage, it looked as if 292 was around 20 short. It proved 183 too many. Now, the Indians are set to play the second (day-night) semifinal in Durban. But before that is the last Super Six fixture, versus New Zealand, on Friday. Beating the Black Caps is Souravs focus. full points could eliminate the chance of an India-New Zealand semifinal.And, yes, theres that small score to settle: Erasing the black marks earned during  Copyright

 Wednesday, February 19, 2003 				 PM appeal
																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Tuesday night appealed to cricket lovers across the country not to do anything that would demoralise the team.																								I am dismayed at the improper manner in which cricket fans in some places have given vent to their feelings at the performance of our team in the World Cup matches so far.																								Victory and defeat are all a part of the game. Sportsmanship lies in showing confidence in our team and cheering it to do better, Vajpayee said in a statement.

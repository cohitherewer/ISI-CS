 Saturday, August 30, 2003 				 Holy site blast kills US hope
 							 - Shia leader dies in Najaf carnage		 Ayatollah Mohammed Baqer-al-Hakim Najaf, Aug. 29 (Reuters):  A car bombing killed 75 Iraqis, including a top Shiite  leader, today in an apparent assassination that dealt a  grave blow to the US occupation and left carnage at the  holiest shrine of Shiism.																								The blast tore through worshippers as they streamed away from Friday prayers in the Imam Ali mosque in the holy city of Najaf. It was by far the worst such atrocity in Iraq since the US-led war toppled Saddam Hussein in April.																								In the aftermath, Iraqis burrowed into rubble strewn with body parts in a hunt for survivors. Volunteers screaming God is great pulled out a severed foot and dug frantically around a deep crater filled with twisted metal and stinking black water.																								Some supporters of the slain Ayatollah Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim, 63, leader of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, blamed Saddam loyalists.																								But some commentators pointed to bitter faction-fighting among Iraqs long-repressed Shiite majority that has raged in Najaf since the end of the war.																								Hakim was for many the leading Shiite figure in Iraq and his cooperation with the US-led administration through its governing council was seen as crucial to the American efforts to stabilise the country and instal democratic rule.																								We have at least 75 dead and that could go up to 80 because of severe injuries. There are 142 wounded, Dr Safaa al-Aneedi, director of the Najaf teaching hospital, said.																								Three gutted cars lay in the street by the mosque. Some witnesses said there had been more than one explosion.																								Witnesses said Hakim was about to drive away from Friday prayers when the blast destroyed his car.																								A US military spokesman confirmed there had been a bomb.																								The attack is the latest in a series of bloody incidents in Najaf, several of them aimed at religious leaders of the Shiite branch of Islam followed by a majority of Iraqis.																								The Shiite power struggle is viewed as one of the keys to the future of Iraq. Washington is keen to discourage those Shiite leaders who favour Islamic clerical rule like that of Shiite Iran, where many lived in exile during Saddams reign.																								With many Iraqis belonging to Saddams once dominant Sunni Arab minority or to other ethnic and religious groups like Kurds and Christians, the prospect of domination by the 60 per cent Shiite majority is one that many regard with anxiety.																								There is a very serious chance that what we are entering here is a Shiite civil war akin to what happened in Iran in 1979-80 with rival factions jockeying for power, said Ali Ansari, an expert on Iran at Britains Durham University.																								At the scene, some called for a stronger American presence around holy places where a few months ago Shiites demonstrated to keep the troops away.																								The world is going to be turned upside down after this. This is our holiest site, said Qusay Jaber.																								Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim was tortured under Saddams rule and spent more than 20 years in exile in Iran before returning to Iraq after the US-led victory.																								We deplore this horrible act of terrorist violence, said a White House official. We will not be deterred in our efforts to help the Iraqi people rebuild their country and establish a representative democratic government.

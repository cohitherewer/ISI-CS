 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 ICC warms to Indias best
 															- Panel recommends provisional acceptance of contract  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Jan. 23: In a significant development, the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) World Cup contracts committee is understood to have recommended that the Indians conditional signing of the Player Terms be provisionally accepted by IDI Limited, the business arm of the ICC.																								This (practical) recommendation, one learns, will be revealed to the IDI directors  all 15 of whom also serve on the ICCs executive board  during the tele-conference of the millennium, at 3.30 pm (IST) tomorrow.																								And, so, unless theres a dramatic shift, the Sourav Ganguly-led squad will head for South Africa while the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the ICC will meet at the arbiters table in Lausanne  of course, after the February 8-March 25 showpiece.																								Officially, the IDI board has a straightforward option: Either to return the conditional signing and call for a fresh squad or accept the same and refer it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, in Lausanne. Well-placed sources of The Telegraph have indicated there will be a sincere effort to push for option No. 2.																								Initially, though, there was talk that attitudes within the ICC/IDI could harden, specially after yesterdays interim order of Delhi High Court.																								Respecting the larger interest, the contracts committee has taken the least-damage-to-the-ICC route. Moreover, the sports most ambitious event ought not to be dwarfed by any controversy, is how a source put it.																								The IDI board, however, is likely to add a recommendation of its own  that Indias share of around $9 million (as one of the 14 participating nations) be put in a trust account till the arbitration is complete.																								Incidentally, ICC president Malcolm Gray and vice-president Ehsan Mani, both of whom are on the IDI board, also figure in the contracts committee. Unlike the heads of all 10 Test-playing nations and the three Associate members, though, they dont enjoy voting rights on the board.																								Meanwhile, speaking from New Delhi, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said he would go along with arbitration but would oppose the freezing of only Indias payments.																								For tactical reasons, Dalmiya will hook-up from the capital itself.

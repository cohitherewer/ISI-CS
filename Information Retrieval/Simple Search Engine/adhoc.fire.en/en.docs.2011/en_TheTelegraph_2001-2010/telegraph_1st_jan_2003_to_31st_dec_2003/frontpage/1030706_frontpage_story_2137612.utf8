 Sunday, July 06, 2003 				 Sangh appeals and warns
 KAY BENEDICT																								Kanyakumari, July 5: The RSS today asked Muslims to give up the claim on sites in Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura and cautioned against efforts by vested interests within Hindus to create a rift.																								The RSS also urged Muslims to identify with Indian cultural icons like Ram instead of an invader like Babar.																								A resolution unequivocally demanding the restoration of temples at the three sites was unanimously adopted by the RSS national executive that began here today. The BJP is a party to the resolution as its general secretary Sanjay Joshi is among the participants of the meeting.																								RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav said the Sangh looked at the issue from the perspective of the nations self-respect and honour. We believe Muslims are also equal inheritor of the nations culture. We call upon the Muslim leadership to seize the historic opportunity and give up the claims over Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura and do not convert these into a bargain.																								The resolution sounded a warning by saying that if the Muslim leadership fails to understand the intensity of the sentiments of our countrymen and continues with its obdurate and obscurantist attitude, the executive calls upon the government to explore the possibility of legislative option to resolve this issue in the interest of national unity and communal harmony.																								But the spokesperson added that there should not be any hurry in enacting a legislation without satisfying either of the parties involved.																								The resolution alerted the Sangh parivars leaders to efforts by certain vested interests to create a rift in the Hindu movement by spreading untruths and half-truths. Nothing should should be done by way of words or deeds that would directly or indirectly lead to division in the Hindu ranks. 																								Asked to identify the vested interests, the spokesperson said: We do not see any need to elaborate to the media. We know who they are and they, too, know what they are doing.																								The resolution said: Ayodhya is not a Hindu-Muslim dispute. The Ayodhya movement symbolises the manifestation of the yearning of a national culture for self-respect and honour. Muslims of Bharat should become torchbearers of its honour and glory along with other countrymen, instead of becoming flag-holders of invaders.

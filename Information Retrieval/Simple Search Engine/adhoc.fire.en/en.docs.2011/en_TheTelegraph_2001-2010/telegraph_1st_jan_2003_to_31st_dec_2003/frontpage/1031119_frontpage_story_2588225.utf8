 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Nov. 18: Ricky Ponting isnt known to be uncomfortable laying a wager, but he would still have been hesitant at the break this evening. Australias 235 for five, after all, couldnt have guaranteed the TVS Cup.																								Pretty early in the Indian innings, though, it became apparent even that was too many. Moreover, with a batsman less (to accommodate five bowlers) the ask was destined to get tougher. Actually, keeping the larger picture in focus  with the tour of Australia days away  an Indian victory was a must.																								Bottomline, however, is that the world champions forced a 37-run win on an Eden wicket where the ball turned prodigiously, stopped disconcertingly and kept low alarmingly. Hardly the surface for a star-spangled ODI but, then, that cant be an excuse.																								Well have to improve 25 per cent in all departments Not batting for the entire 50 overs is a cardinal sin, fumed stand-in captain Rahul Dravid. Man of the Series Sachin Tendulkar (466 runs) was as biting: The batsmen should have completed the job We batted poorly																								Of course, there were moments when the sporting 100,000 turnout found reason to be optimistic: like when Hemang Badani launched an exciting counter or, later, when Ajit Agarkar suggested he would single-handedly make it a down-to-the-wire finish. But, then...																								Eventually, India was stopped in the 42nd over, at 198, with Ian Harvey prising out wickets at a most decisive time. He returned handsome figures, with the four victims falling in eight deliveries.																								Reflecting on one more victory over India, Ponting said Badanis dismissal (159 for five) was the turning point. 																								Virender Sehwag left early, Tendulkar didnt exactly fire and top-scorer Dravid was unlucky to play-on after a character-laced 49. In fact, nothing went right for India.																								Sourav Gangulys 80 per cent fitness remained just that and a body blow was taken before the final got underway. Losing the toss didnt help either.																								The Indians themselves made it worse by dropping five catches, with V.V.S. Laxman the culprit four times. Also, the move to keep the wicket dry didnt fetch the expected result. 																								For Australia, Damien Martyn top-scored with 61 and, towards the end, the visitors were excellently served by stalwart Michael Bevan and Michael Clarke, who was adjudged Man of the Match. Clarke remained not out on a punishing 44 (from 28 balls).																								Despite much life early on, circumstances forced Dravid to rely more on the spinners  regulars Harbhajan Singh and Murali Kartik as also the many part-timers. Kartik was easily the best and, if not anything else, must have embarrassed the selectors by another stand-out performance  10-1-30-1.																								Yesterday, Kartik told The Telegraph: Im not demotivated at not being picked for Australia Ill work harder now.																								Intended or not, he did make a point.

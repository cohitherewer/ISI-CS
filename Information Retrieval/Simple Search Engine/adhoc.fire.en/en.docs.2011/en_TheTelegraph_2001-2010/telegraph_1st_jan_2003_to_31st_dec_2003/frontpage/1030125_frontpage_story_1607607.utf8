The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 Players on pitch, bosses in court
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Jan. 24: Taking the pragmatic route, IDI Limited  the business arm of the International Cricket Council (ICC)  has agreed to provisionally accept the Indians conditional signing of the Player Terms for the World Cup.																								Accordingly, the Sourav Ganguly-led squad will leave for South Africa in the early hours of January 29, as scheduled. As for the warring Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the ICC, both are scheduled to head for the Lausanne-located Court of Arbitration for Sport after the February 8-March 25 tournament.																								Much could, of course, happen between now and the end of the World Cup																								To talk of the present, Samsung and TVS Motors, for example, will be able to run campaigns with the Rahul Dravids and Sachin Tendulkars except during the tournament. Claims (if any) from LG and Hero Honda will be settled later. 																								The imaging, too, will be in accordance with the Indians wishes.																								Essentially, the IDI directors - who featured in a global tele-conference this afternoon  endorsed the World Cup contract committees recommendations, which were listed by The Telegraph in todays edition.																								[The composition of the ICC and IDI boards, by the way, is the same: All 10 Test-playing nations, three Associates plus the ICC president and vice- president.]																								Incidentally, ICC vice-president Ehsan Mani is understood to have been instrumental in putting together this practical package.																								The IDI, though, will not disburse Indias share of the World Cup spoils ($9 million) till arbitration is completed. Moreover, should it be determined that India is liable for damages and the BCCI refuses to pay, the ICCs board will recommend Indias suspension.																								That, however, is something for the distant future. In any case, its an absurd proposition.																								While the BCCI didnt have reservations about arbitration  though, initially, it did call for non-binding mediation  president Jagmohan Dalmiya was firm about not accepting the freezing of Indias share. Obviously, a majority within the IDI board felt strongly about it.																								Dalmiya, however, isnt reading too much. The BCCI isnt dependant on $9 million for survival Moreover, if it comes to that, the IDI will have to release that amount with interest, he remarked bitingly, after returning from New Delhi late tonight.																								Though Dalmiya didnt comment, its significant that Hero Honda (one of the three World Cup sponsors with Indian links) has already announced its willingness to offer concessions on the terms. Effectively, that translates into not asking for compensation.																								With Pepsi also expected to climb down somewhat, only the bristling LG has to be tackled the BCCI.																								If the key sponsors dont pitch for compensation (through Global Cricket Corporation), wheres the question of the BCCI having to pay up?																								Meanwhile, one learns South Africa emerged Indias strongest backer during the tele-conference. Zimbabwe wasnt far behind.

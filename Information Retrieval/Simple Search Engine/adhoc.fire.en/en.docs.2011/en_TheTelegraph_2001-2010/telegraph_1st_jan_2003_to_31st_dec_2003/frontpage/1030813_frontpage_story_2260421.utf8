 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Crash-crazed staff attack ONGC boss
 															- Subir Raha to file attempt-to-murder case, survivor hope sinks OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Raha: In troubled waters Mumbai, Aug. 12: Angry  ONGC workers attacked chairman and managing director Subir  Raha after rescuers gave up hopes of finding any more survivors  of yesterdays helicopter crash.																								The wreckage of the chopper, which plunged into the Arabian Sea shortly after take-off from the Sagar Kiran oil rig in Bombay High, was traced this morning. The fate of 24 employees of the public sector giant and crew is not known.																								Raha, who arrived in Mumbai to talk to employees and dissuade them from going on an indefinite strike from tomorrow, has decided to file a case of attempted murder against some union leaders. He described the assault as premeditated and organised with the help of musclemen.																								Shortly after he touched down at the ONGCs helibase in Juhu, a large crowd of employees charged at Raha. Abusing him loudly, the crowd attacked his car with sticks and stones and smashed the windows. Ringed by CISF jawans, Raha beat a hasty retreat.																								ONGC workers are getting ready for an indefinite strike that begins at 6 am tomorrow. They said they had to resort to the protest after the corporation refused to agree to most of their crucial demands.																								But in a late night development, Bombay High Court restrained the employees from going on strike because it does not want crude oil supplies to be disrupted. 																								L.K. Mirchandani, the chief of the Association of Scientific and Technical Officers, one of the ONGC labour unions, said the employees were going on a tool-down agitation and not a strike. 																								The workers are demanding Rahas removal and a CBI inquiry into the accident, the worst in the oil giants history. The government has already ordered an inquiry by the civil aviation ministry, with investigations being handled by the office of the directorate-general of civil aviation.																								In addition, the workers are demanding a compensation package of Rs 25 lakh each to the families of those killed in the crash. The package will have to be supplemented by a job in ONGC for one member of each family. The ONGC management says some of the demands are not viable. 																								According to V.K. Sharma, director (offshore), the company is ready for the insurance package of Rs 7.5 lakh and social security of Rs 5 to 10 lakh (varying across employees). 																								We are also giving financial assistance to the families of the deceased ranging from Rs 1.8 lakh to Rs 6 lakh. This is in addition to the Rs 5 lakh that petroleum minister Ram Naik announced for the families of each of the deceased yesterday, Sharma said.																								Mirchandani said the government offer was too little, too late.																								Rescuers found the wreckage of the MI-172 helicopter around 5.30 am today. It lay at the bottom of the Arabian Sea, 150 metres from the site of the crash, 60 km off Mumbais shore. There were no signs of survivors.																								Two officials, S. Mandloi and A.J. Mhatre, had been rescued yesterday. I was in the rear seat when the helicopter spun out of control, Mhatre recalled. By the time I had tightened the life jacket around me, the chopper was diving face first into the sea at great speed. But just as the helicopter crashed, I pushed Mandloi out and followed him into the sea. There was very little time to even see what happened to the rest. A Coast Guard vessel found them an hour-and-a-half later.																								Divers on a joint salvage-and-rescue mission launched by the ONGC, Indian Navy and the Coast Guard, found the Russian-made helicopter at a depth of around 55 metres on the sea bed, shattered and upturned, its tail broken.																								Coast Guard sources said they will get to know if there are any people trapped inside only after the chopper is brought out. There were 29 persons on board, of whom three have already been declared dead.

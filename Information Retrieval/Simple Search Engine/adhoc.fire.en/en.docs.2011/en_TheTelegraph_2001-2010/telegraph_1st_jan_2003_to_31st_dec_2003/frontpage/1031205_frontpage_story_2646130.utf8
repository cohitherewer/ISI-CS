 Friday, December 05, 2003 				 Victory of Vajpayee basics
 ASISH CHAKRABARTY			New Delhi, Dec. 4: Atal Bihari Vajpayee said today in the Assembly elections, the BJP campaigned on development issues  power and roads  and not on mandir and masjid.																								We are called communal and are accused of practising communal politics. But what about this election? a jubilant Prime Minister asked before leaving for Nigeria.																								Hum ko bhi aisi asha nahi thi. Hum logone socha tha two-two ayega (Even we didnt expect this. We thought it would be two-two), Vajpayee said. 																								We have done better than that (2-2). Obviously, the people weighed the performance of governments run by the Congress.																								 He said the people had found the BJP a better choice than the Congress.																								In response to a question if the verdict was a consequence of anti-incumbency feelings, he said: Satta main rahne ka labh bhi hota hai, ghata bhi hota hai (There is both advantage and disadvantage of being in power).																								The Prime Minister, who sent on the day a letter accepting Pakistans invitation to the Saarc summit in Islamabad in January, appeared to rule out an early Lok Sabha election.																								Still one year is left, he said, suggesting it would be held on schedule.

 Wednesday, October 22, 2003 				 Mamata back with rally bang 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 21: If you were surprised by the ruling Left Fronts recalcitrant response to Justice Amitava Lalas order on rallies, you hadnt yet heard Mamata Banerjee.																								Surfacing from hibernation in Delhi, the Trinamul Congress leader today announced she would campaign against the state government. How? Through rallies  thats how.																								And hospitals would not be spared either.																								Let deaths of patients due to negligence in government hospitals and anarchy in the health administration come to a halt. Then only we will restrain ourselves. But if this continues, we will respond, she replied to a question whether her party would organise rallies inside hospitals after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees ban.																								If they (state government) cant build proper infrastructure in the health sector in 26 years, when will they do it? What is the use of a government continuing if it cant deliver the goods? she asked. 																								Mamata announced a string of protests (all on weekdays from 10 am to 5 pm), starting tomorrow, against the collapse of the health administration, among other things, making clear what she thought of Justice Lalas restrictions which have now been stayed.																								However, she attacked Left Front chairman Biman Bose for his comments on Justice Lala and his order. 																								The situation has come to such a pass that the ruling party feels it can do anything it likes. It can also ask a high court judge to get out of Bengal, she said.																								Asked why she took so long to react to the rally controversy, Mamata said she had kept quiet because of the festive season. We generally dont organise protests till bhaiphonta (brothers day). But we could not keep quiet any longer, she said 																								Echoing mostly the view of the CPM, Mamata said holding rallies is a fundamental right. We dont want rallies banned. But we dont want to disturb people at the same time.																								It is an intention that has yet to be seen on the ground. Mamatas rallies routinely block the Chowringhee crossing.																								With the police beginning to crack down on rallies, Trinamuls planned demonstrations from tomorrow will present a tricky challenge before the administration. 																								The Opposition party will hold a rally near the approach to the office of the Howrah district magistrate tomorrow and its womens wing will demonstrate opposite Metro cinema on October 28. 																								A day later, Trinamul workers will organise sit-ins before district magistrates offices across Bengal and take out processions in every civic ward. The Trinamul youth wing will hold another protest agitation on November 3.

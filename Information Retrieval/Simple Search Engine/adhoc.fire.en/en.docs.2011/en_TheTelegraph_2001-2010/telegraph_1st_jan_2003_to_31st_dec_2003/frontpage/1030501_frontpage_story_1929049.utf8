 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 Ghosts, drunks amp; virus victims
 SUNANDO SARKAR AND PRONAB MONDAL				 	 Policemen stand guard at the Infectious Diseases Hospital gate. Picture by Pradip Sanyal n See Metro																								Calcutta, April 30: Ghosts round the clock, drunks after dark and criminals when the occasion demands: that is what Asitabha Purakayastha, Radheyshyam Gupta, Jamil Ahmed and Hazari Prasad will have for company at Beleghatas Infectious Diseases Hospital, the states first  and last  defence against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.																								The confirmed SARS patients, Purakayastha and Gupta, and suspects Ahmed and Hazari are staying in different areas of Isolation Block-I. However, the suspects may very soon be shifted to Isolation Block-VIII because the confirmed patients might pass on the virus to them if they do not have it already, say doctors.																								Isolation Block-VIII comprises an area believed to be infested with  no, not cockroaches and mice but  ghosts, say hospital insiders. Quite a few incidents have occurred there, a group-D staffer working at ID Hospital for the past two decades said.																								As, initially, group-D staff and, then, nurses and other paramedical staff started shying away from work there, that wing has not seen any activity for quite some time, he added.																								He was speaking the truth, at least about the no-activity part. Not a single fan or light can be found now  corroboration of the old mans tale.																								More seriously, the administration has serious work to do as far as the problems  which even educated doctors working from ID Hospital admit  vis-a-vis human beings go. One problem is regular but the other  the more fearsome  is not a once-in-a-blue-moon occurrence either.																								Hospital officials admit it is a common practice for local criminals to take shelter in this hospital whenever they feel the heat  of police raids  more. There are several reasons for this, they explain.																								First, with the state seeing a decline in the incidence of infectious diseases, the hospital has for some time seen mostly empty beds. Only about a 100 of the hospitals 700 beds (according to official records) are now occupied by indoor patients.																								Second, a section of the group-D staff has strong political connections and  consequently  not-very-tenuous links with the local underworld. Every political party  be it the ruling CPM or the Opposition Trinamul Congress  has some staffers who take active part during elections (that translates into jamming booths or fighting on the road, say officials).																								They, necessarily, have some friends who do not belong to the hospital. But help cannot be denied in times of need, a hospital insider admitted. So, when the police chase becomes too hot, many in the local underworld simply come to the hospital and take up a bed.																								This hospital sees little crowds and, consequently, little government and media attention, an official explained. So, it is much easier to do things here  with the vacant beds than in, say, Medical College and Hospital or SSKM Hospital, he said.																								Drunks, of course, are a regular nocturnal phenomenon. A section of the hospital staff invites friends over after dark and with illicit liquor vendors selling the country-made variety, the vast campus becomes an open-air bar every rainless night, say officials.

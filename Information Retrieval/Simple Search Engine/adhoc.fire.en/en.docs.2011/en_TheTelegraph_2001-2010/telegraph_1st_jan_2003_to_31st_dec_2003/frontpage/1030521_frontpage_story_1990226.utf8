 Wednesday, May 21, 2003 				 Rein on Hizb
 Islamabad, May 20 (PTI):  Pakistan today said the activities of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen,  the largest militant group in Kashmir, had been restricted,  but there was no ban on the organisation.																								Interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat said: We cannot ban Hizb-ul Mujahideen because it is not a Pakistan-based organisation. The suggestion in the statement is that the outfit works out of India. 																								He said the Hizb would not be allowed to regroup as a militant force. They would not be allowed to open offices, organise rallies and carry weapons.

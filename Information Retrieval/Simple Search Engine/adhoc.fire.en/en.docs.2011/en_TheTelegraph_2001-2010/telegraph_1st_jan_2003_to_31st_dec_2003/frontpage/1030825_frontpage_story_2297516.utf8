 Monday, August 25, 2003 				 State medical seat blow
																								Calcutta, Aug. 24: The Medical Council of India has decided not to allow SSKM Hospital and Midnapore Medical College to increase MBBS seats by 100 each for the time being.																								The decision was taken at a meeting of the medical council in Delhi yesterday.																								Because of the lack of infrastructure at the two hospitals, we could not grant permission for the seats, said an official of the council. If we receive a second application from the Bengal government, we will again hold inspections and consider it.																								Health officials in Calcutta, however, maintained that they had not yet received any official intimation. 																								They said another meeting of the medical council is slated for September 15 in Delhi. Health secretary Asim Barman is expected to visit the capital during that time to impress upon the council and central health ministry officials to grant permission for the 200 seats.

 Monday, November 17, 2003 				 Mulayam parrots Delhi on Babri
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Mulayam Singh Yadav government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court defending the controversial omission of the criminal conspiracy charge against L.K. Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case.																								The affidavit mirrors the changed political equations in Uttar Pradesh, where Mulayam Singh came to power amid widespread speculation that the BJP facilitated his smooth takeover to thwart Mayavati.																								Mulayam Singhs volte face on Ayodhya comes a few months after he said the Centre was misusing the CBI. The CBI is an independent body and the Centre is misusing it to serve its political objective, Mulayam Singh had said on July 21, when the controversy had rocked Parliament.																								In August, Mulayam Singh became Uttar Pradesh chief minister. The affidavit, filed a little over two months after that, says: The submission of the petitioner that political pressure has been used on CBI in further investigation which was done under 173(8) is not admitted.																								The conspiracy charge pressed against the deputy Prime Minister under IPC Section 120B was dropped in a supplementary chargesheet filed by the CBI in May. The Uttar Pradesh governments affidavit was in response to notices the apex court issued to the state on a petition by lawyer Wajahat Ansari.																								The trial court, taking cognisance of the chargesheet, had quashed all charges against Advani.																								The state government affidavit says the petitioners contention of a criminal conspiracy to demolish the mosque is wrong and adds that there was no such plot by any political party. 																								The contentions of the writ petition are admitted only to the extent that the Babri Masjid was destroyed on December 6, 1992. The contention of the petitioner that the aforesaid act was done under criminal conspiracy by any specific community or political party is wrong and denied, the affidavit says.

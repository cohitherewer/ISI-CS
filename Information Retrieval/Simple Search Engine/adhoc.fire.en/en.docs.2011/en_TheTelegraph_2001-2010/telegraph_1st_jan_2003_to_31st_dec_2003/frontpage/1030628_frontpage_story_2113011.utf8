 Saturday, June 28, 2003 				 Atal back with Sikkim hope 
 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI				 	 Atal Bihari Vajpayee addresses the media in Shanghai on Friday. (PTI)																								Shanghai, June 27: Delhi hopes China will soon initiate steps on the question of recognition of Sikkim as part of India.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today hinted as much, saying: What we want to achieve (Chinas recognition of Sikkim) will soon be achieved.																								China will make its position clear on the issue, as a key negotiator put it, in the not too distant future  within a few months. Talks at both official and political levels during Vajpayees China visit have convinced India that it may now be only a matter of time.																								Even the agreement on border trade through Nathu-la is being seen as a stepping-stone toward Chinas de jure acceptance of Sikkims 1975 accession to India. The agreement is an unmistakable indication that China has accepted Nathu-la as the border between the two countries and by extension, Sikkim as part of India.																								Addressing Indian journalists at the end of his official visit to China, Vajpayee also sought to discount fears that the joint declaration signed by him and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao compromised Indias traditional position on Tibet.																								There was nothing new and nothing was conceded, Vajpayee said. Indias position on Tibet had neither ambiguity nor inconsistency.																								An argument in support of the Indian position was that it closely resembled the US state departments Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, which says that the US recognises the Tibet Autonomous Region to be part of the Peoples Republic of China. 																								It also says that the US encourages China and the Dalai Lama to hold substantive discussions aimed at resolution of differences at an early date, without preconditions.																								Indian negotiators were at pains to explain that this precisely has been Indias position and it has now been put in an official document. Like the US, India, too, wants the Tibetans to have cultural and religious autonomy from Beijing.

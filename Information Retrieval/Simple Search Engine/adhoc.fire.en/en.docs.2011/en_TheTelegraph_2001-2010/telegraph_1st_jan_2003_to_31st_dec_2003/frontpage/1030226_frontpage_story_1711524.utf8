																								New Delhi, Feb. 25: A day before the President is scheduled to unveil a statue of controversial Hindu rashtra ideologue Veer Savarkar in Parliament, the Opposition has urged him to block it.																								In a letter to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Opposition leaders said Savarkar was accused in the Mahatma Gandhi assassination and also backed M.A. Jinnahs two-nation theory. The President will, however, go ahead with the unveiling as scheduled.

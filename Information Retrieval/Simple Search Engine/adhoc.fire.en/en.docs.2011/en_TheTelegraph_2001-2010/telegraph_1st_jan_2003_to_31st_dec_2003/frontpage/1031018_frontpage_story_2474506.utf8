 Saturday, October 18, 2003 				 Munda gifts merged districts
 ANUPAM RANA																								Chaibasa, Oct. 17: The first commissionary of Jharkhand, the Singhbhum Kolhan division, was formed today with jurisdiction over East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharswan districts.																								Chief minister Arjun Munda told a gathering of thousands at Chaibasa stadium here that the government is giving a Deepawali gift to the people of this region.																								The people welcomed the formation of the commissionary by bursting crackers. The road to Chaibasa was chock-a-block with buses carrying people to the stadium. Thousands of BJP flags were hoisted along roads and in public places and many posters of the chief minister adorned the area.																								Singhbhum was formed in 1837, Munda pointed out at the stadium. But the process of bifurcation started in 1994. It was the first bifurcation of Singhbhum and eventually East and West Singhbhum were created. After the formation of Jharkhand, Seraikela-Kharswan district was formed on April 30, 2001, said the legislative Assembly member from Kharswan.																								Now the government has united these regions. The first commissioner, Gayant Muni Gala, will sit at Chaibasa. Now Singhbhum has regained its previous status, asserted the chief minister.																								Munda accepted that West Singhbhum has been given step-motherly treatment for more than five decades.																								However, the Kharswan MLA said the governments work is not over. Proposals for raising the socio-economic status of this district include linking Kolhan to Paradeep port in Orissa and a link between Sahebgunj and Haldia port in Bengal. The government has already got approval from the Centre to export from Haldia. The state government also wants to form an economic zone with Bihar, Bengal and Orissa, he said.																								 The government, he said, has given its approval for the improvement of the Jaitgarh-Badajamda highway, as a step towards improving infrastructure.																								Munda said the government is also in talks with various parties for the opening of private engineering and medical colleges. The people of this region have to provide the land. In return, the government will pay the money for the land and even arrange one job for the family that sells the land, he said.

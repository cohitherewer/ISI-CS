 Monday, July 21, 2003 				 Kar sevaks see threat to life after accusing Advani
 YOGESH VAJPEYI AND K. SUBRAHMANYA																								Lucknow/ New Delhi, July 20: Two kar sevaks who publicly accused deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani of instigating the Babri Masjid demolition have said their lives are under threat. 																								Santosh Dubey and Vinod Vatsa, among the five kar sevaks who made the accusation on June 7, yesterday told the CBI special court in Lucknow that they have been receiving threatening calls since. 																								At the behest of Advani and (Murli Manohar) Joshi, senior BJP and VHP leaders are after our lives and we seek the courts protection, the complaint said. 																								In his order, special judge Seth Shailendra Nath Tandon directed the police chiefs of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to provide special security to the duo. 																								Dubey and Vatsa are Shiv Sena chiefs of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana respectively and are facing trial in Lucknow for the demolition. Along with co-accused R.C. Khatri, Amar Nath Goyal and R.. Das, they had said outside the court that Advani, human resources development minister Joshi and other BJP and VHP leaders had instigated them on December 6, 1992. 																								Though the allegation is unlikely to impact the trial of Advani and seven others in the Babri case in a Rae Bareli court, it will hand the Opposition a stick to beat the government with. 																								Opposition leaders, who met at Sonia Gandhis residence this evening to decide the strategy for Parliaments monsoon session beginning tomorrow, are raring to confront the government on the Babri case. 																								The CBIs decision to quietly drop the conspiracy charges against Advani, Joshi and six other accused will be on top of the agenda, Congress spokesperson Jaipal Reddy said. 																								The charges were listed in the original joint chargesheet against all the Babri accused filed in September 1997 but were omitted from a supplementary chargesheet filed against Advani and seven other Sangh parivar leaders on May 31 this year. 																								The 90-minute meeting at Sonias residence unanimously decided to move an adjournment motion on the deliberate sabotage of the demolition case by the CBI tomorrow morning. Chandra Shekhar, Somnath Chatterjee, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Sharad Pawar, Laloo Prasad Yadav, Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee were among the leaders present.																								The government owed an explanation for its outrageous attempts to scuttle fair trial and the Opposition would demand it in one voice as top priority, Reddy said. The Taj corridor and Nitish Kumar will be next.

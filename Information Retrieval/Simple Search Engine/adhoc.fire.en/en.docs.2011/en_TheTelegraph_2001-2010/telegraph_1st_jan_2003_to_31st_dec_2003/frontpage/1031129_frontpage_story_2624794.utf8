 Saturday, November 29, 2003 				 Jail for Salem, extradition for wife 
 DALIP SINGH (From top) Abu Salem, Monica Bedi																								New Delhi, Nov. 28: A Portugal high court is believed to have ordered the extradition of Bombay blasts accused Abu Salems wife Monica Bedi to India.																								At the same time, a trial court there has handed her two years imprisonment for forging documents to enter Portugal.																								Salem was sentenced to six years imprisonment on three counts, but the court moderated the term to four-and-a-half years, CBI officials said. A verdict on Salems extradition is also expected soon.																								The CBI said it would seek official confirmation of todays developments in Portugal. 																								The bureau had appealed to the Portugal Supreme Court against a trial court order refusing to extradite Monica. The Supreme Court directed the high court to consider the petition.																								Highly placed sources said the trial court has given a lighter sentence to Monica because Salem accepted that he had got her passports under assumed names from Hyderabad and Bhopal.																								CBI officials said they believe Portugal laws have provisions whereby a convict, if facing extradition, can serve the sentence in the country they are offloaded in. 																								We are verifying this provision and, if it exists, we will certainly request their government to hand her (Monica) over to us, a source said. 																								Salem, who is wanted in India for the 1993 Bombay blasts, had been convicted in Portugal on three counts: three years for forgery and using forged documents to enter and stay in Portugal; two years for assaulting Lisbon police officers and resisting arrest when they chased his car to round up the duo; one year for perjury. 																								Sources said Salem had falsely deposed before the court that he was Arsalan Mohsin Ali, a Pakistani national.																								The couple has the option to appeal against the trial court order convicting them and Monica can challenge her extradition in the Supreme Court.

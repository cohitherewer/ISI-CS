 ANUPAM SHESHANK																								Ranchi, Oct. 15: JMM chief Sibu Soren today offered rice for Rs 2 a kg, wheat for Re 1 and a string of other sops if his party came to power.																								During a rally on Morhabadi Grounds, where the emphasis was on wooing the adivasi, moolvasi and minorities while keeping them aware of the NDAs communal agenda, the Dishom Guru also promised one job to each family, besides dhoti and sari for Rs 10.																								The JMM leader said it was time for the people to oust the ineffective NDA government from the state. He said that while the government had failed to fill vacant posts, it had cared little for the local people by not according priority to them on the basis of language or culture.																								Assuring power to all villages and free electricity to all living below the poverty line, the JMM chief appealed to the masses to remain alert of forces who were trying to divide them on the basis of caste and religion.																								All those born in Jharkhand are Jharkhandis, they have no caste or religion. We are not against any religion, he said.																								He also had a word of caution for outsiders. Live here like brothers, not like dacoits, or else the people will immediately chase you away.																								Exhorting people to fight for their rights, Soren said: Instead of blood, there is water flowing in your veins. I am not saying this to tease you, but to remind you that you have to fight for your rights. Unless you fight, you will not be given anything by this ineffective and incapable government. Soren said he knew how to make officials work and how to take development to the remotest corners.																								Each family will get at least one job, be in government offices, factories, agriculture sector or through animal husbandry. Each village will get water. I know how to take water to the villages. No one needs to tell me about the state rivers.																								The appointment of teachers will be done on the recommendations of villagers. Those who are already teaching in villages will be absorbed and they will be required to get three months training after two years in service. They will be paid for the training period, Soren said.																								Soren iterated his promise that police jobs will be given to those tribals who live in jungle and who know how to climb trees. Had I become the chief minister, I would have given police jobs to those who live in jungles, but I was not given a chance.

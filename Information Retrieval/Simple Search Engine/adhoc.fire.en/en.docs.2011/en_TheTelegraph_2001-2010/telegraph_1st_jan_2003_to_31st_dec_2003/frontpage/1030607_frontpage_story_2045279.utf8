 Saturday, June 07, 2003 				 Case filed against Rajnis doctor 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 6: City police today registered a case of death due to negligence against Dilip Majumdar, the doctor whose alleged delinquency and maltreatment led to the death of young cricketer Rajnis Patel at the SSKM Hospital on Monday.																								We have started the case under Section 304 A of IPC, which is causing death due to negligence, said a senior officer of Calcutta police. City police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty has instructed the detective department to investigate the case, registered on the basis of the FIR filed by the cricketers father, Manoj Patel, with the Bhowanipore police station.																								Director of education C.R. Maity had suspended Majumdar for delinquency of service on the basis of a prima facie report submitted by a three-member committee set up by SSKM authorities to probe charges of negligence and maltreatment against the doctor.																								Seventeen-year-old Rajnis was admitted to the hospital under Majumdars care after breaking his left shinbone in early February. Since then till his death, he underwent five operations.																								Rajnis died of post-operative haemorrhage shock and infection that spread from his wound.																								In their complaint, the Patels alleged that Majumdar did not come even once to see him, despite being sent several messages on Sunday.																								Maity said the final report on the case would be submitted to state health department authorities in 15 days.																								The terms and conditions on the basis of which the investigation will be carried out have been mentioned, Maity said, adding that Majumdars inability to cure the patient was secondary. It is the negligence and his aloofness that is being deemed as the offence here, he said.																								Majumdar should have formed a medical board when he was unable to handle the case. That is not uncommon even in the case of some of the most efficient doctors, a senior health department official said.																								Following the uproar over Rajnis death, the department has decided to send officials from Writers Buildings to government hospitals every week to talk to relatives of patients.																								A team of health officials will monitor the entire process of medical treatment and hear all complaints, including those about treatment and diet, a senior health official said.

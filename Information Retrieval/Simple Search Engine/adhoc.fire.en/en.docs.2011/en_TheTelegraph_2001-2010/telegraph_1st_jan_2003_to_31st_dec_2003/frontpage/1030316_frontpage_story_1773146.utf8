The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Sunday, March 16, 2003 				 If its home, its Durban
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Durban, March 15: If theres a home away from home, for Team India, its this picture postcard-pretty port city. From the names, malls and even Zee TV, theres a distinct Indianness which cant be missed.																								In fact, Durbanites of Indian origin are convinced the desi flavour inspired Sourav Ganguly and Co. to thrash England in that crucial league game last month. This time, a win over Kenya, in the March 20 semifinals, is taken for granted.																								Given the reception accorded by dozens of fans, when the team arrived at the Holiday Inn Elangeni this afternoon, it seemed the World Cup had already been won. Indeed, the locals fervour made some wonder: If this is the mood here, whats it back in India?																								Its a thought which hasnt escaped Sourav and, in days to come, the pressure will become pronounced. Today, amid a deafening Daler Mehndi number and the serving of samosas and chicken tikkas  all part of the welcoming ritual  he made a quiet entry and quickly headed for his tenth floor room.																								Actually, Im very tired, Sourav told The Telegraph, as he settled to watch the Sri Lanka-Zimbabwe match. While he didnt admit as much, yesterdays game in Centurion (versus New Zealand) took a lot out of him  specially emotionally.																								Sourav wanted to teach New Zealand a lesson, on neutral ground, and was successful. Yet, he didnt talk about that match, except to praise Mohammed Kaif (68 not out) for a brilliant innings. He added: Kaif wasnt getting big scores, but hes such a solid cricketer....																								Looking ahead, Sourav said: My views on Kenya havent changed.... Steve Tikolos team is dangerous and we shouldnt be caught napping.... They may have gained four points from New Zealands decision to not play in Nairobi but, otherwise, theyve won games.																								Breaking off to watch Maravan Atapattus 100th run, he continued: Remember, barring the Australia match we lost, the only time we were under pressure was against Kenya (Cape Town). Cricket has taught me never to take anything for granted and Im not assuming anything. To repeat, good cricket alone will earn us a ticket to the final.																								The captains message, then, is: Dont sneer at Kenyas round-of-four entry. Theyve earned it.																								With the team management deciding on a well-deserved break, most players preferred to ensconse themselves in their rooms  watching either the Sri Lanka-Zimbabwe game or the Kingsmead fixture featuring Australia and Kenya. Kaif, though, preferred to step out for a while.																								In the midst of obliging autograph-seekers, as he was preparing to leave, Kaif confessed to feeling much better after the superb effort. Its not that I wasnt confident in the earlier matches, bas runs nahin bante the.... Kuch runs karne ke baad accha to lagna hi hai....																								Dekhiye, koshish hamesha rahti hai.... At times, everything works; on other occasions, nothing clicks..., Kaif said.

 Tuesday, February 18, 2003 				 Harare heroes in armband dilemma
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Harare, Feb. 17: Andy Flower and Henry Olonga, who authored unusual history last Monday, may not wear the black armband in Wednesdays match against India. Instead, they could issue another statement, iterating their stand (on democracy) announced so dramatically during the Zimbabwe versus Namibia game.																								While its true both did declare they would continue to wear the armband throughout the World Cup, the Zimbabwe Cricket Union and the ICC have asked them not to do a repeat. As their point has been made, its possible that only a statement may be made two days from now, a Flower confidant told The Telegraph late tonight.																								A decision is expected by tomorrow evening.																								The confidant added: In any case, both wish to continue playing in the tournament and another show of protest could bring about President Robert Mugabes intervention. Right now, they dont wish to precipitate matters. That the ICC has called for a stop to cricket being used for political purposes is something they should respect.																								Significantly, Flower and Olonga had a half-hour meeting outside the dressing room, at the Harare Sports Club, on conclusion of the days workout. They were briefly joined by two teammates. 																								Apparently, Flower is a bit worried that just a statement may not go down well among the many Zimbabweans who have supported his and Olongas move. At the same time, he doesnt wish to quit international cricket with the stigma of being thrown out of the biggest-ever show.																								Also, Flower is concerned about any backlash which could hurt brother Grants career. Hes a different person an individual with a mind of his own. I hope nobody tries to settle scores with him, is what Flower is understood to have told well-wishers.																								Flower has received an offer from South Australia and may head for Adelaide after another summer at Essex. 																								Though it couldnt be confirmed, there are whispers that Olonga (first Black to don the Zimbabwe cap) could migrate to either the US or Australia.

 Friday, July 25, 2003 				 Bhaichung, boys make a mark
																								July 24: East Bengal reached the Asean Club Championship final in Jakarta on Thursday, beating Indonesias Petrokimia Putra 8-7 in a penalty shootout.

This is the first time that an Indian club has reached the final of a tournament of such stature. 																								Bhaichung Bhutia, who scored East Bengals equaliser, said his team should have won within 90 minutes. We got so many chances in the second half but did not utilise them. We worked hard and it was a good team effort.																								In Saturdays final, East Bengal will meet crack Thai outfit BEC Tero Sasana. The Calcutta team had lost to Tero Sasana 0-1 in their group league match earlier.

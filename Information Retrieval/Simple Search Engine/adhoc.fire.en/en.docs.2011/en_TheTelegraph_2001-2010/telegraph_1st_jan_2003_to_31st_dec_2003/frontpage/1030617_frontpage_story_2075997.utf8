 Tuesday, June 17, 2003 				 Judge in call-girl supplier dock
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, June 16: An out-of-work judge has been arrested on charges of delivering  not judgments  but women for a call-girl service.																								Rajesh Mishra was arrested by Lucknow police last night after a girl alleged that she was raped when she went to a house as suggested by the suspended judge. Mishra had been posted as the civil judge in Ghazipur district but was suspended on corruption charges in 1999.																								The police said they stumbled on the racket when the house of one R.. Sharma was raided last night following cries for help from the girl.																								The girl told the police that she had been sent to Sharmas house by the judge. When I had just entered the house, two young men broke into the house and dragged Sharma away. They then raped me, she said.																								After obtaining a full statement from the girl, the police raided the judges house in Gomti Nagar and some hotels. Mishra was arrested from his residence but Sharma is absconding. Mishra was produced before a magistrate today and remanded in seven days custody.																								Our investigations indicate that the suspended judge has been running the operation for more than a year, Lucknow senior superintendent of police Vinay Kumar said.																								The manager of one of the hotels and two others have been arrested for running the racket. We are conducting raids at some other hotels and there may be more arrests, Kumar added.																								During interrogation, the girl confessed that Mishra had engaged over a dozen girls and used to send them to the residences of wealthy clients as well as to some hotels in the city, Kumar said.																								The girl said the judge had got every call girl in his operation photographed. He sent each of us to a select group of clients at private homes. Some hotel managers were also in touch with Mishra and frequently asked him to send a girl.																								Irrespective of the frequency of the calls, each girl was given a weekly payment of Rs 2,000, she added.																								Mishra has denied the charge. He claimed that he was only helping a poor girl get a job. Mishra said he had sent the girl to Sharmas residence to discuss how she could get a clerks job in the office of a judicial officer.

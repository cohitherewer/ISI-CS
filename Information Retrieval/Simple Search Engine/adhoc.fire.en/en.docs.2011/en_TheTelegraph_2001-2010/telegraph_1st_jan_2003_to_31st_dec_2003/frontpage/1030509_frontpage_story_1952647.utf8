 Friday, May 09, 2003 				 Clash in VIP-attack zone 
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, May 8: A day after public works department minister Amar Chowdhury was attacked in North 24-Parganas, CPM and RSP loyalists clashed in the same area with sticks, rods and sharp weapons, leaving several wounded.																								Four CPM supporters and nine RSP workers were severely injured in last nights clash, deputy inspector-general of police (headquarters) Narayan Ghosh said at Writers Buildings.																								He said CPM supporters had gone to Bhordubi in the Jeliakhali area to distribute voters slips when local RSP leader Atul Ghosh  who sheltered Chowdhury on Tuesday evening when he was chased by anti-socials resisted, leading to the clash.																								Anukul, brother of Atul, was seriously injured after being hit with rods on his head and neck. RSP state secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay, who complained to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee over phone, said Anukul had been admitted to a south Calcutta nursing home and required over two dozen stitches on his head.																								The PWD minister said from Jhargram over phone that he would address a meeting in the same area tomorrow. 																								Those who attacked me definitely had the intention of disrupting my election campaign. I have given a list of anti-socials to the police and told them it would be difficult to hold elections if those people were present in the area, he said.																								The chief minister told me arrests had been made in connection with the attack on Tuesday. When I informed him of last nights developments, he told me he would inquire about it. Later, he phoned me and confirmed the clash but told me no firearms were used, he said.																								Senior RSP leader, Kshiti Goswami, claimed bullets were fired on his party workers by CPM activists.  CPM local leaders are furious  after the police arrested some workers in connection with  the attack on the PWD minister. They have torched several  houses belonging to our supporters and threatened them with  dire consequences, he alleged in Gosaba.

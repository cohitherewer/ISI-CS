 Saturday, November 22, 2003 				 Kale benched for bribe probe
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Nov. 21: Maharashtra batsman Abhijit Kale, accused of offering an inducement to selectors Pranab Roy and Kiran More for facilitating a Team India berth, has been suspended by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).																								Beginning today, the suspension is effective for a maximum of six-and-half months. By then, the BCCI is obliged to complete its probe. After that 																								With the appointment of a commissioner, Bar Council of India chairman D.V. Subba Rao, stage I is in place. Moreover, he has been advised to complete his inquiry within 15 days.																								Its after three years that a commissioner has been appointed  the last incumbent was former Central Bureau of Investigation top gun K. Madhavan, when match-fixing was probed.																								Incidentally, Madhavans findings have been challenged.																								Once Rao completes his assignment, the BCCIs disciplinary committee (to be constituted by president Jagmohan Dalmiya) will take over. It must finish work in six months.																								As with the commissioner, the committee was last seen in 2000, when punishments related to match-fixing were handed out. It will have three members, including Dalmiya. The others are likely to be vice-presidents.																								The commissioners report isnt binding but, then, the disciplinary committee should have very good reasons to disregard the findings.																								While acknowledging the Kale affair had hurt Indian cricket, Dalmiya insisted nothing will be swept under the carpet. This must be welcomed.																								The Vizag-based Rao, currently in Mumbai, said: Im not making a detailed comment till Ive gone through the papers but, yes, such allegations tend to reflect on the system.																								Rao couldnt confirm whether he will only examine the three principal characters or call the three remaining selectors and BCCI secretary S.K. Nair as well. The secretary convenes the quintets meetings.																								Given that Ill be back in Vizag on Sunday, my work will effectively begin then, Rao, the Andhra Cricket Association chief, informed.																								More, one understands, will be overseas for a while.																								The Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA)  a Dalmiya-baiter  has instituted its own probe and the hearing is slated for tomorrow. However, MCAs S.G. Balasaheb Thorve emphasised there wont be any awkwardness and they would cooperate. Thorve, though, added: We will  forward our report to Dalmiya. Having said that, the selectors  should also be investigated.

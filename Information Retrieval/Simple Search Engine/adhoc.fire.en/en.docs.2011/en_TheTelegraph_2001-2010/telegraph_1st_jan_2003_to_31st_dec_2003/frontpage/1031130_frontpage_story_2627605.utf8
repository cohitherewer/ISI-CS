 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta, Nov. 29: Easts Pranab Roy and Kiran More of West, the national selectors who have accused Abhijit Kale of offering an inducement, stuck to their stand during the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)-initiated inquiry in Visakhapatnam.																								Apparently, they substantiated their (unprecedented) charge as well.																								With Bar Council of India chairman D.V. Subba Rao in the chair, as commissioner, the days proceedings lasted over six hours and his report should be ready within four days. Raos deadline, by the way, is December 5.																								The Telegraphs sources said the exercise turned into a More-Kale showdown, with the former even cross-examining the Maharashtra vice-captain a second time.																								Though cross-examination isnt mandatory in any inquiry of a preliminary nature, Rao gave that option to ensure greater transparency. Moreover, in a first for the BCCI, an audio recording was commissioned.																								While proceedings began an hour late (at 11.30 am), thanks to the delayed Mumbai-Hyderabad-Visakhapatnam flight, drama wasnt at a premium. And, at the centre of it all was Centrals selector Sanjay Jagdale.																								Quite like George Bush landing unannounced in Baghdad, Jagdale flew from Mumbai to confirm statements made in his colleagues written submission. After all, he was informed of Kales Rs 10-lakh offer before Pranab and More complained to BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya.																								Incidentally, Jagdale had Kale as a co-passenger but, predictably, didnt interact.																								Meanwhile, Punes district and sessions court has stayed yesterdays order by a lower court judge, V.D. Kulkarni, restraining the BCCI from suspending Kale.																								An appeal is planned, but its unlikely that the middle-order batsman can play in the Ranji match against Orissa, beginning in Cuttack on Monday. He will, of course, feature prominently at the BCCIs emergent working committee meeting tomorrow in New Delhi.																								Among other things, it will finalise the disciplinary committee  Dalmiya plus two others. The trio will come into the frame once the commissioners report is submitted.																								Dalmiya, it is learnt, wont personally suggest names. Given the sensitive nature, he will leave the decision entirely to the house.

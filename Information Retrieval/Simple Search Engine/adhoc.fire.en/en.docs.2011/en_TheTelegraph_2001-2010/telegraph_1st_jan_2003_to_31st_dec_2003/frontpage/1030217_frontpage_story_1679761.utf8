 Monday, February 17, 2003 				 Boys find a safe haven in Harare
 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Harare, Feb. 16: With the Zimbabwe leg of the World Cup having an appreciable political overtone, it came as no surprise when the countrys minister for sport (education and culture as well), A.S. Chingwedere, personally welcomed Sourav Gangulys team on arrival this afternoon. 																								Were very happy the Indian team has come to fulfil its obligation and though a smear campaign has been launched by some people, I wish to reassure that Zimbabwe is as safe as India. Every country has some problems, but we dont wish to get provoked. If we do, that will mean playing into the hands of those inimical towards us, Chingwedere declared in a short speech at the airport.																								The Indians, who arrived from Johannesburg, are to play Zimbabwe on Wednesday. 																								Later, talking to The Telegraph, the minister slammed England for refusing to come here and remarked he wouldnt be surprised if Australia, too, eventually decided against playing on Zimbabwean soil. 																								Englands stand has been hypocritical... Theres been so much lecturing on keeping sport and politics separate, yet the English have themselves mixed the two... Everything has been blown out of proportion. In fact, the only dispute (in Zimbabwe) is between a section of the White commercial farmers and the government... A huge majority of our population isnt affected, Chingwedere insisted. 																								The minister continued: Because of what has been spoken about, I wont be surprised if the Australians decide to go Englands way. Only, if they do that, Zimbabwe will have to be compensated. Having invested so much, its not easy reconciling to matches not being played. 																								The reigning champions are scheduled to play Zimbabwe on February 24 in Bulawayo. Its not insignificant, perhaps, that Australian Prime Minister John Howard has been calling for extending Zimbabwes exclusion from the Commonwealth and has consistently taken a hard line.																								While complimenting the International Cricket Council (ICC) for its stand on England  awarding the four points to Zimbabwe  Chingwedere declined to comment on the sensational (black armband) protest by Andy Flower and Henry Olonga during the countrys opening game versus Namibia last Monday. They were mourning the death of democracy.																								The government has chosen not to react. However, we have asked the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) to look into the matter and revert. What is known is that the ZCU placed the issue before the ICC and the world body responded by saying cricket should not be a platform to advance any political agenda, he said.																								Sources said the ZCU is unlikely to act while the tournament is in progress. The players action came as a shock and immediate disciplinary action would have added to the negative publicity... Its for this reason that, instead, the ICC was moved. A repeat, though, could change things, the source explained.																								Another source observed that Flower, in any case, has announced he will quit after the World Cup  so, action by the ZCU wont really affect him. Olonga, the first Black to wear the Zimbabwe cap, is reported to be considering a shift to either Australia or the US.

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Oct. 2: As an injured Chandrababu Naidu stepped off a special flight here this morning, his government went into a high-level huddle over the Centres offer of National Security Guard commandos to tighten the chief ministers security ring.																								We want to totally revamp the security system. We are prepared to hand over this task to a specialised and independent agency or individuals, Andhra Pradesh home minister T. Devender Goud told reporters.																								Director-general of police S.R. Sukumara said the government was keen to accept the Centres offer because of the heightened threat perception. The Telugu Desam Party chief yesterday survived an attempt on his life when Peoples War Group rebels set off a series of landmine blasts near Tirupati, injuring him and several others.																								The government today asked security adviser S. Subramaniam to probe the lapses that led to the attack. The retired IPS officer has left for Tirupati.																								Sukumara said a probe would be conducted to find out if there was any intelligence failure. He said there was no specific information about the possibility of an attack. I will not call it a lapse but we will inquire into it.																								Police sources in Chittoor said six activists of the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee, an organisation often accused of siding with extreme Left groups, were taken into custody in Tirupati this morning.																								Naidu today returned to Hyderabad by a special flight. His hand in plaster and a belt round his neck, he drove straight to his Jubilee Hills residence with wife Bhuvaneswari.																								Minister B. Gopalakrishna Reddy has been admitted to the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences here. Desam legislator R. Rajasekhar Reddy, who too was injured, has been shifted to Apollo Hospitals in Chennai.																								Governor S.S. Barnala called on the chief minister. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani will meet him tomorrow.

 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Sushma push to death law for spurious drug makers
 OUR BUREAU New Delhi, Aug. 12: Fake  drug makers will be put to death under stringent new laws  to be enacted as soon as possible.																								The government today almost admitted that the 56-year Drugs and Cosmetics Act on manufacture and sale of medicines has failed to prevent substandard and fake medicines from hitting the market.																								A study has found that every one in four strips of tablets is fake.																								Were going to have the most severe penalties in the world against fake drug manufacturers, health minister Sushma Swaraj said. They are mass murderers of innocent people.																								The minister was releasing the interim report of a committee asked to suggest ways to plug drug law loopholes. 																								I dont want even a single days delay in moving on this  if Parliament allows, well introduce a bill during this session, Swaraj said.																								The committee has recommended that the punishment for sale and manufacture of spurious drugs which cause grievous harm or death be raised from life imprisonment to death and a fine of Rs 1 lakh or three times the value of the drugs seized, whichever is higher.																								The committee, headed by Raghunath Mashelkar, the director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, is expected to submit its final report by October. 																								The punishment for dealing in spurious drugs which do not cause death should be enhanced from five years imprisonment to a minimum seven years up to life, the committee said.																								It has recommended the establishment of a Central Drug Administration to coordinate between central and state drug control agencies, which are often at odds with each other.																								For instance, state agencies give licences to companies that have been denied one by the Drug Controller of India.																								Mashelkar said the magnitude of the spurious drug problem is not a frightening 35 per cent of the market, as claimed in some reports, but is closer to 0.5 per cent.																								A World Health Organisation survey has said 35 per cent of the worlds spurious drugs are made in India. The value of the fake products market has been estimated at Rs 4,000 crore.																								Mashelkar blamed inadequate drug control infrastructure, lack of testing facilities, shortage of inspectors and absence of accurate information for lax enforcement of the law.																								The committee said most prosecution cases remain undecided for years. Policy-makers are concerned about not fake drugs alone, but also rampant sale of substandard medicines.																								The health ministry claims it has been difficult to track down the guilty because the fake industry is run by small businesses often working from backyards or garages.																								What it does not say is that some drug inspectors are in cahoots with the criminals.

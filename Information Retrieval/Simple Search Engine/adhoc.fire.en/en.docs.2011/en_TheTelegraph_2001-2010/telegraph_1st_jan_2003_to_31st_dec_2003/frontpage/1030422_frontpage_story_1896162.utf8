 Tuesday, April 22, 2003 				 Bokaro tech varsity in pipeline
 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA																								Ranchi, April 21: The Jharkhand science and technology department today forwarded to chief minister Arjun Munda a proposal for setting up a technical university in Bokaro that will offer degrees in engineering and other disciplines.																								The department also forwarded proposals for establishing four industrial training institutes (ITIs) at Silli (Ranchi), Ramana (Garhwa), Gumla and Pakur.																								Science and technology minister Samresh Singh told The Telegraph that the proposed technical university would be known as the Shahid Vishwanath Sheikh Bhikhari Jharkhand Takniki Shiksha Vishwavidyalaya. The President would be its visitor and a renowned scientist or a reputed technocrat its vice-chancellor.																								The university will be a fully autonomous technical education institution. It will offer degrees of the highest level in all leading branches of applied science and technology, Singh said.																								Half the seats will be reserved for students from Jharkhand, while the other half will be open seats to be filled on an all-India basis. We expect to generate good revenue from the open seats, added the minister.																								The campus for the university, the project report for which was prepared by the Jamshedpur-based Xavier Labour Relations Institute (XLRI), would be spread over 500 acres.																								The states technical education advisory committee discussed the project at a meeting presided over by Singh here today before forwarding the proposal to the chief minister.																								It was earlier planned to establish the university in Ranchi. But XLRI proposed that the campus be spread over 500 acres and have an atmosphere conducive to academic growth. 																								Bokaro was found to be the best place for it, while in Ranchi the government is unable to provide 100 acres to Ranchi University, the minister said.																								Singh represents Bokaro in the Assembly. He is a native of the district and his political activities have centred around the steel town. Sources said the proposed technical university could give his political career a boost.																								The minister, who is on the board of governors of the Bokaro Institute of Technology, has been trying to win recognition for it since the formation of Jharkhand. 																								Sources said the establishment of the university could solve the problem of recognition for the institute.																								The buildings of the university would be spread over 56,004 square metres and be built at a cost of Rs 33.6 crore. The estimated recurring annual expenses would be Rs 2.22 crore and the estimated non-recurring annual expenses will be approximately Rs 43 crore.																								Setting up the four new ITIs will cost an estimated Rs 60 crore. Each ITI will have 220 seats and will impart training in five branches. The project shall be completed within two years, said Singh, who has laid the foundation stones of three ITIs.																								The minister said the science and technology council general body meeting would be held on May 6 for budget and project approval. Awards would be given to meritorious students the same day, he said.

 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 BJP snuffs out early poll talk
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The BJP today scotched speculation on general elections in November.																								I wish to clarify that there is no proposal to postpone or prepone polls, party president M. Venkaiah Naidu said. Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis blueprint for synchronised elections was only meant to start a debate, he added. 																								However, Naidu used the occasion to attack chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh, without naming him, for his negative reaction to the proposal.																								There is no need for anyone to worry about things like cheating like hell. In Jawaharlal Nehrus time, simultaneous elections were carried out and no one went to hell. There was no cheating like hell, no meeting like hell, only voting like democracy. Synchronised elections are an ideal situation. So we placed an ideal situation for debate. Polls will continue as per schedule.																								The BJP chief added that he had asked the cadre to be ready because a student appearing for exams in March will start preparing from September and not February. 																								The possibility of early elections was discussed at a meeting Naidu held with party office-bearers yesterday, in which minister Sushma Swaraj and the party chief whip in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, were present. 																								Sources said the members asked if the Centre was seriously planning November or February polls and what the Prime Minister thought because only Atal Bihari Vajpayee can recommend dissolution of the House.																								One member reportedly said Vajpayee did not favour November elections. The meeting also took into account the feedback that a majority of the party MPs did not want an early poll despite the good monsoon and positive outlook for the economy.

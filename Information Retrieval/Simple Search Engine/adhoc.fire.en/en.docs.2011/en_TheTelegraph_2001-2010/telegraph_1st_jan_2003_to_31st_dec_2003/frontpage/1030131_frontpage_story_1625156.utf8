Story  Shuffle set in praise of each other
- BJP second rung bristles with dynamic leaders RADHIKA RAMASESHAN New Delhi, Jan. 30: Pramod Mahajan appeared crestfallen; M. Venkaiah Naidu a bit edgy; Arun Jaitley not quite as pleased as he could have been. But a day after Atal Bihari Vajpayees shuffle felled a heavyweight like Mahajan and enhanced Arun Shouries profile, the BJPs second-rung leaders appeared to belong to a mutual admiration society.The endeavour was to clear the perception that the shuffle had brought into open their eagerness to outsmart one another and book the third slot in the leadership.Announcing Mahajans appointment as a general secretary and spokesman, Naidu spoke of him as one of our most senior, dynamic and experienced leaders. He said as the party president he felt proud when Mahajan gave up his ministership to take up party work. This is a testimony to the BJP as a party with a difference and a party with a mission.

Had Jaitley joined then, he would have been one of our most senior leaders, Mahajan said.The two Aruns  Jaitley and Shourie  also did their share of back-slapping. Jaitley, who took over the commerce ministry, said his predecessor  Shourie was holding additional charge  was doing exceedingly well and has the support of the Prime Minister. Whatever little I can do to support his cause, I will do. Shourie, who took charge of Mahajans ministries, said no message should be read in it and promised to carry on the good work of his predecessor who he described as  Copyright

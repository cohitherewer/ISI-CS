The Telegraph - Calcutta : Frontpage
 Thursday, November 27, 2003  Bye baggy green, hello Rosie
 - Waugh announces retirement, renews commitment to Udayan  Steve Waughs daughter  Rosie  Sydney, Nov. 26: International  cricket may lose Steve Waugh, India will not. The Australian Test captain today  announced retirement at the end of the current series at  home against India, but said his relationship with the country  against which he made his debut, too, at Melbourne in 1985  will continue beyond. Waugh said he planned to carry  on working with the charity Calcutta Foundation, which runs  a home  Udayan  for children of leprosy patients, and  would raise funds for another. I know that whatever field I  turn to, I will give it 100 per cent, he said. Little Rosie will not mind Waughs  abiding Indian interest, it seems, though she is the one  who thought it was time for dad to hang his Australian green  baggy cap up on a nail.  At breakfast last week, Rosie  looked at her father and said: I dont want you to go away  anymore. Rosie will know if he does go  away, it will be only to Udayan, which, like her, is hoping  Waugh will now have more time for it. Udayan is my pursuit for life,  he had said on a visit in September. Shamlu Dudeja, of Calcutta  Foundation, said: Steve wants to build another shelter (Ashray)  for 200 girls. I hope to speak to him tomorrow about the  plan. Im sure hell have more time  to spend here, post-retirement, said Rev. James Stevens,  of Udayan. Although he did not specifically  mention that it was seven-year-old Rosie who forced the  decision, the most-capped player in Tests (164) has advanced  his retirement, sacrificing the opportunity to achieve one  unfulfilled wish: conquer India in India. He had initially planned to step  down after next Septembers tour of India, but now it will  be the last Test of the current series at home ground Sydney,  starting January 2, where Waugh will bow out  if it is  possible for this most stubborn of cricketers to bend   at the age of 38.  Its been in the back of my mind  for a little while now but Sydneys a great place to finish,  Waugh said. My present form and fitness suggests  I could play on, however all good things must come to an  end. That should be read as a dire  warning by Sourav Gangulys team, which can expect the regular  Waugh the Warrior to put on a coat or two more of war paint  in his last Test appearances. Indian vice-captain Rahul  Dravid, however, believes Waugh will play as only Waugh  does. Whether it is his first or last Test he would not  have played any differently, Dravid, a confessed admirer,  said. Theres also the possibility that  after Allan Border overtook Sunil Gavaskars number of Test  runs, another Indian record will fall to Australian hands. Already the second highest run-scorer  after Border, Waugh is only two Test hundreds away from  Gavaskars 34. Two centuries in four Tests to catch up with  Gavaskar against an Indian attack not known for running  through opposition is not too much to expect from someone  who scores at an average of over 51 runs per match. His recent form suggests that  the feat is very much within the realm of possibility. Waughs  career seemed to be on the rocks after a barren run last  year, but he defied critics with a stunning century in the  final Ashes Test against England (in Sydney) in January,  hitting a boundary off the final ball of the day to reach  his hundred. That innings seemed to revitalise  Waugh who has scored another four centuries since. Ill never forget what happened  in Sydney, no one will ever take that away, he said. There was a temptation to finish  up then but it wasnt about that one good moment. I wanted  to go when I was playing well and playing consistently. I feel Im playing consistently  and Im in good form now and I wanted to go when there was  still some fire in the belly. This fire turned him into the  most successful captain in Test history, as he converted  a struggling Australian team into arguably the best the  world has ever seen after taking charge in 1999. I think he set great examples  in the way cricket should be played and in tough conditions  he would produce some tremendous performances, said Sachin  Tendulkar. Waugh admits retiring for someone  so competitive will be hard. With one shoulder raised a  tad more than the other, Waugh brought to the field a quiet,  understated confidence. To satisfy his thirst for competition,  Waugh joked he would take on his four-year-old son Austin  in a game of backyard cricket. And the applause will not die.  Rosie and Lily, who is only two, and wife Lynette will be  around to give him a hand. Written with agency reports

 Thursday, January 16, 2003 				 MCC takes first step to unity
 							 - Maoists and splinter group to merge OUR BUREAU																								Ranchi, Jan. 15: The Maoist Communist Centre today nipped all talk of its cadre having undergone a lumpenisation process and announced its unification with the Revolutionary Communist Centre India (Maoist).																								Post-unification, the MCC, which becomes MCC (India), also expressed unflinching support for the struggle of the CPI-ML (Peoples War).																								MCC (India) expressed satisfaction with the growth of the peoples struggle in neighbouring Nepal, led by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), where, it said, the onslaught on the movement was from three quarters: Nepals ruling classes, backed by the Indian expansionists and imperialists, and the American imperialists.																								In a joint seven-page signed communique, dubbed a policy statement, the MCC and the RCCI (M) laid out their ideological positions and goals, while resolving to continue their struggle in the face of the assault of the ruling classes and forces of state repression. 																								The RCCI (M) is a splinter Naxalite outfit with a marginal presence in Jharkhand and Bihar.																								The communique, smacking of customary Communist literature, is suggestive of the MCCs new-found ideological finesse, gave a call for evolving a single Maoist Party in India. Today, in India, the development of a unified and single-statured Maoist Party is the pressing and the biggest need of the time. Our unity is a quite important step in this direction, it said.																								Our united organisation will be based on MLM (Marx-Lenin-Mao) and remain firmly committed to the long-cherished need of the great Indian people to carry forward and complete the new democratic revolution.... We have arrived at this much-awaited conclusion of far-reaching importance after a long period of highly healthy, intensive and thoroughgoing discussions on all the vital questions regarding the international as well as the Indian revolution, including the practical and organisational questions, said the hand-written release in English.																								High-powered delegations of both the outfits held the unity talks from January 1 to 4 at an undisclosed location but made the formal announcement today. The unification comes after the MCC and the Peoples War made similar efforts to join hands. Though the MCC remained silent on its unification with the Peoples War, it is understood that some ideological differences have hindered the process.																								The MCCs positive approach towards the Peoples War today, however, indicated that unification was not a lost cause yet. The two rebel groups together have expanded their influence in all districts of Jharkhand, except those in the Santhal Parganas. Todays extensive statement, therefore, delineated the strategy in the light of increasing rebel attacks on police in Jharkhand. The outfits have not indulged in mass killings of villagers in Jharkhand for almost two years now.																								The release outlined Jharkhand, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Dandakaranya as the core areas of peoples war and said the movement was advancing by boldly facing as well as resisting the most barbarous method of repression let loose by the reactionary ruling classes.																								The policy statement also confirmed the rebels strategy of guerrilla war and thereby encircling the cities from the countryside, which it has been practising with precision in Jharkhand.																								While supporting the Left movements in Peru, Turkey and the Philippines, it said the Prevention of Terrorism Act was enacted at the behest of the US government after the September 11 attacks. The MCC and the Peoples War are listed as outfits banned under the law.																								The release outlined Maoist party, protracted armed peoples war and the united front as its three magic weapons of the revolution.

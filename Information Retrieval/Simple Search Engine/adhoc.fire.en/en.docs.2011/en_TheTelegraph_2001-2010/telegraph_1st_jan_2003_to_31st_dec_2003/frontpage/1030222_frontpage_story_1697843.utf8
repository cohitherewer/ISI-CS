 Saturday, February 22, 2003 				 Bhojshala trap for Centre
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Feb. 21: In a move blessed by Sonia Gandhi, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh today recommended to the Centre that the doors of the disputed Bhojshala be thrown open to Hindus once a week minus the right to perform puja. 																								The suggestion to allow the majority community entry into the shrine every Tuesday  on a par with a similar concession to Muslims every Friday  comes a day after three persons were done to death in communal violence in Jhabua. Digvijay also released a seven-point formula based on an inter-community agreement thrashed out in 1995. 																								Digvijays decision is fraught with legal tangles that the Union culture ministry and the Archaeological Survey of India will have to grapple with. But he washed his hands of the matter, asking central forces and ASI officials to man the 11th century monument. 																								The Congress move has foxed its rivals and robbed them of an emotive poll plank ahead of the November elections. The Sangh is hell bent on dividing the country on communal lines. Let us see how they succeed in Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay said. 																								The saffron brigade was split in its reaction. While the state BJP leadership hailed it as a victory, the Hindu Jagran Manch dubbed it a case of too little too late. 																								The MP government has no locus standi. The ASI should decide on the basis of feelings and faith of the people of Dhar. The formula is a childish act by Digvijay Singh, manch convener Radheshayam Yadav said. 																								But the BJPs Uma Bharti termed the move a victory for the masses.

 Wednesday, September 03, 2003 				 Crack over blockades 
 ASHISH SINHA																								Ranchi, Sept. 2: Three days before the Assemblys monsoon session, a difference of opinion seems to have surfaced between Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari and the Arjun Munda government over road and rail blockades.																								The Assemblys privileges committee, chaired by Namdhari, today found the Chaibasa district administration guilty of misbehaving with deputy Speaker and Congress leader Bagun Sumbrai when he was leading a rail roko in April to demand a new train from Noamundi to Howrah.																								The indictment comes a few days after the home department appealed to the people and leaders not to block railways and roads and cause disruption.																								The same day, the Ranchi district administration warned against putting up road blockades, saying that not only would offenders demands not be met but compensation would also not be paid to the victims family if such a protest was against an accident.																								The action against the deputy Speaker took place when Sumbrai, with his supporters, allegedly tried to prevent rail movement at Chaibasa. Sumbrais son Hitler was taken to task by police after he allegedly misbehaved with a woman officer, Sandhya Rani. A case was registered against Hitler.																								Chaibasa deputy superintendent A.P. Singh, police superintendent P.K Singh and Sandhya Rani today appeared before the privileges committee and admitted their mistake. 																								Namdhari said since Sumbrai was among the protesters, the officials should have met him at the spot as this would have pacified the protesters.																								The advice runs contrary to the home departments appeal which suggests that instead of putting up blockades, protesters should meet the official concerned to put across their grievances.

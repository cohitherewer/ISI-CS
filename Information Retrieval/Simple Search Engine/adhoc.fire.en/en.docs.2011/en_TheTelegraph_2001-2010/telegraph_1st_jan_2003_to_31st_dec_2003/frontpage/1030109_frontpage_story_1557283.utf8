 Thursday, January 09, 2003 				 Now, extortion charge on cop
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 8: No crime is beyond police: murder of a colleague, plunder of a helpless woman.																								A policeman was arrested last night on the charge of extorting Rs 1,000 from a woman. Asura Bibi identified her tormentor as Rashid Ahmed, an assistant sub-inspector of Government Railway Police on deputation in the railway intelligence branch.																								The incident occurred with the death of sergeant Bapi Sen, battered by fellow policemen, fresh in memory.																								In her complaint, Asura Bibi said that after she got off a train from Mumbai, Ahmed asked her to prove her identity.																								I produced my identity card given by the Election Commission. The officer was not satisfied. He took me in front of the Foreigners Registration Office where no other policemen was around. After asking some irrelevant questions, he asked for Rs 1,000.																								The lady, in her mid-thirties, also alleged that she was robbed by a taxi driver and his helper as soon as she left Howrah station and stepped inside the vehicle. She said the duo snatched ornaments worth Rs 32,000 and Rs 4,000 in cash from her.																								She made the complaint to the police one-and-a-half days after the incident on Monday when she stepped off Mumbai Mail to head for her residence at Barasat in the outskirts of the city.																								Ashok Hazari, inspector-in-charge of Howrah GRP, who organised the identification parade, said: She was returning from her husbands place in Mumbai. Ahmed challenged the woman suspecting her to be a Bangladeshi infiltrator.																								When he started threatening me, I gave him the money. I was nervous. I had no idea where to go to make a complaint. So, I left the platform silently.																								Ajab Narayan Pandey, the deputy superintendent of police (headquarters) of Howrah GRP, said she returned with her brother-in-law last evening.

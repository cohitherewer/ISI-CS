 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 Veteran colonel soldiers on to salute Bapi as policemen play
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 18: He wasnt invited for Bapi Sens shradh nor did he know him, but the retired army colonel chose to fly down from Patna all the same to pay homage to the sergeant.																								Calcutta police, on the other hand, were too busy playing games to remember that a colleague had given up his life fighting drunken constables who were teasing a woman on New Years eve.																								From the commissioner to the lowliest constable  only one police officer showed up for the ceremony at the recreation club in Behala Government Quarters, where Bapi had lived. All were participating in the annual sports meet at the Alipore Bodyguard Lines, barely a five-minute drive from Bapis home.																								Only after the days fun and frolic was over did a Calcutta police representative squeeze out some time. Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner, detective department, turned up at the Parnasree complex shortly after 7 pm with condolences for Bapis family and, perhaps, a face-saver for his force.																								But Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee hadnt forgotten: he mentioned the sergeants sacrifice while addressing the police force at the end of the day. The incident has undoubtedly made us bow (our heads) in shame and tarnished the image of Calcutta police. We have lost a policeman like Bapi and wont get him back. We will have to remember him and what he has done, the chief minister said.																								For 83-year-old N.K. Sinha  a colonel of Kumaon regiment who retired in 1969  Bapis courage was inspiration enough. Being a soldier, I have come to pay homage to the departed soul of a young policeman who laid down his life to save a girl from the clutches of his rogue colleagues. As soon as I heard that today was the last chance to salute this braveheart, I decided to come here, he said.																								When Sinha, crouching inconspicuously in a corner of the club, slowly rose and walked towards Bapis photograph and bowed before it, the sergeants family did not recognise him. Only later  as he was getting ready to leave after lighting a candle in front of the picture  did Sinha speak up.																								He briefly spoke with Bapis elder brother Anup and handed Dingo, the sergeants 13-month son, Rs 100. Dont take it as financial help. It is a symbol of my honour to your fathers sacrifice, Sinha said.																								Anup said invites had been sent to select people only. People do not need invitations. They are coming and paying their homage silently, he said.																								Only Calcutta police chose to do otherwise, with Amit Banerjee, the officer-in-charge of Tollygunge traffic guard, being the sole representative to show up during the day.																								n Picture on Page 8

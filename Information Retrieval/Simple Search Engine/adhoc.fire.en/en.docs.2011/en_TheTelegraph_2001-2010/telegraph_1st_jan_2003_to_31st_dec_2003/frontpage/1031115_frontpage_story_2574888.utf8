 Saturday, November 15, 2003 				 Abducted youth smashed by stone 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 14: What began as a Stoneman scare  this time in a hospital  ended with the dramatic discovery that the man found lying with his face smashed beyond recognition was the kidnapped son of a Dum Dum businessman.																								A youth found on the campus of Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital yesterday has been identified as 20-year-old Mithun Koley, R.C. Saha, the officer investigating the case, said. 																								The student of a commerce college in Bangalore was last seen in Salt Lake on Monday afternoon.																								Mithun has been in coma since he was found. He was picked up from behind the gynaecological department building late on Thursday and admitted to the hospital, said officer-in-charge, Entally police station, bhranta Bandhu Majumdar.																								With no clues to his identity, Majumdar contacted Bidhannagar South police station on the hunch that it could be the youth missing from that area. But as no further leads were forthcoming, the OC decided to call the missing youths family.																								Mithuns relatives came to the hospital this afternoon and immediately identified him. They shifted him to a nursing home in Salt Lake. 																								He is in the ICU with serious head injuries. A CT scan has been done, but the results have not come in. Doctors are waiting to ascertain whether internal bleeding has taken place before deciding on the next course of treatment, said an uncle of Mithun.																								The son of businessman Ashim Koley, Mithun had gone to a restaurant near Salt Lake stadium on Monday afternoon. 																								In the evening, the first ransom call came  for Rs 50 lakh. Another call followed, scaling down the demand to Rs 15 lakh.																								After the calls, the Koleys filed a complaint with Dum Dum police station. The Bidhannagar South thana was alerted, but little headway was made for 72 hours.																								Then came the chance breakthrough. A section of the NRS hospital staff noticed a youth with a badly battered face lying unconscious. 																								From the clothes he was wearing, it was apparent that he came from a well-to-do family, one of them said.																								It has been a nightmare for us since Monday evening. At least we have found him now. The rest is up to the doctors, and god, said a family member keeping vigil at the Salt Lake nursing home.

 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Exchange of rhetoric on ceasefire
 							 - Pakistan and India ask each other to act IMTIAZ GUL AND SEEMA GUHA																								Islamabad/New Delhi, Aug. 12: In a rare meeting with five dozen Indian MPs and journalists, President Pervez Musharraf today linked a ceasefire in Kashmir to what he called reciprocity by India.																								Reciprocity can be demonstrated by cessation of atrocities in India-occupied Kashmir, reduction in troops level, allowing political activity and the detained people to travel freely around the globe, he said after the talks with the Indians who are in Islamabad for a South Asia Free Media Association conference.																								Musharraf said these are elements of reciprocity that must be there when we talk of the possibility of a ceasefire in an area where military operations are going on.																								Any unilateral attempt (by Pakistan to hold fire) in that direction may not be practicable, he said.																								India reacted with scepticism. There is nothing to prevent Pakistan-aided terrorists to stop their activities inside Jammu and Kashmir. Once these activities stop, there would inevitably be a change in the necessary measures required to be taken by the security forces, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said.																								Some news agencies had quoted Musharraf as having offered a ceasefire. But a Pakistani official clarified: What Musharraf meant was that you can bring about a ceasefire by a single blow of the whistle but you have to first work out the modalities for a real ceasefire.																								Musharrafs intention was to highlight the necessity of resuming talks. 																								The general told the Indians that he advocated an offensive search for peace, saying that Delhi would not find lacking the basic element of sincerity in Pakistan. We must learn from history and look for a better future, burying mutual suspicions.																								He described sincerity as the basic ingredient for normalisation of relations. Both the countries suffer from common conditions of poverty, lack of health, education and basic amenities of life. Let us be sincere to the cause of peace and for the deprived people of the region.																								We must talk at the official level and not sideline the issues, including Kashmir, which had bedevilled relations, the President said.																								Bulbeer Punj, a BJP member who is part of the delegation, later said Musharraf scored a diplomatic victory by speaking his heart out.																								Privately, senior Indian officials dismissed Musharrafs words as his usual propaganda spin. The officials said Delhi would have taken him seriously if there was a change in the ground situation. We see no indication of that.																								For now, when the country is in election mode, the government is unlikely to change its step-by-step peace moves.

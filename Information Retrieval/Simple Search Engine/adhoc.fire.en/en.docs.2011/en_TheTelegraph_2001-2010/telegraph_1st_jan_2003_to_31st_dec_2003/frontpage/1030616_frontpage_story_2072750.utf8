Story  Board breaks from past, not chaos
 A STAFF REPORTER  A student in front of a cyber cafe Calcutta, June 15: Last years fiasco  on papers and inside courtrooms  cast a shadow on this years Madhyamik results, forcing the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education away from tried and tested conventions.Provisional, not final, was what officials said as they picked a Sunday during the summer vacation to announce this years results that found 70.45 per cent candidates passing. But the message that came out of the Park Street office of the board  scarred by the lawsuits of 2002  had a better safe than sorry buzz about it.The 2003 results had a lot of firsts going with it. First, there was no first boy or girl  in fact, no top-10 list at all. Instead, the board announced a list of 588 nameless candidates who scored a 100 in at least one subject.

The declaration of the magic number  the highest score of 788 out of a maximum 800  led to a day of rumours with several students claiming that they had either got exactly that number or were very close to it.From Malda to Coochbehar, from Midnapore to South 24-Parganas, there were too many claimants to 788. By the end of the day, Soumyajit De of Burdwan Town School emerged with 788. I have got the number, he told reporters after visiting the nearest cyber caf.If what De said was true, he was lucky. With thousands of Madhyamik examinees crowding cyber cafes, the sites were jammed. A similar experience befell those who tried the SMS route. Together, these resulted in an overwhelming majority not being  Copyright

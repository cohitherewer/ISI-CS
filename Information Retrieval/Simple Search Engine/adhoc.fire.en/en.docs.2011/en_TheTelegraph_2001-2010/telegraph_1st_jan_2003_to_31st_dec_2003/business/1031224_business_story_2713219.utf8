 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Early-disclosure funds from UTI
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Damodaran: Trust me																								Mumbai, Dec. 23: UTI Mutual Fund (UTI MF) will soon launch six schemes that will give investors a wider choice on where they would like their money to go, besides disclosing the proportion to be spread among competing financial instruments like stock or debt. In financial jargon, the portfolio will be known before hand.																								The announcement came from UTI chief M. Damodaran, who said this while sharing his year-end assessment of the way the UTI MF has fared since it was carved out of Unit Trust of India (UTI) in February.																								The high-point was the surge in assets under management to over Rs 19,000 crore, seen as a sign of growing investor confidence. The six new schemes on the anvil will raise another Rs 1,000-1,200 crore.																								The funds will invest their corpus in banking, automobile, basic industries, public sector, large cap and mid-cap funds when they are launched in phases next year.																								An upbeat Damodaran said investors in UTI MF could expect better rewards in the months ahead if the gains from booming stock markets continue to pour in. This will be in addition to the Rs 900 crore in dividend and bonus payments it has already handed them so far.																								With a base of more than 10 million investors, the fund has been successful in garnering funds of over Rs 3,000 crore since February and its assets managed is now Rs 19,011 crore, including Rs 400 crore in offshore funds.																								The accent is now on improving employee efficiency, attracting better talent and focussing on recoveries of non-performing assets (NPAs). In 2004, we will see a large number of recoveries. All these will push up the net asset values , said Damodaran.																								Officials said the fund will shortly become a zero-NPA company following an aggressive provisioning policy totalling Rs 967 crore.																								They added that the mutual fund is now in the process of setting up Asrec, an asset reconstruction company, with a capital base of Rs 5 crore along with Life Insurance Corporation, which has a 10 per cent stake.  UTI Bank stake UTI-I will not offload its holding  in UTI Bank Ltd and instead be part of UTI brand to exploit  business synergies. The UTI Bank was a good asset and investment,  Damodaran said.

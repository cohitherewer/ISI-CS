 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 14: Herbal products maker Sunrider International has set up a $1-million manufacturing facility in Gurgaon and hopes to carve out a huge market in the next five years.																								Sunrider, a $700-million California-based company, proposes to introduce herbal-based health-food products, beauty and personal-care products in the Indian market at competitive prices.																								We are targeting sales worth $10 million each month in India after a period of five years, said Tei Fu Chen, chairman of Sunrider International.																								Sunrider has plants in China, California and Taiwan. Chen said China, North America, Taiwan and Singapore are its best selling markets.																								The company hopes to employ a large number of Indian marketing agents and distributors for its direct selling initiative.																								We are offering an amazing marketing plan, which gives the agent an opportunity to earn up to 58.5 per cent of the total sales volume of the company, said Chen. Admitting that its 100 per cent subsidiary, Sunrider India, which has been operating for the last four years, is not doing too well, he said, We are embarrassed to announce its turnover. But after researching a lot, we are confident that we will do well in India.																								The company has been selling its products in a limited way in southern and north-eastern India. The pricing is high. But most of the products are in concentrated form and offers more value for money.																								At present, the total size of herbal products industry in India is Rs 4,000 crore.																								With the entry of a number of multinational companies, it is difficult to determine at what rate this industry is growing.

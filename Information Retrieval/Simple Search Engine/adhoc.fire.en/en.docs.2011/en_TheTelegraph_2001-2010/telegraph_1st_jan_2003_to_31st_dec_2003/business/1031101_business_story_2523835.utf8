 OUR BUREAUX																								Oct. 31: Indian Oil Corporation has registered a net profit of Rs 2,751 crore for the first half of the current fiscal which is Rs 388 crore (12 per cent) lower than the net profit of Rs 3,139 crore recorded in the same period last year.

The turnover of the company increased by 7 per cent to cross the Rs 66,600-crore mark in the six-month period. 																								IOCs earnings per share has come down to Rs 23.56 in the reporting period from Rs 26.87 crore in the year-ago period. 																								Bharat Petro																								Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) today reported a 46.9 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 477.1 crore during the quarter ended September 30, 2003 as against Rs 324.6 crore posted last fiscal.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT  New Delhi, Dec. 11: The  government has decided to introduce a comprehensive legislation  which will amend the Chartered Accountants (CA) Act of 1949,  Cost and Works Accountants Act 1959 and Company Secretaries  Act of 1980. 																								The new legislation to bring in changes in the regulations governing these three apex professional bodies will also see the setting up of a Quality Review Board (QRB) to monitor the standards of professionalism in the three bodies.																								The move comes on the back of a number of auditing scandals. The administrative ministry for these three professional bodies which act as watchdogs of the Indian corporate sector is the department of company affairs.																								The amendment to the CA acts incorporates most of the recommendations made by the Naresh Chandra committee on corporate audit and governance. 																								The new bill will be sent to the standing committees of Parliament. Since Parliament is in session, the details pertaining to the provisions of the bill was not shared by Swaraj. 																								Reacting to the cabinet announcement, ICAI secretary Ashok Haldia, said, The details of the amendments are not yet known but we can say that the changes in the CA Act deals with issues on which ICAI had recommended to the government.																								Meanwhile, ICAI is collaborating with the Government Accounting Standards Advisory Board (GASAB)  which was set up by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor general of India (CAG)  to frame standards for government accounts in India. 																								At present, there are three two topics on which exposure drafts are in the final stages and will be ready within the next one month. These are on cash flow statements and accounting and classification of grants-in-aid.																								Another area that GASAB is working on is the simplification of the presentation of financial statements, to make it more comprehensible to the general people and to make it more transparent and comprehensible. 																								In 10 years from now, government accounts, should be as comprehensible and easy to understand as corporate accounts, said S. Sathyamoorthy deputy comptroller and Auditor general, who is the chairperson of the GASAB.

 Friday, May 30, 2003 				 India high on foreign investors wishlist
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 29: India continues to figure high on the wishlist of foreign investors.																								A Ficci survey on foreign direct investment (FDI) for 2003 says that 40 per cent of the foreign investors see India as a positive investment destination, while 44 per cent see it as neutral and the remaining 16 per cent have a negative assessment of the country.																								Out of the 135 multinational companies with substantial foreign holding in India that were surveyed, an impressive 82 per cent perceived opportunities for greater FDI in their own sector.																								Moreover, 62 per cent of respondents reported making profits in their Indian operations and another 9 per cent said that they are breaking even. Also, 53 per cent companies said their capacity utilisation was in excess of 75 per cent.																								The survey states that 78 per cent of companies have plans to expand their Indian operations while the remaining intend to maintain their existing level of activities. This result seems encouraging in the backdrop of the fact that the last FDI survey pointed that only 51 per cent were planning for expansions in India.																								The overall policy framework for FDI in India is rated as good to average by 82 per cent of the respondents as compared with 63 per cent in the last survey.

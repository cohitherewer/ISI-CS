 Friday, March 07, 2003 				 Easier norms for duty drawback
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 6: The government has simplified the duty drawback procedure to boost exports on lines of the recommendations of the Kelkar committee, the finance ministry said in a statement here today.																								The new rules allow manufacturers to self certify documents stating they have not availed of various Cenvat rebates while claiming duty drawbacks. 																								Duty drawback is a rebate of input stage duties of customs and central excise, which renders the goods competitive in the international market. 																								As per the current central excise rule, the rebate is granted on the amount of duty paid on taxable goods, which are used for exports. The finance ministry said exporters will be eligible for excise rebate even if it sublets the production work to manufacturers, not registered with the central excise.

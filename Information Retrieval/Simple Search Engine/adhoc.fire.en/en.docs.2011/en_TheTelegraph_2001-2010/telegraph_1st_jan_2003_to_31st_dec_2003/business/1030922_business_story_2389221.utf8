 Monday, September 22, 2003 				 World Bank reforms alert
																								New Delhi, Sept. 21 (PTI): The World Bank today warned India will not be able to reduce poverty and improve human development by 2015 without socio-economic reforms percolating to the poor.																								Without improvement in policy, most states in India will not be able to accomplish the millennium development goals, which calls for halving the global incidence of poverty and broad improvements in human development by 2015, it said in the World Development Report 2004. The report said improvement in human welfare will not occur unless poor receive wider access to affordable, better quality services in health, education, water, sanitation and electrification.																								Without such improvements, freedom from illness and freedom from illiteracy  two of the most important ways poor people can escape poverty  will remain elusive to many, it said.

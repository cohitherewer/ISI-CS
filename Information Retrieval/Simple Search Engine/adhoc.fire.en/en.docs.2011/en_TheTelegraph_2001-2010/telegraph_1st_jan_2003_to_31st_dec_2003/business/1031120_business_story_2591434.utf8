 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 19: Pfizer India and the Bayer group today joined hands in a strategic marketing alliance through which the former will market Bayers international range of livestock and animal health products.																								The arrangement is slated to combine two complementary product portfolios with an unprecedented therapeutic reach in all segments of the animal healthcare business, Pfizer India said. 																								The alliance will introduce Bayticol pour-on, Drontal Plus tablets, Bayrocin 10 per cent injectable, Baycox 2.5 oral solution and Negasunt powder to Pfizers existing portfolio.																								While Pfizer has a strong presence in the country in both human pharmaceuticals and animal health business, Bayer has a diversified business, including agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, and has production facilities at 14 sites. It has marked India as a promising market in the Asia Pacific region. Currently, Glaxo Smithkline has a major share in the animal health business in the country.																								The agreement was signed today by Bayer Group country speaker Stephan Gerlich and Pfizer India managing director Hocine Sidi Said.																								Bayer HealthCare head Praveen Singh said, Bayer, which is ranked among the top five companies in animal health worldwide, has a presence in the companion animals and livestock segments in India. This arrangement enables Bayer to introduce the latest products and application technology, which will benefit the Indian animal health industry.																								It is a win-win situation for both companies. The value of the combined portfolio will be enhanced through the Pfizer field force, which is regarded as one of the best in the industry, and well respected by veterinarians, Said added.																								Pfizer Animal Health started its operations in India in 1964 primarily in the cattle market. In 1995, Pfizer Inc acquired SmithKline Beechams animal health business worldwide resulting in a separate poultry team and subsequently, a companion animal team in India.

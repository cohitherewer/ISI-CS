 Friday, October 10, 2003 				 Yahoo doubles net profit
 BEN BERKOWITZ																								Los Angeles, Oct. 9 (Reuters): Internet media company Yahoo Inc. on Wednesday posted a profit more than double last year and raised its annual earnings guidance, sparked by a red hot web advertising market and its recent acquisition of Overture Services.																								Shares in Yahoo were up just over 1 per cent at $39.31 in after-hours on Instinet, following the financial communitys initial enthusiastic reaction.																								I think it was just an awesome result, said Safa Rashtchy, an analyst at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray.																								Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo reported a net profit for the third quarter of $65.3 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $28.9 million, or 5 cents a share. Revenue rose to $356.8 million from $248.8 million last year.																								Financial analysts average estimates called for earnings per share of 9 cents on revenue of $337.2 million, according to Reuters Research, a unit of Reuters Group Plc.																								Revenue in marketing services, the companys widely watched division responsible for advertising and sponsored search services, rose 48 per cent from last year to $245.1 million.																								It was a very good quarter and illustrative of the fact that the online advertising business is thriving right now, said Derek Brown, of Pacific Growth Equities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, January 21, 2003 				 Slow-growth forecast for e-governance
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 20: E-governance, in spite of an 18 per cent growth last year, is unlikely to make progress due to operational, economic, personnel, planning and implementation issues. Estimated at Rs 1,400 crore in 2001-02, it was the fastest growing vertical in the domestic IT market.																								Nasscom has conducted a survey of 10 states that have implemented e-governance. The findings indicate that the southern states are leading in terms of implementing projects at different citizen-government interface points. West Bengal, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Rajasthan are catching up.																								The main impediment is that e-governance projects have invested heavily in hardware and very little in developing software and services, which could maximise hardware investments, said Nasscom chairman Arun Kumar.

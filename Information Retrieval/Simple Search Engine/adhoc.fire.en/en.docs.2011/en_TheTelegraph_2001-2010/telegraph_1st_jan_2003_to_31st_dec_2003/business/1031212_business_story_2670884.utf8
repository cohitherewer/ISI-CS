 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 11: Gartners latest survey reveals what subscribers suspected all along  VSNL has been rated significantly below the industry average for international leased lines.																								VSNL is rated significantly below the industry average for international leased lines. As for local access lines, both BSNL and MTNL were rated lowest among 20 major Asian carriers, well below the industry average, the report says. 																								India still has a long way to go in terms of telecom service quality, said To Chee Eng, principal telecom analyst in Gartner. The country needs to improve its service quality quickly if it wants to be the IT and outsourcing hub for multinational corporations, he warned. 																								Large enterprises, fuelled by the boom in IT and outsourcing services, will drive the demand for telecom services in India over the next five years. But the country has to first overcome an underlying problem  the quality of its corporate data services, particularly local access lines (that provide internet connection), still lags far behind international standards.																								The findings are based on responses from 139 network managers in multinational companies. They were asked to rate their service providers on a range of international services, including leased lines, frame relay, ATM and IP-VPN, as well as local access services. The evaluation is based on the following criteria: reliability, performance, support, installation and repairs, optional features and pricing.																								Kobita Desai, principal telecom analyst and co-author of the report, told The Telegraph that the situation is turning out to be challenging for the country. With several business process outsourcing (BPO) companies setting up base here, labour is not the only deciding factor for BPOs, available telecom infrastructure is also a major factor.																								However, there are some bright spots. International service quality has actually improved. But its inconsistent, often due to problems in the local access lines. Prices have also come down significantly. They are far from cheap, but not expensive either  even by Asian standards, Desai added.																								The last-mile connection continues to be the weakest link. BSNL and MTNL were rated fair and below for reliability, performance and support for installation and repairs. To circumvent the problem, an increasing number of enterprises and international carriers are seeking out alternative carriers such as Bharti, Reliance and Tata to provide the access circuits. 																								Competition will put pressure on the dominant carriers to improve their service or lose market share as alternative carriers expand their local loop, she said. The best way to improve quality is competition. This is beginning to happen in international and long-distance services. It will take longer to happen in the local loop due to the high investment and long rollout times, she added.

 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Fee-cut prop for BSE derivatives
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 11: The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has cut membership fee for its derivatives segment by Rs 2 lakh. Membership of the exchanges futures and options segment now costs only Rs 3 lakh.																								BSEs derivative segment has not quite taken off, and a year ago its management was reported to have even considered closing it down. Instead of shutting down, the bourse chose to cut fees to keep the segment afloat.																								The derivatives segment of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), on the other hand, is roaring with activity. Its turnover has surpassed that of the cash market, and its still going up.																								Besides the membership fee, an applicant will have to pay Rs 7.5 lakh in cash and securities towards a refundable deposit. What is more, transaction charges have been brought down to as low as 25 paise per lakh.																								BSEs charges and fees are not even comparable with NSEs  even for an existing cash market member  but the problem is derivatives trading on BSE hasnt taken off as yet, said a senior broker.																								Daily turnover of the BSEs derivatives segment rarely exceeds Rs 50 crore, whereas on the NSE, its approaching Rs 10,000 crore. NSEs futures and options segment today registered a turnover of Rs 8,770 crore. BSEs new rates are applicable for both individual and corporate members. The applicant has to have a minimum net worth of Rs 25 lakh, which is Rs 30 lakh for NSE.

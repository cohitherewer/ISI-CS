 Friday, September 26, 2003 				 Air-India cuts Europe, US fares
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 25: State-run international carrier Air-India today said it will offer lower fare on some routes, to boost traffic, during the slack-season October-December period.																								As per the new economy class fares, a two-way London trip from either Delhi or Mumbai would cost Rs 26,000, down from the earlier Rs 34,000. While, a two-way flight to Frankfurt would cost Rs 25,000 instead of Rs 34,000 and to New York would cost Rs 4,500 less at Rs 43,000.																								At the same time, domestic state carrier Indian Airlines also announced holiday packages, applicable till the financial year ending March 31, 2004, for Malaysia, Kathmandu and Sharjah.																								The six-day tourism package, which includes return two-way fare, accommodation, food and sight-seeing, would be available from Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai.																								Air-India said, The new rates would be 15 to 25 per cent lower than those applicable during the peak season July-September period to attract passengers, adding ongoing-promotional schemes would still continue.																								Passengers travelling to London, Paris, Frankfurt, New York and Chicago would be eligible for the lower fares, the statement added.																								Airline officials said the lower traffic is generally registered in the Europe and America bound flights and so fares in other sectors have not been reduced.																								The seat-load factor during these three months fall to 45-50 per cent but improves after December, the official said.																								The carriers decision to slash fares for the remaining three months of the year, comes on the back of lower fares announced by British Airways.

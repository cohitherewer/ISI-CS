 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 L amp;T arms Naik with more powers 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Naik: Feather in the cap																								Mumbai, Dec. 30: A. M. Naik was today appointed the chairman and managing director of Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T). Naik is L amp;Ts first whole-time executive chairman in over a decade.																								The decision to elavate Naik as the companys chairman and managing director was taken at a board meeting today. He was appointed as the managing director and CEO of L amp;T in April 1999.																								Naik is also the first to have risen from the executive ranks of the company to be appointed chairman. L amp;T has not had an executive chairman since N. M. Desai retired in March 1989.																								Since Naik took over the mantle at L amp;T, he has been focussing on restructuring into operating divisions and he also led a transformation process. Recently in a major move, he led a move to de-merge L amp;Ts cement business to Grasim Industries wherein a proposal of an employees foundation/trust was also conceptualised.																								In the board meeting held today, the directors also decided to divest the companys glass container business. The transaction is likely to be consummated by this fiscal. It is expected to fetch L amp;T close to Rs 100 crore.																								While L amp;T had earlier also divested its cork business, it has identified heavy engineering, industrial machinery, electronics and electricals, information technology, construction and projects as its core areas of operations.

 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 Cell firms one up on basic players 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 20: Cellular service providers have scored over basic operators in meeting telecom regulator Trais benchmarks for quality of service.																								A report on the quality of service in the telecom industry shows that the cellular mobile operators have improved their performance, while the basic operators have fallen short of the benchmarks set by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).																								The report says that for the quarter ended September 2003, basic operators were in general able to meet benchmarks in only two areas  Grade of Service and Meantime to Repair (MTTR).																								However, the cellular mobile operators improved performance in 7 out of 10 benchmarks compared with the previous quarter.																								Basic and cellular service providers are required to submit to Trai the performance report of their networks under their service area for every quarter in the format prescribed by the regulator.																								On comparing the performance of (basic) operators with that of the previous quarter, it is seen that there is a scope for major improvement in case of most of the parameters, a Trai report said.																								Against the benchmark of three faults per 100 subscribers per month, the figures of some of the operators  Tata (Tamil Nadu), MTNL (Delhi), MTNL (Mumbai) and BSNL (Rajasthan) are 43.8, 32.6, 16.3 and 13.9, respectively.																								Similarly, against the benchmark of 65 per cent call completion rate in local network, the majority of the operators have achieved figures ranging between 40 per cent and 55 per cent.																								In percentage of repeat faults category, it is found that most of the operators are not meeting the required benchmark of less than 1 per cent in a month, the report said. Non-achievement of this benchmark indicates that subscribers complaints are not being properly attended. 																								In case of cellular mobile services, the benchmark for the parameter faults cleared within 24 hrs is 100 per cent. The performance of BSNL (Rajasthan), Hexacom (Rajasthan), BSNL (Gujarat) is 65 per cent, 73.5 per cent, and 74 per cent, respectively. Similarly, against the benchmark of 0.1 per cent for complaints for 100 bills received, Hutchison Essar (Karnataka), BSNL (Andhra Pradesh) and BSNL (Kerala) have figures of 70 per cent, 4.1 per cent and 4.0 per cent, respectively.																								Trai has said in the parameters concerning billing and refund, there has been a deterioration in the performance. The reasons for this may include inadequate infrastructure and large changes in tariff packages and services available.

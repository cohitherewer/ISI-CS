 Tuesday, February 18, 2003 				 Jute goods export gets back lustre
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Feb, 17: Jute product export business has registered an encouraging performance during the first nine months of the current fiscal and is expected to reach Rs 900 crore by March. Even then jute goods export may finally miss the annual target by about Rs 100 crore. Target for the current year was set at Rs 1,000 crore but the year may close with a total export of Rs 900 crore, according to the jute commissioner S. Majumdar.																								Jute goods export during April-December 2002 at Rs 614 crore has surpassed previous years export of Rs 613 crore. 																								Majumdar said the ratio of traditional and diversified jute products export of 67 and 33 per cent, respectively, is being maintained in the market. The industry and the government is upbeat about maintaining the demand for traditional and diversified jute goods in both domestic and international markets. 																								Despite a dilution of the compulsory jute packaging order major food grains procurement agencies, the Food Corporation of India and the state corporations of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh have maintained their sacking orders for the ensuing rabi crop. The government had recently diluted the mandatory packaging order by 20 per cent for the current year for food grains and 25 per cent for sugar. The dilution is to go up progressively in the coming years.																								Even the private sector sugar industry has ignored the dilution and chose to use jute sacks for bulk packing for the current crushing season, according to G. M. Singhvi, chairman of the Indian Jute Mills Association.

 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Shot in the arm for Wockhardt
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Booster dose																								Mumbai, Dec. 23: Wockhardt has been granted five years of exclusive marketing rights (EMR) for its topical anti-bacterial drug Nadoxin (Nadifloxacin) by the Indian Controller General of Patents and Trademarks. 																								Wockhardt said it is the first domestic pharmaceutical company to receive an EMR grant. 																								The approval comes after a similar nod received by Novartis for its anti-cancer drug Glivec.																								Wockhardt said it had filed a mail-box application in India in 2002 for its product of invention and that a patent for a process to make the product of the invention was granted in 2003.																								Nadoxin was approved for marketing in India in 2002. The EMR is valid for five years from the date of approval by the Patents Controller or until the grant of the product patent in India, whichever is earlier. Wockhardt will thus have sole marketing rights for the products till 2008.																								The grant of the EMR by the Indian Patent Controller to a domestic pharmaceutical company like Wockhardt sends a positive signal to the international community that the amendments introduced in the India Patents (Amendment) Act, 2002, are in keeping with the governments intentions to meet its TRIPS obligations, while protecting the interests of Indias domestic companies, chairman Habil Khorakiwala.																								Since the early 1970s, very few topical antibacterials have been launched in India, leading to bacterial resistance against the older drugs, they added. A post-marketing surveillance study conducted on 696 patients across the country has established a 99 per cent success rate for Nadoxin, the company said.																								The EMR granted to Novartis had faced opposition when some said the anti-cancer drug could provide the leverage to its holders to interfere with the generic production and distribution of this drug. The controversy erupted as Natco, a Hyderabad-based company, had launched a similar product on Glivecs lines, under the brand name, Veenat. Ranbaxy approval																								Ranbaxy, which announced a change of guard at the top yesterday, continued with its aggressive gameplan in the US market by securing approval to market liquid anti-infective drug Cefaclor. 																								The US market for this anti-infective drug in the US is estimated at $21.3 million. The original innovator of the drug is Eli Lilly, which sells it in the liquid form under the brand name Ceclor. Ranbaxy will market this product under the brand name Raniclor. 																								A Ranbaxy spokesperson said the liquid form of Cefaclor holds a 27 per cent market share and tablets have a 73 per cent market share. Both the segments will be affected by this new dosage form, he said.

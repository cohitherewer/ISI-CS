 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 Jagson to buy five aircraft
																								New Delhi, Feb. 15 (PTI): Private carrier Jagson Airlines, which recently bagged the scheduled operator status, is negotiating with global manufacturers to acquire at least five aircraft, including 50-seater jets and helicopters within this calendar year.																								The airline, which is known for its Dornier operations to Himachal Pradesh, has already acquired a chopper from the Rajasthan government for charter flights and was planning to launch a thrice-a-week Dornier service between Delhi and Rajkot via Jaipur from February 26, its chairman Jagdish P. Gupta said here.																								Price negotiations are currently on with the plane manufacturers for acquisition of the jets, which we plan to put into operation by the third quarter of this year, he said, adding this was the first phase of its fleet expansion programme.																								The company was negotiating with Brazilian firm Embraer, French ATR and Canadian CRJ.																								Stating that the next new route it would start operating was Nagpur-Raipur-Calcutta, he said the carrier had plans to fly on trunk routes with the new small jets at noontime when the major airlines do not operate. We will fill in the gap on these routes, Gupta said. 																								The Dorniers on these proposed routes would be later replaced by the 50-seater jets, Gupta said.																								Jagson has already received the necessary approvals for its fleet expansion programme, including those from the directorate general of civil aviation.																								Replying to questions, the Jagson chairman said the airline also had plans to be in the queue for operating to Saarc countries if the government permits.																								Having got one six-seater Chetak helicopter and planning to buy one eight-seater from the European chopper firm Eurocopter, Jagson would soon start its new helicopter division based in the national capital, he said.

 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Lehman back-office back home
																								New York, Dec. 16 (AP): Lehman Brothers Holdings has stopped using Indian workers for its internal computer help desk, in another sign of backlash against using offshore labour. The New York-based financial-services firm last year hired two Indian firms  Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro  to manage some of its information-technology operations.																								About six weeks ago, however, Lehman stopped outsourcing its IT help desk, which handles employee reports of computer problems, to Wipro.																								Lehman spokeswoman Kerrie Cohen confirmed that the firm has brought the help-desk function back in-house. Lehmans top IT executives disclosed some details of the change last month on a conference call with Louis Miscioscia, a Lehman IT-services analyst, and with clients. The conference call was held to discuss trends in technology spending.																								Lehman continues to outsource other IT functions, including software application development, applications support and some IT infrastructure support, Miscioscia said. Lehman, which uses about 450 workers at Tata and Wipro, has generated savings of about 40 per cent to 50 per cent, he said. 																								Meanwhile, TCS has clarified that it continues to work with Lehman. With reference to reports in the media, TCS reiterates that it continues to do work with Lehman and the decision as reported, does not impact the TCS-Lehman engagement in any manner, Atul Tackle, V-P, corporate communications, TCS said.

		 Monday, December 29, 2003  Q amp;A				 Seniority claim
																																																																																													What is the maximum standard deduction one could claim? Are senior citizens entitled to a special tax rebate?																																																																													K. Paul, Calcutta
																																																																																													The maximum standard deduction that one could claim is Rs 30,000 or one-third of taxable income whichever is lower. 																																																																																													ior citizens are entitled to a special tax rebate of Rs 20,000 under section 88B of the Income Tax Act. This means a person aged above 65 will not have to pay any tax for taxable income up to Rs 153,000.																																					Stuck with shares																																																																																															I have 100 shares of Kalse Info that was listed on the Delhi Stock Exchange. Ive read in newspapers that the bourse is closed and is going to be merged with the Bombay Stock Exchange. I have access to the Bombay and National stock exchanges now. How can I sell these shares?																																																																													A. K. Santra, Jamshedpur
																																																																																													The National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) does not have record of any company called Kalse Info. But since you mentioned that you bought it in the demat mode, the share you meant is likely to be Kals Info. The sad news is neither appears to be listed on the NSE or BSE. This means you may not be able to sell the shares till trading on the Delhi Stock Exchange has resumed. Thats the problem of buying shares listed only on regional bourses. However, if you could confirm the name of the company, and give other relevant details, we could forward your query to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).																																					In search of better options																																																																																															I am a salaried person and have invested in the post office monthly income scheme and National Savings Certificates. Are there better ways of saving my money?																																																																													T. R. Anand, Calcutta
																																																																																													Well, if youre comfortable with the return on these instruments, theres no better way to invest your money. These products are government-guaranteed, and absolutely risk-free.																																																																																													However, if you are looking for a better return on your savings, you should look to invest a bit in stocks as well. If you have no experience of investing in stocks, you should route your money through a mutual fund scheme.																																																																																													However, if you are completely averse to risk, you could consider Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana if you are above 55. It pays 9 per cent annually.

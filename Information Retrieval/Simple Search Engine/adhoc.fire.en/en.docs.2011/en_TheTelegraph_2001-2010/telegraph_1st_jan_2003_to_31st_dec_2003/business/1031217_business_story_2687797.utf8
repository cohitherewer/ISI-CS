 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 RPG builds up big-ticket expansion kitty
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Goenka: Money mission																								Calcutta, Dec. 16: The RPG group might raise Rs 2,000 crore to fund expansion over the next two years, vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said. It proposes to raise the amount through a combination of debt and equity.																								The group is planning to invest heavily in CESC and close to Rs 200 crore each in its carbon black and tyre businesses. 																								Goenka said CESC was planning to set up a power plant, which alone could cost Rs 1,000 crore. In addition, we are increasing our carbon black production capacity, which would cost close to Rs 200 crore.																								Alongside, the group is planning to cut more jobs and divest non-core businesses, which include its mobile phone and pharmaceutical companies. Goenka said, the group was hoping to complete the sale of RPG Cellular within the next few weeks.																								It has already sold off a number of companies to release resources for its core businesses  power, retailing, tyre and commodities (rubber and carbon black).																								The RPG group currently employs around 50,000 people, having cut some 12,000 jobs over the last two years. Over the next two years, the group is looking to retire 8,000 more. CESC alone could account for 2,000 more job cuts. Around 2,300 employees of the company recently opted for early retirement. Split option																								The CESC management is expected to decide by February whether to carve up the power utility into two firms  one dealing with generation and the other, with transmission and distribution. A team of CESC officials has been engaged to examine the advantages of separating the operations.																								CESC is planning to refinance its borrowings to reduce interest cost. It pays 13.5 per cent on its Rs 3,000-crore debt, having brought it down from around 18 per recently. The interest it pays is still too high, and could be reduced further. CESC is engaging credit rating agencies to evaluate its creditworthiness as the first step towards refinancing its borrowings. Phillips Carbon Black																								Phillips Carbon Black today announced its net profit in the year ended in September had jumped 244 per cent on the back of a 10 per cent growth in sales.																								The company earned Rs 543.13 crore in revenues during the year, which was Rs 48.64 crore higher than 2001-02. Its Rs 18.6-crore net profit for the year translates into an earning per share (EPS) of Rs 10.48.																								Goenka said significant growth in carbon black offtake was expected next year. We have reached an agreement with a leading tyre manufacturer for export of 25,000 tonnes of carbon black. We are negotiating with another tyre manufacturer for a similar deal, he added.																								The company is raising the capacity of its plant at Baroda that produces 18,000 tonnes at present, by 70,000 tonnes. A 12-megawatt power plant is also being set up at the unit. Expansion at the Baroda unit will cost Rs 100 crore.																								The production capacity of its plant at Durgapur is being scaled up by 25,000 tonnes to 1.5 lakh tonnes, while a 20-megawatt power station is also being set up. The proposed capital expenditure on the unit in Durgapur is Rs 80 crore.																								The company is also on the lookout for opportunities of inorganic growth in neighbouring countries.

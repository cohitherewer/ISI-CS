The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, January 21, 2003 				 Infotech to clock 30% growth 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 20: The domestic information, communications and telecommunications market (ICT) is expected to grow by 25-30 per cent this year and will be the fastest growing ICT market in the world. However, China will still remain the numero uno in overall market size.																								Gartner, a leading IT research agency, said that Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) will lead the global IT recovery in 2003 with sales of IT and communications products and services almost doubling from 5.8 per cent in 2002 to a 10 per cent growth rate this year. 																								Combined PC desktop and notebook shipments in Asia Pacific will grow 11 per cent to 23.4 million units this year compared with 21.2 million in 2002. Hardware unit growth in India will reach 10 per cent making the country one of the fastest growing hardware markets  in unit terms  worldwide																								Gartner also expects local IT suppliers from within the Asia Pacific region to gain market share at the expense of existing IT multi-national companies. 																								This includes the tier one Indian service providers, such as, Infosys, TCS and Wipro, emerging Chinese hardware manufacturers, including Legend, Huawei and ZTE and niche software companies from across the region.																								The research body is of the opinion that China is more significant to India as a huge market than as a competitor for IT services. Difficult to ignore the potential such a large market offers, Gartner recommends that the major Indian IT service providers should chalk out their plans to enter China.

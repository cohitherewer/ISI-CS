The proposal includes setting up of a bloom-caster in the first phase and a couple of finishing mills at a later stage.																								Sources in the company said the investment for the bloom-caster will be around Rs 125-150 crore.																								The bloom-caster will help us reduce the operating cost while enhancing the quantity, quality and yield, said S. K. Bhattacharyya, managing director of Durgapur Steel.

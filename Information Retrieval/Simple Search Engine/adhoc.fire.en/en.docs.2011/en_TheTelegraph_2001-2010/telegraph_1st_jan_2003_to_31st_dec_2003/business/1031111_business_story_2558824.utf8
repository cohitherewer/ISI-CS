 Tuesday, November 11, 2003 				 Airtel users to get better voice quality
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 10: Airtel subscribers in the city can look forward to a clear call reception after the service provider upgrades the network.																								We have incorporated the voice quality enhancer (VQE) technology in the network. The technology has been sourced from US-based Tellabs, the research arm of Lucent Technologies, to enhance voice quality and clarity. It removes high background noise from the wireless side of the call, thus providing clear call quality on mobile phones. The voice-quality enhancement echo technology also eliminates the complexity of the acoustic echo generated by digital mobiles and handsfree kits, Bharti Cellular CEO (eastern region) Deepak Gulati said.																								Calcutta is the second city after Delhi to be offered the voice-quality-enhancer technology. Some prominent GSM players using the technology include SingTel, Bell South, Telstra and BT Cell.																								Speaking on further network enhancement plans, Gulati said the total investment has already crossed Rs 600 crore. The company already has 275 base stations in place and will cross the 300-mark by December.																								We have already invested Rs 75 crore in the last six months and will invest another Rs 50 crore by March, Gulati added.

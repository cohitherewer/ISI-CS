Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Nov. 15: Reliance Infocomm will invest Rs 700 crore in four projects in the state. These include a 2000-seat call centre, a network development centre, the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Technology and a Knowledge City on the lines of Navi Mumbai.																								Reliance has requested us to allot 6 acres of land for the call centre, said Manabendra Mukherjee, state minister for information technology. The company requires a total of 40 acres, he added.																								The minister has asked Reliance to consider setting up a submarine cable landing station at Haldia to beef up the bandwidth strength of the state. We have sent the request to IT minister Arun Shourie a week ago, Mukherjee said. Haldia is logically and geographically positioned to be the fourth submarine cable station in the country.																								Besides Reliance, Spectramind and AIG are the other BPO companies that will set up operations in the state. Five other companies  Satyam, GE Capital, WNS, Sitel and Vetri  are expected to announce their investments plans within the next month.																								We see a demand-supply gap of around 2.5-lakh sq. ft in the city by next October, Mukherjee said. We are planning to set up two new towers  one at New Town and the other in Saltlec  to meet the growing demands for space.																								The state plans to aggressively pursue IT and ITeS companies through the new IT promotion cell  Advantage Bengal  which will have five core members who will market Bengal to investors. Around 400 companies are on the must-visit list for the next two months. The state IT department is also moving its offices from Writers Buildings to Camac Street so that investors can have better access.

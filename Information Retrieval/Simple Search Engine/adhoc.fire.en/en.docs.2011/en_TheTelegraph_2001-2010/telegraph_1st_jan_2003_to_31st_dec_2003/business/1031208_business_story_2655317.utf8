 Once youve cruised you never want to stop!  Americans, Europeans and the Japanese swear by it. Closer  home, a small but growing band of Indian tourists have turned  believers as sea cruises are catching up fast. Upwardly  mobile Indians have begun to discover newer routes to exotic  holidays. quot;There has been a sharp increase in cruising  as a holiday option among Indians, says Frederick Divecha,  senior vice-president, SOTC, affiliated to Kuoni India,  a leading travel agency.  quot;When cruises first came to India, the  Indian market was not aware of such a product, though there  was a niche well-heeled traveller who had travelled on the  QE-2.  In 1999, when Star Cruises entered India, they  had 10,800 customers in the first year, which rose to 20,000  in 2000-01. After 9/11, tourist traffic tumbled but has  since started rising again. The cruise business is targeting  25,000 tourists this fiscal. Divecha says the figures indicate that Indians  have come to recognise value for money in cruises. They  also enjoy the convenience and comfort that such a travel  variation offers.  The number of Indian customers opting for cruises  therefore is increasing not only for the 2 nights/3 days  itineraries but also for the 5 night/6 days trips. Cruises  arrange for non-stop entertainment with theatres showing  the latest movies, plays and theme restaurants, shopping  plazas, sauna, spas and game shows. Estimates suggest that in three years, 30,000  passengers from India will go on a cruise every year. India  is likely to become the second largest market for cruises  after Australia, predicts Divecha. Earlier elderly couples  went for holiday cruises, but a new tribe of tourists, including  honeymooners, have emerged. Indians normally prefer cruises from the Far  East, but Star Cruises also has cruises from North American  ports to Hawaii, Caribbean islands and even to ice-laden  Alaska. Cruises cover practically all parts of the world   Australia, Far East, USA. General trends: Depending on the main  hub, long duration (6 months  1 year) cruises cover various  ports of call and thus cover various continents, short duration  cruises travel the high seas within the country. One can  visit destinations while on tour. Age group: Long duration cruises attract  couples and senior individuals while short duration cruises  appeal to families. Duration: Two nights to six months /one  year  Discounts: Depending on the season (peak  travelling season of summer and winter), cruise companies  offer discounts. Facilities: World class entertainment  and hospitality. Mode of payment: US dollars accepted.  However, Star Cruises in India has begun accepting Indian  rupees.

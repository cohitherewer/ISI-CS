 Saturday, December 06, 2003 				 Inflation rate up to 5.24%
																								New Delhi, Dec. 5 (PTI): Rising prices of eggs, vegetables and fruits, wheat, imported edible oils and barley pushed up the rate of inflation for the second consecutive week to 5.24 per cent for the week ended November 22. The general price level, as measured by the wholelsale price index (WPI), was up by 0.12 per cent from the previous weeks mark of 5.12 per cent. However, prices dipped for rice, maize, tea, moong, groundnut oil, sugar and cement.																								The point-to-point inflation was only 3.58 per cent in the same period last year, showing the extent to which prices had soared in one year.																								The WPI increased by 0.1 per cent to 176.7 points during the latest reported week broadly due to a rise in the indices of mass consumption primary items and heavy-weighted manufactured products, even as fuel prices remained unchanged. The index was 167.9 points a year ago.

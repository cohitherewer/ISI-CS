 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 Petrol pumps may go dry tomorrow
																								New Delhi, Feb. 22 (PTI): Petrol pumps all over the country may go dry on February 24 as their owners today threatened not to take deliveries from public sector oil companies alleging harassment by oil firms in the name of checking adulteration.																								Petrol pump owners will not lift petro products (petrol and diesel) from oil companies on Monday, Ashok Bhadwar, president of the Federation of All India Petroleum Traders, said today. Fuel stations across the country will run dry once the petrol and diesel stocked by them today is sold out. Petrol stations fill their tanks when they are empty and Sunday being a holiday, oil marketing firms fill tanks at petrol stations till Saturday evening only.																								Alleging that adulteration of petro products happen during transit from refinery to fuel stations, Bhadwar said Oil firms show us the density of the product delivered but put the product coming out of our dispensing pump through rigorous testing.																								The strike is in protest against the cancellation of the August 17, 2002 pact between oil firms and petrol pump dealers that provided for lenient norms for checking adulteration.

 Thursday, February 27, 2003  Business Briefs																								 Mumbai, Feb. 26: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked stock exchanges to submit plans for providing facilities for shifting to T+2 settlement cycle from the current T+3 mode with effect from April 1, 2003. In view of shortening of trade cycle, the new activity schedule has been finalised, Sebi said, adding bourses should provide facility for late confirmation of trades by custodians. However, the time limit for late confirmation should be fixed and exchanges should levy an additional charge to discourage such delays. The exchanges should design an alternative clearing and settlement system for companies whose shares have not been dematerialised to align the clearing and settlement system for such stocks with the T+2 rolling settlement, Sebi said.

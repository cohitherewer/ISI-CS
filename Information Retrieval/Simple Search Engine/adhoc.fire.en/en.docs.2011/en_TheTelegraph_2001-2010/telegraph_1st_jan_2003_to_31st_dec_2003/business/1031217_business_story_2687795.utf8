 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Hind Petro to tap Reliance on pipeline sharing deal
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Dec. 16: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) is planning to invite Reliance Industries to share the proposed Mundra-Delhi pipeline.																								HPCL, which will sink more than Rs 1,367 crore in the project, has already secured approval for the investment.																								If the investment in the pipeline is not made, the company will face a severe problem in despatching its products to north India where it has a number of petrol pumps. But given the capacity of the pipeline, it can cater to the requirements of other companies as well, a senior HPCL executive said.																								The decision has been taken following Indian Oils decision to convert its Kandla-Bhatinda pipeline from one that carries petroleum products to one that brings crude.																								The Kandla-Bhatinda line currently transports products to HPCLs petrol stations in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. HPCL needs a dedicated supply line of its own to bring products from its Mumbai refinery. 																								Sources said the 1008-km long Mundra-Delhi pipeline would have 25 per cent excess capacity that would be leased to firms interested in transporting their petroleum products from the countrys west to the north.																								The project, which is proposed to be financed by 1:1 debt-equity ratio, would be commissioned in 36 months and would have tap-off points at Palanpur, Ajmer, Jaipur, Rewari and Delhi.																								The 316-km Mundra-Palanpur section of the pipeline will have a transport capacity of 5.8 million tonnes of liquid products like petrol, diesel, kerosene and jet fuel per annum.																								The 336-km Palanpur-Ajmer section will have 5.7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity, the 120-km Ajmer-Jaipur section will have 5.2 mtpa, the 171-km Jaipur-Rewari section will have 4.6 mtpa and the 65-km Rewari-Delhi section will have 4.2 mtpa capacity.

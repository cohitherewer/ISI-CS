 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Basic firms moot class licence 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 11: Telecom operators with basic service licence have proposed that unified licence should be given only to those companies that offer both facility and services.																								These are those operators who can offer various services using any technology at any time. The infrastructure service providers that offer backbone support only like the railways, Gail India Ltd and Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd and internet service providers and mobile trunking service providers should not be given the unified licence.																								In a response to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias (Trai) preliminary consultation paper on unified licensing regime, the Association of Basic Telecom Operators (ABTO) has suggested the issue of a class licence. 																								The class licensees would include existing service providers like ISPs, public mobile radio trunking service providers and very small aperture terminal operators and who may get their licences by paying a nominal registration charge to provide the services they are providing now.																								On the issue of spectrum, ABTO feels that registration and entry fee should be divided into two parts with separate charge for spectrum for services which use spectrum as at present and none for those who do not use it.																								However, it is essential that for allocation of spectrum over and above what is permitted and allocated, extra payments would need to be levied, states the letter from ABTO.																								This is contrary to the suggestion of cellular mobile operators who had sought no additional fee for spectrum under unified licence regime. 																								On rural connectivity, ABTO has suggested that licence fee for a few operators who wish to offer services only in rural and unremunerative areas may be different.

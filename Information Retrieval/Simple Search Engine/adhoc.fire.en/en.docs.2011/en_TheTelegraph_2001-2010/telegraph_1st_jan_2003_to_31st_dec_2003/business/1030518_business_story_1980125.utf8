The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, May 18, 2003 				 Go for the general plan, says CalTel
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 S. P. Chakravarty, chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones, in Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, May 17: Economy is no longer economical. With BSNL increasing the number of free calls in the general plan from 30 to 50, the economy plan has lost its attraction.																								Under the general plan, subscribers have to pay only Re 1 for all metered calls from 51 to 300 and Rs 1.20 for beyond 300 calls. The monthly rental is Rs 250. 																								On the other hand, the economy plan has a monthly rental of Rs 350, adding up to Rs 200 more than the general plan in the bimonthly bill. Under this plan, all calls beyond the monthly 150 free-call limit are charged at Rs 1.20.																								We have told BSNL, Delhi that the economy plan is not a viable option. Though no change is expected in the tariff structure, we suggest that the users go for the general plan. In case of high usage, one can opt for the special or super plan, says chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones, SP Chakravarty. 																								CalTel feels that consumers whose metered calls do not exceed 550 should take the general option, while those whose metered calls exceed 1420 should take the super plan.																								The telecom service provider has introduced a new facility of cancelling the earlier exercised option through the Calcutta Telephones website or by dialling the tariff helpline. The date for exercising the option has also been extended to May 26.																								Moreover, the user can change into another plan structure every four months, though the time frame is not strictly rigid, adds Chakravarty. The user has to exercise the option within the 20th of every month to change his plan, which will be effective from the next billing cycle. VPN launch																								BSNL is gearing up for the commercial launch of its VPN (virtual private network) on May 24. Initially 10 cities in the country will be networked. Later, the service will be extended to 27 cities across the country to connect all state capitals.																								This is the first time in the country that the public network infrastructure will be available, Chakravarty said. The VPN will provide the opportunity to outsource communication requirements of the enterprise, allow easy migration from existing networks and provide variable bandwidth on demand.																								The service provider has designed a three-tier tariff structure for its VPN services with discounts depending on number of ports. Bandwidth varies from 64 kbps to 2 mbps.

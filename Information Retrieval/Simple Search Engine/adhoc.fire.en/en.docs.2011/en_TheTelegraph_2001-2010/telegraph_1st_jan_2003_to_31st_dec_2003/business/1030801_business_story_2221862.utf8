The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, August 01, 2003 				 Messaging on basic, WiLL phones
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 31: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today allowed all basic phone operators to provide short messaging service (SMS) to their subscribers. 																								Since the limited mobility service is part of the licence for basic telephony, WiLL operators would also be allowed to offer SMS.																								The authority having considered the terms and conditions of the licence, and the existing international practices, has decided that SMS could be provided by basic service licencees and has informed all basic service operators on July 29, Trai said.																								The issue of allowing basic service operators to offer SMS facility was under Trais consideration for more than a year. 																								Beneficiaries of this decision would be Tata Indicom, Reliance Infocomm, Shyam Telecom besides state-owned Mahanagar Telecom Nigam and Bharat Sanchar Nigam. Reliance already offers SMS on a trial basis.

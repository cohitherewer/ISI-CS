 Friday, November 21, 2003 				 FIIs on recce run ahead of funds parade
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 20: Leading foreign institutional investors are flocking to India. Investment analysts view it as significant because such visits occur ahead of investment institutions making fresh allocations.																								Representatives from around 40 funds were in the country this week. Many corporate bigwigs made presentations before them. Sources said the visit was organised by J. P. Morgan, a leading foreign investment bank.																								It is a significant development, said a leading Bombay Stock Exchange broker. In December, the funds appraise their performance, pay dividend and look for new opportunities. The fact that they are here speaks volumes for the emerging India story, he added.																								There are new faces among the visitors, he said. According to estimates, the funds manage $500 billion investments and even if a small percentage of this is earmarked for the Indian capital market, it will be a huge booster.																								Funds like Janus Capital, which has been building up large shares of Reliance Industries and Tata Steel, were in the city to do a recce. Others included Putnam Investment, which is yet to take a major exposure in India, UBS Global Asset Management, Capital International and several emerging funds.																								FIIs started pouring money from April onwards and only this month the flows have slackened a bit. Market observers are, however, confident that inflows will spurt from 2004.																								Early last month, several big names of India Inc visited New York to make presen- tations before Wall Street honchos. 																								However, there are a few who advise caution. The impending elections and the fact that foreign funds may find other more attractive destinations in 2004 cannot be ruled out. 																								Already, in Australia, the interest rates have started rising making the country an attractive investment proposition. Further, if the US economy falters, it would ring warning bells for the Indian capital market.																								Market analysts also said FIIs have limited investment opportunities. There are hardly 150 companies having liquid stocks they can invest in. The new issues hitting the market are also small except for those of Tata Consultancy Services.

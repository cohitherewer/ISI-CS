The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, January 20, 2003 				 Parekh gets tough with lazy SEBs
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Parekh: Cracking the whip																								Calcutta, Jan. 19: Deepak Parekh, chairman of the committee on power sector reforms, has directed state power utilities to work out a time-bound action plan in consultation with the state governments and the state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs). Peeved at the tardy progress of power sector reforms, Parekh issued this terse direction at the committee meet held in New Delhi recently. 																								The meeting was attended among others by R. V. Shahi, Union power secretary, R. Gopalakrishnan, ED Tata Sons, chiefs of the Rajasthan and West Bengal SEBs. 																								The terms of reference of the committee were: a) examine the ongoing efforts under the existing APDP focussing on the distribution segment and to suggest improvement measures; b) identify reform approaches currently being pursued by the states, ascertain their rationale for preferring a particular approach and critically evaluate these approaches; c) devise a reform approach to restore and sustain the financial viability of the sector; d) devise a state-specific reform programme in consultation with the respective state governments that is fair and equitable to all the existing measures and for prospective stake holders in the power sector. 																								Senior power ministry officials said the reforms programme will provide a specific approach for reforms in each state, make a quick assessment of the transition support required and the extent and manners in which APDRP and other funds could be deployed for achieving the reform objectives. 																								Officials said the action plan mooted by Parekh should focus on these areas.

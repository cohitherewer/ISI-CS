 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Italy mounts rescue mission for food giant
																								Milan, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Talks to save Parmalat gathered pace on Sunday as concern grew that a hole in the accounts of the global food group could be even bigger than feared, adding to a scandal that has been dubbed Europes Enron.																								Renowned turnaround expert Enrico Bondi, who took the reins at Parmalat this week, was meeting with bankers to decide how to file for protection from creditors and keep the producer of long-life milk and Archway cookies running.																								Long-standing worries about Parmalats habit of tying up its steady cash flow in complex investments exploded on Friday when it revealed a four-billion-euro hole in its accounts which Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called almost incredible.																								On Sunday, Italian media reported the hole could gape wider.																								Newspaper Corriere della Sera said Parmalats former chairman had told potential investors in the group that Parmalat had not bought back 2.9 billion ($3.58 billion) of bonds, as detailed on its books.																								That would push total debt to almost 9 billion, up from 6 billion on its September 30 balance sheet. Parmalat was not immediately available for comment.																								Parmalat  a household name from South America to Australia  dropped a bombshell on Friday by announcing that a document showing 3.95 billion held by a Cayman Islands unit had been declared false by Bank of America.																								The news slashed its already battered share and bond prices to less than a third of face value. 																								It also turned up the heat in a struggle between the government and the Bank of Italy over who should rule over Italys financial markets.																								Prosecutors who took part in the Clean Hands corruption trials that toppled a political and business generation in the 1990s, took boxes of documents from Parmalats auditors Grant Thornton and Deloitte amp; Touche on Saturday.																								Charges could include fraud and providing false information to auditors, judicial sources said.																								The missing 4 billion dwarfed a 1-billion accounting scandal at Dutch retailer Ahold and drew comparisons with the collapse of US energy giant Enron and Italys Ferruzzi empire in 1993.																								Bondi, famous for creating a profitable firm out of Ferruzzis ashes, could ask the courts to put Parmalat in controlled administration as soon as Monday, an industrial source said on Saturday. That would give Parmalat up to two years protection from creditors while it sorts through its finances and operating business spanning 30 countries with nearly 35,000 employees.

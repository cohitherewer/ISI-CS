 Sunday, May 04, 2003 				 BSNL focus on staff output
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, May 3: In a move to streamline operations at Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, all the personnel and human resource functions of the company have been brought under the director for human resource development (HRD).																								The move has made it mandatory for the financial personnel in BSNL to report to the director, HRD. This was strongly opposed by the accounts and finance wing of the company who were earlier reporting to the finance director on the BSNL board.																								An order to the heads of BSNL circles sent recently states, Henceforth, all the personnel handling HR functions in any discipline of BSNL would become part of the overall HRD organisation of BSNL headed by director HRD, BSNL board.																								Sources in BSNL said: This will help in clearances of many files related to financial matters and also transfer of officials in finance. It was an issue that was creating protocol problems in the maintenance of hierarchy and co-ordination of activities by the chief general managers.																								With this order, at circle level the chief general manager (CGM) will have the final authority on all personnel matters and HR functions. This will be done as part of the first phase of HRD integration exercise. 																								The telecom HRD is already being administered under the supervision of the circle CGMs. 																								The order stipulates that all the HRD related activities of all disciplines in respect of Group A and B officers of telecom, finance, civil, electrical and architectural wing will be carried out with the approval of circle CGM. The HRD related works will include recruitment, probation, confirmation, promotion, transfer, deputation, leave, discipline and code of conduct.																								The order has not pleased the accounts and finance officers in BSNL who have made a representation to the BSNL board and also to the communications minister. The officers have alleged that it will lead to problems in their service conditions since most of them had opted to join BSNL with the belief that they will be reporting to the finance director.																								This order states that in matters related to accounts and finance the HRD related decision will be taken in consultation with the director finance. While earlier the director finance was the final authority related to HRD matters. It is unlikely to help streamlining the functions but will complicate the overall functioning of the company, said a senior official in the accounts and finance division of BSNL at Delhi. 																								However, the official ruled out any move by their cadre for strike opposing the decision. We have made representation to the chairman and managing director, Prithipal Singh, and to the communications minister, Arun Shourie, and we hope a solution would be found soon, the official said.

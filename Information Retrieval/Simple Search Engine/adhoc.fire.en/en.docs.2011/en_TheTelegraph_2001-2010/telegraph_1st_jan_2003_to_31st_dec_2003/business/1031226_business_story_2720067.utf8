 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Honda trails on output
																								Tokyo, Dec. 25 (AFP): Honda Motor Co Ltd suffered its first fall in global production in three months in November as its rivals Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor enjoyed expansion, Japans top three auto makers said today. Hondas global production in November declined 4.4 per cent from a year earlier to 247,115 vehicles, hit by stagnant domestic production, a company spokesman said.																								The decline was mainly due to a slowdown in domestic output of our key models, including the Fit, the spokesman said.																								Toyota Motor, Japans largest car maker, said its worldwide production rose 3.1 per cent to 527,918 following a 10 per cent gain the previous month.																								Nissan Motor said its global production rose 6.5 per cent to 250,607, the sixth straight year-on-year increase, backed by brisk output in the United States.																								Hondas sales at home dropped 22.1 per cent to 59,749 last month, the first decline in two months, while Toyotas domestic sales fell 1.6 per cent to 143,960, the first fall in three months.																								Nissans sales in Japan slipped 9.8 per cent to 55,196, the first decline in seven months chiefly due to the lower sales volumes seen for the March, Cube, Fairlady Z and other models that were launched in 2002, the company said.

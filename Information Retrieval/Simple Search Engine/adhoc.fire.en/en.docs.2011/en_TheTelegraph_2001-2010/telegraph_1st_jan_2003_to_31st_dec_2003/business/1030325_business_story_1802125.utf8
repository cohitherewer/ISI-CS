The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, March 25, 2003 				 Supply back-up put in place
																								New Delhi, March 24 (PTI): Employees of HPCL and BPCL will strike work for three days from tomorrow. But the stir is unlikely to affect petroleum product supplies as the government has made an elaborate contingency plan to ensure that there is no disruption.																								Contingency plan is in place and there will be no difficulty in ensuring petro product supplies to consumers, petroleum secretary B. K. Chaturvedi said. There would be no shutdown of any refinery or bottling plant of BPCL and HPCL, he added.																								Reliance Petroleum and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals have been asked to ramp up their production to bridge any shortfall in supply.																								Meanwhile, in an ad-interim order, the Mumbai High Court today restrained seven unions in BPCL from going on strike from tomorrow. Major trade unions, on the other hand, have decided to go ahead with the nation-wide strike in the oil sector to protest against the disinvestment policy of the government.

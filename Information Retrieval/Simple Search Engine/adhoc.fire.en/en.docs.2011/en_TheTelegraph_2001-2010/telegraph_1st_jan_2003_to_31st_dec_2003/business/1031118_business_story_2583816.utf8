 Tuesday, November 18, 2003 				 Fillip for software units, call centres
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Nov. 17: The call centre and software industry is upbeat about an announcement by minister for information technology Arun Shourie that leased circuits in the city would receive round-the-clock or 24x7 service from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL).																								He was speaking at the inauguration of Infocom 2003 being held in the city.																								Calcutta Telephones chief general manger S. P. Chakravarty said, We have been running the system for the past two months and checking for possible faults. We are entirely satisfied with the average uptime which is around 99.6 per cent.																								This means that leased lines run a chance of service drop for only 43 hours in a year and less than 3 hours in a month.																								Calcutta Telephones has already entered into a service level agreement with Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL) to ensure a 99.5 per cent uptime for their leased services. The bandwidth is sourced from VSNLs Mumbai gateway and carried on BSNLs national long distance backbone to the Calcutta landing, from where it is distributed to the companys 160 clients, most of whom are software companies and call centres.																								Birla-owned Manjushree Infotech vice-president Debashish Biswas said, We will benefit hugely from this upgrade as the service now comes with a guarantee seal from the government. This will make it easier for us to show proof of unhindered connectivity to our overseas clients and add credibility to our services. Earlier we had experienced an uptime between 96 and 97 per cent.																								Brigadier Suresh Menon of BNKe Solutions said, Though we have not experienced any problem with the service, the guarantee will help us commit smooth connectivity in the service level agreement.

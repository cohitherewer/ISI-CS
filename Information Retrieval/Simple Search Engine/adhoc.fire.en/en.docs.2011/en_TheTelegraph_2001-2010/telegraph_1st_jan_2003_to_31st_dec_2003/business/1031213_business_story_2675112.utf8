 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Bharti to buy Canadian firms 27.5% stake in Hexacom
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mittal: Closing in																								New Delhi, Dec. 12: Sunil Mittal-owned Bharti group today announced plans to buy the 27.5 per cent stake of Telesystem International Wireless of Canada in Hexacom, a cellular operator in Rajasthan, for Rs 102 crore.																								While the Bharti executives were optimistic that the deal would go through, industry observers felt the majority stakeholder in Hexacom  Shyam Telecom  could oppose the deal. The agreement, which Bharti has signed with Telesystem International Wireless (TIW), is subject to regulatory and other approvals and right of first refusal with other shareholders.																								Hexacom operates GSM network in Rajasthan and has over two lakh customers as on November 30,2003.																								Telesystem International Wireless Inc., Canada (TIW), which is a subsidiary of Telesystem (Mauritius), may also sell the minority stake held through a company called Shyam Cellular Infrastructure Pvt Ltd in Hexacom.																								TIW is dedicated to wireless operations, basic services and is a specialist in high growth markets. It is a provider of trunked mobile radio services in France and the UK and paging services in Mexico and the Netherlands.																								Shyam Telecom holds a 10 per cent stake in Hexacom. Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd (TCIL), a public sector company, holds a 30 per cent and TIW holds 27.5 per cent. Shyam and TIW hold another 30 per cent stake through a holding company called Shyam Cellular Infrastructure Projects Ltd. Other financial investors have a 2.5 per cent stake. 																								Shyam Telecom holds the majority stake in the holding company.																								Todays announcement comes a week after Sunil Mittal said his company would soon announce acquisitions in cellular telephony. Interestingly, the company had also applied for a unified licence for the Rajasthan circle.																								Sources in Bharti said, Eventually, we would like to have a majority stake in the company. When we took over Spice Calcutta, SkyCell in Chennai and JT Mobile in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab, it was a 100 per cent acquisition. They added that the company would be willing to pick up TCILs stake as and when the government decides to sell it.																								If all the conditions are met, the sale pursuant to this agreement is scheduled to close within the next two months. Bharti intends to consolidate its stake in Hexacom as and when an appropriate opportunity comes its way. This will give Bharti a presence in Rajasthan, thereby expanding its footprint to 16 circles, a release said.																								Hexacom offers mobile services with more than 48 per cent share of the GSM market. The other cellular mobile operators using the global system for mobile communications in the state are Hutch and BSNL.																								A senior executive in Shyam Telecom (STL) said, We are yet to receive any notice regarding the buy out of the stake in Hexacom. It will not be possible for us to comment without a proper communication.																								Shyam Telecom is an ISO 9001 company and one of the largest suppliers of radio, microwave and other telecom equipments in India, with established research and development expertise and a strong export arm. STL also has a licence to provide basic telecom services in Rajasthan. It has already paid Rs 3 crore to department of telecommunications for migrating unified access licence, which will eventually become a unified licence.																								Thus, the company will be able to offer fixed and mobile service and also ILD and NLD if the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) recommends and government accepts it.

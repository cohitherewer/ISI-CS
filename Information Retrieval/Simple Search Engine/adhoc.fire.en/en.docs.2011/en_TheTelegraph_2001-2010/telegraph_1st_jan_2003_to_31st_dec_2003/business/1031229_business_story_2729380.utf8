 S. P. S. PANNU				 Money drain 																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: Foreign dredging cartels comprising mainly Dutch and Belgium companies appear to be fleecing Indian ports.																								Sources disclose that the new shipping secretary, D. T. Joseph, has carried out a detailed study of the prices charged by the foreign firms and found, to his dismay, that they were charging up to twice as much as their Indian counterparts for the same work. 																								India has only a few dredging companies and the foreign cartels appear to be exploiting this weakness to the hilt. The largest Indian company is the public sector Dredging Corporation of India; the rest of the handful are smaller firms, such as the Gujarat-based Jisu.																								It is reliably learnt that the shipping secretary visited various ports to get to the bottom of the dredging scenario. His investigation is reported to have revealed that while in some cases the charges of the foreign companies were more than 100 per cent higher than their Indian counterparts, in others they were higher by 75 per cent to 80 per cent. 																								In one case, while the Indian company had charged Rs 42 crore for a particular dredging job, a foreign company had charged as much as Rs 90 crore.																								According to sources, the technological gap between the Indian and foreign companies is in evidence only in select jobs and cannot account for the price difference in most of the cases. Even Indian companies possess the latest dredging equipment. 																								Foreign companies have been claiming that they have to pay higher customs duty and mobilise expatriates. But these are specific amounts that can be quantified and do not explain the huge price margins vis-a-vis Indian companies.																								The issue assumes importance as the country lacks dredging capacity, while it is amongst the worlds largest market for such operations. 																								Most of the Indian ports are shallow and constant dredging has to be done to maintain the water depth in some parts, while others have to be further deepened to increase the capacity of the ports to take in larger ships.																								Another issue related to dredging operations that needs to be addressed is the companies being made to guarantee the maintenance of a particular depth in their areas of operation. Currently, the amount of work done is measured in terms of the amount of soil that is excavated.

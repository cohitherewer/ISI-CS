 M RAJENDRAN				 Future focus 																								New Delhi, Nov. 26: After the merger with Digital, H-P plans to launch digital products in the consumer electronic segment like camera and scanners.																								The company is bullish about the Indian market and has kicked off the drive with the launch of projectors. H-P is betting in a big way on digital light projector (DLP) over liquid crystal display (LCD) technology targeted at educational institutions, call centres and software houses. 																								The company will also target the mobile managers by offering an end-to-end solution that will have a palm digital accessory (PDA), digital note pad, mobile printer and a mobile projector.																								We are bullish on the Indian market for our new products like projectors and will soon unveil a range of digital products. The H-P brand value will help us penetrate into the existing markets like defence, public sector companies and educational institutions, said Barkha Deva, country category manager for H-Ps digital imaging products.																								H-P will focus on the projector market in the country with its wide range of projectors to suit multiple business requirements. Our thrust will be to make the concept of portable office and office on the move a reality, said Deva.																								The basic model projector is priced at Rs 1.2 lakh and about 10,000-12,000 projectors are bought in India each year.																								H-P is in the imaging business for more than 18 years. A projector has everything to do with imaging  just that it produces images that are projected on the screen rather than on paper.																								According to a senior analyst with IDC, The company is facing a major challenge on the price front from gray market operators. Though the projector market in India is expected to double over the next few years, the total market share for H-P and its competitors like Panasonic, Acer, Toshiba, Benq will be 60 per cent, while the rest will still be with the gray market.

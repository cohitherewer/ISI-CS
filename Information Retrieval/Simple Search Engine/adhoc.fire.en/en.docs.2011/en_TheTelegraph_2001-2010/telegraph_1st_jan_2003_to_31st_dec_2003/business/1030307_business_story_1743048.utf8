 Friday, March 07, 2003 				 British Gas to double investment
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 6: British Gas (BG) has decided to double its investment to $ 1 billion in India for increasing the output of Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields. 																								Further investment in the western offshore fields had been held for over a year because of the dispute between BG and ONGC over the operatorship of the fields.																								BG had bought a 30 per cent share from Enron in the ONGC-discovered fields and had been keen on the CEOs post to run the operations. ONGC, on the other hand, as the largest shareholder with a 40 per cent stake, had staked its claim to the CEOs post. They have now settled for a joint operatorship model. 																								BG chairman Richard Giordano and CEO Frank Chapman had come to India to give final touches to the plan.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 30: The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance is disappointed with the WTO deal. Its secretary general, D. G. Shah, said today though a mechanism had been put in place, it had certain shortcomings. There is no change in the original text and statement passed today, he said.																								The understanding reached, does not present great opportunities nor is a shot in the arm for Indian pharmaceutical companies. 																								According to industry sources, the accord specifies certain changes in colour, size and shape of the affordable medicine than its original patented product. It will, therefore, increase the cost of the product.																								Analysts feel the deal will not benefit Ranbaxy and Dr Reddys Laboratories but should help Cipla. Both Ranbaxy and DRL have been focussing on the developed markets while Cipla has been very aggressive in emerging markets, an analyst said.

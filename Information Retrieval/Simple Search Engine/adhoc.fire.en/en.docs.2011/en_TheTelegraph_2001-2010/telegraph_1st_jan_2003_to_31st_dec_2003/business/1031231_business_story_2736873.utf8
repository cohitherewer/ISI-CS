 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Hutch plans Rs 1800cr update
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 Fruits of labour 																								Mumbai, Dec. 30: Hutchinson Essar, provider of cellular services under Orange and Hutch brands, will invest Rs 1,800 crore in its 10 circles, including Delhi and Mumbai, for expanding the network infrastructure.																								Of the total sum, Rs 300 crore will go to Mumbai, taking the total investment in this circle to Rs 1,150 crore. This investment will go towards expanding the network infrastructure, a release issued by the firm said.																								Hutch said it had crossed the 4-million customer-mark in the country  one million each in Delhi and Mumbai. 																								Hutchison Max Telecom managing director Asim Ghosh said, Today, we serve over a million customers, who say I speak Orange. It has been a wonderful eight years.																								It plans to increase cell sites in the countrys financial capital to 820 and triple SMS-handling capacity. It will also launch EDGE in a countrywide initiative next year. 																								Orange officials said it has the largest number of cell sites deployed in Mumbai among all operators (including GSM and non-GSM operators). It covers the city with over 650 cell sites and the leading service provider now plans to retain capacity leadership in the city with an additional deployment of 170 more cell sites.																								Further, to enhance its data services and to allow a better throughput, Hutchison Essar will soon be launching EDGE as a countrywide initiative. 																								The investment in Mumbai alone will be around Rs. 20 crore for the project. It may be recalled that Bharti, the leading cellular operator has already announced plans for launching EDGE.																								The circles in which Hutchison Essar currently operates include Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (East).																								In a recent report, Gartner has said the calendar year 2004 is set to break all records for growth in the Indian mobile market due to the introduction of full-mobility CDMA cellular services and an aggressive competitive response among GSM operators.																								Provisional estimates suggest cellular connections reaching 56 million by the end of 2004, a 96 per cent growth over the current year.																								Gartner said GSM operators who were initially dismayed by the introduction of CDMA services have risen to the challenge and responded with aggressive promotions and handset subsidies to maintain their share of net new connections.

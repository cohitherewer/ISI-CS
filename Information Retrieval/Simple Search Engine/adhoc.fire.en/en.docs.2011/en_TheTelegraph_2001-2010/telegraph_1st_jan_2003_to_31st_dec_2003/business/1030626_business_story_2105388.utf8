 Thursday, June 26, 2003 				 Nokia joins the CDMA bandwagon in India
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Reaching out																								New Delhi, June 25: Nokia, the worlds largest maker of cellphones, is making the crossover in India.																								The leading manufacturer and supplier of handsets based on global system for mobile communication (GSM) technology today entered the competing technology  code division multiple access (CDMA)  that is used to offer limited mobile phones.																								The company will supply the first set of CDMA phones to Reliance Infocomm for its limited mobile service. It has begun deliveries of the CDMA 2000 1X Nokia 2280 phone to Reliance Infocomm.																								Based on a Nokia-designed CDMA2000 1X chipset, the Nokia 2280 phone combines ease of use with style and personalisation options and is set to cater to first time users who desire a relevant feature set optimised for voice and text messaging.																								The Nokia 2280 phones will sell for Rs 6,800 in Delhi and Rs 7,200 in Mumbai. The Finnish phone, unlike the Korean majors LG and Samsung IndiaMobile, do not have an exclusive arrangement with IndiaMobile and so do not come preset like its Korean counterparts.																								Nokia views India as one of the fastest growing markets in Asia Pacific and one of the potential key markets for CDMA. 																								We are pleased to be working closely with Reliance Infocomm, a key service provider in India, to offer affordable and localised CDMA products like the Nokia 2280 to Indian consumers. This development marks an exciting phase for Nokia towards increasing our CDMA footprint in India, as well as for other CDMA markets in the region. 																								We see a great potential for the continued growth of mobile telephony in India where mobile penetration is relatively low, said Robert Andersson, senior vice-president, Nokia Mobile Phones Asia Pacific.																								As the leading brand in mobile communications in India, Nokia will continue to deliver products which cater to the needs and preferences of Indian consumers, he added.

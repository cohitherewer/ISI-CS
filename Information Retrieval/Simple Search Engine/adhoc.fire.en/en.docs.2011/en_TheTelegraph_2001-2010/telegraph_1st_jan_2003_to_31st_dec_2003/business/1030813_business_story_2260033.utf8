 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Cellular players up the ante in telecom tussle
 M. RAJENDRAN																								Bangalore, Aug. 12: Cellular operators today decided to give a 48-hour ultimatum to the government to explicitly state how it plans to implement in letter and spirit the order issued last week by the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on the vexed issue of allowing limited mobility services.																								Last Friday, the TDSAT permitted limited mobility services but placed several stiff conditions that were expected to severely straitjacket the ambitions of fixed-line telephony operators like state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, Reliance Infocomm and Tata Teleservices.																								The fixed-line operators will be badly hobbled by the condition that requires them to restrict their mobility services to the short distance charging area  a roughly 25 km radius. 																								The cellular operators are demanding that the government indicate that it will enforce this condition which, they claim, the fixed-line providers have been flouting with impunity, thereby making a mockery of the limited nature of the service which has been spelt out in their licences.																								They have also asked the government not to allow the limited mobile operators to use the mobile switching centres and the nature and feature of limited mobile service should be maintained.																								The cellular companies are also very keen to see the government implement the directive relating to the payment of compensation for the creation of a level playing field vis--vis the fixed-line operators.																								They have already come out with a Rs-300-crore tab that they intend to furnish to BSNL to recover access charge arrears with retrospective effect.																								The TDSAT order had directed the government to work out the compensation amount that the cellular operators should get while creating a level playing field between cellular and basic operators who have paid niggardly amounts to obtain their licences.																								The tribunal had directed the government and Trai to create the level-playing field by December 8 to compensate the cellular operators.																								At an executive council meeting of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) held in Delhi today, the operators decided to send their request to government urging speedy implementation of the TDSAT directives. In case the government fails to take action, the COAI plans to move the Supreme Court next week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 March date for Bhartis Hexacom deal
 M RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Bharti group is planning a complete acquisition of Hexacom, the cellphone service provider in Rajasthan, by March next year when it hopes to buy out the two other shareholders in the company  Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd and Shyam Telecom. Last week, Bharti made a proposal to buy out the 27.5 per cent stake held by Telesystem International Wireless of Canada (TIW) in a deal worth Rs 102 crore.																								Shyam Telecom has until January 10 to make a counter-offer for Telesystems stake but this seems unlikely at the moment.																								Under the terms of the agreement between the shareholders of Hexacom, Shyam Telecom has the right of first refusal  a right that it will relinquish if it cannot beat Bhartis offer.																								The Bharti group intends to open negotiations with Shyam Telecom and TCIL after the deadline for making the counter-offer expires. The Bharti group has bought out the entire stake in all the circles where it has made acquisitions like Spice Calcutta, SkyCell in Chennai and JT Mobile, which has operations in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab.																								Currently, Shyam Telecom holds 10 per cent in Hexacom while Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd (TCIL), a public sector company, holds 30 per cent. TIW holds 27.5 per cent.																								Shyam and TIW hold another 30 per cent stake through a holding company called Shyam Cellular Infrastructure Projects Ltd while other financial investors hold 2.5 per cent. As a result of the majority stake in the holding company, Shyam Telecom has the majority stake in Hexacom.																								TIW, which is a subsidiary of Telesystem (Mauritius), may also sell the minority stake held through Shyam Cellular Infrastructure Pvt Ltd in Hexacom. 																								Hexacom operates a GSM network in Rajasthan and has over 2 lakh customers as on November 30. It offers mobile services with more than 48 per cent market share of the GSM market in the state. The other cellular mobile operators using the GSM communications in Rajasthan are Hutch and BSNL.																								A senior Bharti executive said: We have received verbal approvals and indications that there will be no counter-offer from the stakeholders. We are optimistic about sealing the deal by the second week of next month.																								Executives in Shyam Telecom refused to say whether they would make a counter-offer. We will state our position later. There is enough time for the deal to be completed, they said.																								Industry observers said Shyam would like to hold out for a higher price (more than what has been offered to TIW) for its stake.																								This is important for the company since it would be left with the unified licence and would like to offer competitive tariffs and value-added services to survive in that market. It would need deep pockets do this and the company can use the money from the stake sale, said an industry observer.																								Shyam Telecom has a licence to provide basic telecom services in Rajasthan. It has already paid Rs 3 crore to DoT to migrate to a unified access licence, which will eventually become a unified licence. The company would then be able to offer fixed-line and mobile services as well as domestic and international long distance services.

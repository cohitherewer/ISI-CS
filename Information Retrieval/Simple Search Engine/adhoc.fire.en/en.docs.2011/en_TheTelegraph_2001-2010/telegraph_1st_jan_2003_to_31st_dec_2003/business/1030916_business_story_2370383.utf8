 Tuesday, September 16, 2003 				 Mallya remains unfazed
																								Bangalore, Sept. 15 (PTI): Vijay Mallya today asserted that according to Sebi guidelines his group had ample time to increase its offer in Herbertsons and asked Kishore Chhabria to announce a price of Rs 210 per share and pay the interest separately in addition.																								I have seen Chhabrias revised offer. It is structured in a complicated manner. Imputed or assumed net value to shareholders does not augur for transparency. Our offer is crystal clear with a clearly stated price of Rs 200 per share for 42.5 per cent of the equity. If Kishore feels that his offer is better let him announce a price of Rs 210 per share and pay the interest separately, Mallya said.

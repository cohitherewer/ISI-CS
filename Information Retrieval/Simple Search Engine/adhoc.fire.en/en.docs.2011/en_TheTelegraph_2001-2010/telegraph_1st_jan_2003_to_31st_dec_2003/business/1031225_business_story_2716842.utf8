 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Customers all ears for new tariff cut call
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 24: Customers of telecom service can now look forward to a round of fresh baits and concessions from cellular and WiLL players who have just received a Rs 1,217-crore Christmas largesse in the form of financial concessions from the government.																								The Centre took a few steps forward and we took a few steps forward and the result is good for the sector. The telecom industry will now witness faster consolidation and also better announcements for the customers, said Asim Ghosh, managing director of Hutch.																								The cellular operators responded to the blandishment by withdrawing their case in the Supreme Court against the wireless-in-local-loop (WiLL) services offered by the basic operators.																								Communications minister Arun Shourie said: We can now expect a spurt in the teledensity from 1.3 million mobile phones to 2.6 million phones. I would like to thank the Prime Minister, finance minister, the telecom regulator, the operators and also two important personalities who are responsible for this decision though they themselves may not like to be named (Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani).																								Commenting on the decision, Sunil Mittal, chairman and group managing director of the Bharti group, said, Ab ham tan, man, dhan lagakar kaam karenge (we will now work with our body, mind and money) and fight the battle in the market.																								Explaining this statement, Mittal later said: Tan or the body belongs to Lord Ram and Dhan (wealth) belongs to government and Man (heart) belongs to me. I had control only over the heart and it was unhappy. Now, the heart is pleased with the announcement and we are confident that soon we will surpass the explosive Chinese rate of growth in the telecom industry. There will be an addition of 3-4 million telephones each month.																								The Cellular Operators Association of India said, This decision will enable all the GSM cellular operators, both regional and national, to energetically participate in the growth programmes of the government to attain the national teledensity objectives.																								The Association of Basic Telecom Operators also welcomed the decision but felt that the cellular operators should not have been given the additional 2 per cent concession in the revenue share. 																								We will not contest it, but we feel that this reflects there was no level playing field for them. The story was the other way round, said ABTO secretary general S. C. Khanna.																								Meanwhile, a senior executive from AirCell, the company that had opposed the decision of COAI to withdraw case against WiLL players, said, It is the surrender of a justified cause for which the cellular industry was fighting. Mittal rejected Aircells view and pointed out that 20-30 per cent of time, energy and finance were being spent on the litigation. Now, he said, the same amount could be used to focus on building quality networks and services. There will be faster mergers and acquisitions.

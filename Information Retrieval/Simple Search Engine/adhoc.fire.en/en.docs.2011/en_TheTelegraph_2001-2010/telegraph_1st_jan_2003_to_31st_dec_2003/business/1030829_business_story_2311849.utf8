 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: The ice-cream division of Hindustan Lever Ltd, which posted a net profit of Rs 9.7 crore during the January-June period, has come up with a limited edition of ice-creams for the festive season. 																								Launching 11 ice-creams, J. H. Mehta, executive director, said, This is not exactly a test marketing for these products, though there will be several learning points for the company on the basis of the performance of these products. The ice-cream market in India is about Rs 100 crore, of which the organised sector is about 65 per cent. HLL has a market share of about 33 per cent, he added. 																								There is a kids range in the new products, including Max Rocket and Max Chakri which have the ice-creams shaped as such. Another novelty, created with Diwali in mind is Diya Delites  a pack of 12 cups designed in the shape of diyas.

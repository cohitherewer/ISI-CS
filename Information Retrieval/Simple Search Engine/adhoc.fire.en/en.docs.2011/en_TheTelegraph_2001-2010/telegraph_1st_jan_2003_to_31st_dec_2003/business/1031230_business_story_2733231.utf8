The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Vodafone keen to control Vivendi mobile 
 HEATHER TIMMONS 				 	 Sarin: Another mission																								New York, Dec. 29: Since he took the helm of Britains wireless giant, the Vodafone Group, in July, Arun Sarin has raised dividends, narrowed losses and set his sights on one of the most valuable assets of a competitor. 																								With the asset play, Sarin may have cleared the way for one of the biggest deals of 2004, or set the stage for public humiliation. 																								During a November presentation of Vodafones first-half results, Sarin, the chief executive, was forthright about his desire to take control of SFR, the French mobile phone company that is the strongest business of Vivendi Universal. 																								Vodafone, which receives about a fifth of its revenue from the United States as a partner in Verizon Wireless, currently owns 43.9 per cent of SFR, compared with Vivendis controlling stake of 55.8 per cent.																								Our aspiration is to buy it, and you can quote me on that, Sarin told analysts and investors. But Sarins quest may not be easy to execute, or popular with shareholders. 																								This month, Vivendi reported its first net profit in more than a year, largely on the strength of operating profits at Cegetel, the division that houses SFR. The units profits increased 15 per cent in the third quarter, to 531 million ($637 million). Revenue at the unit was up 8 per cent, to 1.9 billion ($2.3 billion), driven by new customers signing up for SFRs service. 																								In contrast, Vivendis games and music units recorded a loss for the third quarter, and the company said profits at its cable television group would be flat for the year because of marketing costs. 																								Vivendi is preparing to sell its Universal entertainment assets in the United States to General Electrics NBC unit. If Vivendi were to sell off SFR, it would be left with a holding company and a group of sagging, disparate assets. 																								And yet, executives close to Vivendi say Vodafone could succeed in acquiring the SFR stake - but only for the right price. Vivendi now values its 55.8 percent share in the unit as high as 15 billion to 20 billion euros ($18.5 billion to $25 billion), those executives say, although the company paid less than half that to amass the SFR share. And Vivendi is in no hurry to sell, they say. 																								Vodafone investors, meanwhile, are likely to balk if the company, which has spent the last three years undoing the damage of a high-priced acquisition spree, pays anywhere near that much for SFR. 																								Some analysts said they do not see the logic behind Vodafones determination to buy the remainder of the French telecommunications company. SFR already offers Vodafone products like Vodafone Live, a message, television and games system, said Chris Ansell, an analyst with Nomura Asset Management. 																								 quot;Where are the synergies? quot; Ansell asked. quot;It is difficult to see how from a shareholders point of view how they would be able to generate value from holding the rest of the SFR stake. quot; 																								New York Times News Service					 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

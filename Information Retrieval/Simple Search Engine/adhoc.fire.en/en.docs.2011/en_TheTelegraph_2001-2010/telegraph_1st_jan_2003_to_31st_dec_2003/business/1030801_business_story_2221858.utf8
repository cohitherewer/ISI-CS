Dhingra said Berger could consider Jenson for acquisition if a proposal came from the companys lenders. The Jenson management is trying to cut its Rs 150-crore debt by half. Bergers attempt to acquire Snowcem last year failed because the two companies could not agree on price.																								We have indicated to merchant bankers that we may invest overseas and are receiving offers from various countries, Dhingra said. Berger is also exploring takeover targets in Africa. We have an offer there, and are examining it, he added.																								Berger has looked at various buyout targets in Africa in the past.

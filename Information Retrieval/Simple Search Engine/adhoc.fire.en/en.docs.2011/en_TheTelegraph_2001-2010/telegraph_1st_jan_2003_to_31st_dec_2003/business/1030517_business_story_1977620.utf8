 Saturday, May 17, 2003 				 Kotak policy offers host of benefits
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 16: Tax relief under section 88, full-life cover, exemption from capital gains tax, returns of investment in equity and to top it all, a guaranteed sum assured at the end of the term.																								Might sound like a pipe dream, but thats what OM Kotak Mahindra Life Insurances latest policy  Kotak Safe Investment Plan  offers. The scheme was launched in Calcutta today.																								Under the scheme, the policyholder could choose to invest up to 80 per cent of the premium in equity and the balance, in fixed-income securities. However, depending on market conditions, the insurance company could limit the investment in equity at 40 per cent of the premium.																								Long-term investments in equity can give significantly better returns than fixed-income securities. Since we are guaranteeing the sum assured, investors need not worry about the risks of investing in equity, said Shivaji Dam, managing director of OM Kotak Insurance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Gold prices hit new highs 
																								Mumbai, Dec. 30 (PTI): Gold zoomed to close at a new high of Rs 6,235 per 10 grams due to sharp rise in global prices.																								Silver also maintained its march and shot up by Rs 100 per kilo to end at an all-time high of Rs 9,480 on firm London advises.																								In the markets abroad, gold shot up to near seven-year high of $416.50 per ounce on fears of a further fall in dollar against the euro, dealers said.																								Pure gold (99.9 purity) started on firm note at Rs 6,225 and continued to rally to end at Rs 6,235, showing a smart gain of Rs 20 over the previous close of Rs 6,215. Standard gold (99.5 purity), after a sharply higher start at Rs 6,190, firmed up further and closed at a new high of Rs 6,200, revealing a handsome gain of Rs 25 over yesterdays close of Rs 6,175. In Calcutta, pure gold (99.9 purity) closed at Rs 6,300 and standard gold (99.5 purity) closed at Rs 5,900.																								In Hong Kong, gold closed $3.60 per ounce higher at $416.60-417.10 from the previous close of $413.00/413.50 per ounce. Similarly in London, gold fixed firm at $416 an ounce in the morning from the last level of $412.00.																								Ready silver (.999 fineness) resumed smartly higher at Rs 9,455 and shot up further to end at Rs 9,480, showing a steep rally of Rs 100 over yesterdays close of Rs 9,380.																								Gold climbed 19 per cent this year, largely because the dollars 16 per cent drop against the euro made the dollar-priced metal cheaper for buyers in Europe. Gold futures yesterday traded as high as $416.50 an ounce in New York, the highest price for a most-active contract since February 1996.																								We anticipate seeing gold going higher in the new year as the dollar continues to come under pressure on the demand front, said bullion market expert Paul Carter in Australia.

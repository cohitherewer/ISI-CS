 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dream merchants																								New Delhi, May 16: Reliance Infocomm has upped the ante in the battle with cellular operators over the issue of limited mobility by stretching the boundaries of its service and offering 20-second movie clips on its handsets.																								Reliance has launched Armaan Zone, a promotional platform for the Amitabh Bachchan starrer on Reliance IndiaMobile phones.																								Reliance IndiaMobile users can view 20-second trailers of the movie on their handset as well as participate in contests and instant polls relating to the movie.																								This is the first time a movie is being promoted by a limited mobile phone service provider on its code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) technology handset.																								Reliance and other WiLL players are already locked in a grim battle over the limited mobility service. One of the many issues raised by the cellular operators is that the WiLL players are not respecting the circumscribed limits of operations that have been stipulated by Trai.																								Reliance has made no bones about its intention to test all the limits of CDMA  the technology that drives its limited mobility service. The Ambanis have always contended that you cannot have artificial straitjackets to regulate the use of any technology. 																								The movie clip service is another instance of how Reliance does not feel constrained to limit its sphere of operations. 																								Armaan, which stars Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor and Preity Zinta, is the directorial debut of screenplay writer, Honey Irani. The movie is produced by Dinesh Gandhi and was released on Friday. Hungama.com is sponsoring the promos and contest on Reliance IndiaMobile phones.																								Reliance IndiaMobile is the only limited mobile service provider that offers convergence of computing, media, telecommunication and entertainment.																								Apart from the trailers, Reliance IndiaMobile subscribers can get all information relating to the movie such as the plot and the team behind the movie; download wall papers and participate in contests relating to the movie and win prizes.																								They can also take part in pre-launch and post launch polls that give critical feed back to the makers of the movie. 																								Till now, television and cinema exhibition houses were the only places where movie trailers could be shown. With this new service subscribers can now access trailers and information about movies anytime, anywhere.																								The advanced design and architecture of Reliance IndiaMobile network effectively integrates high bandwidth wireless data capability of CDMA 2000 1x technology, custom-made software and hardware on Reliance IndiaMobile handsets, powerful servers running on indigenously developed Reliance Application Platform (RAP) and Reliance Infocomms terabit capacity, nationwide fibre optic backbone. 																								This unique combination of technologies enables the company to offer broadband capability, necessary for audio and video-on-demand services.

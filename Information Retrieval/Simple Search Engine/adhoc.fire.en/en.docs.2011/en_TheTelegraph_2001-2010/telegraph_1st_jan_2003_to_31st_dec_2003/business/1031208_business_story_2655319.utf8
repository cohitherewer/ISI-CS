 Monday, December 08, 2003 				 Be on your guard
																								When did you last visit your bank to take out money? Chances are you havent in the past six months. You didnt have to, thanks to the ATM. But ever wondered what youd do if you got a fake note from an ATM?																								Its rare  but it is a scary prospect. Imagine being stuck with a dud Rs 500 note? Some people have turned so paranoid that they do not take out more than Rs 500 at a time to ensure that they get only Rs 100 notes. Thats a solution, but could be irritating for the people waiting outside, and exasperating if one of the Rs 100 notes turned out to be fake. What is more, its not quite conceivable if youre taking out a big sum, say Rs 10,000. 																								In most cases, you wouldnt even realise that you have got a dud note till youve tried to use it to pay something. And that could be very embarrassing. So, next time you take money out of an ATM, check the notes before putting them in your wallet. Hold them against light and look for the security marks. Make it a habit to do so every time you take money out of an ATM. 																								If a note looks dubious, report it to the guard. Contact the bank if its still open, or call the contact centre if it has one, as quickly as possible. Use the service phone if the ATM has one. 																								Bankers say its a complex problem. Its impossible to track a fake note to a dispensing machine. Yet in most cases, the benefit of doubt goes in favour of the customer if he can prove his case to a certain degree.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Cell users go places in roaming rate war
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Music to the ears																								New Delhi, Dec. 26: Roaming charges have crashed with the telecom titans intensifying their rate wars in a no-holds barred contest to ramp up their subscriber base.																								AirTel is the latest to slash its roaming charges bringing them on a par with Reliance and Hutch. AirTel and Hutch were offering roaming service at Rs 6.44 per minute.																								Last week, Reliance introduced a roaming charge of Rs 1.99 per minute (it did not charge anything under its multiple registration regime). Now that Reliance has been allowed to offer a full-scale mobility service, the two major cellular operators have been forced to cut roaming charges.																								AirTels post-paid customers can now roam freely without paying any STD deposits or a monthly roaming rental of Rs 99bv. While roaming on other national GSM networks, a roaming rental of Rs 5 per day, not exceeding Rs 25 per month would be applicable.																								Airtime charges on all incoming calls while roaming will be free. The airtime charge will be now Rs.1.99 per minute for making an outgoing call, resulting in a substantial decrease in their roaming costs. Hutch had also announced an airtime rate of Rs 1.99 per minute.																								In the case of Reliance, the rates applicable for all outgoing calls while roaming are the same as that in the customers home tariff plan. For receiving incoming calls while roaming outside their home circle, Reliance customers will have to pay only the tariff rates that are currently applicable for a long distance call from Reliance phones to CDMA mobile phones.																								For example, a Calcutta-based user with a Budget-149 tariff plan needs to pay only Rs 1.99 per minute to receive a call from anywhere while roaming in Chennai. With the introduction of roaming, Reliance customers, just like customers of other mobile service providers, will not have to pay incoming charges for receiving calls while travelling within the home circle.																								We are moving away from the concept of airtime charge plus surcharge for roaming, which mobile customers have been compelled to pay for the last several years by other mobile service providers. This provides a saving of up to 70 per cent for a Reliance customer over customers of other mobile service providers, said a Reliance spokesperson. 																								According to the Cellular Operator Association of India, AirTel has close to 5.2 million mobile customers. One in every four customers actively use the roaming facility. With roaming charges waived off and with only interconnect charges applicable, the latest initiative is bound to increase the number of roamers in the country, leading to an overall increase in the minute usage.

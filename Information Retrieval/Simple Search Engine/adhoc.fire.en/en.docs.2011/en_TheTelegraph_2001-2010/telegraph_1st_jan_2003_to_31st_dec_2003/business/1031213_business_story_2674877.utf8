 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 RBI calls for prudence in home loan disbursal
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kamesam: Cautious 																								Mumbai, Dec. 12: The banks are witnessing a retail boom in housing loan portfolio. However, it is also beginning to cause discomfiture of a possible asset bubble.																								While welcoming the robust growth of this segment, Reserve Bank deputy governor Vepa Kamesam today warned that banks non-performing assets may rise if mortgages are not in order. We are happy that the housing portfolio has risen fast but banks must ensure that they do not cut corners in this process, Kamesam told newspersons on the sidelines of the Bank Economists Conference-2003 being held here.																								This is not the first time that the central bank is expressing its concern on the relentless growth witnessed in housing loans portfolio and their pricing. Though the RBI is not opposed to the expansion in banks housing loan portfolios, it has been cautioning them to take adequate care while sanctioning such loans.																								Banks have been experiencing an enormous growth in housing loan largely as a result of the falling interest rate regime. Amidst a cut-throat competition to expand their customer base, the rates of interest on such loans are as low as 7.5 per cent in some cases.																								In some of the nationalised banks, retail loans constitute around 20 per cent of their total loans. In this portfolio, housing loans account for the largest chunk of around 80 per cent.																								Kamesam said that housing loans could lead to potential NPAs if banks avoid proper documentation. He, however, added that so far delinquencies in housing loans have not reached a level of concern.																								He divulged that banks have been accepting power of attorney as security against loans extended. The so called mortgage is not a real mortgage, as power of attorney cannot substitute a title deed, he said. However, such a practice has been widely prevalent, he added. When you are doing mortgage-backed finance, your mortgages have to be in order.																								On being asked whether the RBI was worried over the possibility of an asset bubble in housing, he said, the RBI will look into it because everyone has reduced the prices.																								Speaking on Retail Banking: Challenges ahead in distribution channels in the urban/rural India, B. D. Narang, CMD of Oriental Bank of Commerce, pointed out that the bank had anticipated average rate of default in housing loan segment to be 0.5 per cent. While the bank had priced these loans accordingly, it subsequently found out that incremental rate of NPAs on new housing loans is close to 1.5 per cent and that effective NPA levels could be around 2.5 per cent.

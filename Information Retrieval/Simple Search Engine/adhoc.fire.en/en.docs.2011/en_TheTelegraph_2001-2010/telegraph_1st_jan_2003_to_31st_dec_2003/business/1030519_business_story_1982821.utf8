				 				 																								NESTLE INDIA 																																											Nestle India has put up quite a good performance for the first quarter ended March 2003. At Rs 598.10 crore (Rs 530 crore) net sales were up 13 per cent over the corresponding previous quarter (24 per cent sequentially). Operating expenditure went up 15 per cent over the corresponding previous quarter to Rs 466.84 crore (Rs 405.30 crore) (sequentially it rose by 14 per cent). Though there has been significant revenue growth, rising costs have cut into the margins. At Rs 131.26 crore (Rs 124.70 crore) operating profit went up by about 5 per cent over the corresponding previous quarter. OPM at 22 per cent was 2 percentage points below the year-ago period up from the 15 per cent it reported during the December quarter. At Rs 11.05 crore (Rs 4.60 crore) other income was up by a huge 140 per cent over the year-ago period (up 37 per cent sequentially). A 16 per cent rise in the tax provisioning (up by 130 per cent over the December quarter figure) saw net profit rise by 13 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 86.69 crore (Rs 76.80 crore). On a sequential quarter basis, net profit was up 77 per cent. The stock currently trading at Rs 540 discounts its March quarter annualised EPS of Rs 35.96 by 15 times.

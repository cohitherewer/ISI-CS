 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 A step closer to petro regulator
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Naik: All for oil 																								New Delhi, Dec. 11: Petroleum minister Ram Naik said today that the government would introduce a bill to set up a petroleum regulatory authority during the current session of Parliament. 																								The minister said that the cabinet cleared the petroleum regulatory board bill yesterday incorporating all but two of the 49 recommendations made by the parliamentary standing committee. 																								The bill provides for a regulatory mechanism that will facilitate uninterrupted and adequate supply of petroleum and petroleum products in all parts of the country at a fair price, and promote competitive markets and access to monopolistic infrastructure in the nature of common carrier on non-discriminatory basis by all entities. 																								He said amendments to the bill, which was introduced in Parliament in May 2002, will now be tabled and we will try to get it passed during the winter session itself. The minister was talking to newspersons on the sidelines of the three-day international workshop on hydrogen energy that began here today.																								Naik said the government has accepted 47 out of the 49 recommendations made by the standing committee, including that to enhance the punishment for violators to three years imprisonment. The standing committees recommendation that connecting facilities like storage, marketing and import terminals be included in the definition of common carrier has been rejected. According to international practices, storage facilities are not considered as a common carrier and each company has to make its own investment in these facilities. Hydrogen fuel																								Chalking out the countrys roadmap for introducing hydrogen as a fuel, Naik said that trial runs with three-wheelers are expected to start by 2005.																								Petroleum secretary B. K. Chaturvedi would lead a team of experts from oil and gas firms in a visit to the hydrogen installations in the US next week.

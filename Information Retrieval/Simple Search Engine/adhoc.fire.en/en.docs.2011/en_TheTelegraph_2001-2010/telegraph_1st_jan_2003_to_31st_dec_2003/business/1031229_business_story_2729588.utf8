 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 NIIT logs into Bengal with kids project
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The kiosk in Amtala Pix by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Dec. 28: Children in rural Bengal will now get a taste of technology with NIIT providing an opportunity to learn computers through their hole-in-the-wall project. The project will help children aged between 6 and 13 years to take the first step to cross the digital divide.																								The first kiosk containing three computers has been set up near Amtala. 																								The second will come up at Pathor Protima in the Sunderbans. Another kiosk may be set up in the slums of Entally. The project is funded by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a World Bank affiliate.																								We have received Rs 7 crore from IFC, to be utilised within a period of three years, says Sugata Mitra, chief scientist at NIITs Centre for Research in Cognitive Systems. Each kiosk will be funded for one year from the date of inauguration. The cost of maintaining the kiosk will then have to be taken over by a government or private body.																								A VSAT will soon be set up near the kiosk to enable access to the internet. The maintenance costs amount to around Rs 6,000 per month, Mitra said. However, without the internet services, the cost reduces to a mere Rs 500 every month, he added.																								The project aims to discover the extent to which children in slums and rural areas can learn from a web-based curriculum through a purpose-built internet kiosk. It strives to improve education with a minimal level of intervention. The kiosk is designed specially to prevent adult interference.

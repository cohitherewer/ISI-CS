 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Board to ensure good governance
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 11: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is planning to set up a board for payment and settlement systems to provide efficient governance and best practices in risk management.																								According to RBI governor Y. V. Reddy, the board would provide policy directions in areas relating to regulation and supervision of payment and settlement systems, approval of payment systems, criteria for membership and handling of offences.																								The board will function in a manner similar to the Board of Financial Supervision.																								He said this is being done in anticipation of statutory changes and preliminary steps are proposed to be taken to build the requisite infrastructure for having effective supervision over payment and settlement systems.																								Currently, the clearing process is the predominant mode of funds settlement. This is accomplished by about 1,050 clearing houses in the country. These houses function on the basis of the Uniform Regulations and Rules for Bankers Clearing Houses, a model regulation proposed by the RBI.																								However, Bank for International Settlements has formulated a set of core principles for systematically important payment systems which are the minimum requirements for a sound payment system. 																								A draft payment and settlement systems bill was prepared by the RBI and forwarded to the Centre.																								This would ensure that all payments and settlements in the country are subject to efficient governance and that they adopt the best practices in risk management, which is the prime requirement relating to a safe, secure and efficient payment and settlement system, he noted. These arrangements should also facilitate easy transition to a more formal statutory system, he added.																								Delivering the inaugural address at the twenty-fifth Bank Economists Conference-2003, Reddy averred that the financial sector can add competitive strength and growth if reforms in the sector keep pace.

 Saturday, November 29, 2003 				 Stocks firm, sensex ends above 5000
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 28: Stocks continued their march and pushed the sensex above the 5000-mark today. Sustained buying by operators coupled with an active participation from retail investors saw the key index rise 56 points.																								Sebi figures have also revealed that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have made a net investment of Rs 437 crore on Thursday. This allayed the apprehension that investments by FIIs could peter out as the year drew to a close. Market analysts said offshore investors continued to remain bullish on India.																								The BSE benchmark 30-share index opened moderately higher at 4995.15 and rose further sharply to the intra-day high of 5050.56 before ending at 5044.82 against yesterdays close of 4989.04, netting a rise of 55.78 points or 1.12 per cent.																								The rise was led by old economy stocks as they are supposed to be the largest beneficiaries from a robust economic growth expected this year. Reliance Industries, Tisco, Grasim, GACL, Bajaj Auto, L amp;T and ACC showed prominent gains.

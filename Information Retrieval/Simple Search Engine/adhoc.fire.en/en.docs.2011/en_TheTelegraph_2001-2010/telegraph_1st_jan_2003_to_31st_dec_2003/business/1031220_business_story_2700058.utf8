 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Spotlight on foreign hopefuls in ICAI poll
 RAJA GHOSHAL 				 The big fight 																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: Indian and foreign chartered accountant firms are gearing up for the big fight  election of the new president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).																								The first round of the battle takes place this week with the council elections being held today and tomorrow across India to choose the 24 candidates from about 50 candidates who are in the fray. The president is elected by the elected council members and his tenure is for a year. The ICAI hasnt had a president representing the foreign CAs lobby since 1978-79 when P. K. Malik came from Lovelock Lewes.																								This year there are three aspirants from the foreign CAs brigade  all from PricewaterhouseCoopers. They are Harinderjeet Singh from Delhi, Partho Mitra from Calcutta and Gopal Krishnan (a sitting member) from Hyderabad.																								Its turning into a pretty acrimonious battle even as the chasm between Indian and foreign CA firms have widened over the past year. Given the antipathy towards the foreign CA firms, it seems unlikely that the professional body will get a president from the foreign firms. 																								For a long time now, the institute has had no president from a foreign CA firm, said an ex-president of ICAI who did not wish to be named.																								There is very little chance of any of the three candidates from the foreign firms running for council elections to become the president. Only one or two of them will be elected to the council, the ex-president said.																								Last time there were three council members from foreign CA firms from KPMG, Deloitte Haskins amp; Sells and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Insiders said, By convention, the acting vice-president of ICAI is elected as the president, though this is not by legislation. So, Sunil Goyal, the acting vice-president of ICAI is tipped to be the president. Each council election, held after three years, comes up with a new vice-president.																								The rift between the domestic CA firms and the foreign ones has been widening for a long time now. 																								The swadeshi lobby has often accused the foreign CA firms of bending the law to practise in India  which has become a major bone of contention because Indian CA s are not permitted to practise abroad. 																								As of now, the foreign CA firms in India are not directly registered with ICAI, but do so in the name of an Indian partner. That provision can only change, either in favour or against the foreign CA firms only at the forum of the WTO and the GATS, said . D. Gupta, an ICAI council member.

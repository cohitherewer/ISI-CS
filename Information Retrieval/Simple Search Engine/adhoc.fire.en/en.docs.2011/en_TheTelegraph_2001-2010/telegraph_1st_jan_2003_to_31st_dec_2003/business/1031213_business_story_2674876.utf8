 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Soft car loans propel sales 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Gathering speed 																								New Delhi, Dec. 12: Passenger car sales shot up by 41.4 per cent in November from a year ago, boosted by falling car finance rates and excitement generated by new models showcased in the marketplace.																								The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said today car sales in the past month leapt to 58,166 units from 41,146 units in the same month last year.																								Sales in the April-November period, the first eight months of the current fiscal to March 2004, rose to 433,840 units from 344,701 a year earlier.																								Demand has been buoyant because of softer car financing rates which are at a historical thirty-year low, said an auto market analyst with Crisil.																								He also added that new car models and upgrades of old populars such as Marutis Zen has meant just that excitement which helps spur sales.																								Nearly 70 per cent of the 5.5 lakh new vehicles bought are through financing schemes. By tying up with banks with huge rural reach such as SBI and PNB, car makers have now started penetrating rural markets which were till now little tapped, analysts said. 																								Good monsoons, which generated spare cash with farms across the country and improved winter crop prospects, have meant an ability and a will to spend on luxuries this year in Indian villages.																								Market leader Maruti Udyog Ltd reported a 45.4 per cent hike in sales helped by the old favourites like Maruti 800 and Zen, which remained on top.																								Hyundai Motor reported a 20.3 per cent rise in sales to 11,056 units during the month under review. Sale of Tata Motors surged by 44.4 per cent to 8,304 units.																								The local subsidiaries of US-based General Motors and Ford clocked higher sales at 1,245 and 1,598 units respectively.																								Sales of trucks and buses combined went up by nearly 50 per cent at 21,860 units compared with 14,183 in the same month a year earlier. Sales in April-November were 153,559 units against 114,016 a year earlier. 																								Truck sales soared in the past year, helped by replacement demand geared by tough environment laws, which demand scrapping of old vehicles.																								Motorcycle sales, however, rose a modest 5 per cent to 3.77 lakh from 3.59 lakh a year earlier.

 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Indian Oil lowers cost of Chennai-Trichy pipeline
 S. P. S. PANNU				 On an expansion drive 																								New Delhi, Dec. 25: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has slashed the cost of the Chennai-Trichy-Madurai pipeline by Rs 100 crore and will be funding the project through its own resources. The Rs 400-crore project is expected to be completed by mid-2005. 																								The Chennai-Trichy-Madurai pipeline project, initially undertaken by Petronet Indian Ltd, had failed to take off as banks were reluctant to finance the consortium comprising all the oil companies. The project cost at the time had been worked out to around Rs 500 crore. 																								IOC has decided to take up the project on its own in order to evacuate the products of the Chennai refinery, which is being expanded from a capacity of 7.5 million tonnes to 10.5 million tonnes per annum. The cash-rich oil major now also feels that it has enough internal resources to finance the project even though banks are willing to advance loans for the project. 																								IOC has pruned the pipeline project to integrate it with its Chennai refinery. Since the pipeline will now start from the refinery instead of the Ennore port outside the city, no new tankage has to be built. The tankage at the Chennai refinery will be used to feed the refinery. 																								IOC has also reduced the diameter of the pipeline from 18 inches envisaged earlier to 12 inches in order to ensure better capacity utilisation of the project. Both these decisions have resulted in a sharp reduction in the project cost. 																								However, IOC has added a branch line to Salem, which was not envisaged in the original project. This will enable the oil major to reach out to a wider market with the same pipeline.																								The project will also give Tamil Nadu its first oil pipeline and will mark IOCs foray into the south as well. Until now all the IOC pipelines were concentrated in the northern, eastern and western parts of the country. 																								IOC has provided its expertise for laying the Mangalore-Bangalore pipeline and is currently even operating it for ONGC. The upstream oil company has only recently entered the downstream business after acquiring the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited. Once the ONGC staff gains adequate experience to run the pipeline it will be handed over to them.																								Once the pipeline is commissioned each of the southern states  Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu  will have their own pipeline network emanating from Vizag, Mangalore, Kochi and Chennai refineries respectively. This will now redress the imbalance as the nations pipeline network was earlier concentrated in the northern and western region. IOCs Paradip-Haldia pipeline project will make the network stronger in the east. 																								Part of the mechanical work of expanding the Chennai refinery has already been completed and production is expected to begin in January from the new unit. The new hydrocracker unit, which enables the extraction of higher value added products from the same cut of crude, will be completed in April.

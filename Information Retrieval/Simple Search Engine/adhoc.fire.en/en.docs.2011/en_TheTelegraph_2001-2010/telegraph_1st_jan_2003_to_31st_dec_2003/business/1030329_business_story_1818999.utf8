 Saturday, March 29, 2003 				 Telecom regulator not to review tariff plan 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 28: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) was forced to reschedule the effective date of implementation of the new interconnect user charge (IUC) and tariff plans as many operators had failed to meet the IUC regimes in their alternative tariff plans.																								Trai will also not review the interconnect user charge and the standard tariff that will be effective from May 1.																								The telecom regulator has set a date of April 3 for the operators to file their alternative tariff. On Thursday, Trai had decided to reschedule the implementation of the IUC regime and the new tariff for the basic, cellular and limited mobile operators.																								Trai official today said that they were forced to reschedule the date of implementation in the long-term interest of the consumer and the industry. 																								Many of the alternative tariffs were submitted very late and that would have meant very less time for the consumers. Further, a few operators had failed to meet the IUC regime in their alternate tariff plans. They had also filed their tariff plan very late and we felt that the time was not sufficient for the consumers to adopt or reject, said D. P. S. Seth, member Trai. 																								We do not think that a delay of 30 days will make much difference in the business of the operators. The decision to reschedule the date of implementation was taken for a logical, systematic implementation of the order without any disturbance, said Seth.																								On Thursday, Trai had said that it had received various proposed alternative tariff plans from the service providers during March 10 and 24, and these needed detailed consideration/revision. These have been communicated to the service providers concerned and they have been required to file tariff plans in consonance with the IUC regime to the authority complying with the provisions of the 24th amendment to the Telecom Tariff Order.																								There were cases where operators had filed more than 16 alternative tariff plans. Most of them did not meet the IUC norms. Another alternate tariff plan had discriminated against one type of service against the another. These had led us to take the decision of rescheduling the implementation date by one month, said Seth.

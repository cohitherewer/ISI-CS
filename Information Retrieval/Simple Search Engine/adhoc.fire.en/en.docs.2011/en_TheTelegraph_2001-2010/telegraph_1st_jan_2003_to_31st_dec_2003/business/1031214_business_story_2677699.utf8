 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 IRDA chief C. S. Rao (second from right) in Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, Dec. 13: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) may approach the government, asking it to allow the foreign partner in a private insurance company to increase its stake beyond 26 per cent if the Indian promoter fails to bring in additional funds required to maintain capital adequacy.																								Talking to newspersons here today on the sidelines of a seminar  Insurance India 2003  IRDA chairman C.S. Rao said, The Indian companies who have floated insurance arms have enough funds to maintain the capital adequacy ratio. If at anytime they fail to bring in additional capital, then IRDA will intervene and request the government to allow the foreign partner to increase its stake for fresh capital infusion.																								According to the existing norm, the Indian partner should hold 74 per cent and the foreign partner 26 per cent in an insurance company.																								Private insurers have made representations to the insurance regulator for allowing their foreign allies to increase their stake from 26 per cent to 49 per cent.																								The total foreign direct investment in India in the insurance sector now stands at Rs 812.50 crore. The total premium income of the Indian insurance industry, both life and non-life, for the year ending March 31, 2003 stood at Rs 71376.11 crore.																								Rao said a committee had been formed, with representatives from the Acturial Society of India, to look into the mortality rate of Indian population. The mortality rate on which Life Insurance of India designs its policies is based on the earlier census. The committee which has been formed will give a report on the mortality rate according to the new census.																								The IRDA is also worried about complaints regarding third party administrators. While some of the TPAs have been successful in settling the cases, there are cases where TPAs have not been helpful. The regulator is currently looking into ways to streamline the functions of TPAs, Rao said.																								Rao said with the opening up of the insurance industry, there is a competition in the market place. The entry of new players has also lead to the creation of new business opportunities.

 Tuesday, July 15, 2003 				 Corporate captains fly in for an ovation to Launch Pad IIT
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 14: IITs past is toiling for its future. Corporate helmsmen who earned their stripes as students of the countrys pre-eminent technology school are pulling together to give their alma mater a tribute.																								The PAN IIT Trust, set up by former students that includes the legendary . R. Narayana Murthy, will help organise IIT 2050, an event that will bring ex-IIT students to throw up ideas on how to preserve the institutes culture and improve its image across the world.																								The steering committee for the event will be co-chaired by McKinsey boss Rajat Gupta, along with the Infosys chief mentor. Gupta, whose company has a reputation for helping companies find their way to the cutting edge of competition, says the aim is to debate and celebrate the IITs role now and in future. 																								The idea is to get all stakeholders to discover what we can do in the next 50 years, said Murthy, who himself set up a trust to support his alma mater a few years ago.																								IIT 2050, the two-day jamboree to be held on December 21-22 in Delhis Indira Gandhi Stadium and Pragati Maidan, will be inaugurated by President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will deliver the valedictory address to over 5,000 IITians who are expected to converge from across the world.																								Information about the event was given to reporters today at Lever House, the abode of Hindustan Lever, whose chairman M. S. Banga passed out from IIT Delhi. He is the chairperson of the sponsorship committee. 																								Sharing the dias with him was Yogi Deveshwar, the ITC chairman, who will organise the event along with co-chairman R. Gopalakrishnan, a member on the board of Tata Sons and chairman of several Tata companies.																								The leading lights from the corporate world reiterated that IIT 2050 aims to bring together past students to strengthen the community feeling among IITians here and abroad, and build a bridge between them.																								What distinguishes IIT 2050 from similar events held in the past is that former students on the top rung of the corporate ladder are now looking at all centres  a break from the past when those who made it big lavished attention, and money, only on their own institute.

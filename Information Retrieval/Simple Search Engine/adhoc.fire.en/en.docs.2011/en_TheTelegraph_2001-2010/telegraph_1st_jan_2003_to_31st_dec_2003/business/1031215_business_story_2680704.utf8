 M RAJENDRAN				 	 Call for all																								New Delhi, Dec. 14: Fixed-line telephony operators like Bharti and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) are scheduled to roll out a slew of value-added services over the next few months to plug the migration of subscribers to mobile service providers.																								With mobile telephony services eating into fixed-line services market, the race is on to provide more and more services over fixed lines in order to keep landlines as lucrative as possible. One such recent addition is the provision of short messaging service (SMS) on fixed-line networks and a cut in rates for the transfer of phones and reconnection charges.																								Almost all the telecom operators who provide fixed-line services covered by the basic service licence have announced that they will be providing SMS on fixed lines.																								The trend is to offer more feature-rich fixed-line equipment and services like cordless phones that can provide coverage of up to 1 kilometre and send out alerts about the bill amount due for payment.																								We have introduced SMS on our service and there will be many value-added services introduced in fixed-line phones that are available on mobile telephones, said Badri Agarwal, president, infotel leaders, Bharti Televentures Ltd. 																								Touchtel, the fixed line service from Bharti, offers masala junction, a service that allows subscribers to listen and share jokes, news, greetings, birthday wishes, cricket scores and even bhajans.																								All that the customer needs to do is dial 1750 and listen to instructions. Currently, the exchange of information is between two landline phones only, but given that there are over 40 million fixed line phones in India, it holds immense potential.																								BSNL plans to launch similar services in a few circles as a pilot project free of cost. It has already announced that there will be no initial rental charge for the customers who have left them for mobile connection and want to re-connect. The company has also launched SMS on fixed-line phone free of cost in a few circles.																								These services are in a series on initiatives by fixed-line service providers across the country to bring in an element of stickiness to its customer base. Fixed-line bases are fast eroding due to an increasing popularity of mobile phones, Bharat Sanchar Nigam CMD Prithipal Singh said.																								Another facet that fixed-line service providers are exploring is to hook their customers onto the internet through a broadband.

 RAJA GHOSHAL				 	 Open book																								New Delhi, Dec. 25: The government accounting standards are being rejigged to make them as transparent and easily comprehensible as those for India Inc.																								In 10 years time, the governments accounts should be at least as comprehensible and transparent as the books of companies. Currently, the government accounts are understood only by the people who work on them, said S. Sathyamoorthy, deputy comptroller and Auditor general.																								Sathyamoorthy is also the chairperson of the Government Accounting Standards Advisory Board (GASAB), which was founded by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to formulate accounting standards for the Union and state governments.																								GASAB has been asked to suggest ways to make government accounting standards tighter and more transparent. It has already begun its exercise to re-formulate several government accounting standards, including those relating to investments made by the government. 																								These accounting standards will be built on the lines of accounting standards in the corporate entities, but there will be differences as well keeping in mind the unique position of the government, said Sathyamoorthy. 																								A priority area for GASAB is working out the nitty gritty pertaining to the disclosure requirements of the various investments made by the government, said Sathyamoorthy. 																								Other topics include provisions, contingent liabilities (other than guarantees) and contingent assets, classification of accounting transactions, correction of errors, including prior period adjustments, 																								Also on the radar of GASAB are standards for extraordinary items, administered transactions, reserves and deposits, suspense transactions and details pertaining to remittances. 																								The first Indian government accounting standards (IGAS1) on guarantees given by government: disclosure requirements has been approved by the CAG and is awaiting Presidential assent before its notification.																								Topics on which exposure drafts are in the final stages and will be ready within the next one month include cash flow statements, accounting and classification of grants-in-aid and simplification of presentation of financial statements, to make it more transparent and comprehensible. 																								However, working on government accounting standards has its own set of peculiarities, Sathyamoorthy said. Unlike companies, the government is not all about profits and losses. It has several roles which have to be kept in mind while framing accounting standards, he said. 																								GASAB director Amitabh Banerjee, who is from the railway accounts services, said that creating accounting norms for Indian Railways is not easy. The enormous size of the railways, its huge assets and employee numbers will require enormous work to frame effective accounting standards. However, he felt that GASAB would be able to sort out all the problems.

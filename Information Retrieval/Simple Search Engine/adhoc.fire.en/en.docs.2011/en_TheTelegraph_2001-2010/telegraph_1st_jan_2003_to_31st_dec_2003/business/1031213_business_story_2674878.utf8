 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Jolt to Reliance Energy
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 12: The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has restrained Mumbai-based power utility Reliance Energy (formerly known as BSES Ltd) from disconnecting supply to consumers for non-payment of additional security deposit.																								MERC, in an interim order issued today, said that considering the circumstances and representations made by a consumer organisation it is directing BSES to refrain from disconnecting supply to consumers.																								MERC said the proposal made by Reliance Energy for the approval of annual revenue requirement is already before the commission and security deposit could be decided as part of those proceeds. 																								MERC has the power to regulate electricity tariff and other related issues and its decision can only be challenged in the Supreme Court. 																								Reliance Energy had argued that the deposit is used as a security against bad debts and that this practice is being followed by state-owned BEST and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. 																								Recently, the power generator cum distributor which was acquired last year by the Reliance group had sent notices to their consumers demanding payment of additional security deposit within seven days failing which their power supply could be disconnected.																								The Mumbai Grahak Panchayat had moved the MERC against the BSES move and contended that the security deposit is a part of tariff and required specific approval from the regulator.																								It also prayed for immediate injunction in the wake of the BSES threat to disconnect supply in a very short time.																								Reliance Energy, is the largest distributor of power in Mumbai and has a captive consumer base of over two million consumers in the city.																								The notices to the consumers said there is a provision in the approved conditions of supply that enables Reliance Energy to collect security deposit equal to three months bill amount from all consumers.																								Reliance Energy contended that the security deposit demand is legal and all customers are required to maintain such a deposit. 																								This requirement has been spelt out in the companys Conditions of supply and miscellaneous charges under clause 16 of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 which has been approved by the central government.																								Electricity is a commodity wherein energy is sold first and billed later. The payments are made thereafter. Thus even a defaulting consumer gets credit against payments of bills for at least three months. The deposit is used as a security against bad debts, the company argued.																								The company said the security deposit will carry an interest rate of 5.5 per cent.

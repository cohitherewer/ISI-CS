																								Mumbai, Nov. 16 (PTI): Sun Microsystems has predicted a quantum leap in its Java-based application in the Indian market. The software major is bullish following the governments move allowing unified licence to telecom operators. 																								The company has rolled out an array of initiatives targeted at mobile operators and telecom majors in the country. The regime will witness a shift in focus of services, from the present voice-based system to the emerging era of convergence, Sun Microsystems India chief K. P. Unnikrishnan said. 																								Voice services would become cheaper.

The company has launched Sun content delivery server, Java device test suite and Java mobility advantage programme to provide mobile operators with tools for managing consumer and enterprise mobile content. 																								These applications will help in improving average revenue per user for service providers. Further, it would also provide a freedom of choice to the operators, he added.																								IT spending																								Research and advisory firm Gartner Inc estimates that indian information and communications technology (ICT) spending, would grow at 17 per cent to $17.17 billion in 2003-2004 due to a strong spending on telecom services and equipment and software in the country.

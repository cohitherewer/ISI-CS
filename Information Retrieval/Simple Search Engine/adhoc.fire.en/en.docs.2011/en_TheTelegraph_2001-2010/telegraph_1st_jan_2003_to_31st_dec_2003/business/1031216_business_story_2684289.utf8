 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 15: Indias image abroad is just as confused as it is within the country  and the reason for this is the fact its people appear to project the idea that economic development is entirely compatible with extremist politics, says Sunil Khilnani, professor in Johns Hopkins University.																								Bangalore and Gujarat represent the two faces of India  and it would be foolish not to recognise or acknowledge the reality of everything that the two locales represent. 																								In Bangalore, one senses the enchanting promise of technology to transform and uplift lives to take India forward into the global economy. In Gujarat, one feels the brute fact of technology at the service of state-sponsored massacres which threaten to drag India back into a dark world of religious bloodshed, said Khilnani while addressing a Ficci symposium here today.

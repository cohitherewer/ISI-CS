 Thursday, January 23, 2003 				 Crisil rating pat for IPCL
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 22: The Credit Rating and Information Services of India Ltd (Crisil) has upgraded the debt instruments of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL) on the basis of strong business and financial support from its new parent, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).																								While IPCLs 1403 crore non-convertible debenture issue has been upgraded to AA from AA-, the rating agency also upgraded the companys fixed deposit programme to FAA+ from FAA.																								Crisil said that its ratings continue to factor in IPCLs position in the domestic polymer market and its geographically diversified and integrated operations. However, these strengths are offset by a weak financial position which is inconsistent with its current rating category, its susceptibility to movements in international prices of polymers, a potential increase in the prices of natural gas and IPCLs high fixed cost structure.																								IPCLs financial profile is likely to improve in the medium term with the use of accruals towards debt repayment, as it has no large capital expenditure plans on the anvil, Crisil added.

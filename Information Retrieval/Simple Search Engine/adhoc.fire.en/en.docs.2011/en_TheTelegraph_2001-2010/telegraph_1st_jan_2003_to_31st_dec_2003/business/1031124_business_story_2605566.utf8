 M RAJENDRAN				 Airy feeling 																								New Delhi, Nov. 23: The wireless brigade carries on its relentless march. After knocking the stuffing out of wireline telephony business, theres a slew of wireless gizmos  gaming adapters, camera, printer server and presentation player  that will clear up the messy clutter of wires in homes.																								This means no more wires running around the house or back of your stack fitted with costly gizmos that your friendly mouse loves to chew.																								Indian consumers can now listen to digital music and view pictures stored in their computers on their home entertainment centre, without running cables through the house. 																								Cisco Systems has launched Linksys in India, the global leader of broadband, wireless, and networking hardware for the consumer and small-office-home-office (SOHO) markets.																								Now, at a cost of Rs 13,900, the media adapter gives you wireless connection to display digital photographs from your camera (which you earlier saw on your PC/Laptop) on the TV for the whole family to enjoy.																								Additionally, your digital music collection is finally freed from those little computer speakers and can play full blast through your stereo system. 																								The wireless media adapter sits by your home stereo and television and connects to them using standard consumer electronics cables. The wireless adapter then connects with your PC/laptop either wireless or through wires. Using the remote control and the user-friendly menus on your TV, you can browse through the digital pictures on your computer by folder, filename or thumbnail. 																								You can view pictures one at a time, or watch an automatically created slideshow of all the pictures in a given folder. The media adapter supports four popular picture formats: JPEG, GIF, TIF and BMP. Moreover, use the remote to browse your MP3 or WMA formatted music collection by title, artist, genre, folder or play list and play it through the stereo system. 																								You can even let music play in the background while you browse your pictures. 																								Today one can create a wireless networked home in about Rs 50,000 (almost the cost of a big screen TV) and a SOHO network in about Rs 70,000. Broadband access and the related applications are poised to become a mass-market phenomenon, Linksys vice-president and general manager Tushar Kothari said. 																								The other product for the SOHO segment includes a wireless print server that can connect directly with the local area network (LAN) either through wired or wireless option. Unlike the traditional printer that needs to be connected to a computer for doing server functionality, the wireless print server does not need to be connected to a PC/laptop.																								Paranoid about leaving the house, the company claims to give a wireless solution. For an investment of Rs 21,750, your house and office can be fitted with a wireless gaming adapter.

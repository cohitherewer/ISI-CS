 Saturday, October 25, 2003 				 Dabur centres for herbal services 
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, Oct. 24: FMCG major Dabur India Ltd is interested in moving into the services sector.																								We want to get into the services sector, in the herbal and ayurvedic category only, by opening ayurvedic centres in the country, said Sunil Duggal, CEO of Dabur India.																								The plans are now at the drawing board stage, but the company has already entered into a collaboration with a leading ayurvedic college in Chandigarh, Duggal said. 																								The first ayurvedic centre of Dabur is likely to get off the drawing board stage in about three months time. The first project will be in the shape of a ayurvedic hospital, affiliated to a college which will be funded by Dabur. The basic idea is to get into the services sector directly, but gradually. 																								Dabur, which has recently roped in Amitabh Bachchan as its brand endorser, is keen to be seen as the herbal-specialist. It is in this context that the company is keen on getting into backward and forward integration, an official said.																								The company is also going in for a new brand architecture. In the current one, it has Dabur, Binaca and Real as the three main brands, besides various sub-brands under the Dabur mother brand and those which it terms as Dabur endorsers. Endorsers use the Dabur prefix to their individual brands like Hajmola and Pudin Hara.

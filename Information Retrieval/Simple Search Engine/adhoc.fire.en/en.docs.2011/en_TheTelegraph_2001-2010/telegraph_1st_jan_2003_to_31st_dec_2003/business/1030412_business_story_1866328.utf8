 Saturday, April 12, 2003 				 Second homecoming for Techna
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 11: Techna, an American firm engaged in high quality offshore software development, has rediscovered the charm of Calcutta. 																								The company, founded by Alo Ghosh, has decided to make the city its centre for global corporate operations. Techna, where Purnendu Chatterjee of The Chatterjee Group holds one-third stake, started its operations here in 1991. Later it moved to greener pasuturesa decision that proved to be its undoing. Techna has already wound up its operations in Delhi.																								We have received sanctions to build a software development centre over a 3.5 acres plot in Salt Lake, Ghosh said. The first phase of the centre, to be built over 50,000 sq ft, will be completed in the next 10 months.																								While the project will be partly financed by bank loans, TCHG is expected to pump in fresh equity. If returns justify the investments then we may expand the centre to cover four lakh sq ft, Ghosh added.

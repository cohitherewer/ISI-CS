 Sunday, September 07, 2003 				 Wipro to hire more
				 	 Premji: Upbeat																								Mumbai, Sept. 6 (PTI): Wipro Ltd is planning to recruit 9,000 infotech professionals this year to meet manpower needs of its computer software services and business process outsourcing activities.																								We need to recruit 6,000 engineers for software services and 3,000 for business process outsourcing operations, Wipro chairman Azim Premji said while addressing a workshop organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and McKinsey here today.																								Currently Wipro employs about 24,000 persons, out of which 15,000 are involved in infotech services, 7,000 in IT-enabled services and call centres while 2,000 are in domestic and Asia-Pacific business, Premji said.																								On the overseas growth plans of Wipro, he said the company would be establishing a second base in a developing country for a existing client and Wipro has already dedicated 1,500 persons for the purpose.																								Premji said China is a crucial market for infotech companies and Wipro was likely to establish its base there in about two years.																								Premji said Indias software exports are likely to touch $50 billion by 2008, accounting for 35 per cent of total exports and 7 per cent of countrys gross domestic product (GDP).																								Indias IT industry is worth $16 billion and accounts for 3.2 per cent of GDP, significantly short of potential. The software exports are likely to touch $50 billion by 2008, Premji said.																								Predicting a future course for the IT industry, he said 90 per cent of software exports would take place in services and only 10 per cent in IT products.																								The IT sector has generated enormous employment opportunities and has employed about 40 lakh people directly or indirectly, he said.

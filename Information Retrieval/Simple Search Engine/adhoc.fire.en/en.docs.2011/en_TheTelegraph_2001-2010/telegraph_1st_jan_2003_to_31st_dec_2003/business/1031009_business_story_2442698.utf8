 Thursday, October 09, 2003 				 Nissan steps on gas for Sunny rollout
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sunny side up																								New Delhi, Oct. 8: Nissan Motor Company has approached the Foreign Investment Promotion Board for permission to introduce its premium sedan Sunny in the country. Japans fourth largest carmaker plans to retail the 2.0-litre, 144-bhp Sunny with a DOHC engine here once the permission is granted.																								Sunny will be powered by four-speed automatic transmission or five-speed manual transmission and comes with power windows, hi-fi music system and leather upholstery.																								The model will be priced between Rs 12-14 lakh and will compete with the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Fords Mondeo and General Motors Vectra, which is priced at Rs 17-18 lakh, analysts feel.																								However, Nissan has not specified when it will launch the model. Currently, the company has a tie-up with Delhi-based Pushpanjali Motors, which takes care of its sales, marketing and servicing activities.																								The carmaker, has not specified any investment plans to set up a factory. Most foreign vehicle makers, including General Motors, Toyota and Fiat, import engines for the vehicles they assemble in the country.																								Nissan said the decision to introduce its product in India has been spurred by the booming car market which is estimated to clock a 10-12 per cent growth in 2003-04, fuelled by lower taxes, rising incomes, and a flood of new models.																								In 2002-03, driven by price cuts, discount schemes and a host of other schemes, cumulative new car sales rose 6.4 per cent to 7,08,078 units after a flat previous year.

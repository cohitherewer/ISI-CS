The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, January 18, 2003 				 Webel sets up date with Infosys topgun
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 17: Calcutta will figure high on IT major Infosys list when it moves into the expansion mode by the end of 2003.																								Narayana Murthy has asked us to revert to him in the last quarter of 2003, confirmed Webel managing director S. K. Mitra. Murthy was earlier reluctant to set up base in Calcutta because of the investments that the company has already made in Bhubaneswar. 																								The presence of Infosys in the citys IT map will go a long way in dispensing with the citys image as a non-happening place. In December Wipro finally started work on its software development centre and BPO unit here.																								West Bengal Electronics Development Industry Corporation (Webel) is the nodal agency for IT and related industries in the state.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 27: Exporters of telecom equipment have come together to develop products jointly and identify markets worldwide. A core team has been set up under the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association (Tema). This team will be responsible to develop a strategy and devise norms that would apply to all the telecom equipment manufacturers.																								The team, headed N.K Goyal, president Tema, Rajesh Tully of Coral Telecom, ITI and Y.L Aggarwal of Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd, will identify the exporters of different kinds of telecom equipment and also software who, till now, were negotiating directly with the operators worldwide. The team will convince them to develop products based on the demands from market.																								It is a serious initiative that has been approved at Temas meeting held recently in Mumbai. The members felt that individual negotiations with the operators worldwide did not fetch them much revenue and it was difficult to convince them about the quality of the product, said Tema president N.K Goyal.																								Hence, it has been decided that the core team of Tema will identify markets and inform the various exporters of their demand. Following this, all those who are needed to develop such products will jointly turnout the product and sell it in the market. This will lead to assured return on investments since the cost of the product will be determined by the Tema and various other telecom associations worldwide, Goyal added.																								Tema is already in negotiations with the Telecom Industry Association of the US. It has identified a few major markets in West Asia, Africa, and South Asian Association for Regional Corporations, in addition to the US and Singapore.																								The need for such an initiative was felt by Tema as to lift the members who represent firms of a turnover of less than Rs 5 crore. The core team will also participate in exhibitions worldwide representing as an industry body of telecom exporters and negotiate deals and collaborations on behalf of them.																								Many of the exporters of telecom products and service do not get the best deal and most of them get lost in the big market. We feel that these exporters will get their due when a particular telecom operator will negotiate with the core team, said Goyal.

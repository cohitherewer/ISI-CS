 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Dhunseri Tea eyes gardens in Assam, Dooars
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Dec. 21: Dhunseri Tea amp; Industries Limited, promoted by the city-based C. K. Dhanuka group, may acquire gardens in Assam and Dooars.																								Talking to The Telegraph, C. K. Dhanuka, managing director of the company and chairman of Indian Tea Association, said, We are open to the idea of acquiring gardens in Assam. However, it depends on the price at which we are getting it. If the price is on the higher side, we may not be interested.																								The company will acquire gardens in Dooars if the yield is more than 2000 kg a garden. I am not interested in gardens with lower yields as they are not remunerative, he said.																								Dhunseri has eight gardens in Assam with a total production of 7.5 million kg. 																								Dhanukas also own two other tea companies  Tezpore Tea Company and Madhuting Tea Limited (formerly known as Malbhog Baruah Tea Estates).																								Tezpore Tea has three estates located in Assam having 1,653.60 hectares of land under tea plantation with a crop of 42.53 lakh kg in 2002-2003.																								The annual production of Madhuting Tea from its two estates have been 6.71 lakh kg, including about 0.43 lakh kg of orthodox tea as on March 31, 2003.																								This year the production has been good. Our focus is to produce quality tea. We are also trying to achieve higher productivity and cost control so that we fetch better prices, said Dhanuka.																								Dhunseri produces 30 lakh kg of packet tea. The company introduced packet tea in 1987-88 under the brand names of Lal Ghora and Kala Ghora in Rajasthan, where it holds the highest market share in this segment.																								It had introduced another brand Chhote Lal eight months back mainly in the western parts of the country. It has received an overwhelming response and we are selling 40,000 kg under this new brand every month, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, June 23, 2003 				 Local thrust to IOC sales plan
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, June 22: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has revamped its nationwide marketing set-up by switching from the wider region based system to one which focuses on the state as a unit. The move is part of its effort to cope with the fierce competition in the petroleum sector.																								A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that more financial and administrative powers have been given to officers at the state level so that quick decisions can be taken after processing the feedback from customers. 																								Earlier, the entire eastern region comprising West Bengal, Assam, the north-eastern states, Bihar and Orissa was controlled from Calcutta. Relatively junior officers were posted at the state capitals who had to take permission from the regional headquarters for even minor decisions.																								Under the new set-up a general manager (GM) level officer will be posted at the state capitals who will focus on consumers within the states. A general manager in Bhubaneswar will look after Orissa while another GM in Patna will look after Bihar. The Calcutta GM will look after West Bengal, while GM in Guwahati will head the marketing network in Assam and also look after the northeast states as the demand for petro goods in these states is quite small.																								In the northern region, the Delhi headquarters will now look after only the national capital region and Haryana. The general manager in Chandigarh will manage the marketing for Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal.																								Sources disclose that only a skeletal staff is now left at the regional headquarters which earlier called the shots over several states. The state-level approach is also seen as a better way of dealing with particular problems that are common for a smaller and more uniform set of customers.

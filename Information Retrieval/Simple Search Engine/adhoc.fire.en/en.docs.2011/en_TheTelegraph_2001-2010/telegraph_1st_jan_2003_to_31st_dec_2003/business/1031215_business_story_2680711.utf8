 SATISH JOHN				 	 Boom Time																								Mumbai, Dec. 14: Textile companies are expecting a boost in exports once the quota regime in the US and European countries are removed. The growth in textile exports is expected to surpass the boom in IT exports.																								According to textile companies, exports in this sector hold the potential to rise by 2-4 times in the next 5-7 years and company earnings could rise nearly six times. 																								Indian textile exports are pegged at $13 billion at present. The textile ministry expects the growth in exports to gather pace at a compounded annual rate of 21 per cent to $50 billion. 																								According to a senior textile official, in a couple of years, IT will have a new definition. It will stand for Indian Textiles, he said.																								The bullish view came forth in deliberations at the Textile Yatra in Singapore and Hong Kong organised by ICICI Securities to showcase the Indian textile industry. 																								ICICI Securities has forecast Indias share of global trade to nearly double from 3.6 per cent in the next 3-5 years.																								A relaxation in labour laws will enable many textile heavyweights to plunge into garment manufacturing which earlier was the preserve of small-scale units. Thus, garment manufacturing is touted to capture the highest growth. 																								Rise in profits is likely to be the highest for firms that will integrate into garment manufacturing as the restraints of the quota regime is expected to vanish and the low capital intensive nature of the sector is an added benefit. While terry towels and bed linens will witness a significant growth, it will be lower than garments as quota restrictions on made-ups are not as severe.																								Global fashion and retail consultants KSA Technopak forecasts that exports of garments, terry towels and bed linens are likely to account for two-thirds of Indias textile exports by 2010-11.																								The revival of the textile industry has already started. A Reserve Bank of India study of a sample of around 134 companies reveals that they have clocked a 47 per cent gross profit and a net loss margin of 1.7 per cent in 2002-03. 																								Industry officials said most of the major investments are already in place. There could be a few brownfield expansions rather than greenfield expansion projects, they added. 																								The government sponsored textile upgradation fund provides finance for expansion at an interest of 3 per cent. Debt restructuring is likely to bring down rate of the loans already taken by 5 percentage points to 7-8 per cent.																								Large textile players are on the threshold of an exponential growth akin to the software industry in the mid to late 1990s due to a triple leverage, ICICI Securities said in a report.																								ICICI Securities predicts that 84 per cent of quotas are scheduled for removal from January 2005, triggering a $500-billion or three-fold rise in global trade.																								Indias share of global trade is seen to grow at the fastest rate as its current quota allocation is among the lowest.

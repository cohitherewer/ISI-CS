Calcutta, Feb. 5: The government will simplify procedures to reduce transaction costs in order to boost exports, said Arun Jaitley, the newly-appointed Union commerce minister, today.																								To begin with, the government has decided to introduce electronic data exchange at 23 ports and airports from March. This will minimise the delay involved in physical verification of goods. The facility of electronic data exchange will, however, not be restricted to these 23 ports and airports. 																								We will introduce it nationally. Since these 23 ports and airports handle around 80 per cent of our exports we thought to introduce the system in these areas first, Dipak Chatterjee, Union commerce secretary, said.																								However, physical verification of goods will not be abolished. If the system gives some alarming signals regarding certain products then it will be scrutinised physically, he added.																								Jaitley, who was in the city to attend the pre-exim policy open house meet with Fieo, said, Since I have taken over (as commerce minister) only a weeks back I will not be able to say much. But this is certain that a lot of initiatives are being taken regarding customs duty which will result in abolition of procedural complications.																								Earlier M. Rafeeque Ahmed, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said there was an unprecedented 34 per cent growth in exports in December.

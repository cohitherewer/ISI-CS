 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Reliance pre-paid cards by January
				 Call option 																								Mumbai, Dec. 28 (PTI): Reliance Infocomms pre-paid CDMA cards could be out as early as next month after its trial run, now on, ends.																								The tests being carried out have broken with the usual practice under which employees were involved in the process. This time, genuine customers have been roped in for the trial of what would be known as Reliance India Mobile (pre-paid) cards, company sources said.																								There is real feedback from the testing and the system is being thoroughly examined. Refills for the cards will be available on a virtual calling card basis, the sources said.																								Reliance Infocomm is also believed to be developing a subscriber index module (SIM) for its CDMA pre-paid operations, which would be sold over the counter or through the companys retail outlets in the country. This would function, more or less, like the GSM pre-paid SIM.																								Earlier, Reliance Infocomm president (wireless products and services) S. P. Shukla had said the company got its intelligent network technology for pre-paid operations from US-based Comverse Technology.																								The pre-paid GSM operations constitute around 75 per cent of the cellular business compared with the much smaller post-paid segment.

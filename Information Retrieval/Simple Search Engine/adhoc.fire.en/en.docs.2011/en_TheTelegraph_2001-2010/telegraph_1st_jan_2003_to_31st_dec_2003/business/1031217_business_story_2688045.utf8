 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Trade talk revival deadline missed
																								Geneva, Dec. 16 (Agencies): Members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) missed a key deadline today to revive global trade talks, but said negotiations on farming and other tough topics should resume early next year.																								WTO chief Supachai Panitchpakdi said progress had been made since a doomed meeting in Cancun three months ago and he urged countries to move from demonstrating a willingness to re-engage to taking concrete action.																								Despite the upbeat comments, rifts between the WTOs 146 member-states over agriculture and industrial goods remained wide and some diplomats doubted they would conclude the trade liberalisation talks by January 1, 2005, as scheduled. Our collective aim for today, as instructed by ministers in Cancun, was to arrive at a point where the negotiations can resume full momentum, Supachai told a meeting of the general council  the WTOs executive organ.																								We are not at this point yet but we should not be disheartened, he said in a speech at the WTOs Geneva headquarters.																								Unable to agree on core issues such as farming at the conference in Mexico last September, ministers told their WTO envoys to find a compromise by December 15 at the latest to restart the so-called Doha development agenda. This triggered a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity, with many members, such as the EU, showing signs of flexibility in their negotiating positions. Singapore issues																								Mounting fresh pressure on developed nations, India today said that three of the four Singapore issues should be dropped from the work programme of WTO.																								Giving it views at the general council in Geneva, India said further work on three Singapore issues  trade and investment, competition policy and transparency in government procurement  should be dropped from the agenda of the WTO to facilitate re-start of the stalled trade negotiations.																								Indias view is in line with other developing and least developing countries views expressed in the council document dated December 12, 2003 and the mood among the member countries was generally accomodative or flexible to facilitate early start of trade talks.																								Regarding trade facilitation, the government said work on clarification of various aspects of this issue may continue in the light of the interest expressed by several delegations and any subsequent modalities should be by explicit consensus.

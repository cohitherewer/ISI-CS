 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Govt on the vigil to prevent scams
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Singh: Hawk-eyed																								New Delhi, Dec. 12: To ward off possible stock market scams, finance minister Jaswant Singh today said the government planned to take up a system of integrated surveillance of bourses across the country.																								The mechanism envisaged would put in place an integrated system of surveillance across all stock markets and across cash and derivative markets.																								The regulatory platform would provide automated data reporting capable of capturing market transactions, reference data research, regulatory analysis and market alerts for further frontline proactive surveillance, Singh told the Lok Sabha during question hour.																								The lower House was rocked by queries of sudden spurts in share prices of specific shares. Finance ministry officials later said that the system to be set up by Sebi would provide real time surveillance and comparison with historical stock market data to check out possible fraud and curb it with automated trigger responses. 																								The plan could be implemented over a two-year time frame. Singh also said the government was planning to unveil a series of other measures to safeguard bourses from any possible manipulations and scams.																								Singh said this later in the day while making a statement in Parliament on the action taken on the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the stock market scam in 2001.																								Outlining the measures planned, the finance minister said the government planned to make amendments to the Companies Act which would also tighten disclosure rules and secure the gilts market through a legislation which would dematerialise trading in government securities.																								Singh also claimed credit for a series of measures in the past few months that included setting up additional institutional mechanisms to keep a regular watch on the financial markets. A Serious Frauds Investigating Office and a co-ordination mechanism with financial market regulators and investigating agencies have also been established, he said.

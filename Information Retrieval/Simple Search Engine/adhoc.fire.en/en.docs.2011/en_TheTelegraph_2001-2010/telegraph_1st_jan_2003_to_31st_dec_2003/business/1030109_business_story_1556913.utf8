 Thursday, January 09, 2003 				 Taste of real life at Kelloggs 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jain with Ficci president A. C. Muthiah in Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, Jan 8: What is it they dont teach you at Harvard Business School? Ask the dean of the Kellogg Business School, Dipak Jain.																								Harvard is famous for its case studies  an approach that has been adopted by business schools around the world. Jain reckons that the case-study approach has its place in the academia, but it doesnt fully prepare business students for the real world out there.																								Thats where Kelloggs comes in: Jain is tying up with a number of Fortune 500 companies where his students can get some hands-on training. It has already made a start by roping in Redmond-based Microsoft Corporation and is now looking to team up Seattle-based Boeing Corporation, the worlds largest private airline maker. The idea is to give its students a real-life environment to test the theories they are taught in Kellogg.																								Jain is the first to admit that Kelloggs as a business school has a lot of catching up to do: Harvard and Wharton are still prized as better cachets. But if Jain, a small-time professor from Assam who made it big in the US, has anything to do with it, Kelloggs will give the famous B-schools a run for their money  especially during a downturn in the economy.																								Addressing a special session organised by Ficci here today, Jain stressed: Business schools should emphasise on alumni networking. Alumni are like real estate. The more you invest in it, the more its value grows.																								Talking about the Kelloggs philosophy, Jain said: We believe in having a consumer-centric approach to life and teach our students to always keep themselves in their shoes. Also, executive education and focus on team work form a very important part of our curriculum.																								Jain said the employees of any organisation are the real assets of the company and they can make or break it. The strength and richness of any company differs on the basis of its in-house skills. 																								Jain said companies are facing new realities. While saying that the existing framework is not adequate, he said, We need to look at what should be the content of our curriculum and what are we really producing.																								Jains favourite epigram: To forgive is good, forget is better, and to move forward is the best.

 Reliance score tops forecast

Revenues from this segment at Rs 6939 crore were 6 per cent higher than Rs 6566 crore a year back.																								Some of the bottomline boost in the first quarter came from a 14 per cent decline in interest paid at Rs 349 crore. Contributions from other businesses  oil and gas, textiles, communication, power, finance amp; risk management  also rose to Rs 854 crore from Rs 313 crore.

 Sunday, June 22, 2003 				 Parryware focus on east
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 21: Chennai-based Parryware will aggressively target the sanitary ware market in the eastern and north-eastern region with its water-saving and hygienic products.																								At present, the eastern region contributes a mere 10 per cent to the total revenues. However, with the launch of more products we expect a 20 per cent growth during the current financial year, says Sanjay Tiwari regional manager (east, west and north-east). 																								The Rs 140-crore firm wants to position itself as a complete bathroom solution provider and has introduced a range of stain-free closets and basins and anti-microbial seat covers, electronic flushing systems and dual flush systems. There is also plan to introduce bathtubs, taps and other products.

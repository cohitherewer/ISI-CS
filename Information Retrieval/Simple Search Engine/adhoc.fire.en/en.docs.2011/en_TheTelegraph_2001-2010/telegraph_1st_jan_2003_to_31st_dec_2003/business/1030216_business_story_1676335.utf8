Mumbai, Feb. 15: Reserve Bank of India deputy governors today met chief executives of various banks to assess the floating rate deposits and credit delivery scenario in the economy. The floating rate deposits have not picked up as banks have not been able to get a reliable benchmark apart from the lack of demand from customers for the same, banking sources said. Increasing number of assets in banks are linked with floating rates but the quantum was very less in case of deposits and hence banks were likely to meet with interest rate mismatches.

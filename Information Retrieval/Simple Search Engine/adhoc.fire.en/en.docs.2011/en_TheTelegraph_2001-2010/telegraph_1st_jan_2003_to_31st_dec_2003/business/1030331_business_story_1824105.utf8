A lower tax provisioning and relatively lower incremental costs combined with a respectable rise in revenues has seen net profit rise by 160 per cent over the previous corresponding quarter to Rs 7.74 crore (Rs 2.98 crore), while sequentially it was up by 32 per cent over the September quarter profits of Rs 5.88 crore. 																																											E-serves growth rate has picked up and it expects its fiscal 2003-2004 revenues to go up by 25 per cent over the previous corresponding period and net profits to rise by 70-80 per cent over the same period last year.																																											The stock, currently trading at Rs 465, discounts its December quarter annualised EPS of Rs 25 by 19 times. If its growth stays at the current levels, the stock should move up significantly this year.

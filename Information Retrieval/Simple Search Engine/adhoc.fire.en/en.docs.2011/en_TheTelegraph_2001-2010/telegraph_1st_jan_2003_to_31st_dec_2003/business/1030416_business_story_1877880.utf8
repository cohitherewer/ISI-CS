The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, April 16, 2003 				 Sip-n-shop for the best in Reliance webstores
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, April 15: For Reliance Infocomm, business goes beyond telecom, to lifestyle. The company is in the process of signing multiple tie-ups to offer lifestyle products ranging from coffee to greetings cards to T-shirts through its country-wide network of webstores.																								The company has already tied up with Qwikys of Chennai to run cafeteria in its webstores, which will be known as Reliance Web World. More tie-ups like these are in the pipeline. 																								According to a senior Reliance executive, telecom has graduated from being merely a communication enabler to a trendy lifestyle product.																								Unlike earlier days, telecom is now a combination of both necessity and luxury. People, especially the youth, are keen on a product that has a touch of modernity with style. Keeping it in mind, we have decided to give our webstores a look of lifestyle centres, he said.																								The company plans to set up 777 webstores across the country over the next few years. All the stores will have a standard look and offer similar services.																								Sources said Qwikys, which is a global coffee chain, will manage the cafeteria of each webstore. Besides coffee, it will offer other fast foods. Qwikys has a distribution alliance with La Pavoni, an expresso maker in Italy, and DaVind Gourment, a Seattle-based syrup maker.																								The brand, which made a debut in Hyderabad about three years back, also sells T-shirts, caps and magazines. The items will be available in our web-stores in a phased manner. Various coffee flavours will be there, the Reliance executive said.

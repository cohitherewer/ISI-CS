 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, Nov. 12: RPG Enterprises is set to dilute 20 per cent of its stake in Giant, its hyper-market arm, through private placement in about six months.

RPG Enterprises currently owns 100 per cent stake in Giant.																								The Calcutta-based business conglomerates retail arm is being expanded across the country with a view to double the sector-generated revenues by 2005. In 2002-03, the companys retail business generated revenues worth Rs 470 crore.																								We expect to generate Rs 600 crore in the current financial year and this will increase to Rs 1200 crore by 2005, RPG Enterprises vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said.																								As part of retail expansion plans, RPG Enterprises proposes to set up 14 hypermarkets with a total investment of Rs 200 crore in the next one and a half years in different parts of the country. 																								After the successful opening of our first hypermarket, Giant, in Hyderabad in 2001, we are planning to set up 14 more by 2005, said Goenka.

Delhi will have two hypermarkets by 2004, one each in Gurgaon and Noida. Plans were also afoot to launch Gaint retail stores in Calcutta, Chandigarh, Bangalore, Chennai and Pune, said Goenka. The cost of setting up a Giant in any part of the country will typically depend on the size of the store and the real estate cost, he added.

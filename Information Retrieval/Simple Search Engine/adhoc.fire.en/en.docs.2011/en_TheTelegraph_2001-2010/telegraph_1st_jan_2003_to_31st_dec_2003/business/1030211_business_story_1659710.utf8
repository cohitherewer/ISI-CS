 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 10: Oracle India has drawn up a plan to focus on six new areas of excellence to help e-governance and security applications for the home and defence ministries.																								The enterprise software company will develop and upgrade the existing software for revenue collection, citizen services delivery, workstation-based solutions, security applications for computer systems and servers, wireless technology and threat management systems. 																								The company today joined hands with Hewlett-Packard India to set up an e-governance centre of excellence. The centre will support e-governance initiatives by the central, state and local government bodies in India. It will offer services such as technical consultation, proof of concept and thematic presentations in addition to creating awareness amongst decision makers at the Centre and state level to help them effectively define and implement their respective e-governance process.																								Announcing the initiatives to develop country and application-specific software for India, Derek Williams, executive vice president of Oracle Asia Pacific Division, said, Threat management is the latest application that we have developed after the September 11 terrorist attack on the US. This software stimulates situations projecting various threats that could emanate from within the organisation, country and from outside.																								We have worked with the internal security department of the US and will offer this software to the concerned authorities to develop their own models and solutions using the product, Williams said. 																								Oracle will also lay special emphasis on the development of software for the wireless technologies and applications based on wireless for the Indian market. 																								The company has already started discussions with both cellular and limited mobility operators to offer software that could be upgraded on to their existing network.

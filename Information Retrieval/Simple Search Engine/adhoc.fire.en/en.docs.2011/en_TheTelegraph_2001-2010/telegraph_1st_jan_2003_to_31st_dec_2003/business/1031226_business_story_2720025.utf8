																								New Delhi, Dec. 25: (PTI) The Maharashtra government has decided to sell its minority shareholding in state-owned Manganese Ore India, agreeing to go along with the Centre, which has put the company on the block.																								In a letter to the disinvestment ministry, principal secretary (industries) V. S. Dhumal said the state will play along with the Centre in the process, offering its entire 9.62 per cent stake, official sources said.																								Earlier, the centre, while deciding to sell 51 per cent stake, had invited its two minority partners  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra governments  to come on board.

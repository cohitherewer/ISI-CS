 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Captains spot double digits on growth gauge
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: Indian industry is all set to post double-digit growth in 2003-04, says a latest snap poll of CEOs conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).																								The poll reveals that 74 per cent of the CEOs expect their sales to grow by more than 10 per cent, while a similar percentage also expect their growth in profits to be in double digits.																								On the issue of inflation, 43 per cent of the respondents said they expected inflation to remain between 5 per cent and 6 per cent for the remaining months of the current financial year. 																								Another 35 per cent felt that inflation rates would fall to 4-5 per cent and 13 per cent felt that it would be between 3 per cent and 4 per cent. The remaining 9 per cent said inflation rate based on the wholesale price index (WPI) would be between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.																								The burgeoning fiscal deficit of the government at both the Centre and the states has been constantly identified as a serious impediment to sustainable growth in the economy. When asked whether the budgetary target of a fiscal deficit of 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product will be achieved, a majority (74 per cent) felt that the government would overshoot the target.																								With the economy on a growth path, the apex chamber feels there is an opportunity for the government to enhance it by bringing down the basic corporate tax rate to levels comparable to the corporate tax rate structure in our neighbouring countries.																								The CEOs felt a lower corporate tax rate would enable Indian companies to make larger reinvestments in their business and enhance their growth and competitiveness.																								Almost 41 per cent respondents felt that the corporate tax rate would be reduced to 30 per cent, while the remaining 59 per cent said it would remain unchanged at 35 per cent.																								Arguing that taxation on dividend amounts to double taxation, the CEOs once again called for abolition of dividend distribution tax. However, only 9 per cent of the respondents felt that it would be abolished in the Union budget of 2004-05. 																								The poll showed that 52 per cent felt it would be reduced and the remaining 39 per cent felt it would remain unchanged at 12.5 per cent. 																								In budget 2003-04, the peak customs duty was reduced to 25 per cent from the earlier level of 30 per cent. A good 87 per cent respondents felt that the government should further reduce the peak customs duty to 20 per cent in the forthcoming budget.																								However, it was also stated that while bringing it down, adequate care should be taken to ensure that the tariff on raw materials does not exceed the tariff on finished goods.

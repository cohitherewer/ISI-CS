 Tuesday, November 04, 2003 				 Oracle offers software helpline to small units
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 3: Oracle India today launched the Oracle 10G infrastructure software for Indian enterprises to help organisations implement utility computing, based on grid computing technology.																								Grid computing enables the use and pooling of computer and data resources to solve complex business problems while utilising all spare computing capacity available in a particular network. This technique is the latest development in an evolution that earlier brought forth such advances as distributed computing, the World Wide Web and collaborative computing.																								A larger body of scientific and engineering applications stands to benefit from grid computing like weather forecasting, financial and mechanical modelling, immunology, circuit simulation, aircraft design, fluid mechanics and almost any problem that is mathematically equivalent to a flow.																								Managing director of Oracle India Shekhar Dasgupta said, Oracle 10G is the only infrastructure software available for enterprise grid computing. 																								Our development centre in India has played a significant role in developing the software. Teams from the centre worked hand-in-hand with their counterparts in Oracles global development centre at Redwood Shores to develop the components of Oracle 10G infrastructure software, he added.																								Existing customers of Oracle, who are under the annual support contract for earlier versions of Oracle software, will be entitled to a free upgrade to Oracle 10G. The price of Oracle 10G products will remain the same as the Oracle 9i suite of products.																								The grid computing technology provides customers a high quality of service at low cost by harnessing the power of the total computing capacity of a cluster of computers, so that any available server can rapidly process and solve problems.																								It creates an illusion to the user that all servers on the network are connected to one large computer, available to all users and applications.																								Oracle India has chalked out an aggressive marketing strategy for the new products. Oracle 10G holds promise for the small and medium enterprises in the country, marketing director of Oracle India Somesh Bhagat said.

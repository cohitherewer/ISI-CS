 															- The chance of a lifetime Unit-linked insurance policies are the in-thing, says Aniek Paul																								The entry of private insurers has definitely deepened the penetration of life insurance in India. Private companies have been operating in this country for a couple of years only, but they are already selling one in ten new policies, which, given LICs stranglehold on the market, is not a mean achievement.																								But how has the consumer benefited from this burst of competition? Has the entry of private companies improved product offerings or has the return on insurance policies gone up?																								The fall in interest on safe haven assets is irreversible, and so is the cut in insurance bonuses. Insurance just cant be as attractive as earlier in terms of return, but the consumer now has a wide variety of products to choose from.																								Some of them are fairly advanced  for instance, unit-linked products, which, by far, are the most popular in developed markets.																								Though in India, traditional with-profits products are still more popular, unit-linked policies are fast making inroads. Consumer appetite is already skewed towards unit-linked policies, and a number of companies that do not have these products yet, are thinking of launching them.																								Most private insurance companies have, however, chosen to concentrate on traditional with-profits products so far. They are simple in structure  theres a sum assured that you receive on maturity or your survivors get if you die before the policy matures, plus bonuses, annual and terminal.																								Previously bonuses too were guaranteed, but now they are market-linked, which means they are based on the return on assets in which the insurance company invests your money.																								If the bonuses are guaranteed you need not care what the insurance company does with your money. But if they are not, you are quite likely to demand a clear understanding of how the insurance company manages your money.																								Unit-linked policies are supposed to give you a clear idea of what the insurance company is doing with your money. In fact, it even allows the policyholder to decide the broad allocation of his money in different asset classes  equity, corporate bonds, government securities and money market instruments.																								Unit-linked products operate like mutual funds. The charges, for administration and the various covers  for death, critical illness, etc  that you may have chosen are deducted from the premium, and the rest is invested in a fund of your choice.																								The net asset value (NAV) of each of these funds are declared regularly which gives you a clear understanding of how your savings are being managed. Being transparent, you could compare the charges and returns on investment before buying a unit-linked policy.																								What are the factors that you should consider before buying a unit-linked policy? Insurers try to differentiate their products through one or a combination of factors  service, charges, returns, flexibility in payment of premiums, etc.																								On any of these factors, however, there isnt much to choose among the private insurers at present. But over time  say three to four years  whats going to separate one from another is servicing, return on investment and charges.																								Frankly, its quite confusing at present. All the private insurers have delivered stellar returns despite conservative investment strategy, charges are falling and not too many complaints have been heard about services.																								We have had rallies in both the bond and equity markets. The party is not going to go on for ever, and the current returns are not sustainable, cautions Shivaji Dam, managing director of OM Kotak. Only after you have a performance track record of three to four years, you could form an opinion about an insurance company based on the returns it has generated.																								True quality of services, too, would be established only after a considerable length of time. Any prudent insurer is unlikely to be inundated with claims within a couple of years, and until it has settled a respectable number of claims, it cannot establish its credibility.																								Good sales practice is another key issue. A lot of insurance companies the world over has got into trouble for not explaining a product properly or having led its policyholders to expect unreasonable returns, says S. K. Mitra, the head of Birla Sun Life Financial Services.

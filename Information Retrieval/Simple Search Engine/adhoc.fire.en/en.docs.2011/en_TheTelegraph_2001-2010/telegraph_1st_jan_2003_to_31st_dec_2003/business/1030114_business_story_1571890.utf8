 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 IOC to widen Premium fuel sales
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan 13 : Riding on the success of its sales in the capital, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is now spreading its marketing network for its Premium brand of petrol and diesel to 20 major cities.																								Senior IOC officials told The Telegraph that sales of Premium petrol had gone up to around 120,000 litres per day in Delhi. This brand competes with Speed sold by Bharat Petroleum and Power supplied by Hindustan Petroleum. IOC is spreading its network of the brand to state capitals and some towns on main highways.																								While IOC claims to have an edge over the other two brands insofar as its Premium brand is the only one that is 91 octane; the other brands are 88 octane. The higher octane number is reported to give more power to the vehicle and better mileage as well.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting held on Thursday to review issues pertaining to public grievances of subscribers of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL).																								Officials in MTNL and BSNL will be made accountable for the delay in attending to public complaints and grievances.																								Minister of state for communications and information technology Ashok Pradhan said, Since both these companies have to incur a revenue loss due to the delay in attending telephone faults, the mechanism of attending to telephone complaints needs to be streamlined and officials made accountable.

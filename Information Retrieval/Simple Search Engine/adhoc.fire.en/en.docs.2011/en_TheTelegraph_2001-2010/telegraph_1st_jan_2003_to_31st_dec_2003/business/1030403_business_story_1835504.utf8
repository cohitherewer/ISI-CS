 Thursday, April 03, 2003 				 Capacity heat on fridge firms
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 2: The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC) has directed all frost-free refrigerator makers to state whether the capacities of their fridges have been calculated in gross or net terms. 																								Thus it has ended a nine-month spat between LG Electronics India Ltd, Whirlpool India and Godrej Appliances Ltd.																								The suit arose after Whirlpool and Godrej accused LG of overstating the capacities of its 280 litre, 250 litre and 230 litre frost-free refrigerators.																								Both Whirlpool and LG had technical experts to buttress their claims, but the commission refused to accept either determination. 																								Whirlpool had claimed that LGs frost-free fridge capacities deviated from the BIS norm by over 3 per cent, a view that the commission refused to accept.

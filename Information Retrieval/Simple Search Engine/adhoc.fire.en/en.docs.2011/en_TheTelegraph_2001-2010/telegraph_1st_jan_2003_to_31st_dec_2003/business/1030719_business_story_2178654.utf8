 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 18: Unit Trust of India (UTI) has pared its holding in LIC Housing Finance  the countrys second largest home loans company  by 2.85 per cent. The Trust sold 21.35 lakh shares of LIC Housing Finance in the market recently.																								Though senior officials of UTI confirmed the sale, they scotched rumours that the Trust was looking to offload its entire holding in the company. UTI held 11.5 per cent in LIC Housing Finance as of June 30. It now holds around 8.55 per cent stake in the company, says a LIC Housing Finance despatch to the bourses.																								UTI chairman M. Damodaran said: Some of our fund managers must have found the price attractive  so they sold a part of our holding. But there are no plans to offload our entire stake in the company.

LIC promoted the company in 1989.																								Market observers say UTI sold the shares last week through block deals in the market. UTI is believed to have raked in around Rs 30 crore from the sale of shares. Of late theres been remarkable foreign institutional appetite in the stock. In all likelihood, UTI sold the shares to FIIs, said brokers who track the stock.

 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 Net profit dips 39%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 24: High input costs and a major power disruption left Hindalco with a dismal third quarter performance in 2002-03. The companys net profit slipped 39 per cent to Rs 101.1 crore compared with Rs 165.5 crore in 2001-02. 																								The companys topline also took a hit. Net sales during the quarter fell by close to 10 per cent to Rs 521.5 crore against Rs 577.4 crore in the year-ago period. 																								Hindalco said that the effects of the power disturbance in September spilled over to the quarter and resulted in a further production loss. Extra costs had to be incurred to normalise the process.

 Wednesday, July 02, 2003 				 Trai sets link-up charges
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 1: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today released an interim order on interconnect user charges (IUC), directing the access provider from where a call originates to pay the carrier and termination charges and retain the balance amount.																								Interconnect user charge (IUC) regime stipulates that a payment has to be made by each operator for accepting and delivering a call in each others network.																								For example, if an STD call is made, the charge at the originating and terminating end will be Rs 2 per minute. The charge for carrying the call has been fixed at Rs 1.10 per minute. So, the total charge should be Rs 5.10 per minute as against the recent alternative tariff of Rs 4.80 per minute approved for Bharat Sanchar Nigam.																								The interim order also directs the access service provider to file national long distance (NLD) tariffs till such time that the career access code/career pre-selection is operational. The order also states that since the tariff reduction has been caused by the access provider, his margin must bear the burden of reduction of tariffs and only originating charges must be reduced.																								The order has been passed following the consultation paper released by the regulator in April, to seek suggestions for an interim solution to address certain inconsistencies between long distance tariffs and the interconnect user charges (IUC) regime.																								A senior Trai official said, This order will be replaced by a decision of the Authority following the completion of the larger IUC review.

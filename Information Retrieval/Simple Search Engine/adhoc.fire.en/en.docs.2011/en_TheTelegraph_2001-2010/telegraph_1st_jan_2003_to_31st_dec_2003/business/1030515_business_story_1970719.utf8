 Thursday, May 15, 2003 				 Dhanukas Haldia unit set to roll
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY																								Haldia, May 14: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today inaugurated South Asian Petrochems (SAPL) bottle grade PET resin plant in Haldia, setting the stage for start of commercial production.																								He had laid the foundation stone of the Rs 450-crore venture in December 2000, just after he assumed office. Things have moved swiftly since then for the export-oriented unit, which has an installed capacity of 1.4 lakh tonnes. The project was through six weeks ahead of schedule, and not a man-day was lost during construction.																								South Asian Petrochem vice-chairman C. K. Dhanuka said tie-ups have been forged with global companies to sell the output. Around 25 per cent of it will be hawked to PET- bottle makers in the domestic market. 																								The plant, which marked a diversification for the tea-producing Dhunseri Group owned by the Dhanukas, commenced trial run last month.

 Wednesday, February 26, 2003 				 Connectivity charges fair, says Trai
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) toady said the connectivity charges fixed by it were transparent and fair. 																								In its revised petition filed on Monday with the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has claimed that the regulator failed to take into account the pending cases on the issue of limited mobility.																								Cellular operators plan to file another revised petition this week with the tribunal to protest against the new tariff structure for basic operators which come into effect from April 1.																								A senior Trai official said: The cellular operators demanded that an interconnect user charge be announced by us. Now when it has been announced they claim there has been a discrimination between cellular and limited mobile operators. We have not hidden any facts. They are free to examine the method that has been used to derive the IUC.

				 				 																								D-LINK INDIA 																																											For the first quarter ended June 30, 2003, D-Link India Ltd has put up a soft performance with total income of Rs 42.78 crore (Rs 39.40 crore) up 9 per cent from the year-ago period while its total spending at Rs 35.97 crore (Rs 33.65 crore) up by 7 per cent resulted in a net profit of Rs 6.81 crore (Rs 5.75 crore) up 18 per cent. Net sales at Rs 41.25 crore (Rs 38.84 crore) was up 6 per cent year-on-year. Operational expenditure was up at Rs 34.08 crore (Rs 32.01 crore). Margins have seen no major improvement with operating profit managing to rise by just about 5 per cent at Rs 7.17 crore (Rs 6.83 crore) YoY. Other income has been a major driving force during the quarter. At Rs 1.53 crore (Rs 0.55 crore) it was up by a huge 176 per cent YoY. Interest cost was down by 14 per cent at Rs 0.08 crore (Rs 0.09 crore). A 20 per cent rise in profit before tax saw the tax provision move up by 31 per cent. The stock currently trading at Rs 76 discounts its June quarter annualised EPS of Rs 76 by eight times. Though it looks undervalued at the current growth rates, the fact that a better part of the growth in this quarter has been a result of better treasury operations resulting in a comparatively higher other income could keep tabs on improving the valuation.																																											BAJAJ AUTO 																																											The first quarter performance of Bajaj Auto is sending out signals of a clear slowdown in the two-wheeler category and the overall performance of companies. For the June quarter, net sales managed to rise by just about a percentage to Rs 1,082.22 crore (Rs 1,068.18 crore). Operational cost has gone up by 6 per cent over the corresponding previous quarter to Rs 926.30 crore (Rs 871.54 crore). Poor volumes, lower income from operations coupled with rising costs has led to lower margins. At Rs 155.92 crore (Rs 196.94 crore) operating profit was down 21 per cent. Other income has been the driving force rising by a huge 194 per cent to Rs 101.69 crore (Rs 34.55 crore). The companys net profit at Rs 161.06 crore (Rs 121.81 crore) was up 32 per cent YoY.

MPHASIS BFL 																																											MphasiS continued with its good performance in the first quarter of this fiscal.

Increase in salaries for additional manpower in anticipation of business growth and an appreciation of the rupee led to shrinking margins. At Rs 17.52 crore (Rs 13.82 crore) operating profit was up by only 27 per cent YoY. MphasiS had been recording decent growth in operating profit till the last quarter. Sequentially operating profit fell by 12 per cent over the March quarter profit of Rs 19.87 crore. Higher other income and net interest combined with lower taxes have bolstered overall profitability.

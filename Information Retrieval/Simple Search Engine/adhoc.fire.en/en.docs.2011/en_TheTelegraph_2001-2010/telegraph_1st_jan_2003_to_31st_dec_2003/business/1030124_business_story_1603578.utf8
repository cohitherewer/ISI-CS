The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 Basic players struggle to convince regulator
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Association of Basic Telecom Operators (ABTO) seems to believe in the marketing mantra  bombard with information to prove a point and that is what it seems to be doing with the telecom regulator.																								In a fresh letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the basic operators have said that the cellular operators had paid different licence fees for Delhi and Mumbai and a different one for Calcutta and Chennai. The total fee paid by the two operators in Delhi and Mumbai works out to Rs 28 crore.																								While they were supposed to have paid Rs 1,007.47 crore over the next five years due to migration to the revenue share agreement, they only paid a licence fee of Rs 104.11 crore.																								The top bidder for all cellular circles for a 10-year period was Rs 10,040.83 crore. Since the second bidder was required to match the top bidder, the total licence fee committed by all cellular operators for 21 telecom circles was Rs 20,081.66 crore, states a letter from ABTO to Trai.

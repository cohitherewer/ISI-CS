 Thursday, March 27, 2003 				 Infotech logs 9% growth
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 26: The Indian information technology sector has bucked the trend of slow growth in various other sectors to register a 9 per cent growth during 2002. It has generated a revenue of Rs 23,774 crore as users in government, banking, finance, education and telecom sectors emerged as big IT spenders.																								According to the sixth Skoch report called Browser 2002 on the IT sector, personal computers (PCs) registered a 14 per cent growth with 1.8 million PCs sold during 2002. PCs and other hardware sold during the year contributed 50 per cent of the total revenues of the IT sector.																								The stagnant demand for software services in the US market has not posed any serious threat so far. Software exports have increased by 30 per cent at $ 8 billion during the period. A significant one-fourth of the contribution came from IT enabled services (ITeS), said Sameer Kochhar, CEO, Skoch Consultancy Services.																								However, the report says that the small and medium enterprises have not received adequate support from the government. It suggests measures to follow a friendly approach, including better access to capital and broadening the definition of ITeS.

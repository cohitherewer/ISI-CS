 Friday, July 04, 2003 				 Reliance eyes rich Monsoon harvest
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Join the club																								Mumbai, July 3: Reliance IndiaMobiles Monsoon Hungama is creating waves in the industry and is believed to have roped in 2.5 lakh customers in the first two days of its launch. 																								Breaking the entry price barrier for a limited mobile user, the offer has attracted customers by the dozen with many outlets running out of stocks. The scheme provides a multimedia mobile phone along with a connection for an upfront payment of Rs 501.																								The company already has close to 1.5 million customers under its different schemes launched over the last two months.																								Industry sources say the new scheme will enable the company to exhaust the huge inventory of mobile phones which is in excess of 6 million phones. 																								Sources at Reliance Infocomm say the response in the first two days has been unprecedented. However, they do not want to state numbers, saying it is too early.																								However, according to industry sources, This should not come as a surprise. With the entry barrier brought down to Rs 501, who would not take up the offer? 																								However, they argue that the basic charges for a GSM is still 25 per cent cheaper than the latest offer from Reliance IndiaMobile.																								Analysts agree that IndiaMobile has brought down the entry charge on handset to Rs 501, but the company has exposed itself to defaults as customers could run up huge bills and may default at a later stage. Unlike its earlier scheme, the latest offer does not include any deposits being taken from the customers.

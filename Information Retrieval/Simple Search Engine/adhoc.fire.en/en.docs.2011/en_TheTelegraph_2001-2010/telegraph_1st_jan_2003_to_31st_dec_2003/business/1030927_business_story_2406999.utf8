 Saturday, September 27, 2003 				 Lever in deal to lift lockout at city unit 
 OUR STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 26: The lockout at Hindustan Levers Garden Reach factory will be lifted on September 30, a company release said today. The decision was taken at a tripartite meeting chaired by state labour minister Mohammad Amin. 																								Amin said the six-month long dispute was resolved after the unions and management agreed to the separation of 150 contract labourers. 																								The labourers facing separation notices will be paid Rs 1 lakh each and Rs 2,500 for every year of service, he added.																								The HLL release added that workers would not be paid for the lockout period.																								But the management, on humanitarian grounds, has agreed to make available a recoverable advance of Rs 20,000 to the permanent workers. There will not be any break in service of the permanent workmen due to the lock out, the company said.																								The Hindustan Lever Sramik Karmachari Congress (HLSKC), which represents the permanent workers, said the company has agreed not to shed 500 workers as planned earlier.																								The company has not stressed on the demand of putting permanent workers on the jobs usually done by the contract labourers, said Kamal Tewary, president, HLSKC.																								According to the company, the workers unions have agreed that they would give at least 14 days notice to the management and the assistant labour commissioner about any unresolved dispute that might lead to disruption of work in any form.

 Saturday, February 08, 2003 				 Seafood exports to France may rise
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 7: Commerce minister Arun Jaitley today urged France to give greater market access to Indian seafood exports.																								The issue was discussed at a meeting here with French finance minister Francis Mer and commerce minister Francois Loos. 																								The French ministers are reported to have raised issues pertaining to procurement policies in the award of government contracts and the opening up of the Indian market to French wines.																								Jaitley is also reported to have expressed concern over the continued use of anti-dumping actions against Indian bed linen in the European Union as textile products have a large weightage in the countrys export basket.																								Both sides noted that the present level of bilateral trade estimated at $ 1.71 billion in 2001-02 was way below the actual potential. 																								The two sides agreed to further diversify and expand the two-way trade basket even though there was an encouraging 16 per cent increase in the first seven months of the current financial year.																								The French side indicated that the next session of the Indo-French joint committee scheduled to be held in Paris in June 2003 would provide an opportunity to discuss ways and means of intensifying bilateral trade and economic co-operation. The French ministers invited Jaitley to participate in the joint committee.

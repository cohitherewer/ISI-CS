 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 AccPac focus on SMEs
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Jan. 16: AccPac India, the wholly-owned subsidiary of US-based Computer Associates, will focus on the small and medium enterprise (SME) segment in the country with a range of management application products.																								The SME space is the biggest growth area globally with 8.5 million companies, says Rajesh Ghosh, chief executive officer of AccPac India. 																								In India, there are around 20,000 companies in this segment, which amounts to untapped business potential of an estimated Rs 800 crore. 																								A company that has a turnover of Rs 5 crore to Rs 100 crore is taken into the SME bracket.																								AccPac offers what it calls an extended ERP (enterprise resource planning) for the SME segment. 																								The company plans to replicate the global policy of marketing its products through a network of solution providers and resellers. Globally, AccPac has over 5,500 partners in 130 countries.																								We plan to tap the market and reach out to the end user through solution providers and resellers. Last month, we entered into agreements with six partners in India. This figure is expected to multiply 10 times by the end of next month, says Ghosh. There are also plans to bundle AccPac products with other OEMs and software vendors.																								The applications are OS (operating system) independent and operates on both Windows and Linux. 																								The company already has bundling arrangements with majors like Compaq, Wipro and Hutchison. 																								The end-to-end business management solution provider will also move on to Tier-II cities like Bhubaneswar, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Pune.

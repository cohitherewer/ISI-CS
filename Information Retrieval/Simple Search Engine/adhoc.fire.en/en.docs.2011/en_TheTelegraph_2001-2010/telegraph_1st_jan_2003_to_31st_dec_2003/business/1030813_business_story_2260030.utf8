 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Jaitley holds out Cancun hopes
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: Union minister of commerce and industry Arun Jaitley today said the fifth ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to be held in Cancun (Mexico) from September 10 to 14 could resolve the outstanding issues on public health and agricultural subsidy. 																								Speaking at an interactive session of the Forum for Financial Writers here today, the minister said, Outstanding issues relating to TRIPS (Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights) can be resolved at Cancun. 																								The issue of compulsory licensing for pharmaceutical products was an issue of serious concern to India and other developing countries, said Jaitley. Compulsory licensing is a provision, whereby a right is given to companies other than those who hold patent right over the product, to make it during times of certain types of emergencies and national exigencies.																								The minister said agriculture was another key issue of concern, especially the issue of high level of subsidies given by some developed countries to its farmers, which adversely affected countries like India. 																								We cannot accept a situation where our farmers compete with highly subsidised farmers (elsewhere) as such a situation can have serious socio-economic consequences, said Jaitley.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Sick cable firm from Bangur group on the block
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 19: The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) has put Fort Gloster Industries  a Shree Kumar Bangur-controlled ailing cable maker  on the block.																								Acting as the BIFR-appointed administrator  or operating agency as it is called  Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) has invited bids for acquisition of the company.																								Fort Gloster manufactures power and domestic cables at its plant in Bauria, Howrah. Operation of the plant was suspended a few days ago.																								Because the Bangurs do not appear to be committed to this company, we are looking to change its management. We believe selling it wont be difficult, despite the downturn in the cable industry, a senior IDBI official said.																								The Bangurs, however, do not appear to be much concerned. Fort Gloster has been under BIFR for the last two years, and the move to change its management is a standard BIFR practice, said S. K. Bangur, Fort Glosters chairman.																								He is going to put in a bid to retain control of the company that has accumulated losses of Rs 52 crore. He said he was giving final touches to his offer. Whoever gains control of the company will have to infuse funds to pay down its debts.																								The IDBI official said: So far, Bangur has not shown willingness to invest in the company or even give personal guarantee for its borrowings. If he refuses to bring anything to the table, why should the lenders help the management to ease the companys financial difficulties?																								Sources close to the Bangurs said the family was focusing on its paper business and was not willing to invest further in the cable business.																								Yet the Bangurs are going to make an offer to BIFR, though they are not desperate to revive and retain control of Fort Gloster, they said.																								There are rumours that the Bangurs could even carve out and divest the optic-fibre cable division of West Coast Paper  their flagship company  though the management denies having any such plan.																								Fort Gloster is believed to be indebted to the tune of Rs 30 crore. The IDBI official said lenders would consider giving concessions to potential investors in the company.

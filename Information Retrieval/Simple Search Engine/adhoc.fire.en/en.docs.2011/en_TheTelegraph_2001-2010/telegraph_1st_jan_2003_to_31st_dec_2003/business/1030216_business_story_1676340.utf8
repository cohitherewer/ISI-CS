 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 Jaitley seeks market access
																								Tokyo, Feb. 15 (PTI): India today strongly advocated greater market access to goods and services in the non-agricultural sector from the developing countries for a larger share of the world trade to facilitate its structured growth.																								Speaking at the WTO mini-ministerial session on Market access in non-agricultural products, commerce and industry minister Arun Jaitley said India attaches high priority to achieving significant increase in market access for products of interest to developing countries, such as textile and leather.																								Modalities for negotiations on market access in non-agricultural products must take into account the need of the developing countries for a flexible use of tariff protection to assist their economic development as had been clearly spelt out in the Doha declaration, he said.																								New Delhi lamented that many countries have not taken into account the principle of less-than-full reciprocity in tariff reduction commitments. Jaitley suggested that it would be better to use a simple reduction technique from bound tariff in a phased manner, which could take care of the concerns of developing countries in terms of their revenue considerations and the requirements of their sensitive employment generating sectors.

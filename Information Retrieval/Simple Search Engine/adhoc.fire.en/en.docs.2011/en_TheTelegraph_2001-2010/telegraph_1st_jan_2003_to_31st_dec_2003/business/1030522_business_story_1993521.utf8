 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 21: The software industry in the country could run into a major road block if tensions between Pakistan and India are not ratcheted down as many nations have placed India on the list of risky countries for business.																								The Indian software industry will have to grow consistently at 20-22 per cent over the next six years if the software export target of $ 50 billion is to be achieved. However, the nuclear rhetoric and tensions with Pakistan are not going to help, said Jairam Ramesh, member of the Congress party.																								Speaking at a talk on IT: Impact on economic growth and future prospects, organised by Nasscom, Ramesh said, IT firms in India have to realise that while the de-risking will happen based on political efforts, software alone cannot be a medium to retain the position India has achieved. We need to go back to developments in semiconductor and chips launched in 1980s and 90s to grow.

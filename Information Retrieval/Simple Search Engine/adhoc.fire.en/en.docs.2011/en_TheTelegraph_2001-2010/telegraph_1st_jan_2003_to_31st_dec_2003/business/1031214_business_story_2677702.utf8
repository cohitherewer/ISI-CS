A Telegraph picture 																								Calcutta, Dec. 13: The Tea Board of India is preparing a new package to boost production of quality tea in the country.																								This was announced by board chairman . K. Das at the 15th annual general meeting of the Darjeeling Planters Association held here today. 																								We have seen over the years that quality tea fetches better prices at the auctions as well as in the international market. We have decided to come up with a package to provide fillip to quality tea production, Das said.																								According to the new package, the Tea Board alone will not provide finances for producing good teas. The industry will also have to make some investments, the chairman added.																								He said the board was planning to launch promotional programmes for Darjeeling tea and also speciality teas from Assam to tap the UK and the US markets. The US is emerging as one of the fastest growing markets, he added.																								Das said Unesco, after granting world heritage site status to the Darjeeling Himalayan Railways (DHR), was planning to prepare an integrated plan for developing the entire Darjeeling region.																								We have also been asked by Unesco to prepare a project about what could be done for the development of water resources and other infrastructure in Darjeeling. We have already prepared the report, he said. 																								Darjeeling tea in the current year has shown some signs of improvement. The crop has gone up to 10.4 million kgs till October as against 8.4 million kgs in the corresponding period of the previous year. The prices of the tea at the auctions has shown recovery and has gone up compared with last year. The average price of Darjeeling tea this year is Rs 148 per kg compared with Rs 135 per kg in the previous year.																								However, DPA chairman K. S. David is not happy with the overall situation of the Darjeeling tea industry.																								While the dwindling Darjeeling crop is a matter of serious concern, we must also understand that the industry has done little to market Darjeeling tea as a brand. 																								The members of DPA are unwilling to contribute a part of their earnings to promote the brand. The situation has become so depressing that even normal subscriptions are not being paid and it has been my unpleasant job to delist some defaulting producers, David said.																								He added that without any marketing effort, Darjeeling tea will lose its brand equity. 																								The DPA has decided to organise roadshows from May 2004 in Japan, Germany and the US. We have a small corpus collected from willing producers which we will use. I would request the Tea Board to provide a matching grant to carry on this exercise. 																								Abhijit Sengupta, additional commerce secretary, said that import duty on tea machinery has been reduced from the levels of 30-35 per cent to five per cent so as to boost tea trade.

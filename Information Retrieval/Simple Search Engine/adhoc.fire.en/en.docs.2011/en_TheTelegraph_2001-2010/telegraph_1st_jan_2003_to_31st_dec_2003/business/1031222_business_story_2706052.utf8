The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Wakeup call: Its the accent stupid
 							 - Quality snags leave call centre engines stuttering, says M Rajendran				 From diction to comprehension,  its a long way to go 																								Indias image as a hot destination for call-centre business looks pretty ragged with Dell and now Lehman Brothers deciding that theyve had enough of Indian expertise in handling queries from their customers in the US.																								Both have shifted their call centres back to the US; but the interesting difference between the two is that Dell shifted back because its customers were dissatisfied with the grating Indian accents, while Lehman Brothers found that the Indians manning its helpdesk for its Sybase software did not have the technical expertise to deal with the flurry of questions emanating from its customers. 																								In one sense, the two cases have knocked the stuffing out of Indias claims that it has a large English-speaking population that can handle simple queries and that it has a huge pool of technical personnel.																								India has been black-balled as the stealer of jobs from the US and the UK with the large-scale shift of call centres and back-offices to Bangalore, Mumbai and Gurgaon. The sudden loss of jobs in the US has triggered a growing antipathy towards India, prompting hard-line legislators in the US to move legislation in seven US states to stop American companies from outsourcing call centre jobs to India. But the Dell and Lehman Brothers incidents have nothing to do with these legislations, and for the first time, open up big questions about the deficiency in services.																								In terms of help desk, Indian firms could not provide the level of quality and services Lehman needs, a note written by a chief of Lehman Bothers said.																								Dell Inc is no longer routing corporate customer calls to a Bangalore, India, centre in an effort to improve services, a Dell spokesperson. 																								Is this a worrying trend and will more US companies start reviewing the performance of their call centres in India  and then decide to move back?																								Industry mavens reckon that it would be too precipitate to draw such an inference from the Dell and Lehman cases but they do concede that there are a few worrying aspects surrounding the call centre business in India that need to be remedied  and quickly.																								This is a trend (foreign companies shutting down their BPO operations in India) and it is difficult to predict when it will end, says P. Rajendran, chief of the education division of NIIT, the premier IT education institute, which was one of the first to offer a special course PlanetWorkz to meet the BPO industrys demand for professionals.																								Rajendran admitted that it would be difficult to staff call centres with competent professionals over the next few years. It would be tough to predict when the gap between demand and supply will be reduced. It may be five years or more; that will remain a guess as long as the industry continues to get artificial BPO professionals, he added.																								He said call centres were now too lax in their recruitment strategy  and the advertisements for walk-in interviews with graduation being a minimum eligibility criterion was an indication of the cavalier attitude towards employment in the BPO sector. 																								With competency in English language a prerequisite for success in any career, especially in the case of Customer Contact Centres or BPO organisations, an effective English language training by PlanetWorkz.com is the right channel for you to get that extra competitive edge and meet challenges ahead, states the NIIT website.																								But is spoken English with an Yankee accent the only criteria? No, says Suren Singh Rasaily, head of Planetworkz. It is just not the accent but understanding the culture of the customers you are dealing with.																								An IT consultant said most of the BPO firms outsource work to smaller outfits to meet the demands of clients abroad. Most of these are fly-by-night operators and fail to meet the requirements. But companies like iGate, led by former Infosys director Phaneesh Murthy, feel that this is a churning period for the BPO business and moves by the likes of Dell and Lehman Brothers seem to be a corrective measure.																								The decision by Dell and Lehman are corrective measures. Once these are through, there will be a demand for new services in the BPO segment, said Tiger Ramesh, head of BPO, iGATE Global Solutions.																								A recent Nasscom study says the ITES sector will be a Rs 81,000-crore industry and generate over 1.1 million jobs by 2008.

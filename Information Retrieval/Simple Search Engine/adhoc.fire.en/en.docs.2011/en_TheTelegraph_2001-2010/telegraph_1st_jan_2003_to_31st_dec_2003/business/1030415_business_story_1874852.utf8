 Tuesday, April 15, 2003 				 Amway aims higher in India
 G. S. RADHAKRISHNHA 																								Hyderabad, April 14: Direct selling giant Amway, having made India its third manufacturing base after US and China, says the government must enact laws to rein in rivals who it says are subverting the concept it pioneered. The threat to the $ 5-billion industry from other direct selling groups like Sky Biz, Maple Leaf and Japan Life can be tackled by strengthening consumer rights.																								Amway director Sankar Parameswaran said his rivals had created distorted impressions in the market about direct selling, and unless law-makers ensured protection to consumers, all direct selling concepts will appear faulty. 																								The company, with 36 products in four categories, has set up four contract manufacturing units in India. Two of them in Hyderabad  Sarvottam Care and Yodeva Plastics  supply plastic containers and make other items.																								Amway India grew at the rate of 13 per cent last year, while the direct selling industry grew at 120 per cent. The company has invested Rs 151 crore in its operations here, including Rs 26 crore in foreign direct investment. 																								Parameswaran said Amway and the Indian Direct Selling Association have prepared a draft legislation, which is pending before the government for over two years. He dispelled notions that an internal RBI memo made adverse comments about the firm.

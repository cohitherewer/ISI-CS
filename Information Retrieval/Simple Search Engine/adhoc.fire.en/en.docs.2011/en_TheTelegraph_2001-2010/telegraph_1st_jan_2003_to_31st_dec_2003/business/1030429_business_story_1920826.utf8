 Tuesday, April 29, 2003 				 Tribunal not to insist on telecom files
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 28: The Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) will continue its hearing on the issue of limited mobility and not insist on government to submit the records of correspondence between the telecom regulator and the government as the case is being heard in Supreme Court.																								The war between the basic telecom service providers offering limited mobility and cellular operators will continue at the TDSAT from May 5 as the cellular operators have requested the tribunal to continue the hearing. 																								Last week, the Supreme Court had issued an interim order staying a TDSAT directive to the government asking it to submit to cellular operators the copies of certain files on its decision to allow the basic operators to offer limited mobility services. 																								The cellular operators had given an undertaking in Supreme Court that they would not seek inspection of the files containing the records on which the government had claimed privilege.																								Early this month, TDSAT had directed the government to file all the correspondence and letters relating to the limited mobility issue with the private basic and cellular mobile operators.																								The telecom tribunal refused to accept the plea of the governments counsel that a few files were confidential and could not be made public. However, the government had said the files could be submitted to the tribunal for its consideration.

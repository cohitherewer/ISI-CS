 M RAJENDRAN				 Good conductor 																								New Delhi, Dec. 14: Outsourcing contracts to India might be under pressure but it still continues to be the most popular tech destination.																								The India development centre of the $6-billion semiconductor maker, ST Microelectronics, has now beaten its 16 other design centres, including those in France, Italy and the US, to emerge the European companys largest design centre worldwide.																								The company is bullish about its India centre and plans to increase headcount to 2,000 engineers by next year from 1,350 now. 																								The centre, the firms largest outside Europe, has filed around 65 international patents and are developing technologies slated to go into production three to four years.

Many global chip manufacturing companies are setting up R amp;D bases on chip design in India and are sprucing up their operations following the success they have had in the Indian market, said Pradeep Kumar, country director of ST Microelectronics, India.																								The scope of R amp;D in India is immense because of the huge engineering talent base that we have. Our engineering colleges could work closely with the industry and take their support in designing the courseware and making students work on live projects rather than doing archaic projects, said Kumar.																								The companys new building at Noida, which will be fully operational by this month, will house the new team of professionals to focus on telecom peripheral automation, Kumar said. These professionals will design and develop embedded software for the telecom companies, hard disk drive firms.																								The centre will also undertake chips design works relevant to digital products like web camera, digital TV, automotives like engine, body besides telecom  both wireline and wireless, he said.

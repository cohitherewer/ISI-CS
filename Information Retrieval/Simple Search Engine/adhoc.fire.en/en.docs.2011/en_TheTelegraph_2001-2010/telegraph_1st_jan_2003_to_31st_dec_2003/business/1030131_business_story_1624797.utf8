(AFP) 																								New York, Jan. 30 (Reuters): AOL Time Warner Inc. on Wednesday posted a 2002 net loss of nearly $ 100 billion  the largest annual loss in US corporate history  and in a sign of further turmoil, media mogul Ted Turner said he would step down as vice-chairman. 																								The worlds largest media company took a whopping $ 45.5 billion fourth-quarter charge to write down the value of its embattled America Online unit, as well as its cable operations and other assets, more than double what analysts had expected.																								The charge reflects the loss in value of the company created in a once-heralded deal marrying old and new media that is now widely seen as a failure. 																								Turner, 64, said he was stepping down to devote more time to his philanthropic and other interests. A spokeswoman said CEO Richard Parsons expected AOLs largest individual investor would stay on the board, but the issue will be discussed soon. 																								The New York-based company, already reeling from the recent departure of chairman Steve Case, CNN head Walter Isaacson and federal probes into accounting practices at its online unit, reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $ 44.9 billion, or $ 10.04 a share. That compared to a year-ago loss of $ 1.8 billion, or 41 cents a share. 																								It posted a full-year 2002 net loss of $ 98.7 billion, about the same as the gross domestic product of Egypt and double that of New Zealand. 																								They tried to put a nice face on this $ 44.5 billion write down but we are talking about a $ 100 billion in a year; this is not chopped liver. It still hurts the companys credibility, said Hal Vogel, head of Vogel Capital Management. 																								AOL Time Warner said it had renegotiated its credit line and said the goodwill charge would not impact its liquidity or debt covenants. 																								While analysts said overall operating numbers came in near expectations for most units, some were taken aback at the size of the non-cash charge  which came on top of a $ 54 billion charge AOL took in the first quarter  and its 2003 outlook. 																								We think 2003 will be a challenging year, Parsons said on a call with analysts, trying to reset expectations. 																								He said the company  home to HBO, Faith Hill, People magazine and Friends  expects mid-single digit growth in revenues in 2003 and essentially flat earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a key cash flow metric, due to lower advertising and less favourable comparisons. 																								There isnt going to be any growth in EBITDA in 2003 and I have some questions about 2004 and they still have this mountain of debt they are trying to grapple with, Vogel said. 																								Most on Wall Street were expecting a non-cash charge of up to $ 20 billion. Some found a bit of comfort that the companys debt covenants were not affected and executives addressed plans to trim its $ 25.8 billion net debt load. 																								The company said revenue in the quarter grew 8 percent to $ 11.4 billion and EBITDA rose 16 per cent to $ 2.8 billion. It posted earnings before a range of items of 28 cents a share, compared to 26 cents a year-ago. 																								Strength in the companys film/entertainment business, with hits like the Lord of the Rings sequel, and cable networks offset weakness in the fourth quarter at America Online. 																								Shares of AOL fell to $ 12.53 in after-hours trade on Instinet, after closing at $ 13.96 in regular New York Stock Exchange trade, but analysts expected it to recover. 																								Obviously the turnaround is taking a little longer than I thought Id like to see but that is the reality, said John Tinker of Blaylock amp; Partners. The stock has started to recover (since this fall) as people view the company as a giant battleship slowing trying to right itself. The quarter capped a tumultuous year that saw a change in top management about two years after AOL completed its $ 106.2 billion purchase of Time Warner.

				 				 																								Pidilite Industries																																											Pidilite Industries has put up a seemingly satisfactory performance for 2002-03. Its total income for the period at Rs 580 crore (Rs 500.81 crore) was up 16 per cent from the year-ago period. Total expenditure too went up by 16 per cent at Rs 520.69 crore (Rs 448.69 crore) which enabled it to report a 14 per cent growth in profits over the corresponding previous period. Income from operations for the year at Rs 574.30 crore (Rs 493.88 crore) was up 16 per cent previous years and so was operational spending at Rs 464.28 crore (Rs 401.04 crore). The operational income as well as expenditure having gone up in tandem strained margins with operating profits managing to rise by 19 per cent to Rs 110.02 crore (Rs 92.84 crore). But the OPM was stagnant at 19 per cent. Other income was down 18 per cent at Rs 5.70 crore (Rs 6.93 crore) but was more or less compensated by a falling interest cost which was down 27 per cent over the year-ago period at Rs 3.02 crore (Rs 4.16 crore). Depreciation was up 19 per cent at Rs 22.53 crore (Rs 18.97 crore). The company reported a net profit of Rs 59.31 crore (Rs 52.12 crore) up 14 per cent from the previous year. The stock has seen some upward movement since end of March and currently trading at Rs 252.55 discounts its full year EPS of Rs 23.50 by 11 times.

Other income of the company declined 47 per cent to Rs 1.49 crore (Rs 2.81 crore). Interest was negligible. Depreciation shot up to Rs 4.24 crore (Rs 1.07 crore). The stock had come down considerably. However, now it quotes at Rs 66 discounting its full year EPS of Rs 11.33 by just about six times. However the uncertain environment over the implementation of the conditional access system weighs heavily against any immediate upside.

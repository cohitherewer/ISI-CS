 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Mutuals pitch for pensions 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Retiring room																								Mumbai, Aug. 12: The mutual funds industry, worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore, is gearing up to emerge as a key player in the pension funds business after it is thrown open to private companies at the end of this year.																								We have everything that a pension fund would need. The experience to manage liquid funds, government securities funds and equity funds, Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) chairman A. P. Kurian said. 																								Pensions are now a preserve of government agencies, but that will change soon with the government having made up its mind on letting in private entities, just the way it did in the insurance industry.																								If you are offering to sell pension, ours is a readymade platform. Mutual funds have the infrastructure and are appropriately positioned for it, Kurian said. 																								Let us not put a cap on the number of firms but instead erect high entry barriers like specifying experience and the amount of assets managed as conditions, he said in reaction to recent reports that the government was thinking of allowing only six entities.																								Kurien, speaking at a seminar on pension reforms organised by CII and Birla Sunlife, said 31 mutual funds in India manage 426 schemes worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore.																								Mutual funds are among the intermediaries with the lowest costs and a significant distribution network. The maximum that a mutual fund can charge an investor for managing funds is 2.5 per cent. However, intense competition has cut it to 1.5 per cent.																								Watching Kurien make a pitch for a slice of the pension pie was Prodipto Ghosh, additional secretary in the finance ministrys department of economic affairs.																								Donald Stewart, chief executive officer of Sun Life Financial, stressed on the need to tap the large market that will be spawned by the switchover from defined benefit plans to defined contributions  a system in which the employee is responsible for retirement planning.

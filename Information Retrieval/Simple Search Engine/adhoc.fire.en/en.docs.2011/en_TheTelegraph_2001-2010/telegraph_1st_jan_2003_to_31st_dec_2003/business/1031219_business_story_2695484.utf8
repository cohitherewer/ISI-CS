 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 18: Reliance Infocomm today announced a nationwide roaming facility for all Reliance IndiaMobile (RIM) subscribers with the one number at Rs 1.99 per incoming call.																								They can now carry their Reliance IndiaMobile phones across the pan India Reliance network and make calls at the home tariff plan rate for which they have subscribed, while retaining their home mobile number, the company said.																								For example, a Calcutta based Reliance Info subscriber is visiting Chennai. He subscribes to the Budget 149 tariff plan. He will have to pay Rs 1.99 per minute for every incoming call from anywhere in India as opposed to Rs 6.44 per minute charged by most mobile service providers.

 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Big Board ponders suit against Grasso
				 	 Reed: Will he bite the bullet?																								New York, Dec. 21: Three months after being called from his retirement on an island in France to rescue a New York Stock Exchange mired in scandal, John S. Reed has almost completed his job as interim chairman. He has a new board. He has a new chief executive. And he is on the verge of appointing an independent chairman to preside over the Big Boards regulatory matters. 																								But one important decision looms: Will the exchange file suit against its deposed chairman, Richard A. Grasso, and the former board members who awarded him the $139.5-million pay package that led to his downfall?																								Choosing whether to sue the former board members is the next order of business for the new directors after their surprise decision last week to hire John A. Thain, president of the Goldman Sachs Group, to be chief executive of the exchange. Thain is now in the odd position of helping the Big Board search for a permanent replacement for Grasso as chairman  in effect, recruiting his own boss. That could lead to criticism down the road. But for the moment, at least, the exchange has more pressing concerns. 																								In a 90-minute interview on Friday, Reed, 64, said he and the other directors would make up their minds about the lawsuit in the next few weeks. To help them decide, they will examine an internal investigation of how the stock exchange board came to grant Grassos pay package. If you read this report and if you were trained in the law, you would say that there is information in that report that would support a potential legal action.																								Such a suit would probably contend that former directors had been negligent in how they handled Grassos pay. It could be filed by the exchanges current board; the Securities and Exchange Commission; Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general of New York; or some combination of the three, Reed said. Members of the exchange  its shareholders, in essence  could also sue if the board decided not to, he added.																								Reed has referred to the contents of the report  compiled by Dan K. Webb, a former federal prosecutor  as embarrassing. Its findings were based on interviews with more than 60 executives, including Grasso, who were involved in the deliberations over the former chairmans pay. The report could provide the first round of evidence in a potential suit. 																								The process of deciding whether to sue some or all members of the old board began in earnest on Friday, Reed said. He briefed the directors on the findings in the Webb report and planned to send copies of it to the directors this week. 																								After each director has studied the report, the board will meet again to discuss how to plow through the thicket of legal, procedural and governance questions that would have to be answered before a decision could be made to file suit. Other options, Reed said, include reaching a financial settlement with Grasso  or doing nothing. 																								It would be highly unusual for a board composed of directors of public companies to sue former members of their own board, but the exchanges circumstances are extraordinary. If the directors believe that the former directors blatantly breached their duties, they might feel they have no alternative, lawyers said.																								That would be very extraordinary, said Charles M. Elson, who teaches corporate governance at the University of Delawares business school. 																								He added that corporate directors were generally well protected from legal liability and that winning a suit against them would probably be difficult.																								Experts in corporate governance have criticised the close ties that Grasso had with some directors, including Kenneth G. Langone. A longtime personal friend of Grassos and a fellow director of Home Depot, Langone was chairman of the NYSE boards compensation committee from 1999 to June of this year. It was during that period that Grasso signed the two contracts that would award him close to $200 million.																								Reed said that if that criticism was valid, Langone could be a bigger target than other directors for claims of negligence. quot;If Mr.																								Langone had a relationship with Dick, such that the duty of loyalty could be questioned - in other words, that he was more interested																								in his relationship with Dick than his obligation of loyalty to the NYSE - that would be a basis for attacking him, quot; he said. quot;It would																								not necessarily exist for another director. quot; Langone did not respond to requests for comment. 																								Other former directors of the exchange, including H. Carl McCall, have been criticized for being insufficiently diligent in their duties.																								As chairman of the compensation committee after Langone, McCall signed Grassos last contract, but then said publicly that he had																								not fully read it and was thus unaware of an additional $48 million Grasso would receive in the new contract. (McCall declined to																								comment on Friday.) 																								The directors who might be most vulnerable to a lawsuit are those who served on the compensation committee that met in February.																								According to minutes from the exchange, it was at that meeting that Grasso asked to be allowed to withdraw $130 million in accrued																								pension and deferred salary payments. The committee - including Langone as chairman and a number of other Wall Street and																								corporate executives - approved the request, in principle, and recommended that it be taken up by the full board. 																								Reed declined to discuss the contents of the report in detail, but he did acknowledge that some of those interviewed by Webb had																								said that Grasso wanted to take the money because he feared that a different group of directors might not allow him to have it later.																								Lawyers close to the exchange have said that if it does come out that Grasso was asking for the money for that reason, and told																								directors as much, it would be easier to make the case that Grasso and other directors violated their duties to the exchange. 																								 quot;From a private point of view, it certainly would suggest the decision about the money couldnt be justified on its own, quot; Reed said. quot;In																								other words, if you thought that if this thing would be reviewed by a new board, and it might not be approved, there is some																								implication that, Gee, this thing couldnt stand the light of day. quot; 																								In defending his decision to ask for the money, Grasso has said that he was doing so for estate planning. Kenneth C. Edgar Jr., a																								lawyer who represents Grasso, declined to comment on Friday. 																								If the board decides to sue, Reed said, doing so might be his final act as interim chairman. On Jan. 15, he is to turn over the chief																								executive duties - and the big office that Grasso used to occupy - to Thain. 																								(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) 																								By then, he and Thain may have settled on a new chairman. 																								As disciplined as Reed considers himself to be, he wheeled the cart around the horse when he recruited Thain on Nov. 21. In the																								midst of the search for a permanent chairman, Reed said, he impulsively offered the chief executives job to Thain after lunch in the																								dining room at Goldmans headquarters. 																								 quot;My whole game plan had been to replace myself and then have the new chairman together with the new board start a search for a																								new CEO, quot; said Reed, who had been invited by Goldmans chairman, Henry M. Paulson Jr., to dine with Chancellor Gerhard																								Schroeder of Germany. 																								After the meal, Reed walked up to Thain, whom he knew as a fellow trustee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and asked																								him if he would leave Goldman to run the exchange. 																								 quot;I dont know what caused me to do it, quot; said Reed, who, like Thain, attended MIT. quot;It was just one of these instincts that you have. quot; 																								Thain amazed him by accepting, he said. Now, the two MIT graduates are working together to replace Grasso, a Pace University																								dropout. Reed said he had told Thain the name of his first choice for chairman of the exchange. This candidate, whom Reed declined																								to identify, had already turned the job down once, but Reed expressed hope that Thain would be able to change his mind. He said																								Thain had approved the choice of this man, a retired chief executive, and that if he did not accept, Thain would have the power to																								veto other prospective chairmen - people who could, in effect, be his boss. 																								 quot;Would you saddle a CEO with a chairman he doesnt get along with? quot; Reed said. Elson said that giving a chief executive veto power																								over the choice of the chairman was not the best governance practice but, in this case, the board might have to give Thain significant																								say. 																								 quot;Theoretically, the CEO should not have a veto over the chairman of the board, quot; Elson said. quot;Practically, the CEO will have input on																								whos chosen because they have to work together. quot; 																								Once the questions of who will be chairman and whether to sue are settled, Reed will be ready to sail back into the sunset off the																								coast of France. He said he had no interest in being the exchanges chairman himself and had agreed to stay on as a director - if he is																								asked - only reluctantly. He said he would not answer the next call to help rescue a corporation or institution in distress. 																								 quot;I came here out of guilt and I assuaged that, quot; Reed said. quot;Like a good Presbyterian, I was guilty that I was having so much fun. quot;					 [+uc('New York Times News Service ')+]

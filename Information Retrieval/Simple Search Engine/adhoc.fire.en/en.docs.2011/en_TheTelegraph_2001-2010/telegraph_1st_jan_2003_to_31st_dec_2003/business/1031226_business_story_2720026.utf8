 GARIMA SINGH				 	 Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar at the first Pravasi Bharatiya Divas held in New Delhi in January this year. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Dec. 25: Indias honeymoon with the non-resident Indians (NRIs) continues.																								The government and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) have put together a budget of approximately Rs 9 crore for the second jamboree for non-resident Indians  but funnily enough no ones even seriously talking of trying very hard to persuade them to open up their purse-strings.																								The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas  a three-day celebration of nostalgia and emotional ties with the Great Indian Diaspora  takes place in early January.																								The event, one of the biggest government funded extravaganzas in the country, will be making no special pitch for NRI investment. 																								With no encouraging sign of any great investment by the NRIs since the last jamboree, there are serious questions that need to be raised about the rationale for holding another massive beanfeast for the NRIs.																								Ask around and the Ficci officials churn out the same old platitudes. 																								The focus of this huge conference is to bring the global Indian family together and showcase to them the opportunities available in India. The agenda for this meet is certainly not investment alone. However, it will be an automatic fallout of the one-to-one meetings which the participants will have, said a senior Ficci official.																								The government and the industry association have chosen to play the role of facilitators and provide a platform to enable the NRIs and the People of Indian Origin (PIOs) to form a global network.																								Last year, while addressing the NRIs in his speech at the inaugural session, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said, We do not want your riches but the richness of your experience.																								This conference will give us a chance to bring forth our synergies in the field of culture, education, science and technology and literature. It is our endeavour to strengthen our relationship, said Ficci president-elect Y. K. Modi.																								The three-day conference will witness the presence of other eminent ministers, including deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani, finance minister Jaswant Singh, external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha and minister of state for external affairs Digvijay Singh.																								There will be parallel sessions and discussions on topics like international trade, NRIs in the Gulf, tourism, healthcare, knowledge-based industry, India and global financial flows and infrastructure. This time there will be no Bollywood stars at the cultural evening. 																								However, singers and composers like Anu Malik, Sunidhi Chauhan, Sonu Nigam and Hariharan will be the star performers.

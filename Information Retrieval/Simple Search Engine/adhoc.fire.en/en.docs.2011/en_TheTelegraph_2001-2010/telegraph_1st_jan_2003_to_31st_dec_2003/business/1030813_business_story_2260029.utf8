 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Campaign cocktail to uncork $ flow
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Singh: Playing host																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: India has gone into overdrive to market itself to the world. 																								The finance ministry, which recently took on the job of selling India as an investment destination, has decided to launch a Rs 75-crore publicity blitz using commissioned films to be aired on global channels, the world-wide web, a specialised commercial initiative by Indian missions abroad and has hired an European public relations outfit  Financial Dynamics  to jockey for mind space with global investors.																								Finance minister Jaswant Singh has asked foreign minister Yashwant Sinha to get Indian missions to take up a targeted commercial initiative to attract high-value foreign investors in specific nations in the West, Far East and the Gulf. 																								The move to hardsell India follows the transfer of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) to the finance ministry and a cabinet meetings observation that though investment flow had been good at $2 billion a year it still was nowhere near Chinas and participation in global trade was still less than 1 per cent.																								The cabinet asked Singh to take Sinhas help to improve this dismal situation. A team of ministry officials headed by Prodipto Ghosh, aditional secretary in the economic affairs department and a blue-eyed boy of both the Prime Minister and Singh, has consequently been asked to co-ordinate this effort with other ministries as well as establish close rapport with international groups like the US-India caucus, the India Business Group in London and similar bodies in Germany, Singapore, Tokyo. 																								The whole aim according to a note prepared on the issue is to present a global face to (attempts at) enhancing Indias economic security by raking in more low-cost investment dollars, euros or yen for India.																								The bid to rope in India-friendly groups into the investment effort follows a spate of high-profile visits to targeted countries from where investment flows come by top leaders including the Prime Minister, deputy Prime Minister, and finance and commerce ministers.																								These groups have helped tremendously in the past and we will be leaning on them heavily in our present plan, finance ministry officials said. 																								The fact that Singh has earlier held the foreign affairs portfolio and Sinha the finance portfolio is expected to give the initiative an added advantage.																								The ministry plans to spend Rs 75 crore on publicity this year. The money will be used to make a slew of publicity films and buy airtime on channels such as CNN, CNBC and BBC besides Indian channels like Aaj Tak and Doordarshan. 																								UK-based public relations outfit Financial Dynamics has been hired to perk up this effort in Western Europe. 																								Financial Dynamics will help bring teams of European journalists, editors, and top investing firms to the country on familiarisation trips. 																								Financial Dynamics was recently sold by the media and advertising major Cordiant Group, which owns Bates Worldwide, in a management buyout. It is one of the top three public relations firms in London along with Brunswick and Citigate Dewe Rogerson and has over 400 clients worldwide. 																								The finance ministry has also test-launched a website which will carry a weekly package of news out of the country and a monthly package of analytical features designed to attract the investing community. The latest in business news  the successful Maruti IPO, Azim Premjis latest venture, and ISROs bid to hawk satellite pictures have been showcased in the test effort.

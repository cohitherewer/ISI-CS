 Sunday, February 02, 2003 				 No letup in cell-WiLL tussle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 1: The fight between the cellular and limited mobile operators continues with the Tata group today receiving a notice from the telecom regulator to explain whether it has violated the concept of limited mobility by offering its service beyond Delhi region at local call rates.																								While both the cellular operators in the capital  AirTel and Hutch  said they had not made any written complaints, sources in Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said, We had received complaints from an organisation saying that the limited mobility services offered by the Tatas in Delhi was also available in neighbouring states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. In addition the Cellular Operators Association of India has also written to us.																								In response to these as also verbal complaints from the two cellular mobile operators in Delhi, Trai has asked Tata Teleservices  basic and limited mobile service provider  to clarify whether the company was providing WiLL-based limited mobility services beyond its licensed area in Delhi.																								 Trai is in receipt of a complaint that TTSL is providing limited mobile services beyond its licensed area of Delhi. Its service are available in Gurgaon, Noida and Ghaziabad, Trai said.																								The directives of the government and Trai are that limited mobile services are to be allowed within a radius of 50 kilometers or local area that is termed in telecom parlance as Short Distance Charging Area (SDCA).																								A Tata spokesperson refused to comment on the issue, but according to a technical executive in the company, the technology cannot be restricted to a given area. There will be a spill over of a few meters or a couple of kilometers. This cannot be termed as violation of the directives.

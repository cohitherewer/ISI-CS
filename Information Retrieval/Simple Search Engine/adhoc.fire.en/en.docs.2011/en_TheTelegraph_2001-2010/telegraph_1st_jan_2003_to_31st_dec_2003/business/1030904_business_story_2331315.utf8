 Thursday, September 04, 2003 				 Steps to check misuse of long-distance calls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 3: The grey market operations in the international long distance (ILD) market can be curbed only through a policy initiative from the government that includes penalties, monitoring and co-operation amongst the service providers in this segment.																								A committee set up to examine issues arising from the traffic by-pass through the grey market in international long distance services and the resultant repercussions on interconnect user charges (IUC) has just submitted its report.																								The committee, which was headed by the secretary of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and had members from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, Reliance, Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd, Data Access, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd and Bharti Telesonic, has recommended strict monitoring by government agencies and operators.																								It appears that illegal ILD operators may need to be addressed through more stringent penal provisions in the legal system. Further, law enforcement agencies in smaller towns may need to be better equipped to assess in a timely manner, says the report.																								The panel said the IUC regime has not resulted in a reduction in incoming ISD call traffic terminating in the access network of BSNL and Reliance. Hence, it is not justified to conclude that ILD grey market will be killed by IUC regime.

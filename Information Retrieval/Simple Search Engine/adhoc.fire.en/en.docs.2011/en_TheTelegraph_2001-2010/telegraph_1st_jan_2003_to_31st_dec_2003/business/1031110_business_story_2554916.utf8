Initially, the institute will admit 20 people from all over the country. We will not restrict ourselves to Calcutta alone. We will see that candidates from small towns also get a chance, said Joseph.																								The institute will be housed at Jeevandeep building covering 3,000 square feet. He added that the Khaitan group wants to utilise the space in the Jeevandeep building in a proper manner to generate revenues.

Graduates from any discipline are eligible for the course. 																								For outstation candidates, the Khaitan group will provide hostel facilities. The students will have to pay for it, Joseph added. 																								The academy will provide field training in sales and marketing for six months. In the remaining six months, the students will undergo theory classes. 																								It has appointed the Institute of Psychometrics to carry out an initial interview of the applicants, out of whom they will select 20 for admission.

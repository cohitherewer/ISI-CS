 Monday, June 30, 2003  Result Analysis
				 				 																								TRENT																																											Contrary to what its quarterly performance suggested, Trent has turned out a very mediocre show for the full year ended March 2003. Income from operations was Rs 111.53 crore (Rs 81.97 crore) up 36 per cent from last year. At Rs 102.88 crore (Rs 75.14 crore), operational cost went up by 37 per cent over the corresponding previous period. Although the operating expenditure went up by a slightly higher percentage than revenues, Trent has maintained its margins. Operating profit was up 27 per cent from last year at Rs 8.65 crore (Rs 6.83 crore). Operating profit margin was stagnant at a rather low level of 8 per cent. Other income at Rs 8.57crore (Rs 8.63 crore) was down 1 per cent. Depreciation moved up by 15 per cent to Rs 2.75 crore (Rs 2.38 crore). The tax provision having shot up to Rs 2.20 crore (Rs 0.82 crore) net profit (excluding extraordinaries) remained almost flat at Rs 12.25 crore against Rs 12.22 crore during the same period last year. During the year the company reported an extraordinary income of Rs 4.65 crore against an expense of Rs 2 crore during the preceding year. The stock came down on declaration of results and currently trades at Rs 183 discounting its full year earnings per share of Rs 9.34 by 20 times.																																											PANTALOON RETAIL																																											Pantaloon is the largest retailer in India, with a chain of 13 departmental stores and three hypermarkets across the country, but the numbers for the third quarter are not too encouraging. Income from operations at Rs 95.89 crore (Rs 76.45 crore) went up 25 per cent over the year-ago period but sequentially the same was down 13 per cent from the December quarter revenue of Rs 109.76 crore. Operational cost at Rs 87.87 crore (Rs 71.02 crore) was up 24 per cent from the year-ago period, while sequentially it was down 12 per cent from the December quarter cost of Rs 99.54 crore. Margins improved over the year-ago period but were inexplicably down sequentially.

BHEL																																											Though Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel) has reported an 11 per cent rise in net profit for fiscal 2003 over the previous year, its performance has been poor compared to the excellent results during the year-ago period. At Rs 6,978.14 crore (Rs 7,286.60 crore), income from operations was down 4 per cent over the previous year. Bhel had a operational income over the corresponding previous period at a time when it recorded the highest ever order inflows.

At Rs 782.50 crore (Rs 424.40 crore) operating profit was up 84 per cent over the year-ago period, while OPM shot up to 11 per cent from 6 per cent during the same period previous year.

The higher before tax profits in turn saw the tax provision go up by 30 per cent over the corresponding previous period to Rs 253.43 crore (Rs 194.90 crore). Net profit was up just 11 per cent at Rs 517.06 crore (Rs 467.90 crore). The stock has seen a fantastic rise since late 2002 with intermittent dips. Currently trading at Rs 263 it discounts its fiscal 2003 EPS of Rs 21.13 by 13 times. 																																											TATA TEA																																											Increasing competition from smaller regional players has hit Tata Teas performance for fiscal 2003. At Rs 760.75 crore (Rs 779.43 crore), income from operations was down 2 per cent from the previous year. Operating profit was down 8 per cent from the previous year at Rs 85.90 crore (Rs 93.70 crore), while OPM shrank by a percentage point to 11 per cent from 12 per cent during the same period previous year.

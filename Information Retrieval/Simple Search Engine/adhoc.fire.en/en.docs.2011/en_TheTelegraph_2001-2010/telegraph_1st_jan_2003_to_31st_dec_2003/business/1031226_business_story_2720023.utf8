The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Campaign for iced tea hots up
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 Chill out 																								Calcutta, Dec. 25: The fight between the soft drinks sector and the tea industry is hotting up with the Indian Tea Association (ITA) planning to launch a nationwide campaign to promote iced-tea.																								Talking to The Telegraph, ITA chairman C. K. Dhanuka said, Iced tea will be promoted as a new product which can be prepared in-house. The industry has not been able to come up with a new product for the consumers for quite some time now. Iced tea will create enough excitement in the tea-drinking habit of the people.																								However, he refused to accept that iced tea is being placed vis--vis soft drinks. Tea has no competitor, he said. The ITA chairman will place a formal proposal before its members at a meeting to be held this week.																								The probable catchline will be anything healthier than water is iced tea. It will be placed in the market as a cold beverage and consumers will be getting more anti-oxidants from iced tea. We will try to push the idea that tea can be consumed with ice in-house also, Dhanuka said.																								The promotion will also take care of the price-sensitive Indian consumers. We will try to reach the message that the consumers will be able to get 10 glasses of iced tea from tea worth Rs 5, Dhanuka added.																								The industry will be getting Rs 10 crore generic promotion fund from the Union commerce ministry against the special additional duty which the industry is paying.																								Dhanuka is hopeful that the Indian tea industry will turnaround soon. 																								Last four years had been extremely disappointing for the industry. But in the next four years, we hope that the Indian tea industry will be back on its rails, he added.																								The industry feels that the market will pick up in January. There will be hardly any tea left at the auctions and the prices will see an upswing. Already good north Indian varieties are fetching Rs 6-7 higher per kg at the auctions. Even the south Indian varieties are witnessing a price recovery.																								Besides domestic recovery, the export markets should also revive for the tea industry to become remunerative, said Dhanuka.																								The association will be sending delegates to Pakistan, West Asia and Moscow in the first quarter of 2004 to revive exports to these countries. A delegation from Moscow will also be visiting India.																								Following the ITAs visit to Pakistan, exports of Indian tea to that country is expected to reach 7 million kg in the current year. The overall exports are expected to be 165 million kg this year.

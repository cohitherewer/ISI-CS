The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, April 11, 2003  Technology tanks, Infosys incinerated  Software stars come under a cloud OUR CORRESPONDENT Mumbai, April 10: Technology  titans capsized in the wave of investor fury that swamped  trading floors after Infosys shocked and awed Dalal Street  like none before. Computer companies were bruised,  living down the nightmare of their lives as investors left  distraught by the Bangalore bellwethers pessimistic profit  forecast whip-lashed shares of firms that flaunt software  badges. A bottomline boost of 12 per cent  is what Infosys expects in the first quarter of the current  financial year (2003-04), but shareholders fed on a diet  of heady growth numbers for years lost their taste for a  dose of realism. The company, which rarely dished  out numbers less than 20 per cent when it made profit projections,  shrunk a quarter smaller in market worth when it all ended.  The share plunged 27 per cent; the market capitalisation  was down Rs 7,250 crore at Rs 20,164 crore. The BSE tech  index, a barometer of all technology stocks, was poorer  by Rs 15,817 crore at Rs 63,316 crore.  It was an unprecedented day.  It was shock amp; awe, the Dalal Street kind, said a stunned  Ramesh Damani.  The merciless pounding saw institutions  and retail investors selling ICE stocks with a vengeance  that led many to have second thoughts on the fabled tech  resilience. Why should I rate Infosys higher  than commodity stocks?, wondered Jignesh Shah, strategist  at ASK RJ Investment Management Services. Its earnings  growth mirror that of commodity firms. Infotech majors talk  about lower double-digit growth rates, similar to the better-performing  commodity stocks. The market will not pay a premium on these  shares, he added.  Marketmen and analysts have been  worried about the impact of the current economic environment  and the war in Iraq on the companys performance this  fiscal and were looking forward to the companys guidance  for the future. There were expectations that Infosys  would throw up an earnings-growth guidance in the range  of 18-20 per cent for this fiscal. Analysts had felt that  any guidance below this figure could be damaging for its  stock price and could also influence the prices of other  software scrips. This mornings whammy was the  hardest ever that Infosys has taken on bourses. The stock  crashed Rs 1,113.45 to end at Rs 3,044.60. The wild-fire  spread to others in the same business. Mastek, for instance,  lost 50 per cent of its value at Rs 284.70, Wipro shed Rs  224.80 at Rs 1,007.60, Digital gave up Rs 104.25 at Rs 491.95  and Satyam slid Rs 27.55 at Rs 150.70.  The haemorrhage left the Bombay  Stock Exchange sensex tottering at 105.92 points, or 3.37  per cent, lower at 3035.33. It had plumbed a trough of 3021.74  earlier in the day.  Among the major sellers were foreign  institutional investors, who realised that the growth stocks  were a better bet. That explains why old-economy firms held  out. In the BSEs specified group,  154 shares declined, while 41 advanced. The volume of business  was higher at Rs 1,644.12 crore compared with the previous  days Rs 1,036.32 crore.  Infosys was the chart-topper with  a turnover of Rs 518.70 crore. It was followed by Mastek  at Rs 188.37 crore. Drug majors came out unscathed. Cipla  gained Rs 17.05 at Rs 743.65, Dr Reddys advanced by Rs  6.65 at Rs 931.55 and Ranbaxy by Rs 18.70 at Rs 683.90.  SBI jumped Rs 6.80 to Rs 290.90, Hero Honda gained Rs 8.70  at Rs 193.00 and ITC shot up by Rs 14.20 at Rs 673.95.

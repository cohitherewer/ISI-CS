 Friday, October 17, 2003 				 Stock rally may come in handy for CESC
 ANIEK PAUL				 	 Powering ahead																								Calcutta, Oct. 16: Whatever may have fuelled the rally in CESCs share price  be it fascinating speculations or fundamental strengths of the company  it has done the promoters a world of good.																								The price of the stock having moved up sharply, the Goenkas  the promoters of the power utility  may now get CESCs debts restructured without having to pledge their entire holding with the companys lenders.																								The lenders have agreed to CESCs proposal to recast its debts, but insisted on the promoters pledging their entire stake in the company in return. The Goenkas, however, have offered to pledge up to 40 per cent of their holding in CESC  or 16-20 per cent of the companys shares. Though the promoters acknowledged holding is around 40 per cent, their actual control is believed to be close to 50 per cent.																								The recent rally in the price of CESCs shares reinforces the promoters offer to pledge 40 per cent of their stake, said Sumantra Banerjee, the companys managing director.																								Though the lenders have not agreed to the Goenkas offer as yet, Victoria House is hopeful that the financial institutions are now going to climb down on their demand for full control of the promoters holding in the company.																								CESCs share price has gone up 87 per cent over the last couple of weeks. From a close of Rs 46.60 on September 30, it has gone up to Rs 86.60  the price at which it was last traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.																								Banerjee said, We are hopeful that the debt restructuring deal with the lenders will be completed by the end of November. Previously we thought we could finish it by October.																								The lenders had also asked the promoters to infuse funds into the company. CESC is issuing 33 lakh shares to the promoters at Rs 49.70 apiece, which will result in an infusion of Rs 16.40 crore. The funds are going to be used to pay down CESCs debts. The lenders had insisted on the promoters infusing Rs 50 crore.																								Meanwhile, at the companys recently-held annual general meeting, vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said CESC was looking to set up a 250-megawatt power plant in Bengal at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. He has also indicated plans of roping in a strategic investor from abroad.																								The company is planning a voluntary retirement scheme for its employees at the Cossipore and Mulajore units, the financial implications of which are being examined at present.

 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Five merchant banks in race for ONGC deal
																								New Delhi, Dec. 30 (PTI): Five key merchant bankers, including DSP Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are in race to become advisers to the sale of 10 per cent equity in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) through a public offer. Uday Kotak, ICICI Securities, and HSBC are the other three short-listed for the mandate for ONGC public issue, sources said.																								Kotak is believed to have bid the lowest fee of seven paise per Rs 100 realised. 																								Sources said a consortium of three merchant bankers would be selected among these five advisers for managing the issue, widely expected to be completed in the current financial year.																								The government last week decided to sell 10 per cent each in ONGC and Gail through a public offering in the domestic market to meet largely unrealised disinvestment target of Rs 13,200 crore for the current fiscal.																								Sebi has made special concessions for the twin issues to enable them to hit the market before March 31. Among the relaxation given is doing away with the mandatory beauty parade of merchant bankers. Sources said that presentations for Gails adviser are due on Wednesday.																								The government would appoint a consortium of two advisors for the gail public issue, they pointed out.

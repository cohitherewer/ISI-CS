 OUR CORRESPONDENT		 Hyundai Motor India MD Jae-il Kim (left)  with president B. V. R. Subbu at the launch of its sports  utility vehicle Terracan in New Delhi on Monday. (AFP) New Delhi, Aug. 4: Hyundai Motors India (HMIL) today launched sports utility vehicle Terracan even as its Seoul-based parent faced up to a series of problems, including a payment scandal, strike and suicide by a top executive.																								The 2.9-litre diesel Terracan, with a sticker price of Rs 18.49 lakh, will have the common rail direct injection (CRDi) fuel system. 																								This means Terracan will have the performance of a petrol engine while retaining the fuel economy of the diesel engine, a Hyundai official said. It also boasts of advanced off-road capability with a part-time 4-wheel drive, he added.																								The vehicle sports leather seats, a fully-automatic temperature control system, power windows, dual front airbags and a mini-navigation system. Terracan will be our flag-bearer offering in India, said Subbu. We expect to sell around 700 units of Terracan a year.																								The launch came as the Indian unit stared at a potential threat from the over a month-long strike at its South Korean parent firm, which could affect supplies of critical parts. 																								If the strike prolongs till mid-September, we may face some problems as we import certain parts for Sonata, Accent Viva and Accent CRDi diesel cars from Korea. But we have enough stock to last us till September, HMIL president B. V. R. Subbu told reporters at the launch here today. 																								Hyundai, 10 per cent owned by US-German automaker DaimlerChrysler AG, had earlier said earlier that its Indian subsidiary would invest $350 million as part of its expansion plans to produce sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) from this year.

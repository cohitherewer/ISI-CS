 Tuesday, April 15, 2003 				 PC sales outlook bright
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, April 14: Economic growth coupled with attractive offerings by computer assemblers will push the demand for personal computers in the country during 2003, according to a study by Gartner Dataquest.																								Earlier, Gartner had forecast PC shipments to increase 18 per cent in 2003 after the 12 per cent growth in 2002. 																								The report, India: PC market outlook 2003, said that mobile PCs, economic recovery, small and medium businesses (SMB) growth, education and strong white-box offerings will be the five key demand drivers for the PC market in 2003. 																								The report said that as the technology gap between desktop PC and mobile PC narrows and prices continue to drop, the demand for mobile PCs is expected to grow significantly. 																								The report further noted that though India is not impacted as severely as other countries, it has had its share of worries due to the global economic slowdown.																								 Recent positive trends indicate that organisations are easing restrictions on IT budgets. This will result in increased PC uptake in the corporate segment, it added.																								With population over a billion, India has lot to offer in terms of demand. The consumer segment is still very attractive considering the large population of first-time buyers, said Vinod Nair, research analyst at Gartner India.																								The report was optimistic about the small and medium business segment which has been under utilising technology. A demand from this sector is expected to boost personal computer sales in the coming year.

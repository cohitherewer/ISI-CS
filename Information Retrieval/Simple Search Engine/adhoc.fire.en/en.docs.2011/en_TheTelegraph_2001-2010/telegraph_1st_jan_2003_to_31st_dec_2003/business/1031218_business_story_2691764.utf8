 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Govt to freeze wheat procurement price
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Burden of woes																								New Delhi, Dec 17: In a bid to contain the food subsidy bill in the coming budget, the Union government has, for the first time since the 1960s, decided to freeze the prices at which it buys wheat from the farmers. 																								The move, which is likely to be debated tomorrow by the Union cabinet, is sure to inflame north western India where the politics of farm prices decides the outcome of elections.																								At the same time, the assured price at which sugar is bought will be raised by just Rs 4 as recommended by the economists on agricultural costs prices commission, disregarding demands from the sugar farmers lobby.																								Disregarding demands for a hike of 10-15 per cent from its coalition partner, the Akali Dal, the BJP-led government has retained the statutory price at which state agencies have to buy winter-sown wheat from farmers at Rs 630 a quintal. Last season, the price had been fixed at Rs 620 plus a hardship bonus of Rs 10 or a total of Rs 630.																								We had to bite the bullet this time before the budget so that the budget-making exercise is divorced from the clamour for more subsidies, said top finance ministry officials. The wheat purchases will actually take place in May next year.																								Finance minister Jaswant Singh is believed to have rammed through the decision despite objections from farm minister Rajnath Singh. Singhs logic is that the food subsidy bill has been rising by 12-13 per cent and is expected to touch about Rs 24,000 crore this fiscal.																								The political logic, which promoted acceptance of the controversial move to rein in wheat and sugar prices, is that the BJP has never done particularly well in the agricultural districts of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Its base in the north has been in the urban areas and tough stand on farm prices would not hurt it much. 																								In urban areas, a stable wheat and sugar prices would actually go down well with the electorate and become one more selling point for the ruling partys economic agenda when it goes in for a general election next year.																								The failure to get a price hike sanctioned, on the other hand, could actually hurt opponents like Congresss chief minister in Punjab, Capt Amrinder Singh and Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati.																								It could also actually strengthen the hands of a future ally like Mulayam Singh Yadav who could play the role of an aggrieved farm leader and wrest small concessions later.																								The hullabaloo over wheat prices will die down before the budget and we will be able to plan next years subsidy bill better. And please remember that food remains the single largest component of subsidy, not oil products nor fertilisers, quot; said officials.

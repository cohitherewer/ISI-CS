 Thursday, November 20, 2003 				 TVS-E sets sights on China, Asean markets
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 19: TVS Electronics, a major player in the dot matrix printers business in India, is looking to sell its products in China, Russia and the Asean countries.																								The company could even set up a manufacturing base in China, said S. Shreenivasa Rao, director, TVS Electronics.																								We have set up an office in Shanghai, but so far we have used it only to source inputs for our printers. We are now trying to sell printers in China, which is a huge market consuming about a million dot matrix printers every year, said Rao.																								TVS Electronics is planning to sow the seeds in China next year, and scale up its operations in 2005. The company hopes to sell 1.5 lakh printers this year.																								We expect our revenues to increase by 30 per cent to Rs 300 crore this year. Our target is to realise 40-45 per cent growth next year, he added.																								In India, TVS Electronics controls 44 per cent of the market for dot matrix printers, way ahead of global leaders like Epson and Oki.																								TVS Electronics expects to earn Rs 50-60 crore from exports to Europe this year. Besides dot matrix printers, it markets inkjet printers produced by Lexmark in a small way.																								Besides dot matrix printers, we are bullish on hi-tech point-of-sale terminals which we have started manufacturing. These gadgets are suitable for retail stores  even small ones, Rao said.																								The company has already started selling these terminals in some southern states.

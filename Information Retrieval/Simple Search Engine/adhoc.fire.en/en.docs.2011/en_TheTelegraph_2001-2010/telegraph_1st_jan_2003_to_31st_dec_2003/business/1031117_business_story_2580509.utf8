 Monday, November 17, 2003 				 e-gov data repository on the cards
 															- from keyboard to chips, its a byte boom ALOKANANDA GHOSH				 	 the power of figures																								Calcutta, Nov. 16: The department of information technology plans to set up a central datawarehouse of information related to the e-governance initiatives of different state governments and is in talks with Oracle India for the same.																								The central datawarehouse or digital repository is like a central consolidated database that can be accessed by interested parties to extract information.																								The repository will act as a one-stop solution for government and quasi-government organisations and institutions seeking information on e-governance application models. Detailed study reports and various criteria for projects would also be included in the library, department of administrative reforms and public grievances director (IT) K. Jayakumar said.																								The department will seek endorsement from participants at the national seminar on e-governance to be held in Chennai from November 13 to 16.																								The central database will be accessible to states taking the e-governance plunge and will help them study the success models of various e-governance projects.																								Creating a repository will not be enough. It is also necessary to introduce quality standards for e-governance applications that all states have to adhere to. Service-level agreements between states will increase interaction and lead to exchange of ideas, said Jayakumar. 																								With a belief that e-governance will lead to good governance and finally benefit the common man, the department is gearing up to put a well-oiled mechanism in place. The first step will be to have a common platform for exchange of ideas.																								Jayakumar said, We have already decided on the investment roadmap for the next two years. Now we have to identify the issues and evolve strategies to resolve these issues. It will also be necessary to generate resources to support the strategies.																								The government plans to spend over Rs 12,410 crore in the next five years on information and communication related e-governance projects to bring about a transformation of the rural economy.

 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 New number plan with DoT
																								New Delhi, Dec. 29 (PTI): The department of telecommunications (DoT) is examining the proposals given by Trai on the numbering plan and will meet tomorrow to discuss the issue, IT and communications minister Arun Shourie said.																								DoT has received the recommendations on numbering change and they are being studied. Tomorrow we are meeting to discuss the issue, Shourie said.																								Last week, in its recommendations Trai had mooted a 10 digit numbering for WiLL phones going fully mobile.																								On the issue of compensation to the paging industry, Shourie said, I do not believe in compensation. Paging firms had met him recently and sought a financial package for revival.																								He said in February a financial package was being prepared for the paging industry but there were some difficulties in it.																								In fact, some of the proposed beneficiaries of that package had already wound up operations and it was not clear who the package should be given  whether it was to closed units or the existing players, he said.																								Referring to the issue that SMS service by cellular companies had killed the paging industry, he said, As technology changes, rapid movement of wave will wipe out the other. 																								I cannot give any assurance on any package to the paging industry, he said.																								On the numbering plan suggested by Trai, DoT is considering allotting the first two digits as operator codes apart from extending the implementation period of the numbering scheme to 30 days against Trais suggestion of 15 days, according to sources.

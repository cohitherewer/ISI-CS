 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Kinetic senior vice-president Ajay Kapila in Calcutta on Wednesday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Feb. 19: Kinetic Engineering plans to launch five new models of motorbikes next year in order to jack up sales volume.																								Kinetic senior vice-president Ajay Kapila said the company plans to add at least one new model every quarter during the next financial year.																								Two 165-cc models and one 115-cc model are already on the drawing board. Kapila said these three models will be launched in the next six months while two more models will come in the second half of next fiscal.																								With these launches, Kinetic is targeting a market share of 10 per cent in the next couple of years.																								The company intends to invest around Rs 75 crore on setting up a production line for these new models.																								Although the motorbike segment is very crowded now, growth is substantial. No other auto segment is growing as fast as the motorbike. This provides us the opportunity to grow in the Indian market in addition to the export potential, Kapila said.																								Kinetic, which launched its largest-selling model Boss only about eight months back, is expecting a sale of around 70,000 units in the current year. 																								Next years sales target is pegged at 250,000 units. 																								The Kinetic group registered a turnover of around Rs 1,200 crore last year while two-wheeler sales stood at around Rs 800 crore. According to Kapila, the earning from two-wheelers is poised to go up substantially in the current fiscal because of a surge in sales.																								To explore the rural and semi-urban markets, the company plans to add at least 300 new dealers to the current network of 1000. We are also beefing up the number of service stations, Kapila said.																								The company has launched a special variant of the Boss with added features because of the Cricket World Cup. Kapila said 5000 such vehicles would be manufactured and sold over the next two months.

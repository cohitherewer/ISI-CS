 Monday, June 23, 2003 				 EPF to hire investment consultants
																								New Delhi, June 22 (PTI): The Central Board of Trustees (CBT) of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is likely to appoint a leading consultant to analyse its investments, including those in Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI), which has asked for a rollover of high-interest bonds issued by it.																								We are in the process of appointing a consultant and talking to quite a few companies. The names will be shortlisted and a final decision taken soon, said sources in EPFO. 																								It is understood that EPFO had talks with some of the leading international consultants, including PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and Ernst and Young.																								The consultants will be entrusted with the job of studying the investment pattern of EPFO, including IFCIs request to accept a cut in interest rate on its non-SLR bonds to 9 per cent from the 13 per cent fixed earlier.

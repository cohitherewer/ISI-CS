The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, April 04, 2003 				 Bargain-hunters swoop down for a steal
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bliss at the bottom																								New Delhi, April 3: Shopaholics may be aware of factory seconds outlet for garments in their cities. But how about one for televisions, refrigerators and airconditioners?																								A bargain basement for consumer durables has just opened in the capital  arguably the first in the country  which will retail home appliances with that teeny-weeny, almost indiscernible defect that could be nothing more serious than chipped paint.																								The discount store for these products, known as Discount Circuit, has the support of seven well-known consumer durable companies  Philips, Thomson, Electrolux Kelvinator, Akai, Godrej, Sansui and Singer  that aim to provide an unparalleled value proposition to the customers. Many more companies are expected to join.																								Its an idea that should fire the customers imagination because this is one place where you could snap up discounts ranging between 15-50 per cent across all products, including consumer electronics, white goods, brown goods and appliances, computers, notebooks and mobile phones.																								For example, a fresh Digitron 6 kg washing machine of Electrolux Kelvinator that costs Rs 8,990 at your local electronics dealer will cost only Rs 6,050 due to some minor defect or surplus stock at this megamall.																								Similarly, an Akai television costing Rs 7,990 can cost as low as Rs 4,400 for the above mentioned reasons in this bargain bazaar.																								Okay, so wheres the catch? The products on offer are either slow-moving models that have been in the companys inventory for some time or those that have been slightly damaged in transhipment.																								So, if you arent too finicky about the model, you can go right ahead and snap up the bargain. And dont worry because the companies backing up their claims with the full warranty they give on the products sold through the regular channels. They are also prepared to throw in that annual maintenance contract.																								 Consumers who wish to buy branded products but are unwilling to pay high prices can now grab the opportunity of purchasing retail goods categorised as manufacturing surplus, excess or slow moving inventory and goods with minor cosmetic defaults from Discount Circuit, the megamall which occupies a sprawling 6,000 square feet at Okhla Industrial Area, Delhi.																								Speaking at the launch of the mall, Rajpal Singh Duggal, director, Discount Circuit, said: Retailing is the new business buzzword. Organised retailing leads to an efficient supply chain market. The size of this industry is approximately Rs 15,000 crore and it is growing at the rate of 10 per cent each year.

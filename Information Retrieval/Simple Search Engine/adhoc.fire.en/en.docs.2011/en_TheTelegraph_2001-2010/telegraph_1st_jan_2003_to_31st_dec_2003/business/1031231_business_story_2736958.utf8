 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Dollar still totters near record lows
 CHRISTINA FINCHER 																								London, Dec. 30 (Reuters): The dollar remained under fire on Tuesday, teetering near the previous days record low against the euro as pressure from low dollar yields and US current account deficit worries showed no sign of abating. 																								The euro, whose value against the dollar has risen nearly 20 percent this year, was also supported by a comment on Monday by the German government that it was not worried about the currencys strength and there was no reason to consider taking measures to counter it. 																								Germany is comfortable with the euros grind higher and there is nothing yet to cause a turn in the trend, said Trevor Dinmore, foreign exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank in London. 																								The euro hovered around $1.2500 at 3:45 a.m. EST, having reached an all-time high of $1.2511 on Monday. US consumer confidence, existing home sales and Midwest manufacturing data are due later in the session, but few expect much reprieve for the dollar. 																								While strong US numbers boost global recovery optimism, encouraging money to flow into higher growth regions such as Asia, weak figures reinforce expectations US interest rates will remain low, keeping dollar deposits unattractive for foreign investors. At the root of the dollars weakness is the fact that global capital is not flowing back to the US, said Kota Kimura, assistant forex manager at Shinkin Central Bank.

 Saturday, February 08, 2003 				 Ladybird to open up its kidswear wardrobe
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Feb. 7: Come April Indian kids will be bitten by the Ladybird bug. The huge range of kidswear from Ladybird, an international brand in kidswear promoted by the UK-based Woolworth Group, will be sold from 75 retail stores across the country.																								Woolworth has tied up with Mahindra Intertrade Limited (MIL) to sell its products in India. Mahindra Intertrade has also bagged the master license for the Saarc region.																								Woolworth has conducted a survey of the Indian market before launching its products. Customers are insisting on a broader choice, but are reluctant to pay designer prices for garments, says Simon Brown, international brand manager for Woolworth.																								The kidswear major will initially start with two exclusive outlets in the country. We have decided on Mumbai and are deciding between Calcutta and Delhi for the second location, said Parag S. Dani, head of marketing services for MIL. We decided to choose two divergent markets to understand consumer behaviour. MIL will set up 14 exclusive outlets over the next five years.																								We have trained four vendors who will design clothes for the Indian consumer and also help us offer the entire range at competitive prices, added Dani. 																								The Indian kidswear market is estimated at around Rs 2000 crore. The branded market, which Ladybird will cater to, is between Rs 200-300 crore.

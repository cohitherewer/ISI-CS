 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 IDBI rules out reverse merger
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the Mumbai-based state-run financial institution, today ruled out the reverse merger option with its retail banking unit, IDBI Bank or merger with any state-run bank.																								It was decided that IDBI would be run on a stand-alone basis and the merger proposal has been postponed as of now as we have enough resources to sustain for the next five years, said a top IDBI official after the institutions board meeting here.																								The reverse-merger option as well as merger with a leading state-run bank had assumed significance on the back of the governments go-ahead sign for the institution to acquire a banking licence. 																								The Standing Committee of Finance, constituted to study the IDBI Bill, which would enable IDBI to undertake retail banking operations, had recommended merger with its subsidiary IDBI Bank.																								IDBI currently holds 57 per cent equity in IDBI Bank while Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), co-promoter of IDBI Bank, holds a 14 per cent stake.																								The official said IDBI would focus on increasing its network of branches that would help it tap the retail sector. 																								We need a large network of branches to tap the retail sector as we are not getting merged with any bank...the focus is on branch expansion as currently there are only 37 branches, he added.																								Last November, the government had introduced the IDBI Act repeal bill which would enable it to undertake commercial banking activities but with prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India. The current IDBI Act does not come under the Banking Regulation Act.																								The bill makes special exemption with regard to priority sector loans, CRR amp; SLR parameters  parameters a scheduled commercial bank firmly follows as per the central banks guidelines. And, would also allow IDBI to function as a term lender to small, medium and large enterprises.																								We have applied to the Registrar of Companies, the official added.

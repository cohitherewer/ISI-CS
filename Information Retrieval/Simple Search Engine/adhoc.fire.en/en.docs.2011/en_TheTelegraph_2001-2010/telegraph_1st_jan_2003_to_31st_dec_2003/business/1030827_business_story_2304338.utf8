The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, August 27, 2003 				 In search of Bangla ally
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Aug. 26: Data Access India is scouting for a partner to commence operations in Bangladesh. The company has already obtained the licence to carry international traffic along with Reliance Communications and Bharti Telesonic.																								At present, the ILD traffic in the neighbouring country accounts for around 400 million minutes annually, which is 10 per cent of the Indian ILD traffic.																								We will invest around $ 3 million in setting up the infrastructure in Bangladesh, which will consist of a gateway at Dhaka or Chittagong, says managing director Siddhartha Ray. The single gateway will be connected to the companys remote access hub at London or Hong Kong. The hub will allow access to its capacity and handle incoming dial-up calls.																								Ray said Data Access would replicate the Sri Lankan model in Bangladesh. It has a 51:49 joint venture between Ceylinco and Data Access USA. 																								We are looking at revenues of $10 million per year from the new operations. Around 80 per cent of the traffic is inbound and costs $0.14 per minute, he said.

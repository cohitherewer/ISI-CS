 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 24: Nicholas Piramal, a leading pharmaceutical company, might set up a production facility in West Bengal, director Swati Piramal said.																								We could either increase the capacity of our existing units or set up a new factory. We are weighing the options and should be deciding which way to go in a couple of months. If the decision was to set up a new unit, it could be in West Bengal, she said.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya has been persuading Nicholas Piramal to invest in the state. He has met the companys chairman Ajay Piramal several times in the last few months.																								Whether or not we set up a new unit in the state, West Bengal continues to be the most important market for us outside Maharashtra for pathological and clinical research. We intend to expand in the east with Calcutta as our base in the region, she said.																								Nicholas Piramal has substantial investments in Drs Tribedi and Roy Diagnostic Laboratories, a pathological laboratory in Calcutta. It is aiming to take it to smaller towns in the state. The turnover of the laboratory has doubled in four years.																								We operate in the hub-and-spoke model, which means well have a main lab and satellite units close by. We could successfully implement that model in West Bengal with Drs Tribedi and Roy Diagnostic Laboratories, which has a tremendous reputation, she said.																								Nicholas Piramal holds around 80 per cent in the laboratory. It has similar ventures in Mumbai and Pune. It provides technology and infrastructure to all these laboratories, but does not manage them.																								We could also use Calcutta as our base for research  say in the fields of oncology and genetics, Piramal said. All these initiatives will be in partnership with local players.

 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 L amp;T turnover target on track
																								New Delhi, Nov. 26 (PTI): Engineering major Larsen and Toubro feels that despite the demerger of its cement division, it will be able to report a sales turnover of Rs 9,600 crore for 2003-04. It had clocked the same level of turnover last year.																								We hope to clock the same level of turnover in 2003-04 as that of the last fiscal, said J. P. Nayak, L amp;T president (operations) and member of the board.																								The gap in sales due to the demerger of its cement division, which contributed over Rs 2,200 crore to the sales in 2002-03, would be made up by enhanced revenue from overseas construction projects. Nayak also said the company aimed at touching the magic figure of Rs 10,000 crore sales by 2005.

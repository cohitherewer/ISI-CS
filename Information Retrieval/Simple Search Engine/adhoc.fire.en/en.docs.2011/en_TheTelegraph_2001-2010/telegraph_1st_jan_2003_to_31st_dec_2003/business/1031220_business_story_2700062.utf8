 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Zee tunes into HR revamp
 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, Dec. 19: Essel group chairman Subhash Chandra has kicked off an exercise across the group to assess capability and commitment of employees and also help find the right match for their talents.																								The exercise, a mix of internal communications and human capital development, has already commenced with media major Zee Telefilms (ZTL). Officials said the exercise would be extended to other group firms over a period of time. At Zee, Chandra is meeting all managers to assess talent and commitment.																								According to Ashish Kaul, vice-president (corporate brand development) of the Essel Group, External health of a corporation is nothing but a reflection of its internal health and to assess whether all of us are on the same wavelength, personal interactions are important.																								At Zee, which employs about 1100, Chandra is likely to meet about 800 employees personally.																								Chandras vision is to build an organisation where people are helped to find the right match for their talents. It is important for any organisation to have the same vision and commitment across the hierarchy, officials said.																								The company hopes that the drive will help create a positive corporate culture and talent will be turned into performance by focussing on the employees strengths. Sources added that in addition, ZTL and other group firms will have a frequent appraisal system.

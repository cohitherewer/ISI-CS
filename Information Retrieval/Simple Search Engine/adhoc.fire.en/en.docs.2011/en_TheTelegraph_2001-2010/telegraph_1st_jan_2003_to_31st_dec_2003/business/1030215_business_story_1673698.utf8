 Saturday, February 15, 2003 				 Call for mutual recognition of auditors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 14: PricewaterhouseCoopers today suggested that the new public company accounting oversight board of the US should mutually recognise other oversight bodies, including the one proposed in India.

The question is how to apply that. I think that they need to apply good judgement and mutually recognise other oversight bodies, including the peer review board in India, he added.

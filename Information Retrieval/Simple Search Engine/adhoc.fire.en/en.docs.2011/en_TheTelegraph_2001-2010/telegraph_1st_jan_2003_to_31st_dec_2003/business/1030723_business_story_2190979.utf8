 Wednesday, July 23, 2003 				 Pernod set to uncork Jacobs Creek
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 22: Liquor major Pernod Ricard is set to bring Jacobs Creek, one of Australias leading wines, into the country. 																								Liquor industry watchers say that Jacobs Creek is entering India at a time when the five-lakh cases annual wine market in India is poised for rapid growth. Recently, the ministry of food processing industry had sent a proposal to raise wine consumption in the country. 																								For the uninitiated, Jacobs Creek claim to fame includes the fact that it is the official supplier to Wimbledon for more than five years. A company spokesperson says about 3,00,000 glasses of Jacobs Creek are consumed at Wimbledon every year. 																								Bryan Fry, chief viticulturist for Jacobs Creek, whose main job is wine tasting, said, We are keen to introduce our wines in India. Jacobs Creek is ideal for the Indian wine lover because of its simplicity, richness of flavour and fresh taste. 																								The launch will be done by Orlando Wyndham, a wholly-owned arm of Pernod Ricard. MNC liquor company Seagram India will be doing the marketing and promotion of the brand.																								Initially, the product will not be available in the retail outlets, but only through servings in select restaurants and pubs. However, later the idea is to hit the retail outlets, said Fry. The company has identified Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Goa and Hyderabad as cities where wine has the maximum potential in India. 																								Since it will be sold as servings, prices will depend on the place where it is served.

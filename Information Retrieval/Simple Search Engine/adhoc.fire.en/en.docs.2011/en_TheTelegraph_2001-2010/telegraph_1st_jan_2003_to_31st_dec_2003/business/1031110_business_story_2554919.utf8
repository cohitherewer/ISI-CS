																								New Delhi, Nov. 9 (PTI): Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has said that it is prepared to build the Rs 12,400-crore Paradip Refinery by 2009-10 provided the Orissa government restores the tax concessions it had granted in August 1999.																								In case Orissa government restores 100 per cent sales tax incentives, IOC would endeavour to complete the project by 2009-10 taking into account the projected product availability in the medium term, the company has informed the government.																								Along with restoration of the original package of tax incentives from Orissa, IOC has also requested the removal of a five-year cap on exemption of entry tax on crude oil.

 Saturday, December 06, 2003 				 Regulator rips CSE apart
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 5: The Calcutta Stock Exchange may have long lost its relevance to the countrys capital markets, it could yet pose a systemic threat to the entire securities market, according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).																								The securities market regulator toppled the governing board on Thursday and instated an administrator to manage the beleaguered bourse for one year. In a hard-hitting criticism of the exchanges administration, Sebi points out a series of serious lapses that, it says, could threaten the integrity of the countrys capital markets.																								Admittedly, the operational management (of the exchange) is weak, if not virtually absent. Extremely critical deficiencies (and financial vulnerability) expose (CSEs) system to abuse. An exchange with such vulnerabilities can pose a systemic threat to the entire securities market and to investors, Sebi says in its order, the full text of which was made public today.																								The 34-page discourse on the exchanges inept management starts with a description of the software snags. For years, the exchange has not had any defined policy on data restoration or IT security. Even the anti-virus software installed on its server was outdated, Sebi points out amongst a series of gross deficiencies. The bourse had engaged Ernst amp; Young to conduct a systems audit  or a thorough scrutiny of its technology platform. The exercise revealed that its decrepit software platform had to be revamped thoroughly, but the exchanges management was lax in adopting the corrective measures, says Sebi.																								The market regulator then deals with the financial crisis facing the exchange. It posted a loss of Rs 4.01 crore in the financial year ended March 2001, and in the nine months till December 2002, it registered a loss of Rs 2.02 crore. Its losses are widening and in the current financial year, the exchange might not be able to meet operating costs, say insiders. Sebi chides the exchange for not being able to replenish the settlement guarantee fund  or the corpus that it used up to meet the Rs 120-crore payment shortfall in March 2001.																								Sebi says the public representative directors and the elected members of the CSE board were sharply divided and meetings were marked by acrimonious exchanges. It led to such a situation that decisions could not be taken and even Sebi guidelines could not be implemented. The market regulator even questions the physical fitness of P. K. Ray, the secretary of the bourse.

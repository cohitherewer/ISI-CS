 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Ministry readies bill to reserve orders for SSIs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Thakur: Small wonders																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: The cabinet is likely to consider a draft law that will make it mandatory for the government sector to reserve up to a quarter of all its purchases for the small-scale sector. 																								The government sector, which includes the public sector, central and state governments, purchase goods and services from the market worth nearly Rs 1,50,000 crore a year. A 25 per cent slice of this market translates into a Rs 40,000 crore market, huge by any stretch of imagination. 																								Minister for SSIs C. P. Thakur said, I have circulated this bill to other ministries and will be bringing it before cabinet for approval soon. Legally, this is compatible with World Trade Organisation provisions on competition and many nations, including the US, have adopted such laws.																								The proposed purchase reservation law will be the cornerstone of his bid to protect this sector which is facing closure in most states. It is likely to be one of the showcase items that the BJP leaders will tout at election meetings to party supporters who mostly come from the small business, urban white collar worker class, which has been hit adversely by the creeping sickness devouring the sector. 																								An alarming 14 per cent of the sector is already sick, according to statistics compiled by Thakurs ministry, while another nearly 8 per cent have been described as incipient sick units whose output has been declining every year. West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar top the states in the number of shut SSIs. 																								Thakur also said he planned to call a meeting of chief ministers of these states, Orissa and the northeast, where chief executives of PSU banks would also be called to work out a revival package for the small industry sector in these states. 																								The BJP rank and file had in fact been demanding measures to protect the SSI sector as it employs 20 million people mostly in urban conglomerates where the party has a strong support base. 																								The SSI purchase law, which will be introduced in the winter session of Parliament, will not mention any reservation percentages, but merely set the principle allowing. We will announce the reservation percentage through notifications in consultation with other ministries, SSI ministry officials said. 																								Thakur said, De-reservation (opening up of product lines exclusively reserved for the small sector to big businesses) is happening. The WTO compact has forced India to open up these very sectors to imports. We are staggering the opening so that the small-scale sector has some degree of protection, but it is inevitable. Though he didnt say it, this law might be the only way of preserving the approximately 3.5 million small factories spread all over the country.

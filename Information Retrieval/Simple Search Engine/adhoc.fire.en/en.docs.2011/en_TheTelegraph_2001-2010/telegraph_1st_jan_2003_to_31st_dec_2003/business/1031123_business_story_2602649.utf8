 Sunday, November 23, 2003 				 All clear for Reliance as Flag, Pivotal call off talks
																								New Delhi, Nov. 22 (PTI): Flag Telecom and Pivotal Pvt Equity, the company which had offered to acquire the former at a price higher than that quoted by Reliance, have mutually decided not to pursue their discussions, clearing the way for Reliance to acquire Flag Telecom for $207 million.																								In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Flag Telecom group said, Flag, after taking into account the agreement and plan of amalgamation with Reliance on October 16, and Pivotal, after taking into account its defined investment parameters, mutually determined not to pursue further discussions with respect to transaction between the parties.																								Flag had a market capital of $7 billion at its peak and has laid submarine cables of around 50,000 km across the globe and has hubs in the West Asia and the US.																								The companys network spans four continents and has presence in Asia, Europe, West Asia and the US. 																								Flag, a bandwidth company, had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 last year, and had successfully come out of the filing. 																								Earlier this week, Pivotal Private Equity had expressed its willingness to acquire Flag Cable system for not less than $220 million or $110 per share for 20 lakh outstanding shares of flag.																								Pivotals offer came just days after Reliance Gateway Net, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Infocomm, proposed to acquire the entire equity stake in the Nasdaq-listed Flag Telecom group for $207 million (about Rs 1,000 crore). 																								Flag Telecoms board had subsequently met to discuss Pivotals offer and informed the SEC that Pivotals proposal constituted an offer that was expected to be superior one.

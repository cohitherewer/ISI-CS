 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 21: Mahindra amp; Mahindra, the utility vehicle and tractor maker, has decided to bid for Valtra  the Finnish maker of high horse-power tractors.																								The board of directors of Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) today decided to submit an offer for acquiring the tractor business of Valtra in Finland and Brazil, a notice to the stock exchanges said. 																								The acquisition of Valtras tractor businesses would help M amp;M broaden its product portfolio since the Finnish company makes high horse power tractors while M amp;M is focused on mid-end tractors. 																								Valtra, analysts say, will help M amp;M get a toehold in Europe and the US. The deal will help M amp;M bring in advanced technology in tractors manufacturing at a time when John Deere and Ford New Holland are making their presence felt in India.																								Valtras net sales in 2002 was 762 million (Rs 3,886 crore), and the company had 2,508 employees, including 1,541 in Finland and 710 in Brazil.

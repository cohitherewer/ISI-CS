 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Centre weighs share-cap waiver in SBI associates
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Dec. 29: The finance ministry will take about a month to respond to a request from State Bank of Indias (SBI) for lifting the ceiling on the number of shares investors are allowed to hold in its associate banks.																								We are currently going through their proposal and we will let them know in a month, ministry officials said.																								Banking stock analysts feel that SBI wants to take advantage of the present stock market boom. This will be achieved if the cap on the number of shares is waived.																								Currently, the equity holding for both the individual investor and companies in these associates is capped at 200 shares per investor. As per the existing legislation, these shares cannot even be converted to the demat form, a bank official said.																								Sources close to the development said the countrys largest bank had written to the finance ministry requesting a change in this legislation, especially in the context of the proposed amendments to the SBI Act, which is currently under review.																								SBI has seven associate banks with controlling interest ranging from 75 per cent to 100 per cent. These include State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Indore, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Saurashtra and State Bank of Travancore.																								Of these, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore and State Bank of Travancore are listed on the stock exchanges. Some of the banks unlisted associates are also thinking of tapping the primary market shortly. 																								A senior SBI official said, It is expected that the ministry will look into this along with other issues relating to banking sector reforms.																								The existing ceiling on ownership rights was fixed mainly to prevent an individual or a corporate to have a large stake in these banks. Moreover, when these legislations were formed, none of the associate banks were listed.																								Due to ownership restrictions, there has not been any interest in the stocks of these banks from market players.																								Once the ceiling is lifted, market interest in the three listed associates is likely to increase. The liquidity in the shares of these banks would also increase, said a market analyst. 																								SBIs associate banks have an all-India presence with a strong regional network and a consistent track record of profitability.

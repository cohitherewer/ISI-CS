 Saturday, March 29, 2003 				 Nasscom to help visa victims
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 28: The software industry isnt spooked yet by the latest incident involving i-flex Solutions, whose chief has been arrested in London while the companys software engineers are being thrown out of the Netherlands for visa irregularities.																								The i-flex case is the latest in a series of incidents around the world that have reinforced the suspicion that Indian software industry personnel are no longer being welcomed with open arms in the industrialised west.																								The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), the apex forum representing the interests of software and services companies, has taken up the i-flex case with the authorities in India and abroad. It has expressed outrage at the ill-treatment meted out to the i-flex engineers (who have been given seven days to leave the Netherlands) and also demanded the immediate release of Senthil Kumar, the i-flex chief, who is being held in London.																								In December last year, Nasscom had actively lobbied the government to press for the release of the Polaris Software chief executive officer Arun Jain, who was arrested by the Indonesian government when a contract that the software company was executing for an Indonesian bank  Bank Artha Graha  went sour.																								Nasscom today reiterated its decision to take up this issue with the government and at global platforms such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to prevent any such future occurrences.																								Bail hearing next week																								Meanwhile, the bail application of Senthil Kumar will come up for hearing in a London court on Wednesday, reports PTI.																								Senthil, who was detained yesterday, is now currently lodged in Brixton prison in south-west London.																								According to official sources, the police had given Kumar the option to go to the Netherlands and face charges there since his company was bound by the European Commission regulations but he opted to fight it out here.

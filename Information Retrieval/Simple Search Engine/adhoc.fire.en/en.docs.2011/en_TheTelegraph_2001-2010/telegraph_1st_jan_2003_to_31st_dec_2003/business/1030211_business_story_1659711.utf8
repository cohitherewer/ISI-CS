 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 10: SSI Ltd today announced that it will acquire 27.18 per cent promoters stake in IT training major, Aptech Ltd, at a price of Rs 49.75 per share and follow it with an open offer that would raise its stake to 47 per cent in the company. SSI will purchase over 49.32 lakh shares for a consideration of Rs 24.5 crore.																								The deal displays consolidation in the IT training arena. The education and training business of SSI Ltd will be integrated with Aptech within 12 months.																								This acquisition will consolidate the significant synergies between SSI and Aptech, said Kalpathi Suresh, chairman and CEO of SSI.

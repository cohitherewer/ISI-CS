The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Star Paper owner sells 10%
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Goenka: Selling spree																								Calcutta, Dec. 12: The promoters of Star Paper Mills, G. P. Goenka and his family, pared their holding by 15 lakh shares, or 10.2 per cent of the companys equity capital, earlier this week.																								Goenka and his family now hold 54.47 per cent of Star Papers shares as against a peak holding of 64.67 per cent. Star Paper told stock exchanges, ISG Traders, an investment firm owned by the promoters, sold the shares in two days  on December 9 and 10.																								Star Papers chairman Goenka said the sale was aimed at increasing the liquidity of the companys shares. Certain class of investors wouldnt touch shares of Star Paper for want of liquidity. The promoters and institutions jointly held close to 80 per cent of Star Papers 1.56 crore shares until Goenka offloaded 15 lakh shares.																								Though Goenka maintained that the shares were sold in the market and the identity of the buyers not known yet, market aficionados said the shares were offloaded through negotiated deals. Its impossible to sell such a large number of shares of Star Paper in two days without identifying buyers beforehand.																								Investors who bought these shares will probably be known when the company discloses its share-ownership details at the end of the December-quarter.																								The market sees in the share-sale an indication of Star Papers plans to raise capital through placement of shares. Asked whether it was a possibility, Goenka said: I dont rule it out.																								The company is in need of cash for capital expenditure, and we are considering various ways of raising money. We could borrow, issue shares, or do both. I expect to firm up plans within a few weeks, he added.																								Star Paper has significantly improved its performance this year. Till September, it earned Rs 3.88 per share, as against a full-year EPS of Rs 4.50 in 2002-03. Profit in the half year was Rs 6.06 crore compared with Rs 7.02 crore for the whole of 2002-03.

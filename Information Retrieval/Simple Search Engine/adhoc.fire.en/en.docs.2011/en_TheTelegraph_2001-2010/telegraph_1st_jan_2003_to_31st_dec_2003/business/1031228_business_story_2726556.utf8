The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Assam Company gets feelers from foreigners 
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Heady concoction																								Calcutta, Dec. 27: Companies from the UK, the US, Canada and Japan have approached city-based Assam Company Limited (ACL) for setting up tea bars in those countries.																								ACL has developed a unique concept of tea bars under the brand name Camellia tea bar. Arun Grover , deputy chief marketing officer (marketing and strategy) said, Franchisee interests have come in from UK, New York, Canada and Japan to set up the bars or tea rooms as they call it.																								 Camellia Tea Bar was launched by Assam Company with the objective of repositioning tea. A totally non-alcoholic based bar, it re-emphasises the fat that tea can be made exciting, youthful, trendy and yet healthy.																								ACL has also drawn up plans to float a new subsidiary for the Camellia tea bar business and develop it into a separate profit centre.																								ACL has already launched Camellia tea bars in Calcutta. The company launched a tea bar last week at the Tea Centre in Mumbai. The bar within the Tea Centre would give it a younger profile apart form the dedicated clientele that it already enjoys. ACLs single estate and blended teas is also retailed from the Tea Bazaar at the Tea Centre.																								Extending into more outlets in Mumbai is certainly on the cards, Grover said.																								Talking about the future plans for Camellia Tea Bar he said that Camellia Tea Bar would roll out to premium and out of home consumption points- shopping malls, clubs, health clubs. Pune, Goa and Delhi would be next on the priority launch list, he added.																								Apart form the companys branded bulk business, it has products and blends available at premium stores, such as Harrods, Fortnum amp; Mason, Selfridges and Claridges.																								Over a period of time the company wishes to move out of the commodity sensitive arena. Branding and lifestyle positioning in retail formats has already become a key thrust area. Quite clearly, Assam Company is looking towards the value-added business as individual profit centres for fuelling future quality growth, he said.																								Until six years back, the rate of growth in domestic consumption was three per cent. However, due to the diversion of the beverage drinking consumer, there has been a shift towards aerated drinks, coffee and to some extent, bottled water. The current estimated rate of growth is now, therefore, closer to 1.8 per cent, thus leading to a decline in overall absolute domestic consumption.																								The company has planned to issue equity shares on a rights basis to generate capital for the expansion plans of the Camellia Tea Bar business. The total paid-up equity of the company is Rs 22.39 crore.																								The Jajodia-controlled firm plans to issue one share for every five shares held by the existing shareholders. The company is in talks with leading merchant bankers for the proposed rights issue and intends to finalise one within a couple of days.

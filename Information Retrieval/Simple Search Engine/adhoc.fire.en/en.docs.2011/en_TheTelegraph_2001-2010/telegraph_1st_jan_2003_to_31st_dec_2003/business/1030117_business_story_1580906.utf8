 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 Microsoft gets 120 days to ship Java
																								Baltimore, Jan. 16 (AP): Microsoft Corp will have 120 days to release a version of Sun Microsystems Java programming language for Windows after a Federal judge issues his formal order against the software giant.																								US district judge J. Frederick Motz set that schedule on Wednesday during a lengthy hearing with lawyers from both the companies. 																								Sun had sought a 90-day period, while Microsoft wanted a three-phase approach that would have extended over 180 days.																								Microsoft will have to release a version of Windows XP Service Pack 2 with Java.																								I want to provide the incentive to get this done, Motz said. He said Microsoft could request additional time for its Java work later, with a good reason.																								Motz also rescinded two orders he made last week to dismiss two of Suns claims in its lawsuit against Microsoft.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jaswant: Cold shoulder																								Calcutta, Dec. 21: Finance minister Jaswant Singh has rejected the domestic tea industrys proposal to provide funds worth Rs 150 crore towards social cost that the sector has to bear. Sources said Singh had communicated this decision to the industry at a meeting held recently in Delhi.																								The inter-ministerial group, set up to look into the social cost issue, had pegged it at Rs 592 crore and suggested that the Centre and states should shoulder 50 per cent of the total social cost to house, cure and feed plantation workers. 																								The group had suggested that the Centre will bear 40 per cent of the social cost, states 10 per cent and the remaining 50 per cent will be shouldered by the tea industry.																								The social cost in the north Indian tea industry is Rs 459.97 crore, which is about Rs 7.17 per kg of made tea. The social cost in the south is Rs 132 crore, which is about Rs 3.96 per kg of made tea. The tea industry employs around a million people.																								Social cost includes medical, housing, education, fuel, drinking water, childcare and creches, sanitation, roads and highly subsidised rations for workers.																								The social cost fund is necessary for us. The finance ministrys decision is a major setback to the industry, an industry official said.																								The industry had been clamouring for the social cost fund for quite some time now. The social cost, along with the wages of the workers, have gone up substantially over the years. But the productivity has not increased. This has resulted in higher cost of production. However, the prices of tea have declined sharply over the years. This has affected the bottomlines of the tea companies in the past four years, the official added.																								The inter-ministerial group has also suggested that the tea-producing states should review the high agricultural income tax imposed on the industry.

 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 ITC sells edible oil plant to Adani group
 ANIEK PAUL																								Calcutta, Dec. 30: ITC is selling its edible oil processing plant in Mantralayam, Andhra Pradesh, to Adani Wilmar  a 50:50 joint venture between Adani Exports and Wilmar Holdings of Singapore  for Rs 21 crore.																								Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani said: It is true that we are looking at the plant seriously, but the deal hasnt been concluded. Sudip Bandopadhyay, ITCs head of treasury, who was mandated by the board to sell the plant confirmed the deal, but refused to divulge details.																								A memorandum of understanding between the two companies for the sale is believed to have been signed. Sources familiar with the deal, however, said the amount would be paid over a year  Rs 5 crore up front, and the rest in three equal instalments of Rs 5.33 crore each.																								Though ITC exited the edible oils business in 1996, selling its controlling stake in ITC Agro Tech  its erstwhile food business subsidiary  to ConAgra Foods of the US, it continues to own the plant.																								After withdrawing from the edible oil business, ITC leased out the plant to Agro Tech Foods (the new name of ITC Agro Tech), which is a subsidiary of ConAgra now.																								Virginia Houses arrangement with Agro Tech ended last year, when the latter broke off the lease agreement by paying a compensation of Rs 43 crore. This, too, is being paid in instalments over five years till 2007. Agro Tech, too, had offered to acquire the plant, but Virginia House was not impressed with the price it quoted.

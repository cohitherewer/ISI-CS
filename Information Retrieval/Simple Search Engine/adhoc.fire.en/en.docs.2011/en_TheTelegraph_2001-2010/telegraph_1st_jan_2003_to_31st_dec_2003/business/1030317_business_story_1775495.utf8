The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, March 17, 2003  Business Briefs																								 New Delhi, March 16: The rate of inflation fell 0.22 per cent to 4.69 per cent for the week ended March 1. It might give a breather to the government, but skyrocketing prices of petrol, diesel and lubricants will hit the industry and commoners hard. The point-to-point price change, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), fell from the previous weeks level of 4.91 per cent, though it remained at a mere 1.95 per cent in the year-ago period. The WPI rose by 0.4 per cent to 169.6 during the latest reported week from the previous weeks figure of 168.9 due to a sharp increase in domestic fuel prices and marginal hike in primary articles, even as manufactured products prices stood firm. The index was 162 in the year-ago period.

South Asia Regional Fund has acquired 21.39 lakh shares of the company, of which 4.4 lakh shares were bought from the custodian appointed by the Special Court dealing with the securities scam in the early nineties.

These are Swaraj Engines, Swaraj Mazda and Swaraj Automotives. Swaraj Engines and Swaraj Mazda are profit-making companies in which Punjab Tractors holds 33 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.																								The latter is a joint venture with the Sumitomo Corporation and Mazda of Japan. The two Japanese companies together hold 26 per cent of Swaraj Mazdas shares.

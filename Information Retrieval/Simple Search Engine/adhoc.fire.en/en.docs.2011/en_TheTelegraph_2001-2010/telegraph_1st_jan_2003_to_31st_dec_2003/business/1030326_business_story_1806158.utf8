 Wednesday, March 26, 2003 				 Sony eyes 10% share in colour TV market
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 25: Sony India is charting an aggressive strategy for India with its premium colour televisions (CTVs). The company aims to grab a 10 per cent share of the colour television market in the next three years and has wants to clock a turnover of Rs 1,500 crore by 2005-06.																								To pilot this strategy, Sony has chosen Keichi Sakamoto (legendary Sony founder Akio Moritas personal assistant) as the new managing director, who will replace Teruo Ishii from April 1.																								Elaborating on his plans for the Indian market, Sakamoto said: My target is to achieve 10 per cent market share in CTV in the next three years. I believe it is possible as I have achieved this in my previous experiences in Canada and New Zealand.																								The companys focus would be on retailing of consumer products during the next fiscal, he added. 																								Unruffled by other Korean majors, LG and Samsung in cornering significant market share, Sony said it plans to stick to the premium-end Flat CTV segment. 																								The company is planning to double its advertisement outlay to Rs 4 crore in 2003-04 compared with the previous fiscal, mainly to showcase its Sony World range of showrooms in India.																								Sony World, projected as the companys flagship stores, contributes to 11.5 per cent of the companys turnover, Ishii added. With the latest addition, we expect our turnover to increase to 15 per cent in 2004. With an addition of another 22 stores by 2005, Sonys turnover will increase by over 20 per cent. Sony would peddle its recent product, Play Stations, through Sony Select. It also plans to launch computer laptop Sony Vaio next year.

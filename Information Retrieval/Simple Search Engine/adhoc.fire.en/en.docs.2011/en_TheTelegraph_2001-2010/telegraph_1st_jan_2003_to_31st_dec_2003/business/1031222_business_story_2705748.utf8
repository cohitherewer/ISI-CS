 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Global wine majors raise a toast to India 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Connoisseurs choice																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: Wine makers from the world over, especially those from Europe and Australia, are eyeing what they consider to be a greenfield market in India.																								Signalling this interest, country-level participation from France, Italy and Australia, apart from the US and other European countries, is being held in the upcoming India Food amp; Wine Show from January 8 to 10 in New Delhi.																								Taj Palace hotel is a partner to the show and it is supported by the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India (FHRAI).																								The domestic wine industry is growing at a rate of 30 per cent, which is much ahead of hard liquors like whisky, which is growing only at about 5-7 per cent. Of course, the base of wine consumption is nascent, Lotus Exhibitions and Marketing Services CEO Rajiv Malhotra said.																								Lotus Exhibitions is co-organising the show along with Veronafaire  one of the premier trade fair organisations in Italy. The show will provide an opportunity for the wine makers form the world over to showcase their products and sign business deals with importers. Business tie-ups with Indian wine makers is also possible, Malhotra said.																								The wine market is small at just 250,000 cases, when contrasted with the whisky market which stands at some 55 million cases. However, the market is expected to grow at a scorching pace once it is opened up to cheaper varieties of foreign wines. Most wine producers are not looking at current numbers but at the future potential. 																								European wine firms believe the growing middle class with its increasing disposable income and changed aspirational tastes mean the Indian market holds immense potential for them in the future. 																								Cutty Sark has identified India, Brazil and China as its largest future markets for both its scotch and wine.																								There are Belgian wines which retail for just Rs 90, even at 100 per cent duty. These could sell here for under Rs 200, if the government agrees to reduce the countervailing duty to zero, said Ramesh Mani, director, business development for the Indian subcontinent for Cutty Sark.

 Sunday, May 18, 2003  Business Briefs Mumbai, May 17: Indias foreign exchange  reserves continued to scale new heights and crossed the  $ 78-billion mark following record inflows during the week  ended May 9. Foreign exchange reserves rose sharply by $  961 million to touch $ 78,559 million in the reporting week,  according to the Reserve Banks weekly statistical supplement  released today. Foreign currency assets also rose sharply  by $ 959 million at $ 75,164 million. The rise is mainly  due to fresh inflows and revaluation of non-US currencies,  including the euro, against the US dollar, analysts said.  The RBI said while gold reserves remained static at $ 3,368  million, special drawing rights grew by two million to $  6 million during this period.

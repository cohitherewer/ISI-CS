 Thursday, November 13, 2003 				 Check in at Marriott counter for best room rates 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Mumbai, Nov. 12: Next time  you travel, you wont have to shop for the best room rates  on the Net or pore over fat catalogues for hours. 																								Leading hospitality firm Marriott is introducing a hotel reservation link from January 1 next year, which, the company claims, will provide the best available room rates in about 2,500 hotels the world over.																								If a customer books through Marriotts reservation channel, either directly or through the internet, and finds a lower publicly-available rate within 24 hours for the same hotel, room type and dates, the hotel would match the lower rate and give an additional 25 per cent off, the global hospitality firm said in a release here.																								Under its look no further; best rate guarantee scheme, Marriott said it was the first major lodging company to offer a comprehensive rate guarantee beyond the internet.																								Samir Daqqaq, vice-president of Marriott global sales office in West Asia, Africa and sub-continent, said that the guarantee will ensure that all customers have equal access to the best available room rates. 																								This is a significant difference between Marriott and other major lodging companies, which offer Internet-only guarantees or web-only rates. Such rates create a disadvantage for travellers who prefer to book through traditional channels, such as travel agents, telephone reservations centres or directly with the hotel, he said.																								This guarantee by the hospitality major comes at a time when its presence in India is set to grow next year with the makeover of the 168-room Viceroy Hotel to the 308-room Hyderabad Marriott. The hotel will be the fifth Marriott property in India.																								Currently, the Marriott lodging brand is represented in India by the 371-room JW Marriott Hotel in Mumbai, the 153-room Goa Marriott Resort and the 286-room New Delhi Marriott. It also consists of the 286-room Renaissance Mumbai Hotel among others.																								The companys research showed that travellers spent as much as half-a-day shopping to find the best room rates and a majority of them did not make hotel reservations on the internet.																								Marriott operates and franchises hotels under its name, besides known chains like Ritz-Carlton, Rennaissance, Ramada International, Residence Inn and JW Marriott.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Tata move to dilute stake in Haldia Petro
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 Quit call 																								Calcutta, Aug. 12: After protracted negotiations with the Bengal government on ways to leave Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL), the Tatas have finally sought the approval of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) to transfer their shares to the state government.																								The shares will be transferred to the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC)  one of the major promoters of the Rs 5,170-crore petrochem company.																								However, the Tatas will not offload the entire 14 per cent stake in HPL. They will retain 4 per cent in the company. This 4 per cent stake would be transferred to the groups holding entity  Tata Sons. Currently, the stake is held by Tata Engineering and Tata Power, which have nothing to do with petrochemicals.																								HPL sources said, The Tatas are keen to get a premium on their shares. However, they are also open to the idea of offloading their stake in the company at the face value. The negotiation on the price is currently on.																								The move by the Tatas will expedite the process of corporate debt restructuring.																								The offloading by the Tatas will pave the way for Gail India, to pick up a 10 per cent stake in the company at an investment of Rs 200 crore, sources added.																								HPL chairman Tarun Das had earlier said that Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata group, would join the HPL board once the debt restructuring was in place.																								The Tatas have invested Rs 180 crore in HPL so far. They want to exit the company because petrochemicals is a non-core business for the group.																								IDBI officials said, Share transfer is one of the key issues necessary to initiate the process of corporate debt restructuring. Who owns what in the company is crucial for the restructuring. Once that is achieved, then changes in the stakes of existing shareholders can be sorted out. The Tatas have sought our approval and we are working on it, they added.																								According to the debt restructuring proposal submitted to IDBI, there will be a fresh infusion of Rs 468 crore. Out of this, Rs 268 crore will come from Purnendu Chatterjee of The Chatterjee Group. The remaining Rs 200 crore will come from the Tatas.																								Following the infusion of Rs 268 crore, the Chatterjee groups holding in the company will change, IDBI officials said.																								The current equity of HPL is Rs 1,153 crore. The Bengal government has put in Rs 540 crore while TCG and the Tatas have pumped in Rs 433 crore and Rs 180 crore respectively.																								The total debt burden of the company is to the tune of Rs 4,200 crore with IDBI having the largest exposure in the company.

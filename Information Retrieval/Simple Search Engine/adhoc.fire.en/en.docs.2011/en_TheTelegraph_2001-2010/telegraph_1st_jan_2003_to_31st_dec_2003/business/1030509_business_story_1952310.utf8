 Friday, May 09, 2003 				 Tata Tele joins the tariff war
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 8: Tata Teleservices, a private telecom service provider offering fixed-line and limited mobility services, today reduced domestic long-distance call charges terminating on its own network. The company, a unit of the countrys second-largest business group, the Tatas, said it has cut rates by nearly 20 per cent to Rs 4 a minute for calls terminating beyond 500 km.																								However, a call made between Tata Teles fixed-line and limited-mobility operations, would be charged at Rs 3.60 a minute for distances more than 500 km. But fixed-line long distance call between its own network, for distances more than 500 km, has not been reduced and would continue to attract Rs 4.80 a minute. 																								Earlier, a long-distance call used to attract a flat rate of Rs 4.80 a minute. The rate-cuts come after some of the private cellular companies reduced long distance cellular-to-cellular calls to a flat rate of Rs 1.99 a minute.																								Tata Teleservices currently offers the limited mobility or wireless-in-local-loop (WiLL) services, based on the CDMA technology, in six states  Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra. It offers the WiLL services under the brand name of Tata Indicom.																								At present, there are four monthly rental packages for Tata Indicom subscribers  Rs 295, Rs 450, Rs 599 and Rs 999. For these packages a certain number of free outgoing calls are given.

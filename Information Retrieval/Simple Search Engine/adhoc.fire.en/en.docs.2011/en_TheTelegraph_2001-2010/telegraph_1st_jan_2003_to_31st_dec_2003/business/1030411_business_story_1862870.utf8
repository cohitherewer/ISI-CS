 Friday, April 11, 2003 				 Fewer free calls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 10: Announcing the new telephone tariffs, state-owned MTNL and BSNL tonight slashed by more than half the number of free calls, retained the three-minute pulse for local calls and kept unchanged the overall monthly rentals.																								BSNL slashed free calls for urban users from 75 to 30 calls per month and for rural users to 50 calls per month.																								The new rates will be effective from May 1.																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), while raising the monthly rental for landline phones from Rs 250 to Rs 280 for urban users, had reduced the number of free calls from 60 to 30 every month, as part of the standard package.																								On the other hand, the regulator had exempted rural subscribers from any hike in rental while lowering the free calls from 75 to 50 a month. 																								The existing three-minute pulse for local calls for a landline telephone to landline telephones within a radius of up to 50 kilometres has been retained. 																								While, the tariff package approved by the regulator allows BSNL to bring down the rate long distance calls beyond 200-kilometres from Rs 4.80 per minute to Rs 2.40 per minute and this would be available to all customers including the non-STD customers by dialling 95 code.

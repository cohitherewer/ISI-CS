 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 17: Reliance Industries has submitted a proposal to the Bengal government for setting up a 150-MW power plant in Haldia.																								Lakshman Seth, member of Parliament and chairman of the Haldia Development Authority (HDA), said: Reliance has sent a proposal to HDA for setting up the power plant. We have also received another proposal from the Andhrabased Sanghi group, which is keen to set up the plant. The power generated will be used by industrial consumers.																								Seth was speaking at an interactive session organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry here.																								On infrastructure development in Haldia, Seth said the passing of the Electricity Bill 2001 has made it easier for private companies to set up power plants. We are expecting a detailed project report from the company, he said.																								The proposed greenfield power project is part of Reliances expansion plans announced in 2000-01. Reliance has set a target of achieving a generation capacity of 10,000 MW within the next five to 10 years. The company has been chasing this objective through Reliance Power and through the proposed acquisition of distribution firm BSES Ltd.																								HDA has worked out a perspective plan for 2025 to develop Haldia into a full-fledged satellite township. The authority, which is an autonomous body controlled by the state government, is currently working on a five-year plan (2002-2007).

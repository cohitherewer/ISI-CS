 ALOKANANDA GHOSH				 	 Buzz gets louder																								Calcutta, Dec. 14: The Indian Cellular Association (ICA) has suggested that mobile handsets be classified as declared goods under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. The plea is part of its pre-budget recommendations.																								In a letter to the finance minister Jaswant Singh, ICA president Pankaj Mohindroo said: It will benefit the industry and customers if mobile handsets are categorised as goods of national importance and accordingly put on the list of declared goods under section 14 of CST Act.																								Moreover, the apex body has recommended that the existing procedures of putting MRP stickers before release by the Customs. This involves massive amount of administrative work. After the removal of CVD, the practice is now superfluous, says Mohindroo.																								Other revisions suggested include removal of the 4 per cent special additional duty (SAD) and retaining the exemption on countervailing duty (CVD) and excise duty. The exemption on components, parts, spares and accessories from customs, CVD and SAD should be continued.																								We are recommending a duty structure of 5 per cent customs, and abolition of other duties from the composite customs duty of 14.4 per cent, Mohindroo sums up.																								ICA estimates that the customs duty earned from 200407 in the revised scenario will be Rs 59333 million as against Rs 57757 million in the present tax structure.																								The rate of depreciation on mobile cellular handsets, spares, components and accessories is 25 per cent, says Mohindroo. Obsolescence is much faster in handsets compared to computers. We recommend a depreciation rate of 100 per cent.																								ICA estimates that the government will earn a total additional revenue, including incremental revenue share, Rs 51720 million in the revised scenario.

K. Choudhury, managing director of rating firm Icra, said, This range of services would cover more or less the entire gamut of financial sector. 																								The commercial banks would have quite a few options to enhance their fund-based as well as fee-based revenue streams leveraging their branch network, knowledge and skill sets and considerable amount of resources a their disposal, he added.

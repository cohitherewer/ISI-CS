 Thursday, September 11, 2003 				 Bombay Dyeing gets ready to don recast attire
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Wadia: Makeover time																								Mumbai, Sept. 10: Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Ltd is all set to carve a niche in the market for its range of textile products, an attempt that may result in a revamping of its leading brands.																								The company today presented a new range of home linen collection carrying the tag line  Bring Style Home. This segment, in which Bombay Dyeing has a strong brand equity, plays a crucial role in filling the companys coffers. Maureen Wadia announced the makeover to the new range. She was accompanied by her son, deputy managing director Ness Waida and managing director Ninu Khanna.																								The company has launched a campaign taking a cue from its earlier market-driven strategies. It has mandated St Lukes with the task of revamping the home linen brand to sport an international and premium quality look.																								Officials said the objective behind the new tag line for its media campaign was to regain a position of eminence. We are not mere sellers of bedsheets and towels, but an international quality, lifestyle brand, an official said.																								According to Maureen Wadia, the new campaign addresses the new age consumer that is on the rise. It spells how Bombay Dyeing is keeping abreast with the consumers needs and wants, she said.																								Ness Wadia said the company would bring to the consumer what he wanted. We are on a path of consolidation and growth, he added.																								Vivaldi, the companys apparel brand, will be the next focus area. The company, which had earlier acquired a 49 per cent stake in Proline, is planning to revamp its Vivaldi brand as well.

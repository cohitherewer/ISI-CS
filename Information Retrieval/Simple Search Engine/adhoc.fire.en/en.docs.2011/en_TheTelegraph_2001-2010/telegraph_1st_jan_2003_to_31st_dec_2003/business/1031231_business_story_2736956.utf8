 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Barclays to shift more jobs to India
																								London, Dec. 30 (PTI): UK-based Barclays Bank, which already employs 500 back-office processing staff in India, is likely to move more administrative jobs to the country.																								The bank yesterday said it was reviewing the prospects of taking jobs offshore to countries where the costs of employment are much lower.																								However, a bank spokesman played down the speculation that it was planning to move 5,000 call centre jobs to India. 																								No decision has been made. It is too early in the process, he said.																								The bank management has begun talks with the UNIFI  the union representing the staff  over taking jobs offshore, a union spokesman said. The bank employs 58,400 people of which 10,000 work in its call centres.																								Another bank Lloyds TSB is to cut almost 1,000 jobs and close its call centre in Newcastle as its transfers work to India. The bank plans to have 1,500 staff in India by the end of next year.																								Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) is in the process of cutting 4,000 jobs in Britain to relocate work in India, Malaysia and China. According to some estimates, as many as two million jobs could move to India alone over the next 10 years. 																								Barclays move is in contrast to the decision taken two weeks ago by Lehman Brothers to scale back operations it had farmed out to Indian infotech majors.

 Monday, June 16, 2003 				 Maruti launches more Zen variants
																								New Delhi, June 15 (PTI): Maruti Udyog today launched two international two-door limited editions of its premium small car Zen.																								The car would be available in two variants, carbon and steel, and is priced at about Rs 3.9 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), company officials said.																								The carbon variant would be available in mica black colour while the steel variant will be of sterlite silver colour. 																								The countrys biggest car-maker will initially produce 300 units each of the two variants, they said.																								The new models will have features like alloy wheels, tubeless radial tyres, power windows, sporty pedals and chrome-tipped exhaust system.																								Zen is Marutis highest selling premium car. The company sold 4,384 units of Zen last month, which contributed to over 11 per cent of the total sales Maruti at 39,178 units in May.  Honda scales up output																								Indias largest scooter maker Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) would invest Rs 300 crore in the next two years to double production capacity to 6 lakh units, a top company official said today.																								HMSI, which made net profit within two years of its inception in 2000, would double its turnover this fiscal from Rs 500 crore last year due to growing sales, said Haruo Takiguchi, HMSI president.																								The Rs 300-crore investment for raising capacity to 6 lakh units by 2005-06 will be met through both internal accruals and borrowings from institutions like ICICI and Tokyo-Mitsubishi, he said.																								HMSI aims to more than double its sales this year from 1.60 lakh units sold last year. We have already invested Rs 300 crore for capacity expansion and the additional Rs 300 crore investment will be enough to meet demands for the next couple of years, he said.

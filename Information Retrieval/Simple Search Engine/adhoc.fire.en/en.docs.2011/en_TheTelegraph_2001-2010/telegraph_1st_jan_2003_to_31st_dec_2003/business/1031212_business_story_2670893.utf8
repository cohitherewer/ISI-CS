 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Corporate credit surge makes banks buoyant
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Purwar: Upbeat																								Mumbai, Dec. 11: Senior bankers, led by State Bank of India chairman A. K. Purwar and ICICI Bank managing director and CEO K. V. Kamath, today said they are witnessing an increased demand for credit from their corporate clients who are keen on expanding their capacities.																								The need for capacity expansion is not only restricted to India, but also extends to other nations where these companies have a presence.																								According to Kamath, customers are approaching banks with fresh plans. They want to use organic capital, he said, adding that though these are first signs of a credit pickup, a clear upward trend is more likely to be seen in the next 12 months.																								Purwar expects a robust demand from SBIs corporate clients to result in a 15 per cent growth in the banks non-food credit this year against 12 per cent last year.																								The signs of a good credit pickup has come at a time when most of the banks have reported healthy performances largely due to treasury gains.																								Yet in recent times, they have been focussing heavily on the retail segment. According to Kamath, the retail segment is not the only change driver in the domestic market. 																								The wholesale market is also there, he added, indicating the optimism brimming around the corporate sector.																								Kamath, while pointing out that the bank has come across proposals of few domestic corporates who want to expand overseas, particularly China, stressed that domestic banks should also focus on their overseas expansion.																								Purwar said the bank is planning to increase its overseas business. He added that while the bank currently has 50 offices in 28 countries, this number would go up to 75 offices in 36 countries in two years.																								According to bankers, such an expansion has been necessitated not only to cater to the huge diaspora, but also to the needs of domestic corporates who are expanding and acquiring capacities overseas. 																								Bharat Forge has acquired a forging company in Germany. Such acquisitions would necessitate our presence there, a banker added.																								The domestic economy is expected to expand by at least 7 per cent in this year.																								Meanwhile, Union Bank of India has become the first bank to set the benchmark prime lending rate at 10.75 per cent effective January 1. Other banks, including SBI, are reviewing their prime lending rates. 																								According to UBI chairman and managing director V. Leeladher, the board on Wednesday approved a proposal for fixing benchmark prime lending rate at 10.75 per cent, which is 25 basis points lower than the current rate.

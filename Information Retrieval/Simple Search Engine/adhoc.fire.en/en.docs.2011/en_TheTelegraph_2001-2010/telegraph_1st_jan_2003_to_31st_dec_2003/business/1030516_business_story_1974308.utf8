The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, May 16, 2003 				 Hind Lever looks abroad
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 15: Faced with stagnant demand in India, Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL) is trying to export a host of products, including detergents  one of its principal sources of revenue.																								Sanjay Behl, HLLs marketing manager for detergents, said, Though there are no plans of exporting detergents in the foreseeable future, I feel the export potential for detergents is impressive.																								The company has a dedicated team exploring the export opportunities. I am sure they would be looking at opportunities to export detergents too. But the problem is most countries have their own production units, he said.																								There could still be possibilities of exporting detergents to countries in Africa, where demand exceeds production capacity, or to Europe  where the cost of production is higher than India.																								Behl said HLL was aiming at a 10 per cent growth in revenue from its detergent business. We will have to post a volume growth of around 15 per cent to achieve this since we have had to reduce prices at the beginning of the year, he added.

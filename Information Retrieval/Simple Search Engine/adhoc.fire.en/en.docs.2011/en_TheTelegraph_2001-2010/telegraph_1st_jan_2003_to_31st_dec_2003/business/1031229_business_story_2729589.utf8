The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Ministry takes up loan cudgels for tea industry
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Rich pickings 																								Calcutta, Dec. 28: The Union commerce ministry will approach the Reserve Bank, asking it to persuade banks to provide finance to the cash-strapped tea industry.																								After several representations, the banks are still unwilling to provide funds to the industry. The banks fear any exposure to the industry would become a non-performing asset (NPA).																								The Indian tea industry is also planning to take up the issue with the Indian Banks Association  the apex body of the banks operating in India. 																								Senior industry officials said, We have requested the commerce ministry to look into the matter. The ministry has assured us they will immediately take up the issue with the Reserve Bank of India. The matter was also discussed with the additional commerce secretary A. Sengupta who was in the city last week.																								The industry has already asked for a financial relief package from the Central government.																								The government had earlier announced that from April 1, 2003, till the end of Tenth Plan period, the working capital on agricultural loans would carry an interest rate not exceeding 9 per cent, provided the loan amount does not exceed Rs 50 lakh. 																								But the tea industry wants the quantum of loan to be increased. As a major part of the tea production comes from the large sector, the tea industry has suggested that the loan amount be increased keeping the rate of interest at 9 per cent.																								The tea industry has suggested that a special tea term loan package be created on the lines of the special coffee term loan (SCTL).																								Banks have also been requested not to declare a tea account as an NPA if the interest is not paid within 12 months. 																								As the tea industry has a longer crop cycle, ranging between 9-12 months, the ceiling for two crop cycles would be extended to 18-24 months in the case of tea as against 12 months for other agricultural crops for defining NPAs, the industry said.																								The tea industry immediately needs some financial breather so as to survive the cut-throat competition. Smarting under a clutch of problems, including a debilitated financial bottomline, Indian tea companies are increasingly facing the threat of market erosion in the face of stiff competition from other producing countries, said a senior member of the Indian Tea Association.

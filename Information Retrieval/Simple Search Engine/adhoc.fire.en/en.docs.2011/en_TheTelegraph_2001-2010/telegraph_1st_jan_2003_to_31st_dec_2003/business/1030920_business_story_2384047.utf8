 Saturday, September 20, 2003 				 Trai not happy with dial-up Net service
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH Calcutta, Sept 19: Videsh  Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL)  and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) are not complying  with the quality benchmarks laid down by the Telecom Regulatory  Authority of India (Trai) for dial-up internet services.																								A survey conducted by Trai has revealed that around 61 per cent of users have voiced the need for broadband services with an average speed of 128 kbps and a flat monthly tariff. 																								Internet telephony in the country is on the rise with 97 per cent of computer owners using the service to make international calls due to cheaper rates. Sixty two per cent calls are being made to the US, Europe and West Asia. 																								Forty internet service providers (ISPs) in the country have been allowed to provide internet telephony.																								Trai has reported that BSNL heads the internet services non-compliance list with 37 per cent users being unable to log on to the internet even six hours after securing a connection with the ISP. Eighteen per cent VSNL users and 9.75 per cent MTNL users have similar complaints. Sify, however, has only 3.05 per cent users with such connection problems.																								All major ISPs were unable to meet the benchmark that a dial-up connection should be connected within three attempts. 																								Twenty eight per cent users face problems of frequent disconnection. 																								Around 47 per cent have said their connection speeds are as low as 28.8kbps.																								These problems have led to an increased use of cyber cafs and information kiosks to access the internet. According to 62.45 per cent users, cafes are better means of access. 																								Trai has stated that low rates, better service and continuous connectivity are some of the factors that have contributed to the popularity of cyber cafes.																								Trai has asked ISPs to improve their customer service facilities. 																								It has said lower speeds are mainly due to over-subscription and service providers should upgrade their bandwidth.

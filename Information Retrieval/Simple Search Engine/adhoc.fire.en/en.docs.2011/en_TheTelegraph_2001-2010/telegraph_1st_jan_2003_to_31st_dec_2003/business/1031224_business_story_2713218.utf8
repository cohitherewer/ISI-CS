 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Icra warms up for outsourcing
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 23: Credit rating firm Icra Ltd is planning to form several joint-venture units to service business process outsourcing (BPO) tasks in financial modelling, data collection and equities research.																								In view of our strong in-house research capabilities and the fact that Moodys Investor Services is the single largest shareholder in Icra, there will be considerable opportunities in performing analytical and research work for Moodys, said P. K. Chowdhury, managing director of the firm in which US-based Moodys holds around 23 per cent of the equity.																								In line with its BPO plans, Icra has acquired a 33 per cent stake in software and financial portal, OnlineIndiacapital.com, and is planning to acquire an additional 18 per cent of the stock.																								Our major objective in this acquisition is to leverage on the portals superior technical capabilities and low overheads which would help diversify into a range of financial services, he said.																								Besides Moodys, we will be working for other European and US-based investment bankers and mutual funds, he said. The strong financial and IT capabilities of the portal firm will be a strategic fit for Icra in venturing into the BPO market. 																								We are looking at opportunities in the insurance sector, bond market and commercial paper market. The portal firm, which will soon be renamed Icraonline.com, is developing solutions to serve the stock markets, commodity markets and insurance sector, said Chowdhury.																								Currently, the portal firm provides financial information to mutual fund investors and software solutions for financial services companies, especially in the area of enterprise solutions for mutual fund distribution.																								Chowdhury said Icra is focussing on the outsourcing model as it has been proved successful in information technology enabled services and software sector.

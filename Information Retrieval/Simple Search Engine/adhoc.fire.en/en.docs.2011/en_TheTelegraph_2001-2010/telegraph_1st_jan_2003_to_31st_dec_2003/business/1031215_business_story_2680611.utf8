 Monday, December 15, 2003  Q amp;A				 Pension poser
																																																																																													Im thinking of buying a pension scheme. What are the tax benefits? Are the maturity proceeds exempted from tax?																																																																													K. . Singh, Jamshedpur
																																																																																													Premium paid under a pension scheme up to Rs 10,000 per year is deductible from your taxable income under section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act. On maturity of the policy, withdrawal up to a third  of the proceeds is non-taxable. You are required to  buy an annuity  LICs Varistha Pension Bima Yojana  for instance  with the rest of the amount.																																																																																													Though no tax would be deducted from the maturity proceeds, income from the annuity that you are required to buy is taxable. If you do not buy an annuity, two-thirds of the proceeds will be taxable.																																					Life after retirement In 2001, I had parked a portion of my retirement  benefits under the Tax-free Deposit Scheme for Retiring  Government Employees. It pays 8.5 per cent in interest.  The deposit will mature in October 2004. 																																																																																															What will be the rate of interest if I reinvest the amount under the same scheme? Are deposits under the scheme entitled for senior citizen bonus?																																																																													T. K. Mukhopadhyay, Calcutta
																																																																																													The going interest rate on deposits under the scheme is 7 per cent. It is impossible to predict what banks would offer in October next year, but they are unlikely to pay more than the current rate. Deposits under the scheme are not entitled for senior citizen bonus, which banks pay only on term deposits.																																					Service tax																																																																																															I earned Rs 2,000 from service as a consultant. Do I have to pay 8 per cent of that amount as service tax? 																																																																																															Are such small earnings exempted from service tax?																																																																													C. R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta
																																																																																													You would have to pay service tax on your income, however small it might be. Most consultants realise the tax  or 8 per cent of their fee  from their clients. Even if you dont, youd have to pay up.

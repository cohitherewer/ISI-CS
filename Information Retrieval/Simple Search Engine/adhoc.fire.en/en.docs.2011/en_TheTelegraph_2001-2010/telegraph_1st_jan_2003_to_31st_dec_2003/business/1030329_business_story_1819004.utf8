 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, March 28: Reliance Infocomm has postponed the launch of its commercial services to May 1, delaying it by a month from its earlier scheduled date of April 1. 																								The revision is due to delay in implementing interconnect agreements with other service providers, Reliance Infocomm said in a release here today. 																								The Reliance IndiaMobile services would be fully functional across the country from May, which will include full interconnectivity with all other service providers and two-way SMS operability, the company added. 																								It also said that the interconnect agreements were signed with other service providers and was expected to be implemented within a few weeks time. 																								Further, the existing customers of Reliance IndiaMobile, who have been given the benefit of free on-net calls till March 31, will now enjoy this facility till April 30. However, they would be required to pay off-net charges payable to other operators. 																								Consequently, the Dhirubhai Ambani Pioneer Offer will continue to be available till June 30 in 104 cities and till July 31 in the remaining 569 towns in the country.																								The 36-month subscription period of the existing customers of the Dhirubhai Ambani Pioneer Offer would be effective from the day the commercial services will commence.

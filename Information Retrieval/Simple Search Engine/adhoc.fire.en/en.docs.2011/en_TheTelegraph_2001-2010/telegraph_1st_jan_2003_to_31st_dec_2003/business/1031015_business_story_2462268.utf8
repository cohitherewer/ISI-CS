 Wednesday, October 15, 2003 				 Car sales jump 24% in first six months
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 14: Domestic passenger car sales rose 23.6 per cent to 3.19 lakh units during the April-September period from 2.58 lakh units sold in the same period last year.																								The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), which published auto sales data for the six-month period today, reported lower sales growth in September at 12.87 per cent to 56,674 units. 																								Although exports doubled to 9,882 units from 4,952 units in September 2002.																								Car sales of Maruti Udyog inched up to 12,256 units in September from 11,067 in the year-ago period. While, Hyundai Motor India, which makes the popular Santro hatchback, sold 8,527 units, up from 8,314 last year.																								Analysts said the slower sales growth during September was due to a Shrad period observed throughout North India, when many Indians do not buy durables for religious reasons. Delhi is Indias biggest car market and it showed the lowest sales growth during this period. 																								However, cumulative sales for Maruti in the first half of this fiscal rose 27 per cent to 70,670 units from 57,623 year-on-year, while Hyundai clocked a 18 per cent rise to 49,417 units.

Sales in April-September were 109,688 units against 83,106 a year earlier, the report showed.																								Sales of these two during the first half of this financial year jumped by 32 per cent to 1.09 lakh units primarily due to satisfactory work on the golden quadrilateral highway project and a spurt in the infrastructure sector.																								Sale of two-wheelers grew by 15.1 per cent in September to 4.81 lakh units as motorcycles and scooters recorded higher sales. However, mopeds continued to ride into the negative territory. 																								Cumulative two-wheeler sales stood higher by 7 per cent at 25.44 lakh units.																								Scooters and scooterettes, which are witnessing renewed customer interest, clocked a 13.8 per cent growth in September to 83,349 units.

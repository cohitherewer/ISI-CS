The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, August 07, 2003 				 Tatas go limited in Mumbai 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 6: Tata Tele-Services today launched its limited mobility services here on the back of hopes that the countrys commercial capital has enough room to keep the seventh cell firm.																								Tata Teleservices chairman J. J. Irani said at the launch that the company would not unleash a price-war, but insisted the rates announced today make the service cheaper than those of its CDMA rivals.																								The Tatas are in the telecom business in a big way. In fact, we are the only service provider to offer end-to-end telecom services. We will not claim to be the biggest and the cheapest, and tout extraordinary numbers. But, we will be the best, Irani said.																								In Delhi, the Tatas are expanding the subscriber base, pegged at close to a lakh, Tata Teleservices managing director S. Ramakrishnan said. 																								The company has invested Rs 2,400 crore in a state-of-the-art infrastructure that it hopes will be in place before it signs on more customers in the years ahead.																								Irani said the Tata strategy would be to differentiate its products from the others offering services in the industry so that it can get more users.																								Maharashtra, where mobile users grew at the rate of 21 per cent to 27 lakh, is proving to be a happy hunting ground for the company.

 Wednesday, January 08, 2003 				 Triple hurdle to infotech growth in Bengal
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 7: Labour unrest, lack of infrastructure and lack of a high degree of applied computer literacy are some of the major factors hindering the growth of the information technology sector in the state.																								The state needs to urgently address the issue of labour unrest. The chief minister has assured us that his government is considering a ban on all strikes. This will greatly enhance the image of the city and help attract investors, P. K. Sandell, vice-chairman of Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council (ESC), told reporters on the eve of the inauguration of its office in the city. 																								He added that the amount of bandwidth available in the city was not enough to serve the business process outsourcing (BPO) needs of companies. With Reliance launching its services, the situation may soon change, he added.																								Another major area of concern is the quality of IT-related training imparted across institutions and universities. 																								A high degree of literacy is required in the applied software engineering field, explains Sandell. Another area that is evolving is the software for the mobile communication industry. It is necessary for colleges and universities to keep up with the latest requirements of the industry and train students accordingly.																								Despite these hurdles, ESC feels that the eastern region can be transformed into the IT hub of the millennium. Our function is to support marketing activities of local companies and organise delegations to visit the state, said Sandell.

 Thursday, September 25, 2003 				 India, Korea eye $4 bn bilateral trade
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 24: India and Korea hope to do bilateral trade worth $4 billion in this financial year, a jump of a little over 50 per cent from last years level of $2.6 billion.																								Bilateral trade in the first eight months of this calendar year has already touched $2.6 billion. We expect it to grow to $4 billion by year-end. However, we feel that the Indian government should build a conducive environment for Korean companies to do business here, ambassador of the Republic of Korea Kwon Soon-Tae said at a seminar organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.																								Sharing the Korean experience and citing examples of success of three chaebols  LG, Samsung and Hyundai Motors  he said, These companies are performing successfully over several years and as a result have already expanded their bases and capacities of their Indian operations. Tae said, Koreans have now begun to look at India as an alternative to China.

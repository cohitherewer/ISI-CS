 Friday, January 03, 2003 				 UBI goes extra mile to help customers 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 2: The officers association of United Bank of India (UBI) has decided to appoint an ombudsman to settle customer grievances.																								This is the first time in banking history that a trade union has taken such a step. Retired Judge Niharendu Konar will start functioning as the ombudsman from January 25. 																								The exercise is aimed at hastening the settlement of customer complaints within 15 to 21 days. 																								Debasish Banerji, general secretary of United Bank Officers Association (UBOA), said, The bank management has agreed to abide by whatever decision the UBOA-appointed ombudsman delivers.																								UBI general manager (personnel) Dipak Bhattacharyya said that chairman and managing director Madhukar has promised complete support to the proposed ombudsman including compliance of decisions taken in the areas involving operations.																								The RBI has also appointed an ombudsman to settle the complaints of customers. Former CMD of Uco Bank, Dipak Rudra, has been appointed the ombudsman for the east.																								The RBI appointed ombudsman takes six months to settle customer grievances. 																								Explaining the powers of the UBOA-appointed ombudsman, Bhattacharyya said: Compared to the RBI-appointed ombudsman the man appointed by UBOA will have limited powers. The RBI ombudsman can even settle the non-performing asset (NPA) accounts. But the union-appointed ombudsman cannot do that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Dollar troubles continue
 KAZUNORI TAKADA 																								Tokyo, Dec. 25 (Reuters): The dollar was stuck near record lows versus the euro on Thursday as traders showed little interest in buying the greenback on worries over possible terror attacks on the United States. 																								The dollar edged down earlier in the day on news that the Delta Air Lines terminal at New Yorks La Guardia Airport had been temporarily evacuated after a passenger breached security. 																								It also dipped a tad after about half-a-dozen rockets hit several targets in Baghdad, including a hotel used by Westerners and the headquarters of the US-led administration. 																								But movements were limited with European and US markets closed for the Christmas holiday. 																								Traders are in their seats but not many are actually trading, said a spot dealer at a major US bank. 																								But the dollar is under pressure and the trend remains unchanged. 																								The La Guardia terminal was reopened after security personnel re-screened passengers.

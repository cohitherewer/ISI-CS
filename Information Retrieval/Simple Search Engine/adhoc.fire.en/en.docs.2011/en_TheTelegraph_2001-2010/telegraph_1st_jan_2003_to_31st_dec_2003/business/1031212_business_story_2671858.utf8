Irrangattukottai (Chennai), Dec. 11: Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) will touch the 1 million-mark in car production by 2006.																								Of this, 70 per cent will be sold in India and the remaining 30 per cent will be exported. HMIL today rolled out the five-hundred thousandth car from its state-of-the-art Chennai factory.																								As part of its global growth plans, HMIL has also taken the decision to expand its engine and transmission shop capacity to three lakh units and will export components to Hyundai and Kia Motors assembly units worldwide.																								HMIL managing director J. I. Kim said, Our next phase of growth will be more aggressive and global in scale, as we gear up to emerge as one of the largest exporters from India for small cars and auto components. By 2006, we expect to surpass the million unit mark in passenger car sales and emerge as a percentage contributor to Hyundais worldwide operations. HMIL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Company of Korea.																								HMIL has sold around five lakh cars in just five years since the commencement of commercial production in September 1998, company president B. V. R. Subbu said.																								HMIL currently markets over 18 variants of passenger cars in four models, Santro in the B segment, Accent in the C segment, Sonata in the E segment and Terracan in the sports-utility vehicle segment.																								The company is also increasing its existing capacity from 150,000 units to 250,000 units by mid-2004, for which the company has decided to invest Rs 200 crore.																								The company currently exports 9 per cent of its total produce and the remaining 91 per cent is marketed in India. The company has aimed at exporting 30,000 cars in the current fiscal.																								Next year we will be the largest exporter (in value terms) in the manufacturing sector, Subbu added. The company has already started exporting cars to Europe as part of the Korean parents plan to make India as an export hub for Santro.																								The company has plans to launch Elantra in the middle of next year. The company also plans to increase the number of service centres from 400 to 1,000 by 2004.																								Subbu said the company has no immediate plans to raise the price of the cars even though steel prices have gone up. 																								We may review the prices in March 2004, he added. The company, which had registered Rs 4,300 crore turnover in 2002-03, has set a target Rs 5,000 crore in 2003-04.

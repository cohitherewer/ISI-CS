 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Reform run fails to plug WBSEB losses
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 Trip-wire 																								Calcutta, Dec. 14: West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) has not been able to reduce the transmission and distribution loss substantially even after two-and-a-half years of power sector reforms.																								Reports published by WBSEB shows that the aggregate technical loss (T amp;D loss) is as high as 88.51 per cent in certain divisions. The minimum loss is 33.03 per cent.																								Aggregate technical loss has two parts  non-technical loss and technical loss. The non-technical loss results from unmetered supply due to defective meters and pilferage. A poor transmission system gives rise to the technical loss.																								West Bengal State Electricity Regulatory Commission said aggregate technical losses should be brought down by 2.5 per cent every year. The regulatory commission considered 30 per cent T amp;D loss for 2000-01 as the basis for calculation.																								Reports further show that the T amp;D loss in most of the divisions of the board is over 50 per cent. In Kirnahar area of Siuri division, the T amp;D loss is as high as 88.51 per cent.																								We are trying to put a check on the T amp;D loss. It is a difficult task. Unless we are able to stop it the board will lose revenues, a senior official of WBSEB said.																								Industry analysts feel that it is the taxpayers money which is being wasted. 																								Consumers are not getting proper power supply due to pilferage even though they have to pay higher tariffs.																								They said WBSEB is certainly responsible for preventing mass pilferage by taking timely and proper action. 																								But when such pilferage or theft is done at a scale beyond the comprehension of the utility, it cannot pass on the entire cost of the act to honest consumers as a penalty for their honesty, they added.																								Senior officials of the Union power ministry said high aggregate technical loss is a major roadblock stalling the power sector development.																								Of the total energy generated, only 55 per cent is billed and 41 per cent is realised. The gap between average revenue realisation and average cost of supply has been constantly increasing.																								In 2002-03, the average cost of supply was 310 paise per unit and average revenue was 210 paise per unit. All this has caused erosion in the volume of internal resources generation by state electricity boards. The annual losses of state electricity boards have reached a level of Rs 26,000 crore. Other states improve																								PTI adds: Indicating an improvement in the power sector, 11 states have reported reduction in financial losses during the last two years to the tune of Rs 8,000 crore and became eligible for incentives from the Centre. 																								Besides putting in place the Electricity Act 2003, the ministry of power has taken various initiatives and results are here to see. As many as 11 states have reduced financial losses worth Rs 8,000 crore, Union power secretary R. V. Shahi said in Delhi.																								Maharashtra, Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh pruned losses.

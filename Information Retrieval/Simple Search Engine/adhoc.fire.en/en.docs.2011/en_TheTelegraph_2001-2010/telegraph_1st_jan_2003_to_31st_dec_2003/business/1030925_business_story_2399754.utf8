 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 24: The Federation of Hotel amp; Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) is moving the Delhi High Court next week disputing the department of consumer affairs directive to restaurants to sell packaged drinks at MRP  or the printed maximum retail price for retail sales.																								Associations president S. K. Khullar said: We have tried to explain to government officials that selling packaged drinks in restaurants is not the same as retail sales, and hence the stipulations under the Packaged Commodities Rules 1977 should not apply. We have not been able to convince them and will have to seek the courts intervention.																								Restaurants could sell carbonated drinks in glasses or vials to avoid the packaged commodities rules, but bottled drinking water has to be sold in bottles  customers would refuse to pay for bottled water if served in glasses, he said.

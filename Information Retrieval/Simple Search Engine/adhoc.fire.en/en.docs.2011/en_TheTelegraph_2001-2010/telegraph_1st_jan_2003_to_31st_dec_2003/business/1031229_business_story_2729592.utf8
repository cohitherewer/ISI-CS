 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 PwC recipe for sharper technology forecasts
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Roy: Futuristic Pix by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Dec. 28: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has identified initiatives that will help companies achieve a greater transparency and accountability in its technology forecast report for 2003-05.																								Managing director Roopen Roy said, The classic problem is that business events occur over a period of time. There is a latency between when things happen and the time when the information is conveyed. The intelligent use of mobile devices by integrating them with the process of information dissemination will help break barriers and result in faster reactions.																								According to PwC, the principal issues affecting successful management are governance, transparency and integrity. One of the tools being embraced for communicating financial information among different applications is eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL).																								XBRL is an electronic format for simplifying flow of financial statements, performance reports, accounting records and other financial information among software programs. The application defines a consistent format for business reporting and will streamline how companies prepare and disseminate financial data and how analysts, regulators and investors review and interpret it.																								In the next three to five years, XBRL will move from the early adopter phase to become the generally accepted way to report business information. As a result, corporations will simplify the process of issuing business reports and the public will find it easier to get the information they need to make informed investment decisions, explains Roy.

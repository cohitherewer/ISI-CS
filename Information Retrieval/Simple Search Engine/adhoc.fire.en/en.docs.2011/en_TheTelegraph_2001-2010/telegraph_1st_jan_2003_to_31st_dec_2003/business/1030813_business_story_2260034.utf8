 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Deal deluge for India Inc in Iraq 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: India has renegotiated contracts worth Rs 370 crore in Iraq that were pending under the UN-promoted oil-for-food programme. 																								Indian companies have also been successful in bagging other contracts on a one-to-one basis under the aegis of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).																								Six contracts for providing 300,000 metric tonnes of wheat have been revived under the oil for food programme. Few other contracts have been worked with the Iraq ministry of trade, health and industry, said Anil K Aggarwal, chairman, Ficcis India-Iraq joint business council.																								The six Indian companies which will supply wheat include Priyanka Overseas Ltd, State Trading Corporation, Mohan Exports, PCP Ltd, Cosmos International and LT Overseas. 																								The wheat supply which will start in a months time will be unloaded at Jordan as the ports in Iraq are not ready for bulk unloading, added Aggarwal.																								Although Ficci officials could not quantify the volume of business struck on a one-to-one basis, individual business contracts were finalised by Usha International, Flex Engineering, Yamuna Gases and Chemicals Ltd, Jaguar Overseas Ltd and Asian Fusegear.																								Fifteen of the 30-member business delegation that went to Iraq via Jordan early this month are back. We are quite confident that the remaining members will also be able to strike some fruitful deals as Iraqis have virtually nothing left with them and need everything, said Ficcis senior vice president Y.K. Modi.

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH				 	 Mittal: Share the moolah Calcutta, Dec. 28: The  Esop fables are being retold once again. Employee millionaires  are the stuff of dreams that were built on the dotcom bubble   and were kept alive in the buzzing world of information  technology.																								But now, for the first time, a telecom major  Bharti Tele-Ventures  is creating its own band of super-rich employees.																								Bharti Tele-Ventures had granted employee stock ownership options (Esops) in October 2000 based on performance and service criteria to employees of all subsidiary companies, irrespective of hierarchy.																								Three years down the line, Bharti has succeeded in adding 160 millionaires and 1,129 lakhpatis to Indias growing list of young nouveau riche.																								As part of the Esop plan, 14.96 million options were granted with a vesting period of four years. Of these, 6.07 million options, which comprise around 60 per cent of the total stock, have been vested to the employees so far, thus creating 160 millionaires.																								The objective of the scheme was to reward employees for their contribution to the growth of the company and provide an opportunity for wealth creation while inculcating a sense of ownership among them, a senior company official said.																								An Esop is a qualified, defined contribution employee benefit plan that invests primarily in the stock of the employees company. To set up an Esop, a company creates a trust fund for employees and funds it by contributions of stock, cash to buy stock or cash to pay back the Esops loan to buy stock.																								On becoming a lakhpati from the Esop plan, Aman Prakash, a senior executive of Bharti Tele-Ventures in Delhi, said, All the long hours and hard work has paid off. What makes it special is the fact that I am not only a participant in but also a beneficiary from the financial success achieved by the company.																								Chairman and group managing director Sunil Bharti Mittal said, Bharti believes in best human resource practices. It invests a lot of time and effort in developing leaders at all levels combined with an orientation to serve customers. Esops were a tool to make employees fully aligned towards creating shareholder value.																								Industry watchers also feel that Bharti is certainly ranked in the best employers category and the creation of millionaires has just added more sheen to its armour.

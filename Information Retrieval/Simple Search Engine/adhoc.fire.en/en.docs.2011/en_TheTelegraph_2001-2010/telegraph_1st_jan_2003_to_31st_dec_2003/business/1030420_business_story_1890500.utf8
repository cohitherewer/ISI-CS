 Sunday, April 20, 2003 				 Dabur readies skin care debut
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, April 19: Dabur India is getting ready with a slew of product launches including a foray into the skin care segment.																								The company, which recently held a high-level internal review of its operations and products, has also evaluated the possibilities of other brand extensions. Top corporate sources say the senior management team is now working on the first phase of the brand extension plans. Dabur India, which has interests in family products, pharmaceuticals and ayurvedic specialities, is also keen to come out with new products in hair care and herbal toothpastes, sources said. 																								The Dabur spokesperson confirmed, We plan to enter the skin care category in June this year. The details are being worked out. 																								According to industry sources, the most likely product will be a fairness cream, which is the largest growing segment in the skin care category. 																								This would pit Dabur against Hindustan Lever and Calcutta-based Emami.																								However, the skin care product to be launched in June this year will be an herbal face pack, which will be positioned utilising Daburs USP of being chemical-free and healthy. The face-pack market is estimated at about Rs 100 crore. At present, the company has just one skincare product  Dabur Gulabari or rose water, sources said. However, rose water is more of an all-purpose ayurvedic product.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Phone bait laid in BSNL Net
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Log-in lure 																								New Delhi, Dec. 28: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), the state-owned telephony major, has been allowed to offer its customers a concessional second phone purely for internet connectivity.																								The telecom regulator today cleared the tariff proposal for the BSNL scheme. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said it would clear similar tariff plans proposed by other telephony companies in order to give a thrust to internet penetration in the country.																								Existing fixed-line subscribers will neither have to pay an installation charge nor a security deposit for the internet phone.																								The scheme is available initially for a period of one year. The regulator said it would not intervene in such plans meant to promote internet usage in the country even though, prima facie, such offers contain an element of discrimination in that the offer is open only to existing Bharat Sanchar subscribers. 																								The telecom regulator has examined the benefits arising out of such tariff plans in promoting internet penetration which outweigh the concerns arising out of discrimination and therefore decided that this should be supported. It was further decided that such bundling of tariffs involving concessional tariff for internet usage by any service provider would also be supported by the authority, said a senior Trai official. 																								This decision of the Authority stems from the fact that the internet penetration in the country is very low (0.4 per 100 persons) as compared with many developing countries like Malaysia (11) and South Korea (58).																								Early this month, BSNL had announced a free internet scheme for its fixed-line subscribers that offers an additional fixed line phone for its existing subscribers at a flat rental of Rs 399 per month (where the existing rental is Rs 170 per month) and Rs 499 per month (where the rentals are Rs 450 per month).																								This phone is to be used to access free internet service only. This scheme became operational from November 14. Under this scheme, the subscriber can enjoy dial- up internet service for unlimited time without paying call charges, said Prithipal Singh, BSNLs chairman and managing director.

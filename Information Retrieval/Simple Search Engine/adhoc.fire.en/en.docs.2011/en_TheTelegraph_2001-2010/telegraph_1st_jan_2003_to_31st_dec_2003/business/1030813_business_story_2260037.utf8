 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Shop till you drop																								Mumbai, Aug. 12: Splurge your way to a boom. Chock-a-block malls, says a DSP Merrill Lynch India Research report, show the way to an economy that could be twice as big, at $1 trillion, seven years from now.																								Household consumption, the flywheel of the worlds largest economy, the US, is expected to double to $510 billion in India (Rs 23.5 trillion) in five years from an estimated $250 billion (Rs 11.5 trillion) in 2002-03. 																								There are several pointers to this high noon of consumer spending  rising incomes, changing age profiles, increasing consumerism and cheap retail credit.																								Also at the heart of the anticipated upsurge lie attitudes. The average Indian is more willing to pay for convenience, comfort and entertainment now, all of which go a long way to bring about a spending burst.																								If the shoppers zest goes hand in hand with an investors ardour  more money in machines and capital goods  the size of the national output, or gross domestic product, can double not in 10 years, but five.																								The report cites data from Tata Statistical Outline to conclude that the number of households in the upper-middle and higher-income brackets will rise from around 25 million in 2001-02 to over 44 million by 2006-07.																								More important, the number of people entering the 20-34 age group, known to be the highest spenders, could rise seven million every year. We expect almost 65 million people to enter this segment by 2010. Almost three million join this group every day, the report added.																								The sharp fall in interest rates, almost 600 basis points over the past three years, coupled with availability of easy credit is also fuelling a buying binge. An estimated 22 per cent of the increase in consumer durable purchases came with borrowed money; it was less than 10 per cent about three years ago.																								The authors of the report feel the low interest rates will endure in the near future, punctuated with temporary spikes that could be limited to 100-150 basis points. What has also helped matters is not just easy money. The Indian consumer, known for his aversion to debt, is less fastidious about credit-driven deals as lifestyle changes and urbanisation raise aspiration levels.																								On an incremental basis, almost 60-65 per cent of individuals now finance homes through mortgages against 30-35 per cent five years ago.

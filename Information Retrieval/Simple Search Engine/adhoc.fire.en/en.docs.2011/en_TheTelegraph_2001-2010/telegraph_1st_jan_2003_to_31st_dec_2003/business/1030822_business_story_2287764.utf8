The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, August 22, 2003 				 AirTel dual band in Delhi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 21: AirTel subscribers in Delhi will get better voice quality and fewer call drops, while those in Calcutta and other states will continue to face these problems. Blame it all on the non-availability of spectrum.																								The largest cellular mobile service provider today unveiled a new plan in association with Ericsson to ensure better connectivity and minimal network congestion even at peak hours at hot spots (commercial areas and business centres) and further maximise the efficiency and utilisation of the available spectrum.																								AirTel has installed Indias first multi-band cell feature and voice quality enhancers at 70 dual band cell sites deployed in high call traffic areas of Delhi and NCR in the first phase. It plans to add another 40 dual band sites and two switching units in the second phase.																								The company will invest Rs 250 crore by the end of the financial year on cellular infrastructure in Delhi. 																								The dual band will help AirTel leverage the benefits of 1800 MHz and 900 MHz frequency bands. 																								Sanjay Nandrajog, CEO of Bharti Cellular Ltd (north central region), said, In phase II, we will deploy 40 more dual band cell sites and two mobile switching units (MSUs).

 Thursday, January 16, 2003 				 Deadlock at tea auction persists 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan 15: Tea buyers failed to commit that they would participate in the auctions from next week even after a three-hour meeting with the Tea Board chairman N. K. Das today.																								Talking to reporters after the meeting Das said, We have clarified to the buyers that the rules of the new Tea Marketing Control Order (TMCO) will not be draconian as the buyers think. We have explained to them in details.																								The buyers however, said that no decision has been taken yet on whether they will participate in the auctions next week. We have sought clarifications from the Tea Board on TMCO. Once we get it we will be able to take a decision, they said.																								The buyers had taken a decision last week to stop tea sales at the auctions as well as through private channels.																								Das said that he has requested the buyers to participate in the auction next week so that the trade is not affected. Even though confusion exists whether the buyers will take part in the auctions, the auction committees have decided to conduct auctions from next week. Calcutta and Guwahati will have their auctions next week.																								The Tea Board chairman said that the buyers have asked to change the frequency of submitting their sales report from monthly to annually.

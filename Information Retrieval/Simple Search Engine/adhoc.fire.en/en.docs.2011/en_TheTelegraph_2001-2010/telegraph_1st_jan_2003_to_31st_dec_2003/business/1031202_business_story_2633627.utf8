 Tuesday, December 02, 2003 				 TVS targets more sales with Centra launch
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Dec. 1: TVS Motor Company (TVS), the third largest manufacturer of two wheelers in the country, is in the process of launching TVS Centra and an upgraded Victor in January to ramp up sales.																								The company had witnessed a fall in sales volume during November.																								While most of the two wheeler makers have reported a positive growth in sales volume for the last month, TVS reported a 13 per cent decline in sales from 98,731 units to 85,480 units. 																								The companys sales volume has been hit hard by its plummeting motor bike sales which fell 30 per cent to 48,052 units in the reporting period compared with 68,631 units in November, 2002.																								TVS pegs its future growth on the sales of motor bikes for which it has already made heavy investments. It is also planning to corner a 20 per cent market share by bringing in more vehicles.																								According to industry insiders, it is the sharp fall in sales of its two stroke Max that has led to the disaster in sales growth. Surprisingly, the scooter segment, which has been stagnant for the last few years, has helped the company stem the total sales decline by growing at 42 per cent during the same period.																								TVS Motor sold 16,827 units of scooters in November this year compared with 11,815 units in the corresponding period last year.																								Hero Honda, the countrys largest two-wheeler manufacturer, has again emerged as a clear winner so far as November sales is concerned.																								It has recorded a growth of 26 per cent during the period under review to touch 2,04,533 units. The growth was spread across all major segments, including Splendor Plus and Passion Plus.																								Passion Plus, with its national appeal, has got back the style customer, leading to an increase in our market share in the executive segment. Following this incredible performance, the companys outlook for the year looks great, a company statement said quoting managing director Pawan Munjal.																								Chairman Brijmohan Lall Munjal said, Our new products strategy to identify and satisfy the emerging and latent needs, has shaped this success.																								Bajaj Auto could only manage to stay in the positive side of the growth chart in two-wheelers by recording sales of 1,13,164 units during November, 2003.

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Bhadrachalam, Nov. 2: ITC has launched an initiative to recycle waste paper.																								According to ITC Bhadrachalam CEO Pradeep Dhobale, waste paper, which was currently imported, accounts for a significant part of its raw material. Around 2000 tonnes of waste paper are generated in the country and it costs around Rs 80 crore to collect it, he said.																								ITC had launched an initiative to collect waste paper in 30 schools in Hyderabad. We are planning to expand the scheme to stations of the citys multi-mode transport system. The company will place special bins in these stations and use posters to generate awareness, said Manula Kannan, head of Inbhadra, the recycling unit of ITC.																								Over 70 per cent of the waste paper (mostly loose paper) are not reusable as they are not properly segregated. quot;Only newspapers bought in bulk are recycled in the country and the remaining are thrown away or not properly collected, quot; Kannan said.																								The Bhadrachalam plant also recycles water and power at the paper unit. Although our installed capacity has increased to 2 lakh tonnes per annum at present, our power and water consumption remains at what was envisaged for the first 40,000 tonnes per annum, quot; said Dhobale.

																								Life is full of uncertainties and you need to ensure the future of your children. Avivas Young Achiever Policy gives parents not only an opportunity to save regularly, but also ensures that they can take care of their financial needs should anything unfortunate happen.																								Young achiever is a regular premium fixed term, protection-cum-savings plan for your child. The policy can be purchased on the life of any one of the parents with the child as the nominee.																								The policy term depends on the present age of your child. For example, if your childs age is between 0-13 years on last birthday, the policy term will be 21 minus the age of the child at entry. 																								However, if the age of the child is 10 years at the time of buying the policy, then the policy term will be 11 years (21-10).																								The policy offers two investment fund options: with profits fund and a unit-linked fund. The investment objective of with profits fund is to provide stable and sustained growth. This fund provides a guarantee that the selling price of the units will never fall.																								The unit value of this fund is increased by crediting bonuses on daily compounding basis. A final bonus, if any, may also be payable at maturity, death, or at the time of surrender and partial withdrawals.					 GARIMA SINGH

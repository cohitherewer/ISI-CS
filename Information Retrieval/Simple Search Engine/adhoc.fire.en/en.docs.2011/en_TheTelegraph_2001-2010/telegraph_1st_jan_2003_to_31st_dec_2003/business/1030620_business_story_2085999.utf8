 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 19: Indian Hotels Co Ltd (IHCL) has appointed Raymond Bickson as managing director for India, with effect from July 19, replacing R. K. Krishna Kumar, who has been named as the vice-chairman of the hotel chain.																								Addressing newspersons, immediately after the board meeting, Kumar said: Taj is in an inflexion point and slated to take off. You should be expecting some dramatic things from Taj.																								Bickson, who joined IHCL in January this year as chief operating officer of Taj luxury hotels, is also an executive director. 																								He would be mainly involved in consolidating the Tata group companys growth path in India and its thrust of expanding into other markets outside the country, Kumar said. 																								Meanwhile, IHCL has posted a gross profit of Rs 193.89 crore on a consolidated basis for the financial year ended March 31, 2003, and posted a total income of Rs 904.56 crore.

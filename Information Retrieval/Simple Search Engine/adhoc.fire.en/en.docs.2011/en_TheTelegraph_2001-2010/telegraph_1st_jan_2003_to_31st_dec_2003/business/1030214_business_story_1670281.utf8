 Friday, February 14, 2003 				 Car sales grow 8% in ten months 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: Passenger car sales rose by 8 per cent in April-January 2003 to 5,68,363 units from 5,36,215 in the same period last year, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said in a release.																								SIAM said sales of cars in January alone rose by 10 per cent to 54,825 units from 49,769 units in January 2002. Sales for the month of December 2002 stood at 36,709 units reflecting a revival.																								The report also said two-wheeler sales grew by 19.43 per cent to 41,19,034 units. Sales for the month of January alone were placed at 4,05,967 units.																								Although the cumulative trend for the first 10 months of the financial year showed an average rise in car sales, the commercial vehicles category reported a much higher increase of sales at 30 per cent.																								Sales of commercial vehicles amounted to 89,166 units in April-January, up from 68,571 units in the same period of last financial year. Commercial vehicle sales in January alone grew by 35 per cent to 18,650 units against 13,782 units a year earlier. Analysts said they expected the strong growth in commercial vehicles segment to continue.																								But the mid-sized car market has not shown any significant growth. In fact, some companies have shown a fall in sales.																								General Motors, Hindustan Motors Lancer and Maruti have registered a negative net growth in sales for the 10-month period. General Motors India is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the US auto giant, General Motors Corp. 																								However, the small car segment grew by around 14 per cent. Fiat India Automobiles Palio, Hyundai Motor Indias Santro and Tata Engineerings Indica have recorded double-digit growth.

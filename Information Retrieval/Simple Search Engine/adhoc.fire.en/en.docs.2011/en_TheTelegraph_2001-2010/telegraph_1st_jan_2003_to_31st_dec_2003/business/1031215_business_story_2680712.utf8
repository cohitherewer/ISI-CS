The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Adhunik to set up Rs 320cr steel plant
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA				 On a roll 																								Calcutta, Dec. 14: Adhunik Corporation Ltd has decided to invest Rs 320 crore to set up an integrated steel plant in Orissa.																								The capacity of the plant will be 2.5 lakh tonnes per annum and depending on the demand, the capacity can be increased later.																								Confirming the decision, Adhunik director Mahesh Agarwal said the plant will be commissioned by March 2005 and the work is going on full steam.																								The sponge iron unit is already commissioned with a production of over 12,000 tonnes per month. This will go up further as per requirements, Agarwal said.																								The total project will be completed in two phases. While in the first phase the city-based steel and mines player is going to invest around Rs 120 crore, the remaining portion will be invested in the second phase, which will see the construction of a blast furnace with a capacity of 1.73 lakh tonnes of hot metal.																								Agarwal said the debt-equity ratio for the project has been pegged at 3:2.																								While majority of the equity is being brought by the promoters and their associates, a small public issue is also in the pipeline.																								Agarwal said the maiden public issue would not be large as the company does not need a huge fund.																								We are ready to put in the equity on our own to see the project through. But we are planning to come up with a small public issue to get the company listed on the bourses, he said.																								Agarwal also said the company is currently looking for a merchant banker to prepare the brief for the public issue. The Adhunik group will be the second domestic steel company to come up with a public issue ever since the steel market is buoyant.																								Adhunik, which already operates a sponge iron plant in Durgapur, is also keen on entering into mining coal and iron ore. In Orissa, it has leased a coal mine at Talcher and has applied for an iron ore mine in Belpahar.																								The company has already signed a memorandum of understanding with the Orissa government for mining iron ore.

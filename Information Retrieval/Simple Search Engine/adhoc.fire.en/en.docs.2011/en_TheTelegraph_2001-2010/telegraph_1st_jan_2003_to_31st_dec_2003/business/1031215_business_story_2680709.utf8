 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 General Motors to launch Optra variant soon
				 	 Right up your Alley																								New Delhi, Dec. 14 (PTI): General Motors India will launch a 1.6-litre engine model of its premium mid-size car Chevrolet Optra this week to meet competition from vehicles like Honda City and Hyundai Accent.																								The car, which would deliver about 100-brake horse power, would cost less than the existing 1.8-litre model, a source close to the company said. 																								The Optra, which was first launched in July 2003, is sold in both manual and automatic transmission variants between Rs 7.89 lakh and Rs 10.29 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).																								All the other features would remain the same as the existing 1.8-litre model, the source said.																								When contacted, General Motors India vice-president (corporate affairs), P. Balendran, said there were plans to roll out a new model of the Optra but did not give details.																								A wholly-owned subsidiary of US-based auto-maker General Motors Corporation, the company also produces the Opel Corsa range of models at its plant at Halol (Gujarat). 																								It imports and sells the luxury sedan, Opel Vectra, and sports-utility-vehicle Chevrolet Forester.																								Sales of the company surged by 66 per cent to 13,505 units during January-November 2003, Balendran said. It comprised 8,596 units of the Corsa, a 27 per cent rise over the same period last year. 																								Sales during November 2003 went up by 177 per cent to 1,260 cars.																								General Motors India has launched new models or variants of its existing models this year as part of an aggressive plan to grow sales over five-fold to about 50,000 units in the next three years.

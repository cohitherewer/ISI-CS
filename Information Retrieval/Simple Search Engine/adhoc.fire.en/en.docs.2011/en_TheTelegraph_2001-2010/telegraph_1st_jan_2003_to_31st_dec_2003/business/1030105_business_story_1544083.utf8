The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, January 05, 2003 				 Globsyn ready for BPO splash
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY				 	 Dasgupta: New ideas																								Calcutta, Jan. 4: Globsyn Technologies, promoted by Bikram Dasgupta, will venture into business process outsourcing (BPO) for US companies in a big way. 																								Dasguptas son Romit, a fresh computer science graduate from Syracuse University, has joined the business in New York. His focus would be to rope in US companies BPO assignments for Globsyn and other city-based outfits.																								According to Dasgupta, Globsyn has no immediate plans for opening a call centre. However, its US outfit and associates would get clients for the well-equipped international call centres in the city.																								This apart, Globsyn Technocampus, the education business outfit at the Salt Lake electronic complex, is also planning to start a BPO academy to develop human resource for the emerging sector. He said the academy is being designed to offer post-graduate degree in outsourcing management.																								According to Dasgupta, as US companies have realised the financial benefits of outsourcing jobs from India, every Indian infotech and other companies are preparing to enter the BPO sector. According to his estimates, an American company could get the same job done at one-fourth the cost by outsourcing from India. 																								American companies, which tapped Indian software services and benefited, are bound to outsource all kinds of jobs from India, he said.																								Dasgupta believes that BPO enterprises in India would soon emerge as a new area catering to the business requirement of overseas organisations. 																								BPO sectors growth could exceed what the software services witnessed during the later part of the nineties, he said, noting that the export turnover of the Indian software grew to $ 6 billion from $ 800 million in 1996-97.																								Globsyn has started a BPO wing along with its software division to cater to high-end services such as digital data transmission. 																								Dasgupta said he is hoping at least 50 per cent growth in business during the coming years and Globsyn would become a Rs 50-crore company by 2007.

 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Jute meet fails to resolve issues
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 27: The indefinite strike in Bengals jute industry is on from Monday.																								The representatives of Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) walked out of a tripartite meeting held by the labour department to avert the strike as trade union leaders insisted on payment of dearness allowance to the workers at current cost of living index. The meeting was chaired by state labour minister Md Amin.																								The association leaders also stood by their point that any wage and dearness allowance payment would have to be linked to productivity.																								After over five hours of negotiation in Writers Building on Saturday, Amin said, Mill owners were adamant and the indefinite strike will begin from Monday.																								Amin said, he would hold a series of conciliatory meetings from next week so that the strike did not prolong. The Centre had threatened of a possible switch to synthetic bags as an alternative to jute sacks for packing food grains from the current rabi harvest.																								As many as 19 trade unions, including Citu, Intuc, Aituc, in their charter of demand sought payment of dearness allowance with arrears from February 2002. The trade unions also demanded implementation of the January 5, 2002 agreement with revision in pay scales and bonus payment to the workers who had exceeded the wage ceiling under the Bonus Act.																								According to association chairman Sanjoy Kajaria, members insisted on all payments, including wages linked to productivity.																								The trade union leaders wanted two to four months to sort out the productivity-linked issues. But IJMA representatives were unanimous that payments would be made only from the day of implementation of the agreement.																								Although the strike will begin from Monday, industry watchers are optimistic that the breakdown is unlikely to be complete and lengthy considering the state of affairs of the industry and the down-the-line unity of the workers.																								Going by the recent phenomenon, mill owners too might resort to bipartite settlement at the respective mill levels and resume production to meet their commitment on sacking supply for the current rabi crop.																								The Union food and civil supply ministry has already placed orders for 2.5 lakh bales of jute sacks to be supplied by February.																								The Centre has estimated the jute sacking requirement to be 8.5 lakh bales by March-end. Jute commissioner S. Majumdar expressed in a letter to the state chief secretary the Centres apprehension regarding timely delivery of the sacks in the event of a strike. Majumdar also noted that if the sacking supply schedule is not adhered to the Centre might be forced to consider an alternative mode of sacking.

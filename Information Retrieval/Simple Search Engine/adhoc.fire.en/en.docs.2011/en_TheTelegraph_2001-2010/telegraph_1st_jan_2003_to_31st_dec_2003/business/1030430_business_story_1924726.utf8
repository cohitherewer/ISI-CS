 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 29: Grasim Industries, the third-largest cement maker in the country, has posted a fourth-quarter net profit of Rs 49 lakh after exceptional items against a profit of Rs 79.23 crore in the year-ago period. 																								Consequent to the divestment of its stake in Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, Grasim has taken an exceptional charge of Rs 209 crore. Grasim called it a cash-positive transaction.																								The companys net sales for the quarter rose to Rs 1,211 crore from Rs 1,111 crore. 																								Grasims board has recommended a 100 per cent dividend (at Rs 10 per share) for 2003-04, with a total payout of Rs 103.4 crore.																								Grasim said on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the fourth quarter has been satisfactory. Net profit after current taxes, but before exceptional items, was at Rs 171 crore, a rise of 44 per cent as compared with the corresponding previous quarter.																								The companys total income for the fiscal rose to Rs 4,742.13 crore, compared with Rs 4,501.26 crore in the previous year.																								The companys turnover is up 5 per cent at Rs 4,626 crore while gross profit has risen 30 per cent at Rs 973 crore. Net profit after total tax expenses but before exceptional items is up 40 per cent at Rs 542 crore, despite making a substantially higher provision for tax expenses.																								Grasim said three major factors have contributed to its impressive performance. These are growth in volumes, improvement in operational efficiencies resulting from ongoing modernisation efforts, plant up-gradation and energy optimisation and lowering of financing cost through reduction and substitution of high cost coupled with effective working capital management.																								Grasim has registered an impressive growth both in production and sales volumes. Production at 11.09 million tonnes and sales at 11.6 million tonnes has risen in comparison with the previous year.																								Sponge iron recorded all-round improved performance during the year.

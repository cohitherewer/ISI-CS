 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Twin options for IDBI revival
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 12: The government is planning to either merge Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) with a public sector bank or go in for a reverse merger with IDBI Bank for its conversion into a bank, . S. Sisodia, secretary (financial sector) in the ministry of finance, has said.																								The government is examining the options for restructuring the financial institution through merger or otherwise, Sisodia said and added that a final decision would be taken only after analysing the pros and cons.																								The available options would be evaluated and a decision taken, he said. He was speaking to newspersons at the Bank Economists Conference-2003 here today. Sisodia added that regulatory forbearance for IDBI would depend on which option is chosen.																								These options have come in the wake of the financial institutions transition into a universal bank which is now in its final stages.																								Recently, the Industrial Development Bank of India (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Bill had scraped through in the Lok Sabha.																								The passage of this bill would bring the financial institution under the Companies Act.																								The identification of these alternatives for IDBIs transition into a universal bank forms part of a long story that has seen different views on the avatar that IDBI would don as a universal bank.																								Former chairman P P Vora had, prior to his retirement, said that the financial institution after its conversion into a universal bank would focus on corporate banking, thus ruling out a reverse merger with IDBI Bank. 																								However, there were reports from finance ministry officials, particularly Anandrao Adsul, that IDBI would be merged with IDBI Bank after Parliament gave its green signal to the IDBI Bill.																								Speculations are now rife that M. Damodaran, who has succeeded Vora at IDBI, is not averse to a reverse merger with IDBI Bank.																								In September, Sisodia had told newspersons here that the precise contours of the new entity is being worked out. He then observed that IDBI as a universal bank could either be focussed on retail banking in the classical sense or restrict itself to the corporate sector.

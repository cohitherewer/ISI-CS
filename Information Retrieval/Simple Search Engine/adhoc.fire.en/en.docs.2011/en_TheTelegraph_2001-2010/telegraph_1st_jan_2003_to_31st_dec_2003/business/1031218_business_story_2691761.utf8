 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 January date for new-look Indica
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Mumbai, Dec. 17: The makeover  mania is catching up with Tata Motors. The company plans  to give Indica, its B-segment money-spinner, a new skin  and more gloss  just what Maruti did to Zen and Hyundai  to Santro.																								The improved Indica will roll off the assembly line in early January. Industry watchers say the launch has been advanced to keep pace with rivals who have rolled out upgraded Zens and Santros.																								A Tata Motors spokesperson confirmed the plan, but declined to offer more details. However, sources say the new design is completely an in-house initiative. 																								Already, a more stylish Indica is sold in Europe by MG Rover. Souped-up Indicas are sold in the highly competitive UK and European markets under the CityRover marque. It is an adaptation of the indigenous hatchback version of Indica. Apart from the famous Rover badge, the car sports a new front grill and lights and is powered by a specially designed 1.4 litre petrol engine. Analysts are not sure whether the new Indica for the Indian roads will sport the same look. 																								This is the first facelift for Indica, which was launched in December 1998 as the countrys only car developed entirely at home.																								Giving existing models a facelift is an arduous, time-consuming process, besides being an expensive proposition for car makers. Maruti took two years, and Rs 35-40 crore, to roll out a snazzier Zen, one of its best selling cars in the B segment. 																								While it is expensive, facelifts are also cost effective as designing and making a new car would involve 10 times the cost of giving facelifts.																								Before the facelift for Maruti Zen, the countrys largest car maker had given a facelift to Maruti 800 in 1997.

 Sunday, November 02, 2003 				 Bell Labs set to ring in new mobile technology
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 1: Captain Kirk and his famous star ship team of Star Trek fame will soon lose monopoly over hands-free mobile phones and the devices with the advent of a new technology that will help develop mobile devices that will consist of only three parts  a battery, plastic case and single chip.																								The phone, the size of a thumb with numerous antenna mounted on the single chip, will give 150 per cent coverage and capacity. Which means no more call drops and streaming videos on your mobile devices.																								Such equipment are scheduled to be rolled out within the next few years and will hit the Indian market before 2010. 																								Bell Laboratories is working on a technology that will help the telecom service providers to be ready to meet challenges of high bandwidth demand, efficient spectrum usage and smooth transition from different software systems to a single one.																								Delivering a lecture on Communications Networking: Beyond 2005, Arun Netravali, president (Emeritus) Bell Labs made eight predictions for the new millennium. Netravali predicted that most of the predictions would become a reality by 2010 (See chart).																								Lecturing an audience that included members of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and senior executives from private telecom companies both cellular and basic operators, Netrvali explained the ways to improve the revenue from new value added services.																								Telecom traffic each year is growing by 35 per cent, but the operators and equipment vendors are still making losses. There is a solution in low cost service, intelligent networks and services with richness and quality, said Netravali.																								Mobility does not mean wireless technology. In future the networks will be available that will allow a subscriber moving anywhere in the world to use his device irrespective of the software, language and technology offered by a service provider in any part of the world, he added.																								Netravali said operators are looking to invest in technology that will help them to increase revenues, reduce the cost of infrastructure, implement tool and technology to reduce the time to make the network service ready and that will not be impacted by entry of multiple players.																								This, Netravali said can be achieved by readying themselves for transition to packet switching technology from the circuit-based technology. In a packet-based technology, data sent from one place breaks into many parts, goes through different routes, and assembles at the destination. This reduces the time and improves the efficiency.																								While in a circuit-based technology the data waits for the traffic to be cleared in the circuits. This leads to delay.

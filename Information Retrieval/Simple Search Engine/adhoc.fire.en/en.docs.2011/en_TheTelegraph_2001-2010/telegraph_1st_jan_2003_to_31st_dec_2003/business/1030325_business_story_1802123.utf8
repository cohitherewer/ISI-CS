The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, March 25, 2003 				 Keyed up for traffic surge
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 24: The telecom service operators are all set to meet the increased telecom traffic from All Fools Day  both mobile to mobile and fixed to mobile.																								The initial investment and focus has been to expand the mobile network by increasing the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC) or upgrading the same. 																								It is a challenge that we have faced in times of crisis or a major national or international event. It will not be a problem since the MSCs have been upgraded and we can offer the best quality of service that the existing subscribers receive, said Sunil Bharti Mittal, group chairman of Bharti Enterprises.																								The mobile service providers AirTel, Hutch, RPG, Idea, BPL and Bharat Sanchar Nigam that operate in the four metros Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta  have upgraded their MSCs to accommodate the increased traffic and increased talk time. 																								There will not be any problem of network congestion. We are prepared to meet the increased talk time and network congestion, but we cannot rule out a few hiccups in the first week of next month. When a new service or a package is announced there is an initial euphoria like what we saw when the Metro was introduced in Delhi and in Calcutta, said a senior official in BSNL.

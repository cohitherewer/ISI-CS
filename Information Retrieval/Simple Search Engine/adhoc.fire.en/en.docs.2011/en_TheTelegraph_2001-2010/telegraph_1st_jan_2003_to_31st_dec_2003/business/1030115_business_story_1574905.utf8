 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 14: In what promises to be one of the largest launches in the history of the telecom industry worldwide, Reliance Infocomm will launch its pan-India mobile service  Reliance IndiaMobile  tomorrow.																								The Reliance IndiaMobile service is the largest and most complex launch of mobile telephony combined with computing anywhere in the world, Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said on the eve of the rollout.																								The national roll-out will commence with product and services demonstrations in all major towns and cities and registration of customers.																								Over 50,000 Dhirubhai Ambani entrepreneurs enrolled across the country are ready to acquire customers, the company said.																								We are overwhelmed by the interest expressed by people from all over the country in the next generation Reliance IndiaMobile service and the Dhirubhai Ambani Pioneer offer, Ambani added. 																								Reliance IndiaMobiles call rate of 40 paise per minute is the lowest in the country, whether among mobile or fixed line, local or STD calls.																								The real cost of a call is lowered further with billing at a pulse rate of 15 seconds and free incoming calls. Reliance IndiaMobile also offers the lowest STD rates in the country at 40 paise per minute (Reliance IndiaMobile to Reliance IndiaMobile call) under the Dhirubhai Ambani Pioneer scheme.																								Whats more, users will hold not just a mobile phone in their hands, but a device that is an extension of a huge bank of computers connected to the largest server farm in India.																								Reliance IndiaMobile is the first mobile service to be launched on the CDMA technology platform in India. It can combine voice and data delivery, which are being leveraged with advanced handsets that have computing capability.																								The applications suite will include video and audio streaming, picture messaging, news tickers and magazines, games, e-mail, SMS and internet connectivity.																								Users will get the latest stock prices on their phones and can buy and sell shares while on the move.																								Reliances mobile services have generated a lot of controversy even before the actual launch. Cellular operators have already accused the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) of a bias in favour of wireless-in-local-loop technology.

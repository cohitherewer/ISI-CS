 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Shaw Wallace hunts for buyout targets
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Executive directors Komal C.Wazir and Niranjan M. Thakur in Calcutta on Tuesday. Picture by Kishore Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Sept. 16: Liquor major Shaw Wallace amp; Company told shareholders at its annual general meeting today that it had appointed management consultant McKinsey amp; Company to scout for takeover opportunities. Shaw Wallace has also asked McKinsey to chart a roadmap for the companys growth over the next three years.																								Alongside, Shaw Wallace is looking to upgrade the capacity of its production facilities. The company has already completed the expansion and upgradation of its unit at Aurangabad.																								The key objectives are expansion of business portfolio through new initiatives, strengthening brand equity of existing best-selling brands and creating brand extensions in the mid-priced and low-priced segments, Shaw Wallace director R. A. Shah told shareholders.																								Shaw Wallace hinted at the possibility of entering the country liquor segment. In India, country liquors sell roughly three times Indian-made foreign liquors (IMFL). This segment therefore offers great potential for growth for an organisation like ours that has a countrywide distribution network, Shaw Wallace said.																								In the IMFL segment, Shaw Wallace said it had tied up with wine-producers overseas to sell their products in India. Shaw Wallace has a partnership with liquor major Kyndal International. It has launched a brand of vodka from Kyndals portfolio, and said, it had plans of introducing more products from its partner in the near future.																								Ready-to-drink is another segment on which Shaw Wallace is focusing. A beginning has already been made with the launch of VEBA in Goa and Mumbai in association with Kyndal, and the company is firming up plans for an aggressive nationwide rollout, Shah told shareholders.																								Shaw Wallaces beer business has been converted into a 50:50 joint venture with SAB Miller  the worlds second largest brewer. Its large brewing capacity and multi-location presence gave it significant advantages over competitors, Shaw Wallace said.

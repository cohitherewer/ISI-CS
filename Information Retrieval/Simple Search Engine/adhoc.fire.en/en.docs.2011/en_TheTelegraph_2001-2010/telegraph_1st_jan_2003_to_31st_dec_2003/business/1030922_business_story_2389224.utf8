 Monday, September 22, 2003 				 CII report bullish on small firms
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 21: Small and medium term enterprises are expected to see positive shift in production, capacity utilisation and turnover in the next six months, says the CII CEOs snap poll. 																								However, the poll categorically points out while this sector foresees a positive shift in business situation during the next six months, the sector also sees domestic and international competition as a major limiting factor for its growth. Poll analysis reveal that while 69 per cent of the respondents are optimistic about the general business scenario, 24 per cent expect the situation to remain same with a continued trend for low to moderate demand. 																								With almost 50 per cent of the respondents showing a decline in the last six months, CII feels it is evident that the competition is making the SMEs feel the heat of the dismantling of quantitative restrictions. Also, the most encouraging finding of the survey indicated that close to 80 per cent respondents want to make capital investments this year.

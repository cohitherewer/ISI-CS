 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, Nov. 23: Fortune Informatics Limited has launched k-click ReportSuite Enterprise, a product that enables companies in the services and manufacturing sector to communicate better with their clients.																								The sectors that can utilise k-click include banking, insurance, telecom, manufacturing, healthcare and education. The product enables them to provide itemised bills, invoices, premium receipts and agent commission forms at a lower cost.																								The Hyderabad-based software company plans to make k-click its flagship product. Fortune is one of the few companies pioneering the evolution of electronic document management and distributed output management solutions in the country.																								k-click will allow banks, telecom firms and insurance companies to provide instant responses to queries from customers by offering customised bills giving precise details of each spend. Bills prepared through the k-click software can be either accessed through the Net or obtained in a printed format.																								K-click will enable customers to view their transactions using several customised options.																								Fortune is among the few Indian software firms to concentrate on developing software products rather than offering services. Other companies include i-flex which has developed banking software Flexcube, south-based Ramco with its ERP solution Virtualworks and Subex Systems with its telecom software products.																								Flexcube has already captured global markets.																								Fortune hopes to replicate the success with k-click. quot;The k-click software shifts the balance of power from software vendors to software users, Fortune managing director C. K. Shastri said. The company is betting on an explosive global growth in digital documents.																								Chief executive Jayant Dwarakanath said the company has already received orders from Chennai-based cellular operator Aircel and telecom major Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited. He is hopeful of getting more orders from other telecom players.																								Chief technology officer Radhakrishnan R cited an instance of Amex which processes credit card statements for its Indian card users from its base in Australia. If the company uses k-click, its expenses on this score can reduce dramatically, he added.																								International Data Corporation and the Gartner Group are bullish on the emerging market space for electronic documents. These agencies peg the industry size at $10 to $15 billion by 2005. Fortune is gearing up to meet the exploding demand for digital documents, said Shastri.																								The three-year old company has already made inroads as a technology provider and claims to have a rich roster of clients in India and abroad.																								Fortune has joined hands with global hardware giants like Ricoh in extending its presence in 48 countries.																								Shastri said Tata Infotech and Aditya Birla group company PSI Data Systems are its local partners. CMS Computers and ICICI-owned BillJunction Payments are the other partners.																								Fortune has also got its products accredited by the National Software Testing Laboratory of the US.

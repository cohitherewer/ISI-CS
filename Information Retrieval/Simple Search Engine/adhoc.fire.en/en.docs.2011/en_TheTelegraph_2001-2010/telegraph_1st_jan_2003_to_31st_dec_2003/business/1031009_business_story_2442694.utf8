 Thursday, October 09, 2003 				 Five-year extension for dairy board chairperson
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Patel: On the job																								New Delhi, Oct. 8: Amrita Patel, the high-profile chairperson of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), was today handed a five-year extension by the government.																								Patel, who locked horns with Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) chairman Verghese Kurien in a high-stakes wrangle, breasted the tape in a two-horse contest with B. M. Vyas, the managing director of the Federation, sources familiar with the events said. Her new tenure begins in mid-November.																								Patels name was proposed by the agriculture ministry, and has been accepted by the government, sources said. A GCMMF official said he was not aware if Vyas was the candidate Kurien wanted at the helm of NDDB.																								GCMMF is the largest co-operative society in the country, and its flagship brand Amul is a household name in millions of homes that use milk and its derivatives. Sagar is another key name in its stable of brands. 																								Patel grabbed the headlines in recent months after she took on her one-time mentor Kurien  who earned the moniker of being the father of the White Revolution  in a spat over privatisation of state dairy federations through a series of tie-ups forged with deep-pocketed marketing firms. 																								The row later turned into a showdown between GCMMF and NDDB. It deepened when Patels organisation did not allow Mother Dairy, an affiliate outfit, to buy milk from the Anand-based co-operative to cope with the festival-fuelled surge in demand in Delhi.

 Friday, May 30, 2003 				 IMF pats policy on forex management
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 29: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has endorsed Indias management of foreign exchange reserves, which it says is in line with global best practices.																								The countrys reserve management operations have become more transparent, IMF said in a document published along with the guidelines for foreign exchange management.																								The emphasis is on efficient management of reserves and Indias policies like efficient use of technology, sound management of market risks, sophisticated risk management techniques and determination of optimal currency composition are comparable with international best practices, it said.																								As on May 17, 2003, Indias foreign exchange reserves reached a record level of $ 79,225 million.																								IMF said maintaining a capacity to intervene in markets to support the exchange rate regime or to contain excessive volatility in foreign exchange market as also to provide confidence to markets and reduce their vulnerability to financial crises are some of Indias important reserve management objectives.																								The document also observes that India intervenes to even out lumpy demand or supply in thin markets and to prevent destabilising speculation.

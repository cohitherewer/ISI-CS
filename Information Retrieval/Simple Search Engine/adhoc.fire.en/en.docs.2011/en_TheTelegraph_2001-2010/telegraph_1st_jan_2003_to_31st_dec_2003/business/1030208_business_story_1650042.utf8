 Saturday, February 08, 2003 				 DuPont to double sales by 2005
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 7: DuPont India is targeting sales of Rs 1,500 crore by 2005. We are aiming to double sales in three years in the country, said Charles O. Holiday, chairman and chief executive officer of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co (DuPont). 																								Although the company does not disclose its annual turnover for India operations, the officials said that the turnover expected by the end of this year is a little less than $ 200 million (about Rs 1,000 crore).																								However, since the company did not spell out the exact figure, it would be safe to assume that its turnover at present is about Rs 700-750 crore, which it wants to double by the end of 2005. 																								DuPont India is a subsidiary of US-based E.I. du Pont de Nemours.																								At present, DuPont India markets a wide range of products in varied segments, including food and nutrition, healthcare, apparel, home and construction, electronics and transportation. 																								Growing at an average of 14 per cent a year, DuPont employs about 600 people.

 Saturday, April 26, 2003 				 Trai nod must for tariffs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 25: In a move to discipline the telecom service providers in relation to the tariffs announced by them, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today directed them to first submit their tariff plans and announce it to customers after it is approved.																								The telecom regulator today effected the 27th amendment to the Telecommunication Tariff Order (TTO). The order specifies uniform applicability of the provisions of the reporting requirement of the tariff plans with Trai for approval by all telecom service providers. The order will come into force from April 25, 2003.																								Dr D. P. S. Seth, Trai member (technical), said, Through this order, the Authority will ensure compliance of tariffs with interconnect user charge (IUC) regulation. In addition, the compliance to regulatory principles of non-discrimination and predatory pricing would also be ensured.																								The operators will have to wait for five working days, and another five days if the regulator seeks clarifications, before they can launch or announce the new tariff. Till today they were announcing the tariff in advance and reporting to the regulator within seven days. This led to confusion, a senior Trai official said.																								The regulator had issued orders for the IUC regulation in January this year.

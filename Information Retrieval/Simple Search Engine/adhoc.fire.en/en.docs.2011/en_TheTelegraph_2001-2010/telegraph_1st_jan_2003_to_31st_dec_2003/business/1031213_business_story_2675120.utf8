 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 World Bank pledges to lend more
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Carter: Promisory note																								New Delhi, Dec. 12: The World Bank today said it may double annual lending to India to $2.5-3 billion within 2-3 years, and that it planned to raise $100 million from the domestic market through a bond issue.																								We have already discussed with the government, which wants the bank to increase lending. Our funding to India would increase substantially in the next 2-3 years, World Bank country director Michael Carter said.																								Sources said the bank was likely to raise lending from $1.7 billion to $2.5-3 billion by 2007.																								The World Bank official said his organisation would wish to concentrate on farm infrastructure among other things. He said the bank was eager to offer assistance to India in the development of rural roads, electrification and irrigation.																								Carter said although the bank favoured private participation in infrastructure projects, the government has to commit a bulk of the investment, especially in areas like irrigation.																								We are also talking to the governments of Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Punjab for fiscal and structural adjustments, Carter said.																								Of the total $1.7 billion sanctioned by the World Bank, Carter said half was through International Bank for Reconstruction and Developments (IBRDs) market-related rate and the remaining through International Development Associations (IDAs) concessional loans.																								The bank would discuss the next round of IDA loans with the government next year, he said.																								The portion of IBRD loans would go up substantially as there were some restrictions on the IDA loan sanction to India.																								Carter also said the bank had gained necessary permits to issue bonds worth Rs 450 crore or $100 million from the Indian market.																								The government approved the bonds a year ago. But our treasury department has to decide on the time of the bond issue, he said. 																								The bond issue will be used to part finance infrastructure, education and health sector projects which the bank is committed to fund.

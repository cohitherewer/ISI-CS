 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 Telecom tribunal goes data hunting
																								New Delhi, March 17 (PTI): The Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) today asked cellular and basic operators offering limited mobility telephony to furnish data relating to subscriber base and set-up costs for their services.																								The hearing on wireless in local loop (WiLL) case would begin from March 31, TDSAT said. The tribunal, headed by Justice D. P. Wadhwa, has directed that WiLL case would come up for hearing on March 31, April 1, 2, 7, 8 and 9.																								The tribunal has asked the basic operators offering limited mobility services to furnish data such as subscriber base of WiLL, set-up costs of WiLL services and the licence fee paid by them from the date of licence to migration package and from migration package till date. 																								The tribunal has also asked for data on set-up costs, subscriber base and licence fee from the cellular service providers. Moreover, it has allowed Reliance to be included as a party in the case.																								In December, 2002, the Supreme Court had set aside a verdict of TDSAT allowing basic operators to provide limited mobile services, and had asked the tribunal to re-examine the issue. 																								Allowing petitions filed by cellular operators against an order upholding the Centres decision to allow basic operators to provide mobility service on WiLL, the apex court had asked TDSAT to adjudicate the issue afresh, especially keeping in mind the grievance of the petitioners on absence of level playing field.

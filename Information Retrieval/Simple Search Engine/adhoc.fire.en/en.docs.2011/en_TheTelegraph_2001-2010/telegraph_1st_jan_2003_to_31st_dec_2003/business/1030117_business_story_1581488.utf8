 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 Fresh trouble at Lever city factory
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 16: Employees of Hindustan Levers factory in Garden Reach are on a warpath with the management yet again. The issue, this time, is retrenchment of some 500 staffers, says Kamal Tiwari, president of the employees union. The employees observed a days strike today, and threatened to go on strike for three days every month beginning February, unless the management reverses its decision. Tiwari said the management wants to close the unit.																								The management said the disruption of operation would seriously undermine the viability of the unit. Lever said the employees union (Hindustan Lever Shramik Karmachari Congress) had demanded an unrealistic increase in wages, and resisted efforts made by the management to improve productivity.																								The management believes to sustain the viability of the Garden Reach units operations, its productivity must improve and match the best factories within the company, HLL said.

 Wednesday, November 05, 2003 				 Basic operators withdraw appeal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 4: Basic telecom operators led by Reliance Infocomm today withdrew their case in the Supreme Court against a TDSAT order directing them to pay an additional entry fee for providing wireless-in- local-loop mobile (WiLL-M) services to its subscribers. 																								The Association of Basic Telecom Operators (ABTO) said in a statement that it had decided to withdraw its appeal in the Supreme Court against Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunals (TDSAT) judgment dated August 8 on WiLL(M) requiring an imposition of an additional entry fee for providing WiLL (M) services to its subscribers. 																								ABTO secretary-general S. C. Khanna said, This decision has been taken by the members of ABTO to ensure a litigation-free environment whereby the telecom sector can grow at a fast pace. 																								He further added, both the communications minister and the Trai chairperson had expressed hope that with the recent far-reaching developments, including the introduction of a unified licensing regime, the telecom sector will see fewer disputes. 																								Khanna said the ABTO had taken appropriate measures to immediately withdraw the appeal. This will ensure that consumers will not be under any uncertainty and would continue to avail of world-class telecom services offered by WiLL(M) operators, he added. 																								With this, the only litigation pending will be the COAIs appeal in the Supreme Court of India.

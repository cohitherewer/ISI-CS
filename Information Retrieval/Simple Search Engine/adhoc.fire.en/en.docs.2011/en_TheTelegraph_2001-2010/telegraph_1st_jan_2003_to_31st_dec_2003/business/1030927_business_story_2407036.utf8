 Saturday, September 27, 2003 				 Drop in mobile phone tariffs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 26: The overall cellular mobile tariff has declined by 59 per cent, while the wireless in local loop-based limited mobile phone tariff has dipped by 46 per cent from December 2000 to June 2003. 																								The decline in both cellular and WiLL (M) tariffs has been accompanied by a strong growth in the subscriber base over the period under study.																								According to a survey result analysed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the dip has happened due to various tariff packages released by the operators and the standard tariff announced by Trai.																								A senior Trai official said, For determination of effective charges shown, only post paid tariff plans have been assessed. Within these plans, only local calls have been taken into account as these calls constitutes about 75 per cent of the total usage of voice telephony in the country.																								While calculating tariffs from the two services, Trai has based its calculation on 400 minutes of usage per month and 100 minutes usage per month per subscriber from December 2000 to June 2003.																								The effective amount per minute, including all fixed and variable costs paid by the subscriber for 400 minutes/month of usage has declined from Rs 2.73 per month for the quarter ending December 2000 to Rs 1.12 per month for the quarter ended June 2003.																								The study based its analysis on the data available in the tariff plans of various service providers that were operating in the market. 																								On the basis of known weights for key parameters, the minimum charges (amongst all reported tariff plans) available for local calls both through cellular and through WiLL (M) have been arrived at for the period under study.

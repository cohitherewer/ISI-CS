 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 LG homes in on Bengal sourcing
 GARIMA SINGH				 Local pool 																								New Delhi, Dec. 14: LG Electronics India Limited is looking to outsource consumer home appliances from a local manufacturer in Bengal.																								We hope to enter into a third-party alliance with a local manufacturer to meet the requirements of Bengal. It will take us another three months before we finalise the deal, company managing director Kwang-Ro Kim told The Telegraph.																								He said the company will invest another $40 million in India in 2004-05. 																								Kim said, From electronics and home appliances, we now want to diversify into personal computers and GSM-enabled mobile phones.																								LG, which is expected to post a turnover of Rs 4,500 crore, has spent nearly 5 per cent of its revenues on advertisement and promotional campaigns.																								Kim said the company hopes to garner 10 per cent of its total colour television sales from its recently launched range of display products. 																								The NDP range primarily consists of plasma display panels, LCDs, projectors and projection televisions  all of which are aimed at the high-end consumer.																								While LG enjoys a market share of 18.2 per cent in the colour television category, flat televisions have registered a growth of 283.7 per cent last year.																								The company, which is in the process of setting up its second manufacturing plant in Pune after Greater Noida (near Delhi), will also commence operations next year.																								The Pune factory will essentially be used for our exports expected to be to the tune of $100 million in 2004, said Kim. Countries in West Asia and Africa are the main markets to which the company will export its products.																								At present, the manufacturing facility at Greater Noida manufactures a wide range of colour televisions, washing machines, air-conditioners, microwave ovens and direct cool refrigerators.																								LG, which boasts of extensively catering to the rural and semi-urban population of the country, hopes to garner 35-40 per cent of its total sales turnover from this segment.																								Although Kim denied LGs plans to enter into any film celebrity contract to endorse its products, a senior company official had earlier said, In India, only two things sell well  cinema and sports. We are likely to endorse a sports celebrity to promote our product range.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 23: Madura Garments, the readymade garment division of Indian Rayon and Industries Ltd, is in the midst of a transition that seeks to enhance the differentiation across its product range and tap new segments to boost its topline growth. 																								The emphasis on value growth in an intensely competitive environment will see two of its power brands, Louis Philippe and Van Heusen, sporting more expensive ranges. Apart from this, the company is evolving a new line of business from Byford, the brand which will be focussed towards institutional sales. 																								According to Vikram Rao, group executive president, Madura Garments, the company has talked to over 1,000 human-resource heads in its bid to portray the Byford brand as quality work-wear.																								However, its in Louis Philippe where an attempt is now being made to depict it as a super-premium brand to take on major foreign brands that are imported to the country. 																								Gupta pointed out that Madura Garments would take this brand further up by unveiling shirts bordering on the luxury range. Such shirts would be priced between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 and they would take up the price range of this brand from the existing confines of Rs 900 to Rs 1,500.																								We are aiming for a clear differentiation across our products. Even in Van Heusen, which is more of a corporate wear priced between Rs 600 to Rs 900, there will be a range in excess of Rs 1,100, he stated.

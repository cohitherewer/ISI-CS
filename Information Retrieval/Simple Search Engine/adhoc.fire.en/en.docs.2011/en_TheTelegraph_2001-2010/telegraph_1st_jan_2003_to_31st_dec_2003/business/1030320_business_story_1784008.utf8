 Thursday, March 20, 2003  North Block counts the cost of war
 Inflation, subsidy bills to shoot  up JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY New Delhi, March 19: The  finance ministry has started counting the cost of war in  the Gulf  and it doesnt make for pretty reading. In a study prepared for the Cabinet  Committee on Security, the finance ministry has warned that  a prolonged war in the Gulf may result in higher inflation,  lower tax collections, higher subsidy bills and higher expenditure  on internal security. In its confidential likely scenario,  the ministry says that the rate of inflation, which is hovering  around 5 per cent, is likely to shoot up by another 2 per  cent if the war lasts for more than six weeks, mostly driven  by hardening of the international price of crude to about  $ 45 a barrel as well as domestic freight costs. A 2 per cent rise in wholesale  prices could see consumer prices increasing by a far greater  extent, causing public resentment in an election year. The  finance ministry is already keeping a strict vigil on prices  and has asked the revenue department to talk turkey with  industry chambers to counsel their members against huge  price hikes. To check price increases, the  ministry says it will offer to lower duties on petro-goods.  This is expected to cushion increases in prices of diesel  and petrol, but will not impact kerosene and cooking gas  prices much as taxes on these commodities are far lower.  It will also use the huge buffer stock of over 40 million  tonnes to keep food prices stable. A war in the region is likely  to strengthen terrorist forces in Pakistan and Kashmir which  could lead to significant increase in internal security  expenses. However, the ministry does not spell out the expected  cost increases on this count. The government forecast indicates  that higher inflation and uncertainty in the region could  also see lower investment by both foreign and domestic investors,  who will tend to be cautious. However, a huge forex reserves  of over $ 72 billion is expected to cushion Indias trade  and debt repayments and even pull the rupee up under certain  circumstances. Lower investments, on the other  hand, are expected to translate into lower GDP growth to  levels far below the estimated 6 per cent, assumed while  working out budget figures. It could be as low as this  years 4.4 per cent, top economists working for the finance  ministry said. The ministry is scared that this  in turn will hit tax collections, especially excise and  corporate tax collections which would be down if the economy  does not do well.  The domino effect of crude price  hikes will also be felt on cooking gas and kerosene, whose  real price will go up by 60 per cent, the study feels. However,  to keep this in check the subsidy doled out on this account  will be increased. The bill already stands at about Rs 6,300  crore; this could be expected to cross Rs 10,000-crore mark. The subsidy bill for fertilisers  too is expected to go up from the present Rs 12,700 crore  as gas prices will go up steeply. Exports to take a hit Imports of the US from the rest  of the world are expected to suffer even though it will  spend about $ 200 billion on this war. As a large portion  of Indian exports is meant for US shores, this would imply  far lower export growth. And as Indias two biggest export  earners are textiles and gems and jewellery, both of which  are likely to be hit by war sentiments, prolonged war could  even see a temporary negative dip in exports.

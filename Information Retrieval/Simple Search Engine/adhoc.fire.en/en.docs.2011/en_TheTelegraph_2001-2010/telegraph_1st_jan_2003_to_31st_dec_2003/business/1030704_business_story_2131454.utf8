The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, July 04, 2003 				 Chase the executives
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, July 3: Reliance Infocomm gave the war over wireless-in-local-loop (WiLL) a new edge with a plan that aims to lure loquacious corporate customers in droves.																								Its corporate-user-group scheme allows members of a group unlimited talk-time if they pay Rs 150 every month. As few as five individuals of a firm who subscribe to any IndiaMobile plan can coalesce into a group.																								For Rs 150, they can call each other, free of cost, irrespective of how long and how often they chat. In effect, this means there will be no limit on the number of calls one can make, just as there is no cap on the size of a group.																								Reliance sources said the scheme has been designed to address corporate needs and to make services to this section of subscribers more meaningful.																								While cellular operators across the country are providing these kind of services only within city limits, our facility will be available across a state, they added.																								For instance, AirTel and Hutch offer corporate user group facilities to a sprinkling of Calcutta companies, but their executives get unlimited talk-time only in the city. Reliance has taken that facility to all points in the state.

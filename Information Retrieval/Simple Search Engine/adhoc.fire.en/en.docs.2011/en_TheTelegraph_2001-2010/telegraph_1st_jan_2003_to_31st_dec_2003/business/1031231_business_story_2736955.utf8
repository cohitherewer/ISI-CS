 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 ICAI baulks at changes in statute
 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, Dec. 30: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is preparing to make a representation to the government opposing the CA amendment act that has been approved by the cabinet recently. 																								The bill to amend the Act will seriously undermine the autonomy of the Institute of chartered Accountants of India, ICAI president R. Bupathy told The Telegraph.																								Recently, the government had cleared the proposal to introduce a comprehensive legislation that will amend the Chartered Accountants (CA) Act of 1949, Cost and Works Accountants Act 1959 and Company Secretaries Act of 1980 to bring in more transparency and harmonise the rules governing these associations. The administrative machinery for all three is the department of company affairs. 																								On several counts the bill is not in tune with the Naresh Chandra committees recommendations. When ICAI was consulted for the purpose, it was to implement these recommendations. The bill, has taken only a few suggestions of the recommendations, left out some important ones, and most importantly cuts on the autonomy of the institute, said Bupathy. 																								On the constitution of the appellate authority, the committee recommendation was that its cost should be borne by the government, but the bill passes this on to the ICAI, said Bupathy. 																								Further, the cost of setting up the appellate authority will not be shared by the two sister institutes  ICSI and ICWAI. There will be three members on the tribunal who will be common for all cases, while two additional members will come from each institute depending on the case.																								Some of the important recommendations of the Naresh Chandra committee have been left out like the measures to ensure that non-chartered accountants do not do auditing function, said Bupathy. 																								The ICAI president felt that the provisions seeking to bring about harmonisation with the other two institutes place restrictions on ICAI instead of liberalising the norms for ICWAI and ICSI.																								To buttress his argument, Bupathy said Section 30 A that is being introduced in the bill for CA Act, in tune with similar provisions in the other two Acts, the government is empowering itself to give directions to ICAI, which is essentially an autonomous body and has been working well for the past 53 years. The government is trying to increase its representation on the ICAI council. On another front, it wants to have greater say in internal matters like the overseas travel of ICAI members, he said. 																								Another area of disagreement is the Quality Review Board (QRB) to be formed to review the performance of peers in the profession. 																								The Naresh Chandra committee had recommended that QRB to be formulated by ICAI whereas the bill places the onus on the government. Unlike the committee, the bill does not make it mandatory for government to choose the chairman of QRB, in consultation with ICAI. 																								Bupathy said the bill was also short on clarity in terms of the procedure that would be followed when complaints came before the ICAI council.

The pact focuses on developing innovative technologies for PET resin, polyester filament, and polyester staple fibres.																								A new state-of-the-art research and technology centre that the company is building at Patalganga, near Mumbai, will house the most sophisticated polyester-research equipment and pilot-lines for polyester featuring DuPonts revolutionary new NG-3 PET resin technology. Downstream pilot facilities will include plants to simulate customers operations in bottle processing, yarn texturing, weaving and poly-cotton spinning.																								DPT is the technology development and licensing arm of DuPont Textiles amp; Interiors. The strategic alliance will enable both companies to explore new areas of research and pursue promising projects on the table.																								The alliance, Reliance said, will benefit polyester customers, accelerating the delivery of products in a cost-effective manner. This will be done by building pilot and commercial-scale facilities at Patalganga and other places.

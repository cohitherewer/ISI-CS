 Sunday, July 06, 2003 				 Closer ties in trade sought
																								Bali, July 5 (Reuters): European and Asian finance ministers met on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on Saturday to boost cooperation in trade, investment and finance as the world economy shows scattered signs of recovery.																								The annual gathering of officials from the European Union, China, Japan and eight other Asian nations are expected to stress closer coordination in macro-economic policy between their regions, home to about a third of the worlds population.																								European countries are entering into an integrated single market, while we have just started to strengthen our bond market. There will be talks on how to synergise these efforts, said Indonesias chief economics minister, Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti.																								But, as in previous ASEM ministerial forums, new policies of substance are unlikely by the end of the two days of talks, and much of the agenda centres on technical issues, such as pooling ideas on how to keep Asias fledgling financial markets stable.																								The Bali meeting comes less than two weeks after 11 Asia-Pacific nations launched a new $ 1 billion Asia Bond Fund, drawn from their huge central bank reserves, to speed development of a regional bond market.																								That Thai initiative is seen as a catalyst for Asia to woo back some of its assets invested outside the region, especially in US bonds. But delegates in Bali said the weekend meeting would only touch lightly on ways to develop the fund.																								The Asian Bond Fund is not central to the meetings, one European delegate said.																								Asia has around two-thirds of global foreign exchange reserves but its bond markets are less developed. Many Asian companies still rely on short-term bank loans for funding, raising the risk of volatility if banks cut credit lines.																								In Asias financial crisis of 1997/98, the banks did just that, and Asian policy makers are now under pressure to find ways to funnel savings directly into Asian investments, bypassing Western financial institutions, to nourish future growth.																								The bond market in Asia is still weak. If we really want to have a stronger financial system in Asia after the crisis, the Asian bond market must be further developed, said Kuntjoro-Jakti.																								The EU and Asian officials are also trying to find ways to avoid a stalemate at the World Trade Organization liberalisation talks launched at Doha in Qatar, in the run-up to a ministerial meeting in Cancun, Mexico, in September.																								Some states, such as China, are concerned the round will founder on a lack of consensus.

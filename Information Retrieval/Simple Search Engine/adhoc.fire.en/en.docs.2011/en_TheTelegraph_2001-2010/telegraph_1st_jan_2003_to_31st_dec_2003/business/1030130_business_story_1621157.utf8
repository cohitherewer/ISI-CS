The board of directors has declared an interim dividend of 50 per cent for the current financial year, which works out to Rs 5 per share.																								Higher price realisations on the stock of petroleum products and improvement in the refining margins are reported to have contributed to the increased profits in the first year of the dismantling of administered pricing in the hydrocarbon sector.																								During the three quarters of this fiscal, IOC sold 34.97 million metric tonne (MMT) of petroleum products.																								For the same period, the corporations seven refineries achieved a throughput of 25.96 MMT, and the 6,500-km network transported 30.60 MMT of crude oil and petroleum products.

The company said the outlook for the fourth quarter was positive.

Mahindra and Mahindras indigenously developed utility vehicle, Scorpio, received an overwhelming market response and the demand for the vehicle continues to outstrip the supply since its launch in June 2002.

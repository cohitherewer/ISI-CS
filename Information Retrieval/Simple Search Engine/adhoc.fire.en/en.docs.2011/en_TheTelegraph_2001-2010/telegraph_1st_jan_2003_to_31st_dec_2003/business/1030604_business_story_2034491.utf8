 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 3: Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited plans to set up a chain of research and development (R amp;D) laboratories abroad, starting with North America.																								Speaking to reporters here today, Rashmi H. Barbhaiya, president for research and development said, Outside India, research facility will start in North America. It will complement the R amp;D facility in India, especially in phase-three trials.																								Ranbaxy is increasing its spending on R amp;D from 4.5 per cent of sales to 6 per cent this year and it will go up to 10 per cent in the next five years, the executive added.																								The Rs 2,800-crore turnover Ranbaxy Labs currently has a research facility in Gurgaon, where it has two buildings and a third one is coming up. However, Barbhaiya said no time frame has been set for the offshore facility.																								At present, Ranbaxy has about 800 R amp;D personnel. We plan to double the scope of the gamut of activities being carried out by the R amp;D division, Barbhaiya said.																								Barbhaiya also said Ranbaxy has developed two molecules for a drug to combat malaria and will now narrow down the research to just one molecule within a month. However, he added that it took five to eight years for the final version of the drug to be ready.																								Ranbaxy has recently entered into collaborative research with Medicines for Malaria Venture, Geneva for development of an anti-malarial drug. In this project, the role of Ranbaxy is to complete all pharmaceutical and clinical development activities to seek worldwide approval for sales and marketing, Barbhaiya said.

 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Calcutta brokers fume amp; fret
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Aug. 12: Clouds  are gathering on Lyons Range yet again with brokers threatening  to block the corporatisation of the Calcutta Stock Exchange  (CSE).																								The board members of the exchange went into a huddle today to decide on the date of an extra-ordinary general meeting where the authorities will seek the approval of the members to turn CSE into a corporation.																								But the five broker-directors who attended todays hurriedly-convened meeting, said the members would not give their go-ahead to the proposal for demutualisation until the authorities had completed the audit of CSEs accounts.																								The exchange has yet to complete a special audit of its members deposits (held in the Settlement Guarantee Fund), and could not have its accounts for 2001-02 passed by the brokers at its last annual general meeting.																								Ten months since and its nearly time to hold the AGM for the year that ended in March 2003, but the auditors have not submitted the report as yet.																								Nearly all brokers want to withdraw their deposits with the exchange, and hence want the management to determine the corpus of the Settlement Guarantee Fund. The authorities had to dip into the fund to meet the Rs 120-crore payment shortfall in March 2001.																								The authorities turn deaf ear to all our demands. Why do they need to have an EGM, when its already time to hold the AGM for 2002-03? They must complete the special audit of our deposits before anything moves, said a fuming broker-director who had walked out on the authorities a little earlier.																								Supriya Gupta, president of the exchange said: The audit of the SGF is nearly complete. The records were in complete shambles, and hence it took so long.																								The members of the exchange must appreciate that the government has decided to turn all bourses into corporations, and we cant do anything about it. Sebi has asked us to obtain their approval within the month, failing which the regulator might even derecognise CSE.																								The authorities, in the larger interest of CSE members, are likely to go ahead and convene the EGM soon notwithstanding the impasse.																								Meanwhile, L. B. Jha amp; Co.  the CSE auditors  has submitted the final report on valuation of the exchanges assets. The auditors have kept the final valuation unchanged at around Rs 75 crore .

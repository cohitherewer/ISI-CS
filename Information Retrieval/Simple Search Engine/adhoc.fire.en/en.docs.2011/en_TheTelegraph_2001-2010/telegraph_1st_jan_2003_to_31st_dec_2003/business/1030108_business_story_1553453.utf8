 Wednesday, January 08, 2003 				 Cut in mobile radio fees
																								New Delhi, Jan. 7 (PTI): The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today recommended a reduction in licence fees, including spectrum charges, to 5 per cent from the current 8 per cent, for private mobile radio trunking services (PMRTS) operators to facilitate growth in the sector.																								Licence fees to be paid to the department of telecom and wireless planning and coordination (WPC) and the royalty for spectrum together should not exceed 5 per cent of the adjusted gross revenue from the current 7.4-8.6 per cent, Trai said.																								Meanwhile, the telecom regulator is likely to move the dispute settlement mechanism against its decision allowing Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) to announce cellular tariffs without the regulators permission. 																								Trai is believed to have decided to move the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), which has allowed BSNL to announce cellular tariffs without seeking the regulators prior approval and continue its introductory tariff scheme called Plan-325.																								Trai feels the move could lead to cross subsidisation, sources said.

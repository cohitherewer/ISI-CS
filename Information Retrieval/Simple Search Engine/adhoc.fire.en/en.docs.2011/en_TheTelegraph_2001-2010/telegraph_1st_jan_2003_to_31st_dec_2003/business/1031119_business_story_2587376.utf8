																								Shanghai, Nov. 18 (PTI): Air-India today opened its first office in China in the east Chinese metropolis of Shanghai, ahead of the inaugural flight on December 11. 																								Consul-general of India in Shanghai, Sujan Chinoy, commended the efforts of both Air-India and the Chinese authorities leading to the opening of the first Air-India office in China. 																								The timing of the establishment of the Air-India office was most opportune, in view of burgeoning trade and economic exchanges between the two neighbouring countries, he said. 																								He also noted that bilateral ties had received considerable fillip following Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit to China in June. 																								China Eastern Airlines had commenced its operations to India last year.

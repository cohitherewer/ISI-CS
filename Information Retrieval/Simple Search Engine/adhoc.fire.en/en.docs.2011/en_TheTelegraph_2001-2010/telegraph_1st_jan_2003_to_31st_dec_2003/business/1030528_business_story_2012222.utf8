 Wednesday, May 28, 2003 				 Single platform, several variants
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, May 27: Tata Engineering will build its future cars on the X-1 platform, which provides the base for Indica and Indigo models, according to V. Sumantran, executive director of Telcos passenger car segment. 																								The X-1 platform will house the new variants in the Indica family, namely the station wagon and the sports model. Global majors like Volkswagen also have one platform with several variants, he said.																								With the new variants based on the X-1 platform, we will cater to over 70 per cent of the Indian car market, Sumantran added. 																								Telco has already unveiled its station wagon at the Geneva motor show based on this platform. P. P. Kadle, executive director (finance), called the strategy an execution of platform stretching that will enable the company to bring out newer models at lower costs.																								According to analysts, with product development costs hitting the ceiling and pricing pressures forcing many companies to competitively price their new products, the global car industry has veered to this new concept. 																								They aver that the auto industry has been exploiting the concept of platform engineering for some time as it helps them cut product costs.

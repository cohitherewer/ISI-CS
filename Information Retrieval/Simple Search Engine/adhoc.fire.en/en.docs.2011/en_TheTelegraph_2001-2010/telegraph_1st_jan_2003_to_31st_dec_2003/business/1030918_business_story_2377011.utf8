 Thursday, September 18, 2003 				 Cellular, basic firms differ
																								New Delhi, Sept. 17 (PTI): Cellular operators today expressed serious concern over Trais proposed unification of licences saying the move appeared only to legalise the WiLL services into full-blown mobile services.																								On the other hand, basic operators offering WiLL mobile services welcomed Trais move and said this would go a long way in achieving the NTP targets of teledensity and rural telephony.																								The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said this would create serious problems in the contractual rights of service providers as these rights have been procured after paying heavy licence fees.																								S. C. Khanna of the Association of Basic Telecom Operators said, We are in favour of unification of licences. This will pave the way for growth in the telecom sector.

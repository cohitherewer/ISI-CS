 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Gail pipeline to carry gas from Petronet completed
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Ready to go																								New Delhi, Dec. 30: Gail (India) has readied its Dahej-Vijaipur pipeline to transport 4 million standard cubic metres of gas per day (MMSCMD) to the northern states.																								The gas will be transported from the countrys first re-gassified LNG (R- LNG) terminal, set up by Petronet LNG Ltd (PLL) at Dahej in Gujarat. The first phase of the pipeline is awaiting commissioning for the first parcel of gas to be carried right up to New Delhi. 																								In January this year, the company had set itself a target of compressing the schedule of the pipeline project by as many as nine months to synchronise it with the completion schedule of Petronets project.																								Gail has already completed the Dahej-Vemar section of the DVPL ahead of schedule. At Vemar, the gas can enter the existing Hazira-Bijaipur-Jagdishpur (HBJ) gas pipeline system to reach up to Delhi. 																								Petronet is expecting the first LNG cargo to reach the Indian shores by January. The first year of operation will see 2.5 million tonnes of LNG flowing in the DVPL pipeline, which is equivalent to approximately 10 MMSCMD.																								With the expected completion of the remaining section of the pipeline up to Vijaipur in Madhya Pradesh by January 26, the 610 km pipeline system will be ready to evacuate the entire quantity of up to 10 MMSCMD of gas from PLL, Dahej.

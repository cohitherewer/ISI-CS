Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the consortium leader, has already sent a specimen debt restructuring agreement copy to the HPL promoters for their perusal.																								The banks and FIs today met the HPL management to review the overall operational and financial performance of the company so that they could form their views about the company before going to the corporate debt restructuring cell.																								Interest has to be paid first, said a senior banker after coming out from the one-and-a-half hour meeting.																								The company today explained its stand on interest payment to the banks and FIs. 																								According to the interim restructuring package okayed by IDBI, the company has to clear interest till June 30, 2002. HPL has cleared interest till March 31, 2002, a senior official of HPL said.																								The company, in general, makes interest payment twice in a year  once on March 31 and the other on September 30. Now that IDBI has asked us to clear interest till June 30, 2002 we have written to them to find a way out. There are many lenders whom we pay on September 30. Once IDBI directs us what to do we will clear the interest, the official added.																								We have explained the companys performance to the banks and Fis. We feel that the financial problem of the company will come to an end shortly.																								The IDBI official present at the meeting said, We will express our views at the CDR.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, April 17, 2003 				 Cobra comes back for a kill
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Fit for a king: Perses Bilimoria, regional director of Cobra Beer, in Calcutta on Wednesday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, April 16: Karan Bilimoria of the Cobra curry Beer fame is gearing up to take on the Mallyas and Chhabrias of India after edging out competitors from 5,000 Indian restaurants in the UK.																								To take on the Indian brands, the UK-based Cobra Beer will be investing around $ 10 million  or Rs 50 crore  to create brewing capacity in India.																								Currently imported from the UK, Cobra has been soft-launched in the leading metros. It sells mostly in leading hotels, clubs and restaurants in India at a higher price than local brands.																								Founded by Karan Bilimoria in 1989, Cobra Beer shifted its base from India to the UK in 1997. Positioned as an ideal beer to accompany Indian curry, Cobra has emerged as one of the fastest growing brands in the UK with annual revenues approaching  50 million.																								One in every four bottles of beer sold in Indian restaurants in the UK is a Cobra, the company claims. It is also available in nearly all the high-street stores there, and is exported to virtually all countries in the continent. It has also entered the US market recently as the Mogul.																								Perses Bilimoria, regional director for India, said: We cannot compete with local brands if our product has to be imported from the UK. It attracts all the duties of the world that makes our product far more expensive than its competitors. We have to create brewing capacity in India, for which we are going to invest around $ 10 million.																								The company was looking at various alternatives, including acquisition of existing capacity, he said, but refused to divulge potential takeover targets.																								We are in talks with hundreds of people. We are discussing various arrangements including contract brewing. We hope to establish our own brewing capacity here within the next few months, he added. 																								But Cobra cannot go back to where it started  Mysore Breweries. Its being taken over by the South African Breweries. We cant go back there, he said.

 Sunday, November 30, 2003 				 Unification of phone services in 6 months
																								New Delhi, Nov. 29 (PTI): Close on the heels of unifying basic and cellular licences, communications and IT minister Arun Shourie today said the sector would move to full unification for all telecom services in six months, unless corporate rivalry placed roadblocks.																								The first step was to unify basic and cellular licences. Trai has said that full unification would be in place in six months. I am sure we will meet that target, unless corporate rivalry stops us, Shourie said at the launch of Sifys new video-conferencing service here.																								Full unification would allow operators to offer any services on any technology. Why should the government sit in judgement (of technology), Shourie said.																								He said the governments efforts were aimed at freeing consumers from silos of licencing and added, the idea is now to move to automatic authorisation. Everybody will see the advantages of technology. If corporate rivalry attempts to stall technological progress citing ambit of licences, I hope courts will throw out such challenges so Indians can be pioneers in accessing new technology, Shourie said.

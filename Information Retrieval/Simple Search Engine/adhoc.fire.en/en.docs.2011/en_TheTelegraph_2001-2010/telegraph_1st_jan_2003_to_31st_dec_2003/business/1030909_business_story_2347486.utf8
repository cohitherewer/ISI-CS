 Tuesday, September 09, 2003 				 Honda sways to Asimos beat 
 SRINJOY SHARMA				 	 Asimo shows off its dancing skills in New Delhi on Monday, (AFP)																								New Delhi, Sept. 8: Hes not groomed to groove, but the first nuts-and-bolts man to jive to the tune of Dil Chahta Hai would have left Bollywoods rhythm kings gasping.																								Meet Asimo, the two-legged, 1.2 metre (four-feet) robot, whose Japanese name roughly means the cock of modernity. This afternoon, he played to the gallery, showing off his new skills, and keeping the audience in thrall.																								Asimo  an acronym for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility  is Honda Motors baby. Unlike Sony Corps virtual pet dog Aibo or SDR-4X, and Omron Corps robo-cat Necor, Asimo does more by wagging a tail or dancing.																								In the making for 17 years at Japans third largest carmaker and weighing 52 kgs, Asimo has come a long way since he was unveiled a year ago. He responds to sign language and, though he primarily remains an entertainer, he has inspired hopes of being a home companion.																								Thats one of the reasons Asimo is 120 cms  more than twice as tall as the SDR-4X  despite technological challenges posed by taller robots, Honda officials said. A robot, they say, must be at least this size to move about at home with tabletops, doorknobs and stairs.																								If you are going to have something that moves with ease in a human environment, it is better to design it like a human, said Siriporn Ounkhuma, a senior Honda official.

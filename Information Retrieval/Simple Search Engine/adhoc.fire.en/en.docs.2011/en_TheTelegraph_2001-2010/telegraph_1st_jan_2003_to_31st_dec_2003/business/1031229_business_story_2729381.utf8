 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 One year to go for listing authority
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 28: The Central Listing Authority, which is being set up to vet capital issues, may not be fully functional until a year later.																								A member of its board said the arm of the securities market regulator will start working within months, and by April, it will be vetting all applications for primary offering of shares.																								There are some 11 variants of capital issues, including rights, debts and preferential allotment of shares. The Central Listing Authority will regulate all forms of capital issues when it is fully functional.																								It will take another six months to a year (from April next year) to cover the whole range of capital issues, said the board member.																								A 10-member board of the proposed primary market regulator, led by former Chief Justice M. . Venkatachelliah, has been formed.																								T. R. Rangaswami, who has over 25 years experience in capital markets, has been appointed as the chief executive officer. He has previously worked with the National Stock Exchange.																								Rangaswami will join the Central Listing Authority in early January. He will be an ex-officio member of its board.																								The nine members of the Central Listing Authoritys board are S. A. Dave (a capital market expert), G. Muniappan (deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India), Amit Mitra (secretary general of Ficci), Raju P. Chitale (a chartered accountant) R. S. Nigam (an academician) Prithvi Haldea (an analyst) Ravi Narain (managing director and chief executive of the National Stock Exchange) Manoj Vaish (executive director and chief executive of Bombay Stock Exchange) and Manjit Singh (executive director of Ludhiana Stock Exchange).																								The primary market is showing some signs of recovery. Prithvi Haldea, a primary market analyst, says 160 top-rung companies have indicated plans to raise Rs 50,000 crore.																								Even if one in ten capital issue plans materialise, the depths of the countrys financial markets would be tested.																								Each time the primary market has revived, fly-by-night operators have taken investors for a ride. The Central Listing Authority will have a significant role to play in protecting investors.

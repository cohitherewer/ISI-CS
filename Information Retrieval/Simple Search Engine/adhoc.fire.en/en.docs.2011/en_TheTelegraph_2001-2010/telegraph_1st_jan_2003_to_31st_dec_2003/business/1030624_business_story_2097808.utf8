 Tuesday, June 24, 2003 				 NTPC to tap all sources of energy
 M. RAJENDRAN																								KolDam, June 23: The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) plans to generate power from all sources of energy  thermal, gas, hydel, atomic and non-conventional energy like solar and wind power.																								It also claims to have set a benchmark in the rehabilitation and resettlement of displaced persons as a result of various hydro projects in the country.																								The company, with an installed capacity of 21,249 megawatts (MW), has set an ambitious target of generating 56,000 MW of power by 2017 through various sources of energy. NTPC generates 16,980 MW on its own, another 314 MW through two joint venture companies using coal as the raw material, and 3,955 MW using gas and liquid fuels like naphtha.																								According to a senior NTPC official: It is part of our growth plan. We will be present in all sources of energy and this will help us offset any drop in generation from one source.																								The company has set a target of generating 11,000 MW from hydro power over the next few years. 																								NTPCs first ever hydro venture, the 800 MW (4x 200) KolDam power project in Himachal Pradesh over the river Sutlej is expected to be commissioned a year in advance by 2007. The project, which is under construction at an estimated cost of Rs 4,043 crore, is expected to provide power at a rate of Rs 2.70 per unit and is expected to cost 10 paise per unit after 10 years from the date of commissioning.																								K. B. Dubey, executive director (Hydro) NTPC, said, We will have both organic and inorganic growth to emerge as the major power generator. When we decided to enter the hydro sector, we wanted to take over the Nathpa Jhakri hydro project. But, when the negotiations failed, we decided to start a project from scratch.

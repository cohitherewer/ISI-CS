The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Break-up plan for power board
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Charged up																								Calcutta, Dec. 18: A roadmap has been drawn up to split West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) into two divisions that will independently handle transmission and distribution functions.																								The plan has been formulated by a committee headed by Subimal Sen, which was asked to suggest ways to restructure the states power sector.																								The committee has recommended that two separate companies should be formed to handle the transmission and distribution operations. After the break-up, WBSEB will cease to exist.																								The committee has also suggested that in the changed scenario, there is no need to continue with the West Bengal Rural Electricity Development Corporation.																								The committee, which was set up three months ago, today submitted the report to state power minister Mrinal Banerjee. 																								The other members of the committee are Sanjay Mitra, chairman, WBSEB, Deepak Ganguly, member, WBSEB, Deepak Dey, former chief engineer, R.P. Sengupta, special secretary, power department. Anirban Guha of West Bengal Power Development Corporation is the secretary of the committee.																								The Bengal government had set up the panel following the introduction of Electricity Act, 2003. The Electricity Act, 2003 demands certain changes to be brought in for efficient supply of power to the consumers, senior officials in the power ministry said. 																								The distribution company will have five strategic business units. Each of these five SBUs will be headed by a chief executive officer, who will report to the main distribution company. That will be named West Bengal Distribution Company.																								Of the five SBUs, one will only look after the hydro-electric projects of the state. However, Purulia Pumped Storage Company will not come under this SBU. 																								The other four SBUs will look after the five distribution profit centres of WBSEB. They will have to perform efficiently and become viable.																								Since the four SBUs will look after the distribution system in both urban and rural areas, the role of WBERDC will be marginal. Therefore, the committee has suggested that it be wound up.																								The four SBUs will have to perform according to the performance parameters laid down in the Electricity Act, 2003. This legislation was passed by Lok Sabha today.																								They will be named according to the zones like Siliguri Distribution SBU, Burdwan Distribution SBU and others. The committee has also suggested that a financial penalty should be imposed on the SBU if it slips up on power distribution and fails to satisfy the consumers																								The restructuring of the WBSEB will not affect the employees, who will retain their jobs. The committee has also suggested that the old gas turbine plants of WBSEB should be sold. These plants generate around 100 MW. 																								State power minister Mrinal Banerjee said: I have received the report. Let me go through it. Only then can I respond to the specific recommendations.

 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 ONGC to lease out 19 oilfields
																								New Delhi, Dec. 17 (PTI): State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has floated tenders for leasing out its 19 new/marginal oil and gasfields in western offshore for development and production.																								Exploration and production (E amp;P) companies have been asked to put in expression of interest (EoIs) by January 15 for the development of the fields on a service contract, company sources said here.																								While ONGC will retain the ownership of the fields, the service company would be paid as a percentage (quotable item in the tender) of the price of oil and gas. The service company, which will not be given any equity stake in the fields, would have to deliver crude oil produced from the fields to ONGC.																								All the fields on offer are in Heera-Panna-Bassein block in the Arabian Sea. The fields, which were discovered in early 1990s and together hold oil reserves in excess of 63 million tonnes, were found to be unviable for development by a company of the size of ONGC, they said.																								ONGC wants to lease out the fields to smaller firms for the development and production as service companies. 																								In most of the fields, six to eight wells had been previously drilled and in each case hydrocarbons were found in at least two wells.																								Among the fields on offer include the B-192 field which is estimated to hold 17.09 million tonnes of oil and 2082.9 million standard cubic meters of gas reserves.																								ONGC, which has over 90 small and marginal fields, had previously invited bids for leasing out 13 on-land discovered fields.																								The awards are being finalised, sources said.																								From the current tender, fields B-178/B-179/B-180, where three out of the eight drilled so far are oil and gas bearing, hold an estimated 8.6 million tonnes of oil and 2114.1 million cubic meters of gas reserves.																								With five out of the eight exploratory wells drilled so far encountering oil and gas, field B-28/B-28a are estimated to hold 6.77 million tonnes of oil and 8369.89 million cubic meters of natural gas reserves.																								Field B-23a, with all three exploratory wells being gas bearing, has 4343.2 million cubic meters of gas reserves.

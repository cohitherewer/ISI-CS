 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: Embedded software systems are the future revenue earners for India which will, at the same time, play as a catalyst in bringing down the cost of communications equipment with convergence capabilities. According to Frost and Sullivan, an IT analyst company, the embedded systems research and development from India is expected to generate revenue worth $ 1,502 million by 2005.																								However, Indian software firms have to build and protect intellectual property since this will be important to retain the value and also create an environment for the availability of both hardware and software skills.																								Latest embedded system requires more software skills than hardware requirements. This is an area where software engineers in India have proven their competence. But to sustain this, the Indian companies have to increase investment in core engineering research and development activities, said Rajiv C. Mody, chairman and chief executive officer of Sasken Communications Technologies Ltd, a Bangalore-based company specialising on development of software for embedded products like mobile phones and telecom network equipment.																								Delivering the keynote address at the 16th international conference on VLSI design, he said, In addition to the convergence of information technology, communications and entertainment, there will be a convergence of industrial electronics, bionics, global positioning systems and security systems.																								Smart devices are being developed each day and these need software. India has to gear up to this new opportunity. We need to patent the design and software. The common refrain is that the cost of patent registrations are very high, but they should realise that the final cost of the product is much more than what it costs to patent a product, said Mody.

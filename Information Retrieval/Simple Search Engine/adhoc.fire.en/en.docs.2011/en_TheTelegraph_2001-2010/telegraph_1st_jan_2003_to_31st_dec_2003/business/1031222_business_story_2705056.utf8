The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
		 Monday, December 22, 2003  Q amp;A				 Research riddle 
																																																																																													I am a research fellow drawing a monthly fellowship of Rs 6,600. I am also a guest lecturer in a university drawing an honorarium of Rs 2,000 per month for 10 months in a year. Though neither of the above income is permanent, do I have to pay income tax?																																																																													Samrat Datta, Calcutta
																																																																																													Yes, you have to. One third of your income as guest lecturer is exempted from tax; the rest (Rs 13,333.33) is taxable. Income from fellowship is also taxable, but you could claim exemption to the extent of your expenses on research. Say if you spend Rs 19,200 on your research, Rs 60,000 of your income from fellowship is taxable. Your total taxable income comes to Rs																																																																																													73,333.33 (Rs 13,333.33 plus Rs 60,000), on which you are supposed to pay Rs 3,666.66 in income tax.																																																																																													come from fellowship is entitled to a higher tax rebate under section 88. For you, its 25 per cent, whereas for ordinary individuals, its 15 or 20 per cent depending on income.																																																																																													You could claim rebate under section 88 for premium paid for a life insurance policy, and deposits in Public Provident Fund (PPF) and National Savings Certificate.																																					Spread the risk																																																																																															I am a salaried individual and a doctor by profession. I want to invest Rs 1 lakh in mutual funds. Please suggest schemes.																																																																													Pulak Taraphdar, Calcutta
																																																																																													It would have been easier for us to suggest schemes if we knew your risk appetite. Anyhow, if you are an aggressive investor you could put the entire sum in a diversified equity fund. A defensive strategy would be to invest in a balanced fund  or one that invests both in shares and bonds. To further minimise risks, you could pick a balanced fund that invests more in bonds  say 60 per cent of its corpus  than shares. Do not invest in a fund less than three years old. Consider the consistency of return and the quality of assets before identifying a scheme. And since the equity market is overheated, you could stagger the investment over five to 10 months so that a sharp correction doesnt give you sleepless nights.																																					No surcharge																																																																																															Do I have to pay a surcharge on income tax if my income is less than Rs 8.5 lakh?																																																																													A. K. Dam, Calcutta
																																																																																													Theres no surcharge on income tax if income is less than Rs 8.5 lakh in the current year (2003-04). If income exceeds Rs 8.5 lakh, theres a surcharge of 10 per cent of your tax.

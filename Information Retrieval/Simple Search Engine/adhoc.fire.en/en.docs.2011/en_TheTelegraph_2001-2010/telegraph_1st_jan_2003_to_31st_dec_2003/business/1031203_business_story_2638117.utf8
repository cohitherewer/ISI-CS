 Wednesday, December 03, 2003 				 BPCL shortlists Bihar, Jharkhand for LPG plant 
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Dec. 2: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) is planning to set up another liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) bottling plant in the eastern region. Confirming the move, regional LPG manager (East) S. Banerjee said the company would set up its fifth plant in Jharkhand or Bihar. The viability study is currently in progress and the final decision will be taken shortly.																								East is now our major focus and we are making efforts to strengthen our presence here, he said.																								The second largest oil refining and marketing company in the country has LPG bottling plants at Uluberia, Durgapur and Raigunj in Bengal and at Khurda in Orissa. The total capacity of these four plants is one lakh tonnes per annum. 																								The fifth plant, for which the company plans to invest around Rs 20 crore, will raise the capacity by another 20,000 tonnes per annum.																								Banerjee also said the company has set a target of crossing one million customer base in the current financial year and another quarter million by the next. The current consumption of Bharat Gas, the BPCL brand, stands at around 1.1 million tonne per annum. With the accretion of new consumers, more LPG will be needed in the next year. Hence, we are examining other proposals to revamp our current production to cater to the demands, he said. Banerjee said the company is seriously considering expanding capacities in the four plants as and when required.																								The company is also strengthening its marketing network by employing more distributors and booking agents to provide efficient services to consumers. While all the distributors are open seven days a week, it has been decided to deliver the cylinders at points that are convenient for consumers. Moreover, a cylinder can be booked or a new connection can be applied for on the net as all the distributing points are computerised.																								The company has, for the first time, introduced mechanical devices to be carried by a delivery boy to ensure the exact weight of the gas and safety of the cylinder, Banerjee said.																								Banerjee said the company is also adding value to its services by providing various household products at a substantial discount by entering into marketing alliance with companies like Hawkins, Prestige and Nirlep.

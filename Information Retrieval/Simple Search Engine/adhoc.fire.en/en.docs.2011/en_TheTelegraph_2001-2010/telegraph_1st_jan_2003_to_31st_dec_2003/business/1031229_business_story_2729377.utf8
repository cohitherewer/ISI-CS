The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Jewel for Murdoch, enigma of crown
				 Rich legacy 																								New York, Dec. 28: News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch has been trying to buy or build an American satellite television business for 20 years, a campaign that sometimes appeared to be his lifes work.																								Last week, he finally succeeded, buying control of Hughes Electronics and its DirecTV satellite service for $6.6 billion. But his hard-won victory now raises questions for Murdoch, who is 72, and for the company.																								Murdoch needs to make DirecTV justify the years and billions spent in its pursuit. With the last piece in place, Murdoch needs to prove that the vast contraption of Hollywood studios, broadcast and cable channels, satellite systems and newspapers that he has assembled will run smoothly and profitably, even after he is no longer behind the wheel.																								He has made it no secret that he would like to pass the companys top job to one of his children who have worked for the company: Lachlan, 32, James, 30, or, as he volunteered in an interview 10 days ago, perhaps Elisabeth, 35. To outsiders, the succession question has the makings of a captivating corporate soap opera. And, in November, the plot took an unforeseen twist when James Murdoch was named the chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting, of which News Corp owns a one-third stake. To many investors and Murdoch watchers, that suggested that James Murdoch might have overtaken his older brother, Lachlan, as the Murdoch heir to watch.																								The senior Murdoch prefers not to talk about succession. The reason I want to avoid it altogether is very simple, he said.																								The more people write about it and the more people in the company read about it, it just breeds politics. People say, I want to be on the James wagon or the Lachlan wagon, and it is just terribly self-destructive, even of their relationship, if that happens.																								But relaxing in his Los Angeles office  with seven TVs tuned to the companys channels, including Fox and Fox News, and even more photos of his family around him  Murdoch was expansive, savouring the impending acquisition of DirecTV. He is also a proud father. In a two-hour conversation that covered many subjects, including the problems of the Fox network and his satellite plans in Europe and Asia, he could not resist discussing his childrens progress in the business.																								As he talked, the Federal Communications Commission was completing its decision that approved his deal for control of DirecTV. The acquisition may be a watershed moment for the American television industry. With 11 million subscribers paying $35 to $90 a month for different levels of service, DirecTV is the second-largest cable or satellite service, after Comcast Cable.																								Murdoch has pledged to use News Corps vast resources and satellite experience to redouble DirecTVs threat to cable companies. And the major cable companies are already fighting to keep their customers by adding features like telephone service, video on demand or TiVo-style digital video recorders.																								Murdoch sketched a series of expensive early steps in his attack on the cable firms. He promised to strengthen DirecTVs call centres for better customer service. He said he would virtually eliminate DirecTVs substantial problem with piracy of its signal by using new set-top technology from News Corps NDS subsidiary. 																								He said he planned to offer interactive programming on the companys Fox news and sports channels that would let viewers choose among various screens and camera angles. He also said he plans to push set-top boxes with built-in digital recorders like TiVo at little or no extra charge.																								Murdoch acknowledged that the recorder move was not good news for broadcasters by any means because the devices let viewers skip commercials. Lets just say I am being discouraged by the Fox people, he said, referring to the executives at the companys Fox broadcast network. But he vowed to push the devices very hard nonetheless, to win and keep customers for DirecTV.																								All the moves come from a playbook that British Sky Broadcasting used to dominate the British pay television market, sustaining																								heavy losses to conquer it before other cable or satellite rivals could establish themselves. Murdoch missed that chance in the United																								States, where more than 80 percent of households already subscribe to cable or satellite service. Still, he said he saw room to																								expand beyond DirecTVs subscribers. quot;I am confident we can get to 15 million subscribers, quot; he said. quot;What do I dream of? Twenty																								million. quot; That would pull DirecTV nearly even with Comcast. 																								Murdoch has long championed his vision of a satellite television service around the globe, in part because it would bolster the power																								of his companys film and cable channels. Controlling DirecTV, he said, would add to the companys leverage in negotiating with																								cable companies like Comcast, Time Warner and Cox Communications, which also have major investments in channels. quot;It gives us a																								degree of leverage, quot; he said. quot;There is a certain amount of saying, `We will carry you if you will carry us. quot; 																								But owning DirecTV will not address what may be the News Corp.s most pressing problem, the slump in ratings at its Fox																								broadcasting network. quot;Our new shows havent done well enough, quot; Murdoch acknowledged. He said he hoped to address the																								problem by introducing more new shows throughout the year, rather than waiting until the competitive fall season. 																								Still, Murdoch said that Fox could wring still more years of ratings out of its biggest hit, the three-year-old quot;American Idol quot; talent																								contest. After Foxs teenage edition of quot;American Idol quot; this year and the recent quot;American Idol quot; holiday special, some critics have																								suggested that Fox risks exhausting the shows novelty as ABC did with quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. quot; But Murdoch promised																								self-discipline. quot;`American Idol, I think, is the perfect young show, quot; he said. quot;If we restrain ourselves to just once a year, then it wont																								wear out for a long time, quot; he said. 																								How long Murdoch himself can last is a more delicate question. Even at 72, he says he has no plans to slow down or go anywhere																								for several years to come. But that does not entirely ease investors concerns. 																								 quot;I worry tremendously about the succession, quot; said Uri D. Landesman, a portfolio manager for Federated Investors, a major investor																								in News Corp. quot;Either he is going to slow down or he is going to meet his maker at some point, and I think it is going to be an																								enormous issue. quot; 																								More than any other major media company, News Corp. reflects the work of one man. Murdoch single-handedly conceived and																								built its vast empire from the ruins of his own fathers failing Australian newspaper business. He controls a dominant portion of its																								voting shares. His instincts led the company to bet on satellite television, to defy the television industry by starting Fox as a fourth																								broadcast network and again by betting on the audience for a 24-hour-news network to the political right of CNN. As a result,																								analysts and investors say, it is difficult to foresee how it might look without him. 																								Landesman said he believed that Murdoch would not hand control to an heir whom he deemed unqualified, but added that a fathers																								criteria might differ from Wall Streets. Investors would be happier, Landesman said, if Murdoch turned over the company to a																								strong, young media executive outside the family, perhaps Peter Chernin, the president and chief operating officer of the News Corp.																								and Murdochs second in command. 																								Murdoch has never hidden his aspirations for his heirs. quot;I think it is a very, very human motive to see your work carried forward by																								one of your own, quot; Murdoch said. 																								(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) 																								Still, he said he would never sacrifice the interests of his shareholders to his own ambitions for his children: quot;If it was to turn out that																								they were not good enough, wed have to face that. That is what you have a majority of independent directors for, although I hope I																								would be smart enough to see it myself. quot; 																								Murdoch remains very close to all six of his children, including the three who have worked at the company - Lachlan, James, and																								Elisabeth. Friends and colleagues say the three call their father quot;Pop quot; and often close phone calls to their father with expressions of																								love or affection. All three remain close to one another as well, two friends of the family said. And the News Corp. is woven into the																								family fabric, often dominating conversation when the family gathers. 																								But each of the three differs notably from Murdoch, an outspoken political conservative who grew up in the sensational world of																								Australian newspapers. 																								The eldest of the three, Elisabeth, has led a decidedly cosmopolitan life. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and																								Vassar and married Elkin Pianim, the son of a Ghanian politician. After the marriage ended, she settled in London. There, she entered																								a highly visible relationship with Matthew Freud, founder of a public relations firm sometimes associated with the Labor Party and the																								grandson of Sigmund Freud. 																								Of the three potential successors in the family, Elisabeth may have the best record of success outside her fathers company. She and																								her first husband bought a television station in California, improved its performance and sold it at a substantial profit. After working																								for the News Corp. in television, she started Shine, now a three-year-old London television production company, which has scored																								some successes. 																								She has also done some valuable scouting for the News Corp.s Fox network on the side. It was Elisabeth, Murdoch said, who																								spotted the potential in a British television talent contest that became the basis for quot;American Idol quot; on Fox. quot;I might have been saying,																								`what is hot over there? or something, quot; Murdoch recalled. quot;We were gossiping, and she said this is. quot; 																								After learning about its ratings and consulting with an editor at one of his British newspapers, Murdoch said, he called a top executive																								at the Fox broadcast network in the United States: quot;I said, `You have got to buy it. They said, `Oh, well, we are looking at it, and I																								said, `Dont look, buy. They said, `We will think about it, but the next day they bought it. quot; He added with a laugh, quot;She has her																								uses. quot; 																								 quot;She is a very, very hard-working and intelligent person, and she just loves the business, quot; Murdoch said. But he said she was unlikely																								to rejoin the News Corp., at least for the next few years. quot;She is very settled into the London scene and what she is doing, quot; he said.																								 quot;I dont think she wants to, at least for a few years. She wants to be sure she has been successful in her own right. She will probably																								sell it for a bloody fortune to someone. And then she will come knocking on the door, and she will be very welcome. quot; 																								Until this fall, most investors and Murdoch watchers had assumed that the leading candidate to succeed Murdoch was his eldest son,																								Lachlan, deputy chief operating officer of the News Corp., in charge of its Australian operations, its television stations in the United																								States, and The New York Post, among other things. All three Murdoch heirs were educated mainly in the United States and speak																								without an Australian accent, but Lachlan Murdoch sometimes plays up his heritage, sprinkling his speech with Australian expressions																								like quot;no worries, mate. quot; 																								Colleagues say Lachlan, a Princeton graduate, is, if anything, more consistently conservative than his father, who can be a political																								maverick. His colleagues say The Posts staunchly conservative editorials roughly match his views. They describe him as less verbally																								polished than his father. As deputy chief operating officer of the News Corp., he joins his father and the companys other top																								executives in quarterly conference calls with investors, but he has not yet learned to eliminate the halting quot;ahs quot; and quot;ums quot; from his																								speech. 																								The senior Murdochs antagonists, especially in the British and Australian press, often relish his childrens failures; in one favorite																								example, Lachlan helped arrange a major News Corp. investment in an Australian telephone company that collapsed a few years																								ago. 																								But his father said the fault was just as much his own. quot;Lachlan is accused in this telephone venture, quot; the elder Murdoch said. quot;But I																								did that. We all did that. The whole board of News Corp. approved that deal. quot; 																								Murdoch said, quot;Lachlan is responsible right now for 60 percent of the cash flow of News Corp. and we are doing very well. quot; As																								Lachlan rose through the company, James Murdoch was considered the dark horse. Where Lachlan is stout and athletic, James is																								more slender and cerebral, although in recent years he has taken up karate. James dropped out of Harvard to start his own,																								short-lived hip-hop record label, Rawkus Records, in New York. And, unlike his father or Lachlan, James is steadfastly liberal. He																								has supported Bill Clinton and Al Gore, whose daughter he befriended at Harvard. In the interview, the elder Murdoch suggested																								that their views have quot;converged over time quot; as James has learned more about the burden of taxes on business, but friends of James																								who are familiar with his political views strenuously dispute that assertion. 																								The question mark on James Murdochs resume is a stint in his 20s when he was in charge of the News Corp.s Internet investments.																								Under his direction, the company invested in a handful of Internet ventures that never took off. 																								But the senior Murdoch defended James judgment, too. quot;He saved me a lot of money, quot; Murdoch said. quot;He said, `Here is this																								company Juno, why dont we take about 5 percent of it? I said, `That sounds interesting, why dont we buy the whole bloody thing.																								He said, `No, no, no. He held me back. quot; 																								While Lachlan was based in New York, James spent the last few years in Hong Kong, where he led Star, the News Corp.s Asian																								subsidiary. Star has accounted for only a small portion of corporate revenue, but during James tenure it has also turned its first profit.																								This fall, however, he became the lightning rod for investors anxieties about succession because of his appointment as chief executive																								of British Sky Broadcasting, in which the News Corp. owns roughly a one-third stake. Other shareholders contended that James, at																								30 and with only a few years of experience in television, was unqualified to lead the dominant television service in Britain. 																								But Murdoch said the scuffle with shareholders who opposed the appointment had not changed his views. quot;He just had the																								misfortune of having my name, quot; Murdoch said. quot;I understand it might be seen as nepotism or something like that. But the fact was, I																								know everybody in this business, and who could do better? quot; The only one or two candidates who might be more qualified, he said,																								already had jobs they were unlikely to leave. 																								Whats more, Murdoch said, British Sky Broadcastings board had vetted his son with more diligence than usual, not less. The																								executive recruiter Spencer Stuart conducted an extensive search, and the board considered three internal candidates and three																								outside contenders as well as his son, he said. quot;They put him through psychometric tests and pretty exhaustive interviews by members																								of the committee, quot; Murdoch said, quot;He aced it. quot; 																								Among analysts and investors handicapping the succession, James Murdochs ascension to the top job at one of the companys																								biggest businesses has made him the odds-on favorite. But the elder Murdoch discounted those theories. quot;I think you are jumping to																								conclusions, quot; he said, praising Lachlans performance as well. 																								Outsiders familiar with the dynamics of other families often assume that the potential competition for the fathers job must create																								awkwardness among the Murdoch siblings. Murdochs former wife Anna Murdoch wrote a novel, quot;Family Business, quot; about a female																								media entrepreneur with a certain resemblance to her husband Rupert. In its purple denouement, one of the protagonists two sons																								happily starts his own firm, but the other enters the family business and ultimately drives his mothers lover to a heart attack in an																								argument over succession. 																								Murdoch said that was not the case. quot;They are very, very close, quot; he said. 																								As an example of sibling harmony, he pointed to the Newhouse family - a privately owned media dynasty now led by the brothers S.																								I. and Donald Newhouse. quot;Look at the Newhouse brothers, quot; he said. quot;One is senior to the other, but they basically divide																								responsibilities. quot; 																								He declined to rule out a similar power-sharing arrangement among his heirs. And, for now, Murdoch said such considerations were																								premature. quot;We are going to see, quot; he said. quot;If I go under a bus or my health fails, that is something that the board is going to want to																								talk about. But I look after my health pretty well, and I intend to be the active driver of the company for a long time yet, probably to																								the frustration of all my relatives. quot;					 NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

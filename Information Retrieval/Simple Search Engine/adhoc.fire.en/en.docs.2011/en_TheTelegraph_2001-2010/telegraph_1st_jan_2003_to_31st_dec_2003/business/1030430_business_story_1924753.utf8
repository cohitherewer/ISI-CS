 Wednesday, April 30, 2003 				 Access to long-term funds
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, April 29: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted banks to raise long-term resources from the market which are not in the nature of subordinated debt. It has also provided them further flexibility in branch licensing by permitted transfer of branches from one bank to another. 																								In its Monetary and Credit Policy for the year 2003-04, the RBI said that at present, banks are permitted to issue long-term subordinated debt in the nature of unsecured redeemable bonds which qualify for inclusion in tier II capital. 																								Apart from raising resources through tier II capital bonds, in order to realign the portfolios from the asset-liability management angle and to honour the long-term commitments, banks have expressed their desire to raise long-term resources from the market which are not in the nature of subordinated debt, it said. 																								It is proposed to accept this suggestion, and suitable policy guidelines for banks in this regard will be worked out in consultation with them, the central bank added.

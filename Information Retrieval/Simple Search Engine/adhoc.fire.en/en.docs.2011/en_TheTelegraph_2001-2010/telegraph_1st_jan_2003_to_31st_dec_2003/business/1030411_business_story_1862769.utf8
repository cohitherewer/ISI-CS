The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, April 11, 2003 				 Landline services in four months
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, April 10: Reliance plans to offer landline phone services within the next four months. The company, which is preparing for the commercial launch of its limited mobility service by May 1, has decided to launch landline services in August once the laying of optic fibre network is complete.																								Ninety per cent work on the optic fibre project has been completed. In the next four months, the company will be able to offer landline services as well, company sources said.																								Reliance has decided to roll out its telecom services in 111 cities in the first phase. The services will be finally available to over 700 cities in the country.																								Reliance has also decided to set up one-stop telecom shops across the country which it intends to fund itself. The earlier plan was to set up such shops, to be known as Reliance Web World, through franchisees.																								The shops will have a standard look and all communication services, including broadband and video conferencing, will be provided.																								The companys highly ambitious foray into the telecom sector, however, depends largely on the TDSATs verdict on the roaming services for the WiLL customers.

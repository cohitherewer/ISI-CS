 Friday, February 21, 2003 				 Costliest two-wheeler hits the road
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Fatboy clone is here: and it costs a bomb. 																								With a sticker price of Rs 1.45 lakh, Kinetic Engineerings Aquila  a 250-cc, 26-bhp motorbike  is arguably the most expensive two-wheeler in the country.																								Billed as the nations first cruiser bike with an oil-cooled engine, the Aquila, which is styled on Harley Davidsons Fatboy, is expected to give the company a macho image in the world of mobikes and beefcake.																								Arun Firodia, chairman of the Kinetic group of companies, told reporters here today that the company intends to sell only 100 units of Aquila and isnt looking to ramp up sales.																								We want to keep it as exclusive as possible. If we import another batch of these bikes that means we have been forced to do it, said Firodia.																								The Kinetic chief said the motorcycle maker has tied up with Hyosung Motors of South Korea for production, marketing and research and development activities.																								We have decided to produce a bike that will fit their market conditions as also ours, said Firodia. Also, they will be outsourcing bikes from us but that will be branded under their name.																								The firm hopes to export its current GF range of 125-cc bikes to Germany, Mexico, East Asian countries, Africa, parts of Latin America and the US. The GF range of bikes are produced in technical alliance with the Hyosung Motors.																								We hope to export around 5,000 units of these bikes, the chief said.

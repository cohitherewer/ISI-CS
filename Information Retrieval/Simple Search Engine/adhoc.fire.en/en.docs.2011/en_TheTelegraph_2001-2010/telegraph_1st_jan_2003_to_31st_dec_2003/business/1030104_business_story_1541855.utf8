 Saturday, January 04, 2003 				 Relief for diabetics
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 3: In a major relief to diabetic patients across the country, Eli Lilly India today sharply reduced prices of Huminsulin, its indigenously produced human insulin. The cut will see prices of human insulin vial of 10 ml fall to Rs 145, from the previous price of Rs 218, bringing it at par with the prevailing prices of animal derived porcine insulin.																								However, company officials cautioned that diabetic patients wishing to switch to human insulin from animal insulin should do so under proper medical supervision. The dramatic price cut comes in the wake of the company making Huminsulin in the country, in a state-of-art FDA approved plant in Gujarat. 																								Huminsulin has a 12 per cent share of the Rs 200-crore insulin market. Another leading player in the insulin market, USV, slashed prices of its human insulin products by over 25 per cent on Thursday.

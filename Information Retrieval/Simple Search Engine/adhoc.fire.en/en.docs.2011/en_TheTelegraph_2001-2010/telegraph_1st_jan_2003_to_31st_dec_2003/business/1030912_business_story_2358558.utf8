 Friday, September 12, 2003 				 Ex-Enron official gets prison term
																								Washington, Sept. 11 (PTI): Enrons former treasurer Ben Glisan became the first executive involved in the accounting scandal that shook corporate America to be sent to jail after he was handed a five-year prison-term by a US court.																								 District judge Kenneth Hoyt sentenced Glisan, 37, to five years in prison and three years of supervised release after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit fraud at a Federal Court in Boston, Texas yesterday.																								Glisan, who was sacked by Enron in October 2001, a month before the company filed for bankruptcy, will also forfeit $1.3 million he made from sham investment in an Enron-related partnership, prosecutors said.																								I take full responsibility of my actions, Glisan, who had previously pleaded not guilty to more than 20 charges of fraud and money laundering but revised it yesterday, told the court.																								Glisan, who joined the company in 1996 and served as treasurer from 2000, was regarded as a one of the whiz-kids behind Enron, said Leslie Caldwell, the governments Enron task force chief.

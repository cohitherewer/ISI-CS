 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Creditors tighten noose on sinking Parmalat 
				 	 The companys plant in Collechio, near Parma, in Italy. (AFP)																								Milan, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Parmalats troubles deepened on Thursday after six foreign creditor companies lodged a lawsuit against the global food group, which is caught up in one of Europes biggest business scandals.																								Hours after the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in Italy, a group of foreign life insurers holding unpaid bonds sued to win control of two Parmalat units in the Cayman Islands.																								The suit was the first publicly announced move by Parmalat creditors to recover billions of euros of investments jeopardised by an Enron-like crisis at Parmalat that has thrown a spotlight on some of the worlds biggest banks and auditors.																								Public prosecutors are investigating for fraud at Italys eighth-biggest industrial group after a hole which could exceed 10 billion ($12.44 billion) was found in its accounts  a shameful disaster, according to agriculture minister Gianni Alemanno.																								Some 20 people, including Parmalats founder and former CEO Calisto Tanzi, are under investigation for fraud, false accounting and market rigging.																								Investigators sought to interrogate Tanzi on Wednesday but discovered he had left Italy for an undisclosed location.																								A judicial source said Tanzi was willing to return to Italy to face questioning, but his absence complicated efforts to find out quickly how at least 7 billion went missing from the dairy groups books.																								Those interrogated so far, including three former chief financial officers, have told investigators of a complex web of offshore shell companies masking billions of euros of losses and overseen by senior company officials, judicial sources have said.																								Police on Wednesday searched Tanzis house in Collecchio, the northern Italian town where Parmalat has its headquarters, and sealed off the offices of La Coloniale, the Tanzi familys holding firm that controls the group.

 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: Sub-branding seems to be the name of the game for co-operative food major Amul. After launching its flavoured milk Amul Shakti, Amul is now in the midst of rolling out cooking chocolates and soups.																								The Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), the owner of the brand Amul, is rolling out Amul Chef to tap an almost untouched sub-segment called cooking chocolate. Branded cooking chocolate is still a rarity in the Indian market though a lot of unbranded cooking chocolate is available in the market, a company spokesperson said. 																								Cadburys is a leading player in drinking chocolates. Amuls product is not a drinking chocolate, but meant for and positioned purely as a drinking chocolate, the spokesperson said. Launched recently and being rolled out in the prime metropolitan cities, Amul Chef has been priced at Rs 110 for 500 grams of the premium variants and Rs 100 for 500 grams of the classic variant. 																								While the former is a milk chocolate with presence of milk solids, the latter is a dark chocolate. Amul is also in the midst of rolling out new flavours for its Masti soups, which it has just launched. The soup, which is sold in liquid form, as a heat and eat product is now available in tomato and hot and sour vegetable flavours.

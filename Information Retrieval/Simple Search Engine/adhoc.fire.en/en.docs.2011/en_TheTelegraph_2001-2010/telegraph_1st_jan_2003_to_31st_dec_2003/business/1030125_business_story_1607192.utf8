The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 All eyes now on telecom regulator
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 24: The wait is over. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will announce a revised tariff tomorrow for basic phone users and unveil the controversial access charges.																								One of the bulwarks of the basic telephony regime  billing on the basis of three-minute calls  is expected to collapse. Basic telephony calls are likely to be billed on a one-minute basis, which is a world-wide trend.																								Trai is currently busy giving finishing touches to the interconnect user charges based on a report submitted by the Credit Rating Information Services of India Ltd (Crisil). 																								The regulator has asked Crisil to prepare a report based on the inputs provided by the cellular and basic service providers including state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam and the open house records from the regulator on the issue of interconnect user charges (IUC).																								Crisil has recommended that either both limited mobility operators and cellular operators be allowed to charge an airtime or a ceiling be imposed on the airtime charge. The report feels this will help usher in a level playing field.

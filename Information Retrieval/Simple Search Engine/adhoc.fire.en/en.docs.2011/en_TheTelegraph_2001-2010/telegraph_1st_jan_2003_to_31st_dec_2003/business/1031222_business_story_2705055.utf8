 Monday, December 22, 2003  Shop for that cheap loan 
 Banks and finance firms are paring  interest rates for credit-worthy customers. Satish John  takes a look Ask, and it shall be given  you; seek, and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened  unto you. Mathew 7.7 The biblical passage may have  lost much of its relevance in the current climes. But for  the young Gonsalves couple shopping for a loan, it seems  just as relevant today as it did back then. The double income couple were  eyeing a bigger apartment. Increasingly confident, the children  of the liberalisation era now had the gumption to give up  their motorbike for a hatchback. Of course, to acquire all these  creature comforts, the spunky couple lacked the moolah.  They were looking for loans to pay for their purchases   their appetite for them whetted by the low interest rates. They began approaching housing  finance companies and banks for a housing loan. It was then  that Anahita Gonsalves, the better half, got wind of a well-kept  secret. Her colleague told her that banks no longer consider  lending rates to be sacrosanct. Even lending rates of archaic  banks are not cast in stone. Rates were flexible and negotiable,  she was told depending on the risk profile of the customer. When Anahita heard that, her mind  started computing the costs of taking an additional loan  for a stereo, computer and an airconditioner. She was certain  that if lending rates could be lowered for some people,  she was more than eligible! Just for a lark, Anahita decided  to do some window shopping. She had a willing partner in  Anil  her husband. And what they found was a revelation! To their utter surprise, even  old and stodgy public sector banks were willing to slash  their rates. (Their risk profile, earning capacity and the  reputation of their employers helped drive the rates still  lower). They zeroed in on a bank, Incidentally, a bank where  Anahitas employer  a premier hotel group  had a  corporate account. The rates were customised to suit  their palate. The bankers were hungry to grab them as clients  before other hungry ravens got to them. An HDFC Bank official admits that  depending on the value of the account, quantum of loan,  and other relationships (like employers have corporate accounts  with the bank), they will consider a special rate. Ofcourse,  it comes with a lot of procedural wrangles as the branch  manager will have to forward the application to the headquarters  for special sanction. The discounts could come in the  form of a waiver or a shave on the processing fees, he added. Says S.R. Krishnan, a senior official  at Central bank of India, Special rates are offered in  exceptional cases. The customers are known to the bank  for a long period and the customer offer comforts like  a fixed deposit or has a salary account. Anahita didnt stop at that.  Remember, she wanted a car too. She scoured several dealerships  and again the smart lady discovered that car dealers were  desperate to achieve their month-end targets. They start  offering discounts or throw freebies like a stereo and insurance  to get customers. But she wanted more.  And Anahita (an avid Sachin Tendulkar  fan) got what she wanted. The Fiat dealer in her neighbourhood  was in a hurry to get the last Tendulkar special edition  car out of the showroom before the end of November. Sachins contract with Fiat was  ending in November 2003 and they were keen to sell the car  before the contract expired. She drove a hard bargain; in  addition to the freebies, she got them to shave off a part  of the dealer margins. The dealer was only too happy. The couple also found that rates  for consumer durables could be wangled the same way as many  dealers were eyeing prizes for achieving their sales targets.  But bankers warn that customers  should look out for traps if they get too greedy for discounts.

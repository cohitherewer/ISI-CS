 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 14 Indian tongues, all on a handset
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH				 Packing in a punch 																								Calcutta, Dec. 14: The ubiquitous mobile handset is going desi with a vengeance. As the mobile keypad dons an Indian edge, users can now type messages or manage their handset profiles in local languages.																								Pune-based Penfosys, along with Indian International Multiversity, has developed a software that can use 14 Indian official languages. The company has also devised a keypad that incorporates 57 alphabets in just nine keys. The layout is based on the principles of Paninis ancient Sanskrit grammar.																								Major mobile manufacturers have already implemented Hindi into their handsets, but the usage is cumbersome as the layout of characters is based on English. Different vendors have their proprietary keypads.																								The basic philosophy behind the keypad design is based on the native properties of Indic scripts and to have a single key for similar sounding alphabets, said Penfosys CEO Sandeep Bhat. We are in talks with major manufacturers like Nokia, Samsung and LG to incorporate the software into their handsets, he added.																								The problem lies in the fact that the number of alphabets in Indian languages is more than that in English. 																								A million subscribers are being added every month, said Bhat. This amounts to almost 500 million untapped subscribers mainly in the rural and semi-rural areas where local language-compatible handsets will be in demand, he added.																								He also said the implementation should not affect handset prices as the volumes would compensate for the investment.																								Unlike the software currently available, the new product tracks user profile and keeps a tab on frequently used words, explained Bhat. This helps the software to suggest complete words as the user is typing. Also the learning curve required for using the product is very small. A new user, especially one who does not know English, can very easily punch in words using the localised keypad, he said.																								With a mere 6 per cent English literate population, localised software for mobile users can go a long way in increasing cellular penetration in the country.

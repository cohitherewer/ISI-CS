The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 19, 2003 				 Flat screens sizzle in colour TV market
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH				 Picture perfect 																								Calcutta, May 18: The future looks bright for flat-screen colour TV sales. Flat-screen CTV sales for the first quarter of 2003 stood at 0.2 million units, which is 373.5 per cent higher than last year.																								According to statistics from market research agency ORG, Samsung leads the flat pack with 27 per cent market share followed by Sony with 20.1 per cent and LG with 19.9 per cent share.																								National head for colour televisions at LG Electronics India, Chandramani Singh says: The thrust is clearly on flats. Though the shift is mainly in the urban markets, we are clearly moving towards a 100 per cent flat screen market.																								LG sold around 55,000 flat TVs in the January to March period last year, while this year the figures stand at nearly 80,000 for the same period. The company expects to sell at least 3,50,000 flat units by the year-end.																								The thrust on flat TV is evident from the fact that of the 14 models that LG plans to launch by August this year, eight will be in the flat category.																								Korean major Samsung has already sold 1 lakh flat units in the first quarter. For 2003, it expects to sell around 3.2 lakh flat TVs against a CTV sales target of 12 lakh. There are plans to further boost the line-up with LCD TV launches in the 15-inch to 40-inch category this year.																								Currently, flats contribute 22 per cent of the total volume of CTVs sold in the first four months.																								One major reason for the increase in sales is the drop in prices of flat-screen TVs. While a year ago, a 21-inch flat screen TV cost around Rs 20,000, it is now available at around Rs 13,900 as against a economy model which is available at around Rs 10,000.																								With domestic production of flat picture tubes expected to begin soon, a further drop in prices is likely, bringing prices of flats at par with CTVs.

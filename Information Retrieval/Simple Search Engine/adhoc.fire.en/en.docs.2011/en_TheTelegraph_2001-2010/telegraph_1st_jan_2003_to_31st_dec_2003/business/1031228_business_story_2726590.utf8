The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Banks reap rewards by selling risk covers
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 no risk, no gain																								Calcutta, Dec. 27: The alternative channel of distribution of financial products is emerging as a lucrative business opportunity for commercial banks in the country.																								Bancassurance, the first test case for selling insurance products through alternative channels, has been gaining ground among banks.																								According to insurance industry sources, around 20 per cent of fresh life insurance business in terms of premium income is generated through banking channels.																								This is a good way of increasing the fee-based income of banks. We expect that in the coming years fees earned through distribution of financial products will be one of the major revenue earners of banks, an Allahabad Bank official said. Allahabad Bank has tied up with ICICI Prudential Life and National Insurance Company for marketing their products.																								Banks also market mutual funds and Reserve Bank of India relief bonds which add to their kitty.																								A Birla Sun Life Insurance official said, Bancassurance contributed around 22 per cent of the total business of the company in the past financial year. This year too, we expect a good business through bancassurance.																								Birla Sun Life has already tied up with 10 commercial banks in the country to sell its life insurance products and another six are in the offing. 																								For life insurance companies like Aviva and Metlife, business through the bancassurance route has been pretty good, insurance industry sources said.																								Going by the rationale that a customer will trust the branch manager of his local bank more than an insurance adviser, the insurance and mutual fund firms are relying increasingly on the banks for selling products.																								Providing adequate incentives for bank employees who are selling policies have made this distribution channel more active, a bank official said.																								However, in this cut-throat competitive era, bank officials will have to become more marketing savvy to sell financial products.																								An official of Bank of Rajasthan said, In 2002-03, we had earned Rs 1 crore through bancassurance. We have set a target of Rs 5 crore for this year. The bank is giving special training to its employees for selling the insurance products.																								It is estimated that there are over 18 crore bank accounts in India. If a bank sells one insurance policy to each of these accountholders over a period of five years with an average first-year premium policy of Rs 5,000 and an average commission of 15 per cent, banks can earn a total commission of Rs 13,500 crore.

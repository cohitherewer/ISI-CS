 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Maruti pep talk to ease belt-tightening strains 
 SRINJOY SHARMA				 Brake balm 																								New Delhi, Dec. 21: Maruti Udyog Ltd has started holding pep talk sessions to motivate its employees after 1,235 employees or 27 per cent of its total workforce opted for its early retirement plan.																								MUL, in which Japanese auto maker Suzuki Motor Corp has a 54.2 per cent stake, has already held a series of meetings and seminars with senior and middle-level executives, including workers, on the companys long-term goals and strategy.																								In September, the countrys largest car maker had offered an early retirement plan to employees to improve competitiveness and cut production costs which, it said, would help boost profits and battle competition.																								Suzukis offer of a voluntary retirement scheme and a new wage package which cut the annual salary hike (formulated after it took over Maruti Udyog) had demotivated the workforce, sources said. 																								The new wage deal, which runs for five years, has pared the annual salary hike to 3.5 per cent from 9 per cent and a one-time salary increase of 5.9 per cent, down from a 27.18 per cent one-time jump signed during the last wage agreement in 1996. 																								So the managements focus is to motivate the workers. Accordingly, the company is holding these series of meetings chaired by top officials, the sources said.																								Around 875 workers and 360 supervisors have opted for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) which offered an average retirement benefit package between Rs 10-11 lakh.																								Maruti, which has its factory in Gurgaon, is facing fierce competition since the past five years from Hyundai, Tata Motors and Ford and thus has launched a drive to cut costs and beat back competition.																								It has also planned to cut production costs by half over the next three years to boost profits and battle competition. In 2002-03, the auto maker had spent Rs 214 crore on wages and benefits for 4,590 employees or 2.36 per cent of its operating income. 																								During the quarter ended September 30, the car maker has reported a profit of Rs 124 crore from Rs 120 crore in the preceding three months, propelled by lower interest rates and sales of its cheap 800 cc cars.																								Maruti, which makes 10 models in India and imports one fully built vehicle, had sold 1,34,072 passenger cars and 40,350 units of utility vehicles in the first eight months of this year. Last year, it had sold 3,62,253 units, up 2.9 per cent from the previous year.

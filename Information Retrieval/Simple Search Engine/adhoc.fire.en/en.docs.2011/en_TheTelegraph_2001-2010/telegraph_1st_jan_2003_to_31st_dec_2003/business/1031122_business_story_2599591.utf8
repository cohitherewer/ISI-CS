Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, Nov. 21: The Italian government will help 30 Calcutta-based export-oriented leather goods manufacturing units to market their products in Italy and find joint venture partners.																								The help comes from Italy following Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit to the country last June.																								Representatives of two major associations of the Italian leather industry  Assomac and Pisie  are coming to Calcutta on December 4 to provide expertise to upgrade these units. The two associations had entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Council for Leather Exports for providing assistance.																								The council is currently in the process of identifying the units. The Italian associations will then identify the deficiencies of these units in the areas of machinery, technology and human resource. Then they will come up with ways to upgrade these units, council chairman S. S. Kumar said.																								Funds will come from the Italian government under the Indo-Italy line of credit. The Centre will also provide funds.																								Earlier Agostino Pinna, consul-general of Italy, said Italian entrepreneurs have interest in the leather, gem and jewellery and food processing industries. Water sanitation																								Italian firms will help Bengal to improve water sanitation in the four civic bodies of Howrah, Asansol, Durgapur and Siliguri.  Several Italian companies from  the Lombardi region were keen on developing a relationship  with the state, Italian delegation leader Mattia Miglio  said.

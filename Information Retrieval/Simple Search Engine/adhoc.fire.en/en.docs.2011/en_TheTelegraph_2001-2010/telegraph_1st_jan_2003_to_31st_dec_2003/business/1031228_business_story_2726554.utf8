The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Cabinet set to pack punch in power fund
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Dec. 27: The government is likely to allow the proposed India Power Fund (IPF) to form joint ventures with public sector units like Bharat Heavy Electricals and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and also with private operators.																								A supplementary to the cabinet note is likely to be moved by the power ministry as part of the proposal by Power Finance Corporation (PFC) to set up IPF by March.																								Sources in the power ministry said this will help IPF function like any other financial institution.																								The power ministry also feels that investments by IPF in both private and public sector companies will not lead to any conflict of interest. There will not be any conflict of interest as the IPF, like a financial institution, can hold shares in many competing companies. There are several instances where financial institutions have acted like financial investors and have not been a cause of concern for the investee organisations, said a senior power ministry official.																								The parliamentary standing committee has requested central public sector utilities like NTPC, Powergrid Corporation of India and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation to enter the distribution business. 																								There is a huge opportunity for IPF to pick up stakes in the distribution companies to be formed by these PSUs. There is a probability of the government inviting the PSUs to take over distribution without bidding. This will help IPF and also allay any fears of it selectively joining hands with a few private players only, said a power ministry source.																								Simultaneously, IPF can consult the state governments to pick up stakes in the distribution companies that are to be hived off from separate entities from the state electricity boards. 																								A report presented by SBI Capital Markets  the advisers for establishing IPF  says the stake may be in the form of the share of the state government.																								The ultimate equity holding in the privatised distribution company could be 26:23:51 between the IPF, the state government and the private party, the report has suggested.																								The Delhi model has been generally perceived as pro-reform and a number of power sector players are reportedly pursuing a similar format for other future privatisation in the distribution business, states the report.																								IPF, with a corpus of Rs 5,000 crore, is likely to get the green signal before March. It will help channel investments into and facilitate the development of the power sector in the country.																								It is expected to be set up with a combination of a venture capital fund and mutual fund structure through a common asset management firm. This will help tap institutional investors for an immediate launch and retail investors in future to build up the size of the corpus.

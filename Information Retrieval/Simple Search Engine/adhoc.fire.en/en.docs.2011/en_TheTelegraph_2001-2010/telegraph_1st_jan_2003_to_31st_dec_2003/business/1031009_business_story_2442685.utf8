 Thursday, October 09, 2003 				 Software firms asked to look inwards
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Oct. 8: Indian software firms and the Congress party have agreed to disagree on the need for more H-1B visas.																								The Congress party feels that the country should not be concerned about a reduction in the number of H-1B visas the US doles out to software professionals, but rather focus on the domestic market. The software industry, on the other hand, feels that H1B visas are their priority. 																								Jairam Ramesh, secretary, economic affairs department, All India Congress Committee, said, The domestic software firms should not panic at the reduction in H1B visas, but should look at it as an opportunity to explore the domestic market. This could also lead to US firms set up shops in India which would help the domestic software sector.

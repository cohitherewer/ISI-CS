 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Leash on wheat prices
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Union government today clamped a virtual freeze on the minimum support price for wheat but raised it for five other commodities.																								The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) raised the MSP for wheat by Rs 10 from Rs 620 to Rs 630 per quintal for the 2003-04 season. This is the statutory price at which state agencies have to buy winter-sown wheat from farmers.																								However, in real terms, it does not mark an increase in the case of wheat because last year farmers were paid a price of Rs 620 plus a hardship bonus of Rs 10 to, making a total of Rs 630 per quintal. This year there is no talk of a hardship bonus.																								The virtual freeze in the wheat price has been clamped in order to contain the burgeoning food subsidy bill, which has been rising by 12-13 per cent every year and is expected to touch about Rs 24,000 crore this fiscal. In urban areas, a stable wheat price would actually go down well with the electorate and become one more selling point for the ruling partys economic agenda when it goes in for a general election next year. 																								The MSP for masur dal has been raised by Rs 180 from Rs 1,320 to Rs 1,500.																								The price for barley has been raised by Rs 25 from Rs 500 to Rs 525 per quintal. In the case of gram, the MSP it has been increased by Rs 180 from Rs 1,220 to Rs 1,400. For rapeseed/mustard, the price has been hiked by Rs 270 from Rs 1,330 to Rs 1,600.																								Safflower prices are being raised by Rs 200 from Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,500. 																								Among a slew of other decisions taken today, the government decided to introduce six bills in Parliament that will, among other things, pave the way for the introduction of an eight-digit commodity classification code based on the harmonised system of nomenclature for the purposes of central excise and amend the Patents Act 1970 to comply with Indias international obligations contained in the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement under the aegis of the World Trade Organization.																								The excise reclassification will be in consonance with the schedule to the Customs tariff Act 1975. 																								The cabinet also decided to amend the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 to create a fast-track mechanism to resolve disputes.																								The bill will seek to modify or insert certain definitions and provisions, add a new chapter and schedule and introduce new provisions setting time limits to speed up pending arbitration proceedings.																								The government also approved the signing of the agreement with the US  the countrys largest trading partner  for co-operation and mutual assistance in customs matters.																								The agreement will help in obtaining reliable, quick and cost-effective information and intelligence for the prevention and investigation of customs offences and apprehension of customs offenders.																								In an effort to intensify the drive against makers of spurious drugs, the government decided to enhance the penalty provisions under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, March 25, 2003 				 Mahindra Invader invades market
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, March 24: Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) today launched the Invader, a sporty open-top utility vehicle, based on the Bolero.																								The company hopes to jack up its market share in the domestic auto market with the Invader, which is its second offering in the current fiscal after the successful launch of Scorpio in June last year.																								M amp;M executive director and president (automotive sector) Allan E Durante said: The Invader is aimed at those who want the excitement of a sporty open-top vehicle combined with the power of a sports utility vehicle and the comforts of a car. This is our latest endeavour to give a dose of adventure to our customers at a value price.																								The price of the vehicle, which comes in both two and four-wheel drive versions, starts from 3.78 lakh (ex-showroom, Jaipur). In Calcutta, the price will be around Rs 5,000 more for every variant of the vehicle.																								Durante also pointed out that the vehicle, which is essentially a jeep with some value additions, would have a 2500-cc, 72.5 BHP diesel engine. The petrol version of the vehicle will be introduced within six months with the Isuzu engine, he added. 																								The Invader, which comes with power steering and air-conditioning, will replace the companys jeep  Classic. Durante said the companys priority is to satisfy its customers with the modern facilities that were not present in the Classic.																								Classic, being a old product, could not be modified to match the expectations of the modern consumers. Hence, we have decided to phase it out and bring in a new product, which has both strength and comfort, he said.																								We are targeting both the domestic and export markets with this launch. Focus will be on the army and police where these vehicles are used regularly, Durante said. The vehicles attractive look and aggressive pricing will also lure individual customers both in the urban and rural areas, he added. 																								He, however, refused to comment on the companys sales target for the new vehicle. 																								The company will not make any major investment to develop this product as it has been pegged on the Bolero platform.

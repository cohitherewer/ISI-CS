 White spirit makers on a high
 RAJA GHOSHAL Uncork the bubbly New Delhi, July 13: If the spirits are high, it must be white.As the idea of being seen with a drink in the hands catches on in metropolitan India, makers of white spirits are uncorking the bubbly. The reason for the celebration: their sales have soared a whopping 25 per cent. By contrast, Indian made whisky, which accounts for 60 per cent of the European-style liquor or Indian made foreign liquor market (IMFL), has grown just 7 per cent.White spirits  vodka, gin and white rum  are the sales toppers in the sub-continent, said Ramesh Mani, head of Focus Brands, which sells Scottish whisky Cutty Sark and a clutch of other liquor brands in Asia.However, the sales base for white spirits like Vodka, is low.

White spirits is a very fast-growing segment. We want to be part of the action, a Shaw Wallace official said.However, Weba will have to battle it out with other successful RTD cocktails, including Bacardis Bacardi Breezer  a white Rum based drink and UBs Romanov Shotz  another vodka based cocktail. The RTD vodkas have alcohol content of about 5 per cent, whereas, conventional Vodka has about 40 per cent of alcohol, which is perhaps makes it attractive to young office going drinkers including lady executives. In the conventional Vodka market, the premium segment is ruled by UDVs Smirnoff, which has a market share of about 50 per cent.

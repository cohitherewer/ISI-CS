The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 NTPC charged up for global foray, joins race for UK deal 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Towering plans 																								New Delhi, Dec. 19: The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) is planning to go global by expanding its operations and maintenance business in the UK and other European countries.																								It has made its first move by joining a consortium that is bidding to take over a thermal power plant in England.																								NTPC has been asked to join a consortium that is bidding for a contract to run Carron Energys 430 MW thermal power plant. NTPC will be in charge of operations and maintenance ( amp;M).																								The company plans to aggressively market its expertise next year with special focus on countries where the power establishment has completed more than 100 years. 																								Initially, the company will focus on offering consultancy services and preparing project reports, but later plans to become a joint venture partner.																								We have been invited by an investor who is interested in taking over a power project. Currently, we are being offered the job of an operations and maintenance contractor. We have to undertake a technical study for them and will explore any other kind of associations as and when the offer is made to us, said a company spokesperson.																								Our company has been invited to come on board for the due diligence exercise. However, this offer has to be examined by our board and only then can we explore our future plans. But this is a good opportunity for us (NTPC) and hopefully we may take up equity in the new company, said a senior director of NTPC. The company is likely to be taken over by a new management led by a major investor and is likely to offer a joint venture partnership to NTPC at a later stage. 																								However, sources said the negotiations by the investors with Carron Energy are in the preliminary stage and the question of NTPC getting any equity will only come up later. 																								Initially, we will get the operations and maintenance contract and that will happen only if the foreign investor completes the deal with Carron Energy, the NTPC official said.																								In September, when NTPC announced its financial results, the power utility announced its plans to tap the West Asian market with bids for power and desalination projects in Oman and Saudi Arabia.

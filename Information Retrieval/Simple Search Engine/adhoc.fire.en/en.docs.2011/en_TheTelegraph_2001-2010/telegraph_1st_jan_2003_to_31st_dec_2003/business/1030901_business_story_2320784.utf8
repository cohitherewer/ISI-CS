 Monday, September 01, 2003 				 Cell firms defend call blocking
																								New Delhi, Aug. 31 (PTI): Justifying their action of blocking WiLL calls in January this year, cellular operators have asked telecom regulator Trai to withdraw criminal proceedings against them saying such action will have an adverse impact on Indian firms in the world market, including their relations with foreign partners.																								According to sources, in their representations to Trai recently, cellular service providers have said, Their action was justified under the prevailing circumstances as a defensive measure and to protect their legitimate interest as operators.																								Trai, however, has said that cellular operators contention of defending their action was incorrect in view of the interconnection agreement between the cellular operators and BSNL.																								Trai officials confirmed the receipt of request letters from the cellular service providers requesting the authority to withdraw such cases as it was harming their reputation. Trai is yet to take a final view, they added.																								COAI director general T. V. Ramachandran declined to comment. 																								The cellular operators have said that there was no interconnection between the networks of concerned WiLL operators and the cellular operators in the respective telecom circles. 																								The existing link was only for calls originating from any of BSNLs network and terminating in cellular operators network and vice-versa.

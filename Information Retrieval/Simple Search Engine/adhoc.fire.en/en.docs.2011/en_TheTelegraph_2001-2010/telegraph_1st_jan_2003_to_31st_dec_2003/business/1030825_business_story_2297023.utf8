 Monday, August 25, 2003 				 WiLL warriors warn of lawsuit avalanche
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Hot potato																								New Delhi, Aug. 24: Basic telecom operators who offer wirless-in-local-loop (WiLL) services have threatened to move the Supreme Court if the government amends their licence conditions in a way that limits mobility.																								The threat from basic operators comes in the wake of the pressure mounted by cellular operators and the letter from telecom regulator Trai to the communications ministry last week for immediate implementation of the TDSAT order to keep the difference between the two services  WiLL and celluar.																								This month, cellular operators upped the ante as well, threatening to move court against the government if it did not restrict WiLL services within the short distance charging area  something that Trai and the tribunal have insisted on. Tempers cooled after communications minister Arun Shourie promised their demands would be examined.																								The Association of Basic Telecom Operators met Vinod Vaish, secretary, ministry of communications and information technology on Saturday and submitted a six-page letter reasoning why there should not be any change in their licence conditions.																								They argue that the Trai recommendations came without the government seeking its comment on the issue. Another key contention is that TDSAT has not directed either Trai or DoT to change the licence conditions of basic operators.

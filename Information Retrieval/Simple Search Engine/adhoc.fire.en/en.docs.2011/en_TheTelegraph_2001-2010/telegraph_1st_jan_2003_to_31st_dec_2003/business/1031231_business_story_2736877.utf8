 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Indian Oil director N.  K. Nayyar in Calcutta on Tuesday. Picture by Kishor  Roy Chowdhury 																								Calcutta, Dec. 30: Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) much-awaited debt restructuring package will be cleared on Monday by the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)-led corporate debt restructuring cell.																								On January 5, the corporate debt restructuring cell has called a meeting of the promoters, including 25 banks and financial institutions which have lent to the project. We will get to know the package that day, state commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.																								What has buoyed the state government is Indian Oils proposal to invest Rs 5,700 crore in the project, turning it into a world-class petrochemical manufacturing hub. Senior officials of Indian Oil  led by director (planning and business development) N. K.  Nayyar discussed the plan with Sen at a 90-minute meeting  here today. It was positive, Nayyar said after the talks.																								Sen said Indian Oil is extremely keen on investing in Haldia Petrochemicals. Today, we discussed how to go about the investment. It has been decided that a roadmap will be prepared by the state government and Indian Oil. Based on this, the company will carry out a feasibility study on the new plants that they plan to set up. They are keen to start the entire process as soon as possible.																								Indian Oils proposition will be discussed next month at a meeting to be attended by HPLs promoters, banks and Gail. The Fortune 500 firm is also open to the idea of Gail acquiring a 10 per cent stake in the project.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattcharjee was not in the meeting but said later in the evening that he would work out ways to get both Gail and Indian Oil on board.

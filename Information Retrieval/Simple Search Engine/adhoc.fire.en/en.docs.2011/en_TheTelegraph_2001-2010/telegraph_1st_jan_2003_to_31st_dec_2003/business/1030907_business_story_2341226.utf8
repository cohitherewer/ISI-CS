																								Kuala Lumpur, Sept. 6 (PTI): Tata Motors will export its first lot of Indica cars to Britain later this month. The company had also drawn up plans to expand its operations in Malaysia, which will be Tata Motors launching pad in the Asean market.																								On the companys Malaysia plans, executive director Ravi Kant said that besides an increase in sales of existing product segments in Malaysia, Tata Motors immediate targets include sale of pick-up trucks and sports utility vehicle Safari and the launch of Indica and Indigo in about a year.																								Currently our main thrust is going to be on pick-up trucks followed by Safari and passenger cars. That is the progression we are going to have in Malaysia, Kant said. The company plans to sell about 2000 units in Malaysia in a year. The company currently gets only about 8 per cent of its revenue from exports.

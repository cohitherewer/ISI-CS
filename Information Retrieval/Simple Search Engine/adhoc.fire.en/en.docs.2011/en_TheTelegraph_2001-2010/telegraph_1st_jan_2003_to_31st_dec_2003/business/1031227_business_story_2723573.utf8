The sensex today missed the 5700-mark by a whisker  less than a point. However, brokers are full of hope as the market undertone remains firm. The markets have so far rallied by close to 70 per cent during the current year and India is now the second best performer in Asia.																								According to brokers, the New Year will bring cheer for the investor as investments by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are likely to continue. In December, FIIs have made net investments of $1 billion in Indian shares. This has seen their net investments this year surpass the $6 billion-mark.																								However, on the stock markets today, it was the old economy counters, led by cement, steel and power, which shared the honours among others.

The nifty surpassed the earlier record high of 1818.15 logged on February 23, 2000, and hit the days peak of 1840.35, before mild profit-taking pushed it to a close of 1837.05. 																								On the BSE, apart from cement shares, other key old economy counters like Tata Motors, Reliance, Hindustan Lever, BSES, State Bank of India, Hindustan Petroleum, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam recorded gains on heavy buying support.

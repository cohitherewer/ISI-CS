 Tuesday, August 12, 2003 				 Trai view on limited mobility in 3 months 
																								New Delhi, Aug. 11 (PTI): The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today said that in two to three months it will submit recommendations on TDSATs directive to work out level playing field between cellular and basic operators offering WiLL services.																								TDSAT has given four months to the government. We will work out the details and submit our recommendations to the government in the next two to three months, Trai chairman Pradip Baijal said. The regulator would work out the details in letter and spirit of TDSATs judgement, he added.																								Regarding consulting the telecom players, he said, We have not yet decided on the modalities... We will come out with a consultation paper and may hold open house discussion at some of the places.																								The consultation paper would be issued within the next two weeks, said Baijal, adding that this would be a separate exercise and would not clash with Trais proposed consultation on unified licence regime.																								The main areas for working out level playing field include additional entry-fee over and above what the basic telecom operators were paying, charges for additional spectrum and access charge among others.																								TDSAT, last week, while allowing WiLL mobile services, had asked the government to initiate action on level playing field and complete the exercise within four months.																								Though Trai has started working out level playing field between cellular and basic telecom operators, industry analysts feel it might be a difficult task as one service (WiLL) was limited and the other (cellular) was unlimited.																								The analysts added that unified licence regime could provide an enduring solution to the present woes of the telecom industry.

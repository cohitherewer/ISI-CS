The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, March 18, 2003 				 Come back to a digital network home with LG
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 17: Picture this: You are heading home after a hard days work; your stomach is growling and you want to catch the latest twist and turn in the long-running family soap on television. The trouble is that you are caught in a fiendish traffic jam  and you dont have the time to cook that dinner and plonk yourself in front of the telly to catch the programme.																								LG could just have the solution for you. Its called the digital network home (DNH) which lashes together a range of internet-enabled devices and home appliances to take the charm of TV dinners to a new realm of possibility.																								DNH, which throws in internet-enabled products like refrigerators, air-conditioners, internet microwave, washing machine and a digital projection TV, doesnt come cheap: be prepared to stump up Rs 7 lakh.																								Dreamwhiz from Korea has designed the software for the digital network homes. The operational technology known as LNCP (living network control protocol for information sharing) used by LG is based on Bluetooth technology.																								Bluetooth is a global de facto standard of wireless connectivity. Based on a low-cost, short-range radio link. Bluetooth cuts the cords that used to tie up digital devices. When two Bluetooth-equipped devices come within a 10 metre range of each other, they can establish a connection together.																								This is the first time that a home appliance is offering Bluetooth connectivity on its products  a facility that several companies offer abroad.																								LGs LNCP technology enables an individual to download programme information in a shorter and much faster way, while the PLC (power line communication) facilitates hardware connectivity between products.																								This technology will cater to a market of people who are computer freaks and who want to control life through remote control, says Ganesh Mahalingam, LGs head of sales and marketing. Rivals, however, are more sceptical and reckon there wont be a great market for the product that is priced too high.																								While admitting India is a not a very big market for such tech-savvy products, Mahalingam said, We will be more than happy if we are able to sell even 100 units this year. The DNH range will be available for sale in all metropolises.																								Last year, LG introduced this technology in six other countries. India is the first country in which it is launching these products this year. It will be launched in China soon. 																								LG, which claims to be the number one consumer durable player in India, sells approximately 20,000 units of internet-enabled products on an average. We are the leaders but there is still the need to create a bigger market. However, this kind of product might not really increase our profits but help us globally establish our presence across all the possible segments. said S. S. Kim, vice-chairman and CEO, LG Electronics Digital Appliance.

 Wednesday, October 08, 2003 				 Rasna spruces up its range
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Oct. 7: Rasna Private Limited, the Rs 175-crore Ahmedabad based concentrated soft-drink powder company, today announced a foray into the milk additives business with the launch of Rasna Shake UP, a pre-sweetened milkshake mix powder. The company is targeting an additional Rs 100 crore turnover from this segment.																								The company is also planning to launch soft drink concentrates in January next year, said Piruz Khambatta, chairman and managing director of the company. 																								Rasna has invested about Rs 2 crore towards research for the new milkshake. The products unique selling proposition lies in its cost. Rasna will provide the new drink for about Rs 3 per glass, whereas its prime competitors, Complan and Horlicks, are priced much higher in terms of cost per glass. Most drinking chocolates cost about Rs 6 per glass, Khambatta said. 																								Rasna Shake UP, which is enhanced with proteins and vitamins, will be available in three flavours  chocolate, mango and strawberry. A single serve is priced at Rs 3 and the six-glass pack is priced at Rs 15. 																								The powdered soft drink category is estimated to be worth about Rs 250 crore. Rasna claims that it has a 90 per cent market share of this segment. 																								Khambatta also said that Rasna, along with three other companies, have submitted bids to acquire the Hyderabad production plant of Tang, the international soft drink powder major. Tang had earlier launched its premium powder drink in India by setting up a plant here with a distribution tie-up with Dabur. 																								Rasna, which has earlier created memorable advertising on television, is trying a repeat again with milk. Rasnas long standing advertising agency, Mudra, will launch the Rs 10-crore advertising campaign through print, outdoor and below the line activities like free sampling of products in schools. 																								For years Rasna was ruling the roost in the powdered soft drink category. However, ever since Coca Cola has entered the same segment with Sunfill, competition has heated up, according to observers. 																								After Coke launched the Rs 2 sachets of Sunfill, Rasna reacted last summer with its ek ka do sachets that give two serves at Re 1. 																								Other products in the Rasna portfolio include its mid-sized powder concentrates, Rasna Utsav, Rasna Juice Up and its premium soft-drink powder fruit booster priced at Rs 100, which the company says does not sell well in the domestic market.

 Thursday, May 22, 2003 				 Siemens to chug along rail track 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT		 Talk to me: Models display  new Siemens handsets in Delhi on Wednesday. Picture  by Jagdish YadavNew Delhi, May 21: Siemens AG will focus on software development for mobile communications in India and target Indian Railways for its GSM-R products. 																								GSM-R is the wireless communication platform for rail traffic.																								Siemens Communications Mobile India, the subsidiary of Siemens AG and division of Siemens Ltd India, launched six handsets and announced its decision to shift its telecom network software development centre from Munich to Bangalore.																								Announcing the new initiative, Lothar Pauly, member on the board of Siemens information and communication mobile group (Siemens Mobile), said: Bangalore will be a strategic centre for Siemens with the decision to transfer the work of developing software for telecom network from Munich. The staff at Bangalore will be increased from 400 to 500 and they will develop network software for location-based services and multimedia services. 																								Location-based services enable mobile phones to be used for providing geographical orientation like finding the nearest ATM or a hotel in a new city or town or a country. The multimedia software will enable users to view videos or large volumes of data that can even be transferred from mobile phones, he added.																								We are world leaders in GSM-R technology. The system has been deployed in seven European countries and are in pilot stages in Russia and China. In India, we are in advance stages of negotiations for a pilot project with the Indian Railways, said Pauly.

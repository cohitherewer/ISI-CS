 Saturday, May 10, 2003 				 Nigeria blacklists drug firms
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, May 9: While the resource-rich sub-Saharan African countries have been identified as a thrust area in Indias exim policy, some rogue companies appear to have tarnished the countrys image by exporting spurious and sub-standard drugs.																								Sources disclose that the Indian High Commission in Nigeria has confirmed that the Nigerian authorities have blacklisted Indian companies for exporting these fake pharmaceuticals.																								There is serious concern in the commerce ministry over the issue as such incidents give the country a bad name. Nigeria is a major supplier of crude oil to India and larger exports to that country would help to reduce the trade deficit.																								Since Indian medicines are much cheaper than those supplied by the west there is a huge demand for them in the African countries which find them more affordable. 																								The governments of these countries buy drugs in large quantities through the tender system. The rogue companies have been apparently been putting in low bids and then supplying counterfeit drugs to make a fast buck.

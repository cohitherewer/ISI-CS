 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Marginal rise in Hyundai net profit
 KIM KYOUNG-WHA																								Seoul, Nov. 11 (Reuters): Hyundai Motor Co, South Koreas top auto maker, reported a surprise 1.7 per cent rise in quarterly profits on Tuesday, helped by a reduced tax burden and smaller losses at the firms financial units.

Analysts said Hyundai looks set for a better performance in the final quarter as it cranks up production to fill inventories depleted during the industrial action. 																								In October alone, Hyundais factory utilisation rate topped 100 per cent, a really good sign for earnings at a capital-intensive car maker, said Kim Hag-ju, a Samsung Securities analyst.

 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, Dec. 21: Primary dealers are setting sights on overseas markets after acquiring a command over underwriting and market-making capabilities here.																								Some of the primary dealers have approached the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seeking an international presence through branches, joint ventures or subsidiaries abroad. According to senior RBI officials, the proposal mooted recently is only at a preliminary stage with modalities yet to be worked out.																								It is only a concept and at a nascent stage. Nothing concrete has emerged as yet, a senior RBI official told The Telegraph.																								Sources said this proposal from primary dealers follows their experience in government securities. Therefore, there is a suggestion that they can use this experience in markets abroad, they added.																								Though industry analysts are confident that Indian primary dealers can successfully establish a presence in other countries, there is a word of caution as well.																								A senior official from Securities Trading Corporation of India Ltd, one of the largest primary dealers here, said overseas plans will have to take into account their tough stipulations and the risk element as well.																								This is a high net worth game. There is a huge risk involved in addition to the stringent conditions laid by regulators overseas requiring a huge capital. Therefore, only a few primary dealers can successfully implement such plans, he said.																								Sources indicated that primary dealers may begin operations overseas by initially opening a liaison office and subsequently promoting retail investment.																								The system of primary dealers was introduced by the central bank in 1996 with a view to strengthen the institutional infrastructure in the government securities market to make it liquid vibrant and broad-based.																								The objective was to develop such capabilities outside the central bank. The central bank had then granted licences to six entities and the list was subsequently expanded.

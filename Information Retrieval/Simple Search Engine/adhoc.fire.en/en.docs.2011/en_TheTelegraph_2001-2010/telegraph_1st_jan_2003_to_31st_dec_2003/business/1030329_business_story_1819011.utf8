 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 28 A war of words broke out today between India and the Netherlands over the arrest of the CEO and some other employees of i-flex Solutions in London and two other cities, with New Delhi lodging a strong protest and the Dutch maintaining that the Indians did not have the required work permits.																								Terming the whole incident as grossly unfortunate and patently unwarranted, an external affairs ministry spokesman said these acts were beginning to sound like neo-protectionism and a non-tariff barrier. New Delhis serious concern over the development was conveyed by the Indian ambassador at the Hague Shymala Kaushi to the Dutch authorities and to the Dutch ambassador here P.F.C. Koch by the ministry.																								Reacting to the Indian governments charge, the Dutch government said the arrested infotech professionals of i-flex did not have the required work permits but dismissed the charge that the action was against Indian professionals.

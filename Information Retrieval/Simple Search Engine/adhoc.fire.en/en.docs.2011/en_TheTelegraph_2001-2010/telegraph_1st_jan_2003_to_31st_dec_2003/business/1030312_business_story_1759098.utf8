 Wednesday, March 12, 2003 				 Strike at Hind Lever factory
																								Calcutta, March 11 (PTI): Alleging that the management of Hindustan Lever was violating workers rights, the workmen of the companys Garden Reach factory have launched an indefinite strike since Monday.																								In a press statement issued today by the president of Hindustan Lever Sramik Karmachari Congress, Kamal Tewary, said the HLL management was not honouring the understanding reached before the West Bengal labour minister in October last year on curtailment of manpower in manufacturing operations. The company had already closed down two major units, detergents and toilet soap in the factory, he added.																								An HLL spokesman said that such periodic disruptions would only undermine the long-term viability of the Garden Reach factory. He said that the workers union has once again picked up the confrontationist path which was totally unjustified.

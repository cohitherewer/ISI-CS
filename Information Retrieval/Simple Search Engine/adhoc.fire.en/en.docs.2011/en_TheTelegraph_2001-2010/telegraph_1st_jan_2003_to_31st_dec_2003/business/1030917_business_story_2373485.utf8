 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Crackdown on two drug firms
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chandigarh, Sept. 16: Criminal proceedings have been initiated against two pharmaceutical giants, Lupin and Cipla, by the Haryana health department as part of its drive to make available life-saving drugs at reasonable rates to patients. 																								Civil surgeon at Panchkula, Satbir Singh Chaudhary, said that a criminal case against Lupin Ltd had been initiated because the firm has been found to be supplying a strip of its branded antibiotic Sparfloxacin at a price of Rs 30.70 to the retailers while the maximum retail price shown on the strip is Rs 66. This is helping the retailers to retain a profit margin of over 100 per cent. 																								Cadila Pharmaceuticals has also been booked on similar ground, for one of its branded medicines containing Amoxycillin 250 mg, Chaudhary said.

 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Bill to set up central sales tax tribunal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Dec. 22: The government today introduced in the lower house a bill to amend the Central Sales tax Act which would set up an appellate tribunal to settle inter-state rows on levy and collection of sales tax. 																								The bill states that since CST is levied by states from which movement of goods starts, disputes have often arisen between two states on whether movement of goods constitutes sale.																								The appellate authority would have the power to adjudicate on such issues. All appeals before various sales tax tribunals, which have an inter-state connotation, will stand transferred to this new appellate body once it is set up.																								The government also introduced the arbitration and conciliation (amendment) bill, 2003 which seeks to set a time limit on arbitration to a period of one year. In case it is not completed within that time, the court will fix limits. 																								The bill also seeks to empower courts to make reference to arbitration to resolve their disputes during the pendency of such proceedings before it.																								These measures are being proposed as the existing Act does not provide for expediting awards or the subsequent proceedings.

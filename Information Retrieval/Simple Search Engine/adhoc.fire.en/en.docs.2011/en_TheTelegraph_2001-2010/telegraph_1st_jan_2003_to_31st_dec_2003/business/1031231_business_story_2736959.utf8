 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, Dec. 30: After having signed its first property deal in east India at Darjeeling, the WelcomHeritage group is aggressively looking at Shillong, Agartala and Guwahati as possible destinations in the coming year.																								I have just completed a trip to the Northeast. As a part of our expansion plan, we are looking forward to sign on heritage properties in the region. Nagaland and Mizoram are very attractive tourist spots, said Rakesh Mathur, president of Welcome Heritage group.																								The group is looking at colonial bungalows, which were essentially built by the British but are now owned by individuals who have converted these properties into tea estates. 																								Some of these properties make excellent locations for people who want to spend nature holidays. These places are not only beautiful but serene also give the tourists a sense of privacy, Mathur added.																								Earlier this year, the group signed an agreement with Windamere Hotel in Darjeeling, originally a boarding house built for British and Scottish tea planters. Under the deal, WelcomHeritage has taken over the marketing and franchise of the hotel.																								As a part of development strategy for year 2004, WelcomHeritage will promote the concept of circuit tourism. For hotels to grow, independent properties at isolated locations will never prove to be successful. In an attempt to visit any particular region, tourists always prefer to travel three to four places. It is, therefore, important for us to provide them a right living environment in each of these destinations, said Mathur.																								According to him, the group is expected to grow 22.7 per cent in 2003-04. Last year, the company made a turnover of Rs 22 crore while it targeted a modest Rs 26 crore. The last year was not too good. But this year, we are positive of fulfilling our estimations, said Mathur. The group hopes to make a turnover of Rs 27 crore.																								He said the chain planned to increase the tally of its hotels to 35 by this month and 50 a year later. However, the group has only been able to sign 32 properties so far. 																								Among the properties signed this year include places like Darjeeling, Mysore, Ooty, Ladakh and Leh. On the other hand, the group did not renew its contract with its existing properties in Bikaner, Jodhpur and Nalagarh.																								WelcomHeritage is a 50:50 joint venture between ITC Hotels and Marudhar Hotels, which has properties including palaces, forts, havelis, royal tents, jungle lodges and resorts at heritage locations. These are situated and spread across the states of Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Madhya Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.

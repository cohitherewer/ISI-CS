 Thursday, June 05, 2003 				 Indian Airlines gets Smart with Apex fare 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 4: Indian Airlines has recast its Apex fare structure giving passengers the option of booking their economy class tickets either seven days or 21 days in advance.																								Calling it the Smart Apex fare, IA said that the decision to have differential advance booking periods had been taken with a view to catering to the needs of the business passengers, on the one hand, and of the leisure/vacation traveller, on the other.																								The two advance booking windows will be for one way or a round trip journey in the economy class.																								The current Apex fare scheme, which allows ticket booking 15 days in advance, will be withdrawn from June 7. However, all tickets booked up to June 6 under this scheme will be accepted for travel for the date of original booking. 																								The scheme, which becomes saleable from June 7, will be valid for travel effective from June 14 in the case of passengers who book their tickets seven days in advance and from June 28 in the case of those who book them 21 days in advance.																								The price of the tickets vary depending on when you book them. For instance, the Delhi-Calcutta economy-class ticket booked 21 days in advance is priced at Rs 3,250. The same ticket booked seven days in advance will cost Rs 6,851. The Calcutta-Mumbai ticket booked 21 days in advance will cost Rs 3,710 and the same ticket booked seven days in advance will cost Rs 6,385.																								Any change in booking from D-15 to either D-7 or D-21 would be permitted without application of any cancellation charge. The difference in fare, however, will be collected or refunded as the case may be. 																								Meanwhile, Jet Airways is offering a range of Jet Escape Summer packages, inclusive of economy-class return airfare, to various exotic destinations at some of Indias leading hotels and resorts.

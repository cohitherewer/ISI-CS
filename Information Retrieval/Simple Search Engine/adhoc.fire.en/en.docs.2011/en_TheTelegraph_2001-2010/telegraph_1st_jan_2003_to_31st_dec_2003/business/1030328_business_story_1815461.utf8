 Friday, March 28, 2003 				 Rasna to quench thirst of a billion
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 27: Rasna is charting an aggressive course to expand the market and take soft drink to the remote corners of the country where people have not yet tasted soft drink. With the launch of its sachet product, the soft drink concentrate major is targeting a billion Indian homes. 																								With the sachet product, which gives a glass of Rasna for 0.50 paise, we will touch 86 per cent of the population that has not yet experienced a soft drink, says Piruz Khambatta, chairman and managing director of Rasna. The company has also launched its pre-sweetened ready-to-drink Juc-Up range. 																								The Rs 175-crore company presently has a market share of 86.9 per cent, way ahead of competitor Sunfill at 5 per cent, and has an annual consumption of 2 billion glasses by 29 million regular consumers.																								We expect to double our turnover next fiscal with the new pricing strategy, Khambatta added.

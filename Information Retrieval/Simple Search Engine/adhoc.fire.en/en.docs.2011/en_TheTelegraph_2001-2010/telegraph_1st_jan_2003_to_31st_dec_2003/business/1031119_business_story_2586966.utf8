The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, November 19, 2003 				 Wipro Calcutta debut in March
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Nov. 18: Come March 2004, Wipro will kick off its operations through a development centre at Salt Lake in Calcutta, Wipro Spectramind chief financial officer Raj Dutta said. He was speaking on the sidelines of Infocom 2003, a Nasscom  Businessworld event. 																								First, we will start with our business process outsourcing operations here. The core software operations will follow, said Dutta. He, however, did not give any time frame for kicking off software development activity.																								To begin with, Wipro is laying down a 1000-seater facility in Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec), where work will begin with 500 people. The company employs over 8,500 people in six centres across five cities in the country and the centre in Calcutta will be its seventh facility. 																								Wipro Spectramind is one of the fastest growing BPO companies in the country. Its revenue has grown from $10 million to over $21 million in the last four quarters. It offers one of the most competitive rates in the industry at $13.35 per hour. 																								There are many people from Calcutta who are working at our other facilities and have expressed their desire to come back to the city. We will give them an opportunity to relocate. There will also be fresh recruitment as we plan to scale up operations in all our centres, he added. The three-and-a-half-year-old company is expanding both manpower and business domain. 																								In a meeting with a group of chief executive officers on Monday, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had announced that Wipro had requested for another eight acres of land in Saltlec. 																								We have already identified six acres of land in the complex and I have written a letter to Azim Premji about that, he said at Infocom 2003. 																								Dutta, however, declined to comment on the companys plan with the new plot of land. 																								Wipros Calcutta centre will conduct both voice and non-voice transactions. 																								We dont have any plans to earmark the Calcutta centre for any specific operation. The facility will be used for all sorts of BPO functions, mentioned Dutta.

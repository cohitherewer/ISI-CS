 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 6: Cellular service providers plan to challenge the interconnect user charge (IUC)  the fee that telecom companies need to pay to link up in order to carry calls seamlessly across networks before the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Tuesday.																								The cellular operators are seeking redressal of their grievance that the IUC is loaded against them. If Trai rejects their contention, they plan to approach the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT).																								T.V. Ramachandran, director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), said, The IUC stipulated by Trai has discriminatory and is tilted in favour of the limited mobile operators. We will soon bring out the flaw in the IUC regime by Tuesday when an appeal will be made to the regulator.

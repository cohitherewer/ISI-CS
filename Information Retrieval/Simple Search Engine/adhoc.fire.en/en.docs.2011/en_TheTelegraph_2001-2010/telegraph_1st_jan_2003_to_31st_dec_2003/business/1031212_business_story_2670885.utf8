 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 UK move not to hit outsourcing
																								London, Dec. 11 (PTI): Britains decision to clamp down on those avoiding payment of value-added tax (VAT) would not come in the way of firms which outsource services to countries like India, officials said today.																								The government has looked carefully at least twice at the issue and could find no evidence that VAT is a critical factor in outsourcing decisions, a spokesman for the treasury said.																								When we take action to stop blatant VAT avoidance, we do not expect this to affect the market for outsourcing, he added.																								The contested VAT grouping rule is designed to help large companies by freeing them from paying VAT on intra-company services. However, it is not meant to cover outsourcing to a separate company. The industry argues that if the service had been kept in-house, companies would not have to pay VAT. Therefore, outsourcing should not come under the purview of VAT.																								Taken together with the closure of other VAT loopholes announced yesterday, the treasury estimates that it will receive an extra 400 million in tax receipts in the next three years.																								Companies which outsource their services are exploiting VAT regulations on grouping to avoid paying the tax. The customs and excise department has been trying to stop the practice, but the government is poised to start consulting industry about legislation to make it tougher to avoid VAT through this route.																								Companies increasingly outsource services such as financial back office functions, invoicing and call centres to countries with cheap labour such as India.																								Some tax experts think the proposed change will increase the shift of British jobs overseas.																								The measure takes away the loophole that was there for companies to mitigate VAT costs on outsourcing, said Kendra Hann, head of the London VAT Group at Deloitte and Touche.																								It may drive the move to India and other cheaper countries further, if the UK outsourcing sector has to change VAT. Or, they may choose not to outsource at all, he added.																								The government announced a VAT strategy last year, which is designed to reduce the amount of value-added tax that is not paid, whether due to simple accounting errors or organised criminal fraud. It has recruited 1,000 extra staff to clamp down on tax avoidance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, June 13, 2003  Videocon relents on pay-back
 - Company to clear Rs 990-cr dues to free Ravva assets  S. P. S. Pannu New Delhi, June 12: The petroleum ministry has pinned  down Videocon over a Rs 990 crore loan that the company  has raised through the IDBI by pledging the entire eastern  offshore Ravva oilfields as security even though it had  only a 25 per cent stake in the field. Sources say Videocon has now agreed to start returning around  Rs 30 crore every month from the sales proceeds from its  share of oil so that the major chunk of the loan is cleared  at the earliest.  Recovering this money will not be difficult as the Ravva  crude is bought by the national oil companies and payments  to the company can be withheld till the loan amount is settled.  The crude is currently being supplied to Bongaigaon Refineries  and Petrochemicals Ltd. Interestingly, the petroleum ministry has also highlighted  the fact that Videocon diverted part of this loan for some  of its other businesses. Videocon has in fact managed to wriggle out of a very messy  situation as the petroleum ministry had threatened to toss  the company out of the ONGC-discovered oilfield. This would  have deprived the private sector company of the lucrative  flow of earnings from the mid-sized field. Videocon has issued debentures worth Rs 990 crore to financial  institutions and the revenue flow from the Ravva oilfield  has been pledged as security. The security is being held  in trust with IDBI to ensure the rights of the debenture  holders.  The petroleum ministry had taken strong exception to the  fact that although Videocon had only a 25 per cent share  in the oilfield, on the basis of a production sharing contract  signed in 1994, it had exposed the entire oilfield to financial  risk. ONGC still owns 40 per cent of the oilfield. Cairn  Energy of the UK owns 22.5 per cent and Marubeni Corporation  the remaining 12.5 per cent.  The ministry had issued Videocon (now called Petrocon for  the Ravva operations) a notice for terminating the contract  if it did not make amends. The ministry had also threatened  to recover damages under the provisions of the Indian  Contract Act.
 Initially, Videocon is reported to have gone in for some  tough posturing and talked of going in for arbitration.  However, the weak nature of its case and the high stakes  involved reportedly forced it to fall in line.  Videocon and its partners Cairn and Marubeni have also refused  to pay another Rs 1000 crore by way of profit petroleum  to the government.  The hastily drawn up contract in 1994, when Satish Sharma  was the petroleum minister, appears to have left some loopholes  which these companies are trying to exploit. As a result,  the case has been referred to arbritration proceedings.

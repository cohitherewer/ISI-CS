 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 IOC maps out cross-holding sale strategy
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 19: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is open to the option of offloading its shares in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Gail (India) Limited. 																								The decision to sell cross-holdings would be taken in consultation with the government and PSUs concerned, said Indian Oil chairman M. S. Ramachandran.																								Ramachandran refused to divulge the final date of the sale, but senior officials of the Fortune 500 company say an important question was whether the market has the appetite for the shares. Also, the corporation is not in dire need of money. 																								While some of the money raised from selling these shares can help retire debts, Indian Oil s capital expenditure plans can be financed through existing resources, the Indian Oil chief said while announcing an alliance with French oil major Total to sell additive brands for petrol and diesel.

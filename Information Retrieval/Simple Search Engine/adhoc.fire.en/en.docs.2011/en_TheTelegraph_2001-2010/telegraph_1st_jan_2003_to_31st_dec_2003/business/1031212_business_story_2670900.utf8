 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Two oil majors warm up for interim payout
 OUR BUREAUX Dividend booty 																								Dec. 11: Two public sector oil companies  Indian Oil Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum  today said their boards would meet later this month to consider payment of interim dividend.																								Ever since the Supreme Court stalled the privatisation programme, analysts were expecting the government to milk the cash-rich oil companies and banks to ease financial stress. Despite pressure on profitability, the oil companies are expected to pay dividends generously.																								Last year, Hindustan Petroleum paid a dividend of Rs 20 per share in two instalments. The total payout was a little over 44 per cent of its full-year earnings. Indian Oil paid a dividend of Rs 21 per share in two tranches  it paid an interim dividend of Rs 5 and a final dividend of Rs 16.																								Indian Oil had issued bonus shares in the ratio of 1:2, and paid its final dividend of Rs 16 on increased capital. Effectively it disbursed 55 per cent of its annual profits in dividends. In India, dividend pay out normally does not exceed 30 per cent of profits.																								The oil PSUs generate huge cash surpluses every year, much more than they require to fund their expansion plans, said Jigar Shah of Kisan Ratilal Choksey Shares and Securities. Hindustan Petroleum is expected to pay a dividend Rs 20-21 this year, and Indian Oil, Rs 30.																								In the half year that ended in September, Indian Oil earned Rs 23.56 per share, and Hindustan Petroleum, Rs 17.74 per share. The two companies full-year earnings in 2002-03 were Rs 52.35 and Rs 45.37 respectively.																								The share price of the two companies has hardened over the last few weeks on dividend hopes. With todays announcement, both Indian Oil and Hindustan Petroleum surged above Rs 400. While Indian Oil gained Rs 21.55 to close at Rs 410.75 on the National Stock Exchange today, Hindustan Petroleum advanced Rs 11.55 to Rs 403.30.																								IBP, another state-owned oil company, paid an interim dividend of Rs 10 per share last month. Though Bharat Petroleum and ONGC have not indicated plans of paying interim dividend as yet, their share prices have run up on dividend hopes.																								Hindustan Petroleums board meets on December 22 to consider dividend. The record date is December 30. Indian Oils board meets on December 26. Record date for its proposed dividend payment is January 2.

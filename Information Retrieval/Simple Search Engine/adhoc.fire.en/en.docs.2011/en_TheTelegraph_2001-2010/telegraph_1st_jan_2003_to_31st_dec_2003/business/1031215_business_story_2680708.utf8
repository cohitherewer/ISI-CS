The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 ONGC mulls fuel retail venture with 49% stake 
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA				 	 Pumped up																								Calcutta, Dec. 14: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is planning to set up a separate joint venture to enter into the retailing business for petrol and diesel next year.																								 The joint venture, in which the upstream major will not have more than 49 per cent stake, will be kept outside the governments purview so that it can stay afloat in the cut-throat competition of the retail market. 																								The move has been taken as the oil major wants total freedom in running the retail business, which will otherwise be difficult to manage by ONGC itself.																								A senior ONGC executive has pointed out that the proposed company will have financial institutions as joint venture partners. However, a financial institution will only be able to hold a maximum of 25.9 per cent stake in the proposed venture. 																								Asked whether ONGCs subsidiary  Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL)  will have any stake in the proposed company, the executive said no concrete decision in this regard has been taken so far.																								Incidentally, MRPL is readying for a venture into the retail business in a big way.																								ONGC chairman Subir Raha has already made a detailed presentation to Union petroleum minister Ram Naik in this regard. 																								The corporation, in its presentation, has said that a new company is required for proper running of the downstream business by recruiting skilled manpower and agencies.																								ONGC does not have any experience in retail marketing of petro products and it is not advisable to run such an important consumer-oriented business without any exposure. Moreover, there will be hardly any cost advantage if the retailing is done by ONGC itself, the executive said.

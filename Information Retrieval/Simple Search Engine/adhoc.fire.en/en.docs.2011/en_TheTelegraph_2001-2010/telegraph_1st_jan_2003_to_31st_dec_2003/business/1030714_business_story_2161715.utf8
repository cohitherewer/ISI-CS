 Monday, July 14, 2003 				 Alfa Laval sets sights on Rs 500cr turnover
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, July 13: On the back of an expanding business overseas, Pune-based engineering giant Alfa Laval plans to increase its turnover by some 70 per cent to Rs 500 crore this fiscal.																								Alfa Laval managing director Satish Tandon told The Telegraph, Our European principals have decided to turn us into a global business hub and consequently we are actively chasing business in East Africa, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Turkey, Russia, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and other third world countries.																								Tandon said the company expects its export turnover at about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the total turnover or up to Rs 150 crore. Much of the business is coming from huge orders for distillery plants to be set up in Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.																								Even Pakistani business houses are keen to source distillery plants from us. We cant name them as yet but we have made trips to Karachi and other Pakistani cities and the response has been extremely positive, Tandon said.																								We are selling the Vietnamese a molasses based alcohol plant, costing about Rs 24 crore. The plant is being set up about 200 km from Hanoi. The company is also exporting vegetable oil plants to Finland, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, December 04, 2003 				 HSBC offer price fails to excite institutions
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Damodaran: Wait amp; watch																								Calcutta, Dec. 3: Unit Trust of India (UTI)  the principal promoter of UTI Bank  and other large stakeholders are unlikely to participate in HSBCs public offer for 20 per cent of the banks shares at Rs 90 apiece, say investment bankers and analysts.																								Most analysts believe HSBC had offered to buy the 33.46 per cent stake owned by the Trust before knocking on CDCs doors. It appears UTI was not impressed with the price offered by HSBC, say analysts.																								Theres no official word on it yet. Asked whether the Trust would participate in HSBCs offer, UTI board member D.S.R. Murthy said: I couldnt answer that question till the board has discussed HSBCs offer.																								Chairman M. Damodaran, who had previously said Unit Trust would consider offloading its stake in UTI Bank if offered an attractive price, could not be contacted. He was reported to be meeting finance ministry officials in Delhi.																								Other key shareholders like Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), General Insurance Corporation (GIC) and the Citi Group are also likely to ignore the offer, say investment bankers.																								LIC and GIC were amongst the promoters of the bank and hold 13.5 per cent and 7.39 per cent respectively. 																								The Citi group owns 7.66 per cent of the banks shares through two entities  Citicorp Banking Corporation and Chryscapital  both holding 3.83 per cent apiece.																								The deal pushed up UTI Banks shares by 20 per cent today. The stock is closed at Rs 115  Rs 25 higher than the price offered by HSBC. Analysts say UTI Bank looks strong at this level, and its unlikely that market price will fall below Rs 90. Unless HSBC revises its offer, therell be hardly any retail participation either.																								At least a couple of other public offers have flopped recently for the same reason.

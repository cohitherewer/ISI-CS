 Saturday, January 04, 2003 				 Eli Lilly readies India prescription
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan 3: Eli Lilly amp; Company is considering several options to increase its presence in the country that includes co-marketing arrangements, obtaining licences to further develop and sell molecules made by Indian firms in overseas markets, entering into contract research and manufacturing, besides lining up product launches.																								However, the US-based firm has decided to consciously stay away from acquisitions, focussing largely on organic growth, Eli Lilly amp; Company (India) chairman and managing director Rajiv Gulati said.																								Gulati said the parent is considering holding phase II trials in India for its insulin inhaler as well as launch the Cialis, its erectile dysfunction product, in the next few years. The Indian subsidiary, which earned more than Rs 125 crore for the calendar year 2002, has a significant part of its topline coming from insulin. 																								He did not rule out the possibility of the company entering into marketing arrangements with other Indian companies that had a strong distribution network for Cialis. However, he added that the launch of the product depends upon IPRs. Another product to be launched in the next few months is Dobutrex.																								Eli Lilly has a 50:50 joint venture with Ranbaxy Laboratories in India. The venture was primarily set up to manufacture and sell select drugs of Eli Lilly and Ranbaxy in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan. In August 2001, the US firm acquired Ranbaxys 50 per cent equity in the venture, making it a 100 per cent Lilly subsidiary. 																								Eli Lilly has also finalised a sourcing arrangement with Shasun Chemicals for sourcing two bulk drugs to meet its global requirements.

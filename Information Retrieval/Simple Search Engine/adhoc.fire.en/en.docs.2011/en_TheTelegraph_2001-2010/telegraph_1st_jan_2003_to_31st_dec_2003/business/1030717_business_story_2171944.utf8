 Thursday, July 17, 2003 				 Universal licence opposed
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 16: The opposition to universal licence has already begun even before the ink on the hard copy of the consultation paper has dried. Cellular operators alleged that there is no objectivity in the consultation paper. It seems that the regulator has firmed up its opinion about the issue. There are only positive aspects of the universal licence and no negative aspects have been placed for consultation, said a senior executive of a leading cellular service provider in the country.																								This has been opposed by the fixed-line operators who feel that this is an open offer for consultation and needs to be discussed. The regulator has provided an opportunity to debate the issues comprehensively, that have been kept under wraps by cellular operators or taken up separately, said a senior executive in Association of Basic Telecom Operators.																								The regulator is unfazed by these criticisms. A senior Trai official said: We have maintained objectivity. If anyone has problems on the issue, we would like to hear and read about it in their suggestions.

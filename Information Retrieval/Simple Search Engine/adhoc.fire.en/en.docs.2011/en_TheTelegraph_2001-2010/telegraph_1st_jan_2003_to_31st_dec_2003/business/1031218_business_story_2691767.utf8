 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 17: In an ambitious move to expand its advisory business and attain global scale, Crisil Ltd, the countrys leading credit rating agency, has acquired EconoMatters Ltd, a London-based energy and gas advisory firm, and its subsidiaries for over Rs 15 crore.																								This acquisition represents Crisils first major international foray. The rating agency hopes to propel and participate in the greater global spread and growth of Economatters, Crisil managing director R. Ravimohan said immediately after the board meeting.																								The deal size is around 15 per cent of the companys net worth and the entire payment of acquisition will be met out of internally-generated resources, Ravimohan said.																								The transaction was subject to relevant statutory approvals. The board of Economatters would be reconstituted, he said, adding key people of the London-based energy and gas advisory entity would continue to work with the firm after the acquisition, he said.																								Following the acquisition, Economatters would become a subsidiary of Crisil and we will maintain the status of subsidiaries of Economatters as it is for some time, he said.																								Economatters and its subsidiaries are serving global companies, multilateral agencies and leading international banks, he added. 																								Ravimohan, Hemant Joshi and Rupa Kudwa (the latter two are executive directors at Crisil) would join the Economatters board; the chairperson of the board would be Clare Spottiswoode.																								Hemant Joshi, who is also the chief operating officer of Crisil, said the company still has the appetite to grow through acquisitions. The company has cash reserves of over Rs 75 crore and in several meetings with analysts Crisil officials have hinted at the possibility of using the reserves for acquisitions.																								Crisils strategy will be to expand the business of EconoMatters and its subsidiaries  Gas Strategies Consulting Limited, Alphatania Limited, Gas matters Limited and Overview Conferences Limited  by synergising with itself.																								According to Joshi, Crisils aim will be to attempt to capture the emerging opportunities in the gas business across the world. Our aspirations are to be a global leader in this business, and we believe that with EconoMatters expertise and support we will succeed, Joshi told The Telegraph.

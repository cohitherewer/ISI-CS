 Thursday, April 03, 2003 				 Chief of i-flex Dutch arm gets bail
																								London, April 2 (PTI): After spending a week in the Brixton prison in south west London on alleged visa violations, Senthil Kumar, CEO of Dutch subsidiary of i-flex Solutions, was today released on bail but was asked to surrender his passport by a local court here.																								While releasing Kumar on bail of  20,000, the magistrate asked him to surrender his passport and not to leave the city and fixed the case for next hearing on April 11.																								I thank the Indian government and the diplomatic officers of the Indian high commission here for their support. It is a legal process, we have to go through it, a much-relieved Kumar said soon after the magistrates order.																								The authorities in the prison were very cordial. Every one was supportive, he added.																								Kumar was arrested here last Wednesday following an Interpol alert over a complaint filed against his company in Amsterdam that 14 of its employees were working in the Netherlands without work permits.																								Kumars counsel told the magistrate that his client took over as director of the Dutch company after the visa applications for the 14 employees were made. A family man and a senior officer of the company, Senthil Kumar is prepared to provide a security deposit of up to  1 million with five sureties, the counsel said. 																								India had strongly condemned the Dutch governments action of issuing the Interpol arrest warrant against Kumar and subsequently asking 12 Indian software experts to leave the country, terming it as a neo-non tariff barrier which comes in the way of free flow of services of professionals in violation of the WTO norms.

 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 CMC to take up stock split next week
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 18: In an attempt to increase retail participation, CMC Ltd is planning to sub-divide its shares.																								Stock exchanges were informed today that the company board would meet on December 22 to consider the stock split.																								CMC would then join the growing list of companies sub-dividing their shares to make them affordable to shareholders. Recently, Mirc Electronics has decided to split its shares.																								The Tata group companys move comes at a time when the Securities and Exchange Board-appointed secondary markets committee has suggested that listed companies, whose average market price was below Rs 500 per share in the past six months, should not be allowed to split the value of their stocks.																								The committee said if the listed entity has already gone for such a split, it should not be permitted to split its shares for the next three years.																								The CMC scrip finished higher at Rs 665.90 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today after opening at Rs 630 and rising to a days high of Rs 681.																								Observers said this is the first Tata company in recent times to announce a stock split.																								The companys shareholding pattern changed in 2001 when the government divested 51 per cent of the companys equity in favour of Tata Sons.																								CMC began its operations by taking over the responsibility of maintaining the countrys IT installations.

 Wednesday, January 15, 2003 				 Trai refutes charge
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 14: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today rebutted the cellular operators charge that it was favouring the basic operators in the battle over the introduction of limited mobility.																								Trai has always acted in the best interests of growth of telecommunications in the country and, therefore, its initiatives are taken for the industry as a whole and not for favouring one or another segment of the industry, the regulator said in a letter to the cellular operators.																								The Trai communication says the open letter issued by the cellular operators two days ago  in which they argued their case for denying interconnection to the limited mobility players  was onesided and presented only a partial picture.																								The objective seems to be to exercise undue influence on certain issues which await the regulators approval or are subject matters of various judicial proceedings, the regulator said.																								The Trai directive requires the cellular operators not to block calls selectively, in this case calls coming from other basic services operators through already established interconnection links. Such an act is arbitrary, anti-consumer and putting the consumers to considerable inconvenience may lead to chaos in the industry, Trai adds. 																								The regulator cannot allow this to happen and it would, therefore, want all calls transiting validly through the existing interconnection links be duly completed without being blocked at any stage in any manner, states the letter.

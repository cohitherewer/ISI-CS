 Sunday, February 09, 2003 				 Kingfisher to add fizz to beer sales
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Feb. 8: Kingfisher, the flagship brand of United Breweries Limited (UBL), expects to achieve a volume growth of around 20 per cent in its beer sales over last year. Last year, we sold 26 million cases of beer. This year, sales are expected to cross 30 million cases, said Ramesh Viswanathan, general manager, marketing. The brand is the largest selling beer in the country and has a market share of 40 per cent.																								There is immense potential to expand the beer market in the country, Viswanathan said. As compared to a consumption of 17 litres per person per annum in south east Asian countries, India has a consumption of less than one litre per person per annum.																								The beer market accounts for Rs 3500 crore at the end-consumer prices, of which Kingfisher commands around Rs 1400 crore. The realisation at our end is expected to be around Rs 500 crore by March 2003, said Viswanathan.																								Kingfisher contributes around 70 per cent of UBLs revenues from beer, with the rest coming from local brands like Kalyani Black Label, London Pilsner and Kingfisher Ice.																								Speaking on the efforts made by the company to maintain its lead in the beer market, Viswanathan said, There is product quality upgradation on a regular basis and packaging upgradation keeping with international trends. We also ensure that the brand maintains its young and fun-loving brand image.

 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Brar pops quit pill, Ranbaxy picks Tempest
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Brar: Bags packed																								Mumbai, Dec. 22: D. S. Brar today decided not to renew his contract as the chief executive officer and managing director of Ranbaxy Laboratories. His contract expires on July 4. He was instrumental in steering the company to many notable achievements.																								Brian W. Tempest, president (pharmaceuticals) and whole-time director, has been appointed as the joint managing director and CEO designate effective January 1. Tempest would assume the position of CEO and managing director effective July 5.																								Brar communicated his decision to the company board at a meeting held today. 																								Malvinder Mohan Singh was appointed as additional director, president (pharmaceuticals) and whole-time director effective January 1. He currently holds the position of regional director  India.																								Vinay Kaul (currently CFO) was also appointed as additional director effective January 1 after his retirement on December 31.																								Brar said he had fulfilled his role in the company and would like to devote his time and energy to other pursuits of his interest at this stage of his life and career, a senior Ranbaxy official said.																								He feels that the company has a robust management team that is ready to face challenges, he added.																								Ironically, Brars decision not to renew his contract came parallel to the good news that Ranbaxy is on course to exceed the coveted figure of $1 billion sales target for 2004. He today apprised the board that the net consolidated global sales of the company are likely to be in excess of $950 million in 2003.																								Brar, who had an illustrious career spanning 27 years at Ranbaxy, has been credited with several achievements under his leadership.																								Apart from the $1-billion dream which is set to become a reality, he has steered Ranbaxy to be a global player in pharmaceuticals. The out-licensing of new chemical entity to Schwarz, the deal with Bayer and the tie-up with GlaxoSmithkline are all affirmations of that, a source said.																								Tempest, a PhD in Chemistry from the Lancaster University, joined Ranbaxy in 1995 as regional director  Europe, C.I.S and Africa, and was appointed as president (pharmaceuticals) effective January 1, 2001.																								He has over 32 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry, having held various positions earlier in his career with Glaxo Holdings, Beecham and G. D. Searle. Lawsuit spectre 																								Britains public-funded National Health Service (NHS) plans to sue seven major pharmaceutical majors, including Ranbaxy UK Ltd, for 30 million for allegedly fixing the price of amoxicillin, one of the countrys most common drugs, says PTI.

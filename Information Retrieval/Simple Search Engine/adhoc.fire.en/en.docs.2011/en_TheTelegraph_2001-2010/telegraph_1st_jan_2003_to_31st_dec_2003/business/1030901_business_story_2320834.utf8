The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, September 01, 2003  Learn now, pay later  If you want to study, money is not  a problem. Aniek Paul leafs through loan catalogues of different  banks.			Vineet Gupta has secured admission  to post-graduate courses in a number of US universities.  His qualifying score in the GRE exam wasnt very impressive.  Ergo, no tuition waiver or teaching assistance. The two-year course costs Rs 14  lakh  and thats enough to make his dad quail at the prospect  of sending his son to the US to get that degree he is ready  to die for which will land him that dream job. Gupta senior  with son in tow   has started to shop for loans from banks. He is informed  that he will have to provide 15 per cent of the sum of Rs  14 lakh  or Rs 2.1 lakh  in cash, and securities worth  Rs 11.9 lakh. Senior Gupta borrows against his  provident fund and rustles up the Rs 2.1 lakh, while a bank  agrees to provide the remaining amount. But the family has  to mortgage their home to secure the loan. Banks fund living expenses and  course fees. The applicant has to list expenses to establish  the amount that he seeks to borrow. The estimate should  include return airfare and the cost of study material. The interest on study loans is  linked to prime lending rate (PLR) which varies from bank  to bank. For most banks, its around 12 per cent at present. A number of bankers say the recent  50 basis point cut in the repo rate  the rate at which  the Reserve Bank of India borrows funds from commercial  banks  to 4.5 per cent will eventually bring down the cost  of study loans in the near future. If prohibitive expenses stood  between you and a foreign degree so far, you can now achieve  it with borrowed money. And the cost of borrowing  or the  interest rate  is not too high either. Its probably cheaper  to study with borrowed money than to buy a car. Nationalised banks offer a maximum  of Rs 15 lakh in loans for courses abroad, and Rs 7.5 lakh  for studying in India. But HSBC is more generous  it offers  up to Rs 25 lakh in loans even for a course in India, but  the interest it charges is higher than its competitors. State Bank of India (SBI) appears  to offer the most competitive rates on study loans thanks  to its low PLR. It charges 10.85 per cent for loans up to  Rs 4 lakh and 11.85 per cent for amounts greater than that.  HSBC, on the other hand, charges 12.25 per cent for funding  post-graduate courses and 13 per cent for undergraduate  studies. However, like all modern banks HSBC offers relationship  discounts to existing customers. Nationalised banks charge a simple  rate of interest and offer a moratorium during the study  period. Repayment starts only after one has landed a job  or a year after completion of the course. However, if you  pay the interest during the study period, you get a discount  of up to 200 basis points on the interest rate. For instance, Allahabad Bank offers  a 2 per cent rebate on the interest rate if the interest  is paid during the study period. The discount makes Allahabad  Banks rate more attractive than SBIs, which offers a rebate  of 1 per cent for payment of interest. However, if you borrow from private  banks, youd have to pay the interest from the first month. Although HSBC offers a higher  amount, it charges interest at a quarterly compounded rate.  All banks  both private and nationalised   charge a quarterly compounded rate of interest after the  moratorium. Banks do not ask for collateral  security for study loans up to Rs 4 lakh, but for amounts  greater than that the applicant has to mortgage financial  assets, gold or property, the value of which is equal to  the loan amount. Besides security, what most banks demand  is a guarantor who will be liable for repayment of the whole  amount  the principal plus interest  in case of default.

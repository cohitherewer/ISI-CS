 Wednesday, June 18, 2003 				 Gartner pats infotech spending initiative
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 17: India has emerged as the fourth largest spender on information technology (IT) in 2002, with a total spending of over $ 1 billion, while the combined expenditure of Asia-Pacific (Apac) nations touched $ 15.2 billion. 																								The countrys spendings include hardware, software, telecommunication equipment and services and IT services, but exclude salary costs of IT staff, according to a report prepared by Gartner, a leading analyst in the infotech sector. 																								Though e-governance in India was only five years old and in a nascent state, 12 states in the country already have an infotech policy in place, the report said.																								The governments directive of earmarking two per cent of each state departments budget for IT was instrumental in driving IT penetration in government offices, Gartner said and added that the country was on a par with China, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Philippines on spending in IT.																								However, Gartner cautions that Indian e-government initiatives have reached the peak of inflated expectations.																								According to Bob Hayward, senior vice-president of Gartner Asia-Pacific, Over the last year, most Indian states have announced an IT policy, with each one trying to compete with the other in terms of mindshare. This influx of e-government initiatives is bound to lead to a mismatch among constituents needs, political vision and ability to execute.

 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, May 3: Blue Star, the Indian refrigeration and air-conditioning major, will launch its range of eutectic deep freezers this month. The eutectic pads will give a longer hold on inside temperature even during power failures of more than 10 hours. For places like Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh, where long power cuts are a regular phenomenon, this technology comes as a boon, said Vijay M. Bembey, manager (cooling products), Blue Star Ltd.																								The deep freezers will be available in four models ranging from 100-400 litres. According to Bembey, a 100-litre eutectic deep freezer will cost Rs 14,000, 200 litre  Rs 19,000, 300 litre  Rs 26,000 and 400 litre  Rs 29,000.																								The company aims to sell around 8,000-10,000 units this fiscal. This product is mainly for commercial use. The frozen food and ice-cream parlours will use this deep freezer. However, we also plan to make it available for the high-end households who like to store large quantities of frozen food, Bembey added. The company will invest approximately Rs 10 lakh on installing eutectic pads in these fully-imported deep freezers manufactured by Vestfrost, Denmark.

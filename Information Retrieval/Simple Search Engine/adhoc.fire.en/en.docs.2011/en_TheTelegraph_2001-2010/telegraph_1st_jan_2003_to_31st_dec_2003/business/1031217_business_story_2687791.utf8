 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Dec. 16: Shares of private banks were in the spotlight today, pushing up the BSE sensex past the 5400-mark along with those of pharmaceutical companies.																								The brisk buying in bank shares followed finance minister Jaswant Singhs statement in the Rajya Sabha that the government has decided in principle to enhance the limit of foreign direct investment in private banks to facilitate setting up of subsidiaries by foreign banks and attract investment in private sector banks.																								Analysts feel that increasing the FDI limit in private sector banks could accelerate the process of consolidation in the industry. Few of the leading foreign banks were hesitant in picking up stakes in private sector banks due to the present ceiling of 49 per cent.																								Some of the foreign banks want a majority stake in local banks. Therefore, raising the FDI ceiling would give an impetus to consolidation in the industry, an analyst said.																								Recently, while HSBC had picked up over 14 per cent stake in UTI Bank, it was speculated that the foreign bank might look at the option of raising this stake pursuant to enhancement of the FDI limit.																								Even as banks like Global Trust Bank are in the lookout for a strategic foreign partner, IndusInd Bank has expressed that it is also not averse to talks with an overseas player.																								On the BSE today, noteable gainers included Centurion Bank that spurted over 7 per cent to Rs 17.40, UTI Bank, which rose by over 5.70 per cent to Rs 121.65, Global Trust Bank that finished at Rs 28, a gain of 3.51 per cent, and IndusInd Bank which also finished higher at Rs 41.35.																								ICICI Bank, on the other hand, rose by Rs 6.45 to Rs 282 and HDFC Bank also gained marginally to Rs 355.75.																								Private sector banking scrips accompanied by other select heavyweights shoved the sensex by 46.17 points to finish at 5437.05. The index opened lower at 5374.15 points and dipped to a low of 5351.21.

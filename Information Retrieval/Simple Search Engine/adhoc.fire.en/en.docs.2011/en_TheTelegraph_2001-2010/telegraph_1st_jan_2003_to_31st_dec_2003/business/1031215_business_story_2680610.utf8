			Life insurers are looking to widen  their client base  and one way to do that is to target  potential customers who have the moolah and live abroad.																								SBI Life Insurance has cobbled a new scheme it calls Setubandhan  literally building a bridge  and it targets non-resident Indians who would like to build the bridge with their dependents in India.																								The scheme provides double benefits in the form of a 5 per cent guaranteed return each year and protection to dependents. The benefits are fully repatriable in foreign currency. The dependents can also be covered through a money-back option. 																								This insurance bond is open to all NRIs between the age group of 18-60. The insured can avail of a sum assured starting from Rs 3 lakh up to a maximum of Rs 1 crore for a term of 5 or 10 years.																								In the event of death of the policyholder, SBI Life will pay the nominee the basic sum assured plus the guaranteed addition of 5 per cent on the sum assured annually till the date of death. 																								Policyholders can also avail of two accompanying benefits. The first is in the form of a term insurance cover for one or more dependents living in India with the facility of refund of all premiums paid. The second is a critical illness rider available to both the NRI and the dependent. This cover provides for insurance against six dreaded diseases on payment of a modest additional annual premium.																								NRIs can seek to cover their dependents living in India (spouse or parents) between the ages of 18- 55 and provide cover up to the age of 65 with a sum assured ranging between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 10 lakh.

 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 TV Today CEO G. Krishnan at the companys IPO roadshow in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Dec. 22: TV Today has applied for the Union governments clearance for foreign investment in its shares. Foreign holding in a news channel could go up to 26 per cent subject to government approval.																								The company has obtained the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), and has now sought the clearance of the Union information and broadcasting ministry.																								TV Today is issuing 1.45 crore shares, representing 25 per cent of its equity capital, to domestic investors through a fully book-built initial public offering (IPO).																								Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), the key movers of the Indian stock market now, are not allowed to bid for the shares in the public offering.																								FIIs could invest in the TV Today stock only after the company has obtained the governments clearance, explained an official.																								GE Capital (Mauritius) owns 36 lakh shares of the company, which represents a 6.2 per cent stake. As long as it holds on to its stake, foreign portfolio investment in TV Today cannot exceed 18.8 per cent of the companys equity capital.																								Analysts feel, the company needs the governments approval before listing so that foreign institutions could invest in TV Todays shares from the first day of trading.																								Though it is not known yet when the government will issue the clearance, the investment bankers managing the issue are hopeful that they would obtain the nod before listing.																								The overwhelming success of Marutis public issue was largely due to foreign institutional interest in the stock. The price of Marutis shares surged as FIIs doubled their holding in the company in three months.																								The issuers have set a price band of Rs 80-95 for the book-building. The final price will be determined through bidding. Half of the issue is reserved for non-institutional investors.

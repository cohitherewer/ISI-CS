																								New Delhi, May 25 (PTI): The rate of inflation continued to fall for the fourth consecutive week shedding another 0.13 per cent to 5.90 per cent for the week ended May 10, even as primary items became costlier.

The index was 169 in the year-ago period.																								A 2 per cent price hike in barley and 1 per cent each in jowar, bajra, maize, masur, eggs, mutton and condiments and spices pushed food articles group index marginally up by 0.1 per cent to 179.5 points. However, there was a 3 per cent fall in the price of moong.																								The index for non-food articles group rose substantially by 0.5 per cent to 186.8 owing to higher prices for niger seed (9 per cent), sunflower (7 per cent), cotton seed and gingelly seed (5 per cent each) and raw silk (2 per cent). There was 3 per cent decrease in the prices of copra.																								Minerals group index fell by 0.2 per cent to 118.4 due to price dip in fire clay (7 per cent) and magnesite (5 per cent).

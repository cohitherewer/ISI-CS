 Wednesday, January 29, 2003 				 Law to deal with cyber crimes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 28: The spate of recent computer virus attacks that hit South Korea and the US has prompted the Indian government to frame a comprehensive legislation to deal effectively with cyber crimes.																								The Centre is likely to draft a comprehensive legislation to deal effectively with cyber crimes. The ministry of law and justice has taken preliminary steps to evolve a law against cyber crimes. 																								The law ministry has initiated consultations with the ministries for communications and information technology, home affairs, defence and finance in an attempt to evolve such a law to plug a major legal loophole that could seriously compromise the countrys defence and security environment as well as a raft of new public services that will be offered through the e-initiatives of the Centre and the state governments.																								The move is important since the government has already started major initiatives like e-governance and is planning to offer most of its services online by 2005. 																								The IT industry also recently urged the government to spell out certain laws within the Information Technology Act 2000 for a comprehensive cyber law.																								Before the government moves faster in the field of information technology and other fields, the government would put in place a comprehensive law to tackle cyber crimes, said an official release.																								Under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the rules framed there under, punishments have been provided for various cyber crimes within the framework of the existing criminal laws. However, experts have suggested the need for a comprehensive law to deter cyber criminals who use increasingly sophisticated methods.																								The IT Act 2000 has been ineffective in dealing with cyber crimes. Only limited kinds of activities have been defined as cyber crimes under the IT Act and a large number of cyber crimes still do not come within the purview of any existing law, said Pawan Duggal a legal expert on cyber crimes.

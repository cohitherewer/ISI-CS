 Online trading is fast catching on. Aniek Paul takes a hard look at the new ways of dealing in stocks																								Rahul Kapoor isnt the sort of guy who dabbles a great deal in the stock market but like everyone else chasing a whirlwind, hes been shovelling his surplus cash into blue-chips. However, hes been increasingly upset over the manner in which his broker has been ripping him off on every stock he buys or sells.																								His friend Arvind has been spouting off on the virtues of online share trading and that is when he decided to take the plunge  but with his heart in his mouth because hes wary of the new-fangled system.																								Online brokerages promise a world of convenience for a small fee. They normally attach your depository account. If its a brokerage promoted by a bank  ICICI Direct or kotakstreet.com for instance  even your bank account gets tied. This ensures that to complete a transaction you wouldnt have to deliver transfer instructions or cheques  your account gets debited automatically.																								Online brokerages also allow you to watch the market as closely as a broker. Thats paramount to a day-trader looking for opportunity at every tick  as price movement is called in the markets parlance.																								Even for the less adventurous, its of great advantage  you can transact at the price you want. And if you want to take your eyes off, just leave an order at a defined price. The transaction will automatically take place if that level is reached.																								Online brokerages offer a variety of products  the likes of margin trading and spot cash. 																								Margin trading allows you to take trading calls leveraging your funds. For instance, if you have Rs 1 lakh in your account, you could take trading calls up to Rs 4 lakh in value. But margin trading is highly speculative and hence not recommended for investors with limited resources.																								Spot cash makes your investments more liquid. It allows you to draw the sale proceeds on the same day as you sell. Typically, youd receive the sale proceeds on the third day; it takes a couple of more days to have the amount credited to your bank account.																								Led by the convenience and add-ons, online brokerages are fast making inroads into the world of retail investors. Aficionados say there is an untapped market beyond the cities, and brokers are fanning out into the hinterland. Those using technology to reach this virgin market are leading the race. 																								Some gray-haired brokers are, however, not yet convinced. Its probably a handy tool for a qualified investor, they say, but for the uninitiated there are pitfalls all along the way.																								An online brokerage wouldnt ever stop you from committing a blunder, whereas if you were trading in the traditional way, chances are your broker would at least caution you, if not stop you altogether from burning your fingers.																								Brokers have traditionally played the role of wealth advisers, though corruption has largely obfuscated it. Yet mindless technology can never get the better of tradition, veterans argue.																								It is true that online brokerages tend to turn adventurous investors reckless, and the facility to leverage could at times corrupt a steady head. So tread with caution - its s click of a button that promises a world of convenience, and the same could cost you dearly. And if you are really petrified of online transactions, theres still some chance of quelling those fears.																								Normally, if you had sold youd have to submit the delivery instruction form to have the shares transferred from your depository account to your brokers. And if you had bought youd have to deliver the cheque to your broker.																								But lifes going to be easier in six months. The securities market regulator says it will introduce straight-through processing, or a system that will enable you to complete a transaction with one click of a button.

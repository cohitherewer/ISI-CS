 Sunday, March 16, 2003 				 Crayola to add colour to niche segment 
 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, March 15: US colour instrument product maker Crayola is set to enter the Indian market and is gearing to spruce its distribution and marketing network. 																								However, established players like Camlin and Luxor need not pull up their socks right now as the products are meant for a niche market, said Atul Khanna, CEO, Optimum Marketing Metrics (OMM)the Delhi based agency that is marketing the Crayola products in India. 																								Other big players in the Indian colour product market include Archies and Coleman International. 																								The Crayola products were placed in the Indian market in a very selective manner, some time back. This year, which happens to be the centenary year of the brand, the product is being launched nationally, said Khanna. 																								According to a spokesperson for the company, from being available in super premium outlets, the reach is being extended to even small stationary shops, We are extending reach from top cities, to smaller cities and towns, said Khanna. 																								The primary products that are being brought in include crayons, colour pencils, multi coloured chalks, colour changeables, washable glitter and dust-free white chalks. The price range of products is between Rs 50 and Rs 150. The only competitor in this premium category is German maker Faber Castell which has introduced a part of its range in the Indian market. 																								According to analysts, the international players that have been entering India have been mostly in the premium category and have consequently not been able to make much of a dent in the mass market where Indian firm Camlin still rules. 																								According to industry insider, the total market for art products in India is worth about Rs 500 crore. Of these school and professional colouring segment comprise about Rs 200 crore and colour writing instrument comprise about Rs 100 crore. 																								Internationally, Crayola is a $ 500-million brand and is made by Binney and Smith. The brand is sold in more than 80 countries and is packaged in more than 12 languages. 																								According to Khanna, the USP of Crayola is the non-toxic nature of the crayons which make them absolutely safe for kids. the colours can be printed on wall and are paper washable, he said.

 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Aug. 22: Is your company a great place to work in?																								You will soon find out when the first Indian list of 25 companies  called the Great Place to Work survey  is available later this month.																								A sneak preview reveals the top 10 names: Texas Instruments, Federal Express, Johnson amp; Johnson, Eli Lilly, Philips Software, Godrej Consumer Products, Wipro Spectramind, Nokia, Birla Sun Life and Cadbury.																								Conducted by Grow Talent Company in collaboration with Businessworld  a publication of the Ananda Bazar group  and Great Place to Work Institute, Inc., the survey ranks 25 companies on the basis of the quality of their workplaces.																								The intention is to help organisations turn themselves into great places to work in by discovering their strengths and comparing themselves with global benchmarks.																								This survey is conducted in 22 other countries and published in leading international publications.																								All companies as well as government agencies and non-government organisations that have been in operation for at least two years and employ a minimum of 100 people were eligible for the survey.																								Under the survey, employees at participating organisations are asked to rate their workplace. Each participant distributes questionnaires to a randomly selected group of 250 employees with the objective of evaluating trust in management, pride in work and the organisation, and camaraderie.																								The other part of the survey requires the company to answer questions related to management  one set about structure, ownership and types of benefits offered and another about internal communication, workplace practices and governance.																								Great workplaces are listed largely on the basis of staff perception, the employee survey throwing up as much as two-thirds of the final score assigned to a company.																								Only the top 25 names are disclosed and the rest remain anonymous to the public. Businessworld will publish the results of the survey in its August 25 issue.

 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, June 28: The south-based AMP Sanmar Life Insurance company will pump in Rs 25 crore as fresh capital early next year. The insurer will also soon introduce group pensions and a group gratuity product. We intend to raise our existing capital base by adding Rs 25 crore. This will be our first infusion since we commenced operations and it will take the companys capitalisation to Rs 150 crore, S.P Mony, CEO AMP Sanmar Life Insurance told The Telegraph.																								The private insurer plans to enter eastern India in the first half of calendar year 2004.																								At present, AMP Sanmar has three bancassurance tieups with Kerala-based district cooperative banks. These include Manjeri Cooperative, Perunthalmanna Bank and Nilambur Bank.																								Mony said, By the end of the next month, we will tie up with other few banks which will boost the sales of our products through the bancassurance route. At present, we have approximately 42 offices spread across whole of southern India and about seven to eight in the western region. We intend to open another 25 offices in the west by the end of next month.																								In early March, the insurer tied up with the Shriram group as its corporate agent. In the south, Shriram Chit Funds (a group company) will distribute its products while in the west, Shriram Transport Finance will sell its policies.

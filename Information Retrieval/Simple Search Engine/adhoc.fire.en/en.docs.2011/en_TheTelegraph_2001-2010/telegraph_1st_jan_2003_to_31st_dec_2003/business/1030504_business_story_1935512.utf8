 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, May 3: Amul is on a new ambitious gameplan to sell what has been its core strength all along  milk. Also on the anvil are cheese and ice cream sauces, which are going to be launched this season even as the company maintains that right now it is flavoured milk that the company is focusing on. 																								Amul, the flagship product of the 2,750 crore Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, (GCCMF), has chalked out an ambitious plan of producing 10 lakh bottles of flavoured milk per day. GCMMF, which test marketed the flavoured milk in Ahmedabad sometime ago, launched its Amul Shakti flavoured milk, recently. 																								About Rs 10-15 crore is slated to be invested in the flavoured milk business, which will include putting up around eight more production units, all in Gujarat, said R. S. Khanna, assistant general manager, GCMMF. 																								Four production units have been commissioned in as many plants, he said. These are in Baroda, Surat, Godhra and Gandhinagar, each producing around 40,000 bottles a day, a number which Amul wants to take to one lakh a day each.

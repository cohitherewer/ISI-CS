 Monday, August 04, 2003  Result Analysis
				 				 																								THERMAX 																																											For the first quarter ended June, 2003 Thermax Ltd has reported a good growth in profits due to cost cutting and better treasury operations. Net sales at Rs 83.97 crore (Rs 102.96 crore) was down 18 per cent from the corresponding previous period. But low operational cost at Rs 80.57 crore (Rs 99.65 crore) improved the companys margins. At Rs 3.40 crore (Rs 3.31 crore) its operating profit was up 3 per cent from the year-ago period. Despite the tax provision having gone up by a huge 181 per cent to Rs 1.18 crore (Rs 0.42 crore) the lower interest and depreciation provisioning in combination with a good rise in other income has enabled it to report a profit (excluding extraordinaries) of Rs 7.15 crore (Rs 4.15 crore) up by a reasonably sound 72 per cent over the comparable quarter last year. The stock trades at Rs.244.35 discounting its June quarter annualized EPS of Rs.12.00 by 20 times. It is not cheap given the fact that much of the growth is outside the core area of the companys activity. 																																											ADLABS FILMS 																																											Adlabs Films, which has a presence in film processing in addition to its new multiplex venture, has reported a rather dull June quarter. Net sales was down 15 per cent from the year-ago period at Rs 18.09 crore (Rs 21.17 crore) and operational cost was also down by 12 per cent at Rs 11.34 crore (Rs 12.82 crore).

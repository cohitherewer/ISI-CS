																								Planning ones financial future is an absolute must. However, the most important part is saving enough and providing financial security for your family.																								The recently launched Secure Plus policy by ICICI Prudential Life Insurance is a life insurance plan that gives added protection savings and multiple options. It provides a policyholder with three levels of cover (in the form of sum assured) for the same amount of total annual contribution. These are basic, standard and enhanced level of cover.																								How does your policy value accumulate?At the end of every year, the company would declare a bonus interest that will be applied on the allocable portion of the policyholders premium. This bonus interest will have a compounding effect on the value of his policy. The differential between the bonus interest credited and the income earned on investments will not be more than 1 per cent.																								The insured has the flexibility of receiving his maturity proceeds as a lump-sum or in equal annual instalments over 3 or 5 years which can be decided by the insured at maturity. In case of death, the remaining amount would be paid back. There is no life cover during this withdrawal period.																								Who can apply for SecurePlus? Any person-aged up to 60 years can apply for SecurePlus. The maximum age at which cover ceases is at the age of 75. The minimum term of the product is 10 years and the maximum term would be 30 years. SecurePlus has a minimum annual premium of Rs.6,000, a half yearly premium of Rs 3,000 and monthly premium of Rs 500.					 GARIMA SINGH

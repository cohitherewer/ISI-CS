 Thursday, March 13, 2003 				 New norms for T+2
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Mar 12: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has assigned a revised risk management mechanism that includes assorting scrips into three groups for risk margins under T+2 rolling settlement cycle with effect from April 1, 2003.																								The existing 12 per cent additional margins would be reduced to 6 per cent from April 1. 																								The additional margins would be phased out further on implementation of advance collection of value at risk-based margins, Sebi said in a notification to the exchanges.																								The market regulator said the risk containment measures for the scrips would be based on their volatility and liquidity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, July 09, 2003 				 Bengal Chamber broadens canvas
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, July 8: Bengal Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry, celebrating its 150th anniversary, has amended its archaic membership rules to let in firms that are in the business of offering services and new-age industries.																								The change will make it easier to admit members from sectors like healthcare, hospitality, entertainment, legal, information technology and others.																								Sahara group, for instance, is ready to step into its fold. We are trying to regain the lost image of BCCI, said chamber Sumit Mazumder.																								In the last two months, the chamber has roped in 20 new members, taking its membership to 240. Steel Authority of India, Usha Martin, Herbicure and entrepreneurs like Anjan Chatterjee of Mainland China were among those that were brought onboard.																								Traditionally, the chamber has had members from shipping, tea, jute and engineering. But it feared it would lose relevance unless it ushered in emerging sectors, vice-president Biswadip Gupta said.

 Tuesday, December 02, 2003 				 Dell logs out high-end jobs
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Dec.1: Texas-based Dell Inc, the worlds biggest personal computer company, has shifted all high-end technical support operations, including server support from its fully-owned Indian unit, Dell International Services. Corporate customer calls originating from the US for the premium notebook PCs and desktop PCs  Latitude and Optiflex respectively  will no longer be re-routed to Bangalore.																								Sources said the Indian unit would no longer manage calls from the US on this count and executives of the unit have been relocated back to America with the teams managing calls from Europe, West Asia and America.																								The re-routing of calls was undertaken after complaints from customers. However, Dell said the re-routing was part of the firms normal business operations in which it manages calls to improve its technical support services.																								Sources said complaints were bound to rise as the Indian unit, these days, hires unskilled executives. Earlier, they used to hire only engineering graduates. But, now they also hire graduates with arts, social science or bio background and even undergraduates, the sources said. Consequently, even after a month of the customary training they fail to grasp the technicalities, sources added. Tech-support operations requires skilled and efficient workers to quickly solve a customers problem over the phone.																								Dells profitability and global sales rose this year after stagnating for the past three years driven by exports, price cuts and a faster decline of computer parts like hard drives and chips. US is their biggest market and so obviously they cant ignore US-based customer complaints, an analyst with a global consulting firm told The Telegraph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 Asia-Pacific on Wipro screen
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Raman Roy: Reaching out																								Calcutta, April 30: Software major Wipro has decided to set up an offshore business process outsourcing (BPO) centre in an Asia-Pacific country. Raman Roy, chairman and managing director of Wipro Spectramind, said, We are looking at offshore BPO operations within the Asia-Pacific region and also tapping ground in five countries. He was speaking on the sidelines of a workshop on BPO organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here.																								Wipro Spectramind handles Wipro Limiteds BPO operations. Wipro had acquired the entire equity holding in Wipro Spectramind Services last January for Rs 26.4 crore.																								Wipros last board meeting had received some details on the proposed offshore centre and more information was expected in a months time after which a formal announcement would be made, Roy said. He, however, refused to name the country.																								One reason for the delay is SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). We are watching the situation. We are also negotiating with the country where the BPO will come up, he said.																								Once the formal announcement is made, the company will take about six months to make the BPO centre operational. It will be a 500-1000-seater BPO centre. Wipro, which has a call centres in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and Navi Mumbai, is setting up one in Calcutta. The company will set up a software development centre here.																								We have already started construction work in Calcutta, which is likely to be completed by December this year. We hope to begin by the end of the current financial year. Initially it will be a 500-seater BPO, which will be increased to a 1000-seater as business grows. Investment will be to the tune of Rs 23 crore, Roy said. 																								According to D. P. Patra, Bengal IT secretary, the state has approached ICICI One Source to start BPO operations here.

LIC chairman S. B. Mathur said, The FIs will jointly decide whether to participate in the open offer. We are currently doing an internal valuation of the open offer. 																								LICs stand on the open offer gains significance as it holds the largest equity exposure of 16.24 per cent in Punjab Tractors. 																								LIC will soon hold discussions with other FIs on the matter.																								CDC has made the open offer at Rs 153  the price at which LIC purchased the Punjab governments stake in the tractor company.																								CDC has won a bid to buy a controlling 23.49 per cent stake in PTL at an investment of $47.2 million  the first instance of a foreign firm winning a bid in Indias privatisation programme.																								Under the Indian takeover regulations, CDC then made an open offer for purchase of a further 20 per cent stake from shareholders. Stake in UTI Bank																								Commenting on the corporation increasing its stake in UTI Bank, Mathur said, UTI Bank is currently held by UTI I. LIC has a 14 per cent stake in UTI Bank. The government will now have to decide whether a strategic partner like UTI-I will increase its stake in the bank or the non-strategic partners like us will increase the stake in the bank.																								LIC has decided to make an additional investment of 15 to 20 per cent in select banks, including private ones. The corporation currently has an average 5 per cent stake in various banks, but these are portfolio holdings.

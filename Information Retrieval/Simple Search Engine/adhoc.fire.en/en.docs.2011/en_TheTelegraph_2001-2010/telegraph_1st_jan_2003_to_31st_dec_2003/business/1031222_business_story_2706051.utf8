The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Hughes on a hiring spree, to recruit 1000 next year
				 Open arms 																								New Delhi, Dec. 21 (PTI): Communications software major Hughes Software Systems today said it would add 1000 software professionals in 2004 to work on wireless solutions and network management products. The company is on track for meeting its topline as well as bottomline projections for the current fiscal, it said.																								We will add 1000 more professionals next year to work on communications software, including next generation applications among others, to our current strength of 2,200, said Arun Kumar, president and MD of Hughes Software. The company has, so far, hired 400 to 500.																								Kumar said the company was moving towards meeting its forecast of 60 per cent growth in revenue and 80 per cent growth in net profit by the end of the current fiscal.																								In October, the company had revised its net profit guidance for the year 2003-04 to approximately 80 per cent from the earlier 60-70 per cent but retained the earlier sales growth forecast of 55-60 per cent for the fiscal. 																								While admitting that there is huge competition at the bidding stage in million dollar contracts, he said there is no pricing pressure with established customers. The company had bid aggressively for the Lucent deal, which is believed to be around $100 million, he said.																								In September, HSS had bagged a multi-million dollar deal from US-based Lucent Technologies for supplying software and services to its 3G mobile equipment.																								HSS, which has a strategic relationship with Lucent, is a key beneficiary of the $1 billion contract bagged by Lucent from Sprint PCS to supply 3G mobile equipment.																								HSS has a multi-year outsourcing pact with Lucent by which HSS has absorbed 186 employees from Lucent.																								In November, the company completed acquisition of Bangalore-based Tenet Technologies in a Rs 18-crore deal. Tenet is a 3G and IP network software services company offering technology solutions to the communications industry worldwide. It is primarily focussed on IP, broadband, wireline and wireless. At present it is a 100 per cent subsidiary of HSS.																								For the second quarter ended September 30, HSS posted an impressive 105 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 17 crore as against Rs 8.3 crore for the corresponding period last year. It added 14 new customers during the quarter. Total income for first half stood at Rs 165 crore.

 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Tata CityRover ready for UK trip
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 On a high road 																								Mumbai, Sept. 16: Making a foray into the European roads, Tata Motors today rolled out the first batch of custom-built CityRover cars in four variants, namely, Solo, Sprite, Select and Style, priced between 6,500 to 8,500. The cars would be marketed by MG Rover in the highly competitive UK and European markets. 																								CityRover, which are manufactured on the Indica platform, would go on sales in the UK and Europe from November this year. Apart from the famous Rover badge, the car will sport a new front grill and lights. It will be powered by a specially designed 1.4-litre petrol engine. 																								Rover will buy 100,000 cars from Tata Motors over five years under an agreement signed last December. The value of the deal is not known. 																								Tata Motors executive director V. Sumantran handed over the first CityRover to MG Rover chief executive Kevin Howe at the ceremonial roll-out of the vehicle off the assembly line at the countrys largest automakers plant in Pune today. 																								In order to effectively meet UKs market requirements we felt the need to introduce a small car which would target the city-car sector, said Howe.																								MG Rover, a UK car manufacturer, has been battling to break even in 2003 after being sold two years ago by Germanys BMW for just 10. It is owned by Phoenix Venture Holdings Ltd, a British company.

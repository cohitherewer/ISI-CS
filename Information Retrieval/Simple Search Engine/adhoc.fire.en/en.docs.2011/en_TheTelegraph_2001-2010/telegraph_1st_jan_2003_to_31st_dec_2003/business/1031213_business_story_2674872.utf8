The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Britain bid to rope in local investors 
 TIMUR MOON																								Calcutta, Dec. 12: In an attempt to woo the Bengali businessman, British consular leaders, international bankers and successful Indian chief executives operating in Britain converged on Friday to praise a deregulated UK economy and hail the possibilities it holds for a foreign investor.																								Sixty per cent of Indian investment into Europe currently goes to the UK, which is viewed by many Indians as a key channel into the European market of 470 million consumers.																								In recent years, Indian investment has been increasingly dominated by the IT, software and computer services industries. Last week, software company Mastech clinched a 26-million contract in the UK. Infosys, Wipro and TCS already have a presence in the British economy.																								Indian companies currently employ over 10,000 workers in a British market worth close to a billion pounds. Of the 450 companies operating at present, 338 are involved in the IT industry.																								Britain is the hotbed of IT development in Europe, said Steve Firstbrook, deputy director of inward investment at the British deputy high commission in Mumbai.																								Its deregulated markets, ease of access, high levels of research and development, low costs and skilled workforce make it the right choice in Europe for overseas investment. As a leading centre for science and technology worldwide, it offers major opportunities for Indian inward investment, Steve said.																								Electrical engineering firm Ontrack Systems director B. Hari said his company had enjoyed a phenomenal success in the past three years following its entry into the British market.

 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 GIC property risk cover limit raised
 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, Dec. 27: The insurance regulator has agreed in principle to raise General Insurance Corporations (GIC) reinsurance exposure to the property business from Rs 50 crore to Rs 100 crore.																								In June, GIC  the national reinsurer  had requested the regulator to allow it to raise the limit on its intake of reinsurance risks.																								In response to our request, the regulator has allowed us to raise the reinsurance limit. However, this limit is yet to be mutually decided. We are a financially sound and strong company. We feel we have enough capacity (to take on more reinsurance exposure). Additionally, this will help retain more business and premia in India, thereby minimising the outflow of funds, GIC managing director P. B. Ramanujam told The Telegraph.																								The insurance regulator and GIC officials are scheduled to meet early next year to decide GICs reinsurance limit. The reinsurance limit of Rs 100 crore is the maximum loss that GIC can incur in respect of large risks on this portfolio.																								The Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) has suggested that since all insurance companies have already charted out their reinsurance programmes for this fiscal, it would be appropriate for GIC to incorporate this change only at the start of 2004-05.																								IRDAs suggestion was made in order to give insurers more time to decide whether they wanted to reinsure their business with the domestic reinsurer GIC or approach the global players.																								Ramaujam said GIC was a profitable company and had the capacity to cover the risks of Indian insurers.																								As of now, for any property risk whose probable maximum loss is up to Rs 50 crore, there is a compulsory ceding to GIC to the tune of 20 per cent.																								Above this limit, the insurer has the option of seeking facultative reinsurance where the business might not necessarily go to GIC. The insurers could choose to cover this risk with the global reinsurers.																								Under facultative reinsurance, the premium is determined on the basis of risks relating to that particular case. 																								Under the reinsurance treaty arrangement  which covers most of the risks covered by GIC  the national reinsurer charges a mutually agreed percentage of business from the insurer in a year.

 Saturday, October 18, 2003 				 Buzzword: Ring in a mobile theft cover
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Invaluable option 																								New Delhi, Oct. 17: Over 25,000 handsets are reported stolen every month: yours could be the one tomorrow.																								Here are the options before you: (a) wait for the police to get it back for you; (b) buy a new handset, and (c) make an insurance claim that gives you a new handset within a few minutes. Which of these would you choose? 																								While the first two options are already available, the last option has been made possible by Agrani Convergence, which has launched three mobile handset warranty and insurance schemes with a premium of as low as Rs 199 to a maximum of Rs 699 per annum depending on the cost of your handset. However, the scheme does not provide insurance cover for battery, charger or other auxiliary equipment like hands-free kits or external aerials. 																								Secure is a mobile insurance service that offers claim against theft and damage to your mobile phone. It will be available for all makes, models and technologies of mobile handsets. 																								This is a scheme that provides one year additional warranty to what is already offered to the handset customers by the manufacturers. This service will be offered exclusively to customers who buy handsets from Agrani Switch stores, chief operating officer of Agrani Convergence Arvind Narang said.																								We will set up a 24-hour helpline (Secure helpline) with a toll free number that will be publicised within a week. We will also offer online claims, progress updates and reports. We expect about one lakh handset owners to pick up this scheme, said Narang.																								The company already has 50 Agrani Switch stores in the country and plans to increase it to about 100 by next year. 																								It also plans to open stores through franchisees in remote locations.																								Agrani Convergence has tied up with Warranty Asia, a joint venture of Argus Integrated System Ltd and Moot International Ltd of the UK. The two companies have joined hands with National Insurance Corporation of India to provide the mobile handset insurance scheme.																								We fulfil all the guidelines laid down by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA) and the service will be offered according to the rules laid down for such schemes by IRDA, general manager of Warranty Asia Peter Thompson said. 																								The existing scheme is valid for new handsets bought from Agrani Switch stores. In future, we are planning to offer this to all handsets bought with receipts from the dealers of all manufacturers and also service providers who offer bundled packages, said Thompson.

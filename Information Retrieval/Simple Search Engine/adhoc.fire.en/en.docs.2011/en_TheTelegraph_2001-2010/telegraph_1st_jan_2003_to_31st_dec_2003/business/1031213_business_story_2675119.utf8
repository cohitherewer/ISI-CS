 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Bangurs to buy 25% in AP Paper
 OUR BUREAUX																								Dec. 12: The Andhra Pradesh government today agreed a deal to sell its 25.36 per cent stake in Andhra Pradesh Paper Mills  commonly referred to as AP Paper  to an investment firm owned by L. . Bangur for Rs 39.285 crore.																								As the co-promoter, Bangur had the first right of refusal on the AP governments holding. He heads the company and owns 46.73 per cent of its shares at present. The acquisition will raise his control to 72 per cent.																								Bangur is paying Rs 130.95 per share for the AP governments holding of 30 lakh shares. This is 16 per cent higher than the current market price of AP Paper. The stock closed at Rs 113.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today. 																								The price for the stake sale was determined through an evaluation of the companys assets by an AP government-appointed consultant.																								The government is delighted with the price realised for its stake. Its 59 per cent higher than the average market price of the companys shares, said a spokesperson for the privatisation arm of the AP government.																								The acquisition would not trigger an open offer, said Bangur, who benefited from the recent flare up in AP Papers share price. The rally in the stock was attributed to retail investors who were betting on it in the hope of an open offer.																								It qualifies as an inter se transfer (between two promoters), and since the premium paid (over the market price) is less than 25 per cent, Ill not have to make a public offer to acquire an additional 20 per cent, Bangur told The Telegraph.																								He said he would now consider an investment nearing Rs 300 crore to raise the quality of the companys products and manufacturing capacity. At present, AP Paper can produce up to 1.5 lakh tonnes annually. 																								Funds for the proposed investment could be borrowed or raised through placement of shares. Its likely to be a combination of two, he added.																								Meanwhile, CD Equisearch, a Calcutta-based investment firm said it had snapped up close to 5 per cent of AP Papers shares. With Bangur buying the AP governments holding, we are going to scale up our stake, said Chandravadan Desai, chairman of CD Equisearch.

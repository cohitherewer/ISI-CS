 Monday, September 01, 2003  Debt funds are not dead
 Guest Column / Naval Bir Kumar People say that after having  been a good investment option for the past three years,  debt mutual funds are not lucrative anymore. The interest  rates have bottomed out and so debt funds will lose their  popularity.  But to a lay investor these statements  raise several questions: What are debt funds?, How do they  generate returns? Why should debt funds do well when interest  rates go down? and Will debt funds really lose their popularity? Most of the material targeted  at investors do not answer these queries. My article is  an attempt to do just this.  To start with, although most mutual  funds are equated with investments in the stock market,  a major part of the mutual funds consists of debt funds   a class of funds that do not invest in stocks. Debt funds  are an alternative to bank deposits and other similar kinds  of savings instruments. They are a class of mutual funds  that invest in the same kind of instruments that your bank  invests your deposits in  government securities, corporate  debentures and money market instruments.  Debt funds are geared to provide  higher returns than bank deposits. But, you may ask, how  does a debt fund generate better returns than a bank deposit? The answer is really very simple:  According to the RBI norms, banks have to hold a part of  their deposits in cash and with the RBI. This lowers the  efficiency with which they can utilise their funds. Also  banks have large overheads in the form of branches, operations  and other drags such as maintaining minimum capital and  meeting priority sector lending targets.  This is why debt funds emerged  to provide investors a more efficient and direct access  to high yielding bonds and have become the most popular  and safe investment choice in developed markets like the  US and are becoming popular in India.  But one key question remains unanswered:  how do debt funds generate returns?  Debt funds generate returns in  two ways. One is by way of actual interest that accrues  on various securities and bonds. The other is by the increase  in market price of holdings like government securities and  corporate bonds. When newer securities and bonds are issued,  carrying lower interest rates (as the interest rates have  been falling), the market value of the older bonds, carrying  a higher interest rate, that the fund had invested in earlier,  appreciates.  This increases the value of those  investments of the fund. Funds constantly buy and sell their  holdings in a market to realise these gains and thus pay  out the returns to their investors in the form of dividends  or appreciation in their holdings. The NAV is actually the  market value of one unit of holding in the fund. So if you  find the NAV of your fund going up, your fund is generating  positive returns.  Due to these obvious benefits  over bank deposits, debt funds have become very popular  in the past three years. (The author is MD, Standard  Chartered Mutual Fund.

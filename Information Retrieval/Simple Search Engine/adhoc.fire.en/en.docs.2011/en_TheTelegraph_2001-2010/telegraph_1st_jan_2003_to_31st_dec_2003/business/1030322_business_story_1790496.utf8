 Saturday, March 22, 2003 				 Infotech exports to drop
																								Bangalore, March 21 (PTI): Indias IT exports for the current financial year (2002-03) are likely to be lower by 2 to 3 per cent in value terms from the projected 30 per cent in view of the dollar depreciation, according to Nasscom.																								Nasscom president Kiran Karnik told newspersons here today that in volume terms, India was definitely set to meet the projection. However, in value terms it is likely to be 2 to 3 per cent less because of the currency situation.																								Noting that IT exports in the first three quarters (April-December 2002) have been 28 per cent, he said the ongoing fourth quarter is good and okay. We are comfortable with the projection except 2 or 3 per cent here and there in value terms.																								Addressing Sun Tech Days 2003, a developer conference organised by Sun Microsystems, Karnik asserted that the goal to make the Indian IT industry a $ 75 billion one by 2008, though seemed ambitious and difficult, was realisable in view of the huge human resources pool.																								However, he emphasised the need for enhanced focus on embedded software, R amp;D services, chip design and IPRS.

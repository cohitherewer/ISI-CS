 Friday, November 28, 2003 				 Greaves cottons on to new name
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Nov. 27: Greaves Ltd, a leading engineering company of the Thapar group, has decided to revert to its erstwhile nomenclature of Greaves Cotton. The company said the name change would realise the benefits of the strong brand equity of Greaves Cotton in the domestic and overseas markets. 																								Greaves Cotton was founded by two Englishmen, James Greaves and George Cotton, over a hundred years ago. It remained so until 10 years back when the name was shortened to Greaves Ltd. Company officials said Greaves Cotton continued to maintain its popularity among the company stakeholders despite the name change. They added that the name change should yield better brand equity in the engineering sphere.																								Greaves Cotton CEO P. Sachdev said, Greaves Cotton is synonymous with engineering excellence for over a century. It continues to enjoy a powerful brand presence among all stakeholders, particularly the various market segments we operate in. Therefore, it was only proper to restore the name Greaves Cotton to its rightful place.

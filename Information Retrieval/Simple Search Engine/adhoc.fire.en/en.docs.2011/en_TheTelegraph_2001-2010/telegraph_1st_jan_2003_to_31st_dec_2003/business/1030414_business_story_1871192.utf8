				 				 																								GLAXOSMITHKLINE PHARMACEUTICALS 																																											GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (GSK), ended the year with just a 3 per cent rise in the total income at Rs 1,089.35 crore (Rs 1,056.51 crore). Its total spending was down 2 per cent, in effect bringing about a 71 per cent improvement in the net profits. At Rs 1,047.27 crore (Rs 1,010.31 crore) net sales were 4 per cent higher than those last year. The operational expenditure at Rs 873.55 crore (Rs 905.72 crore) was down 4 per cent over the previous corresponding period. GSK has been able to improve margins on the back of reduced costs. Operating profits went up 66 per cent to Rs 173.72 crore (Rs 104.59 crore), while the OPM shot up to 17 per cent from the 10 per cent it reported during the previous year. Other income was lower 9 per cent against the previous corresponding period to Rs 42.08 crore (Rs 46.20 crore), while there being no debt the interest cost was nil as against Rs 9.56 crore during the same period last year. Net profit rose 71 per cent at Rs 128.47 crore (Rs 75.32 crore). The stock currently trades at Rs 312, which is 18 times its EPS of Rs 17.25. Though profit growth growth was fantastic it was the result of stringent cost control. There has been no significant growth in sales while other income also seem to be on the decline, after years of asset sales. The stock continues to be overpriced.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, April 23, 2003 				 Court order likely to stall telecom cases
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 22: The government and the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) bought time today on the contentious dispute over the tribunals insistence that the government hand over all documents relating to the telecom imbroglio sparked by the decision to allow limited mobility services.																								Solicitor General Kirit Raval, appearing for the Union government, told a division bench comprising Justices S. Rajendra Babu and G. P. Mathur that both the parties  the Union of India and TDSAT  had agreed not to press for a final order today.																								Conceding the request, the judges asked the two parties to appear before them on Friday.																								The TDSAT is scheduled to hear the telecom operators tomorrow. However, todays development in the Supreme Court is likely to stall all proceedings till the apex court passes a final order. The government has refused to submit the documents on the ground that confidential information in the classified files will then come into the possession of business rivals  a situation it would like to avoid.

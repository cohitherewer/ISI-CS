Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Dec. 26: The state government has failed to put the sheen back on its image, Bengal commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen today said.																								The efforts we have been making do not percolate to the places where they are needed. This might lead to a wrong perception regarding our state, he said. He was speaking at the annual general meeting of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI).																								Sen sought BCCIs help to market the state within and outside India. I believe that the chamber will take more proactive initiatives to market the state to give a fillip to the states industrial resurgence.																								BCCI, which is celebrating its 150th year, has already taken steps to market the state as an investment destination. A committee has been set up for the purpose. The chamber will shortly organise roadshows in different parts of the country.																								BCCI sources said a workshop will be held shortly which will be attended by top state government officials. This workshop will help the BCCI members know what the state government wants from the chamber.																								Following this, a strategy will be formulated and roadshows will be launched. Initially, roadshows will be held in Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai. Maybe at a later date we will conduct such roadshows in Chennai and Bangalore, a BCCI official said.																								The commerce minister assured the industrialists present at the meeting that the government will deal strongly with any untoward incident that hampers the industrial peace in the state.																								At times, some isolated incidents vitiate the positive industrial climate. You will appreciate that in case of any undesirable development in the industrial sector, the state government had intervened and brought about logical conclusions. We want to reassure you that we will continue this policy, Sen said.																								The minister said the state legislative assembly has passed the Special Economic Zone Bill, 2003 and it is now awaiting the governors assent. Manikanchan, the gem and jewellery park, is the first special economic zone (SEZ) in the state. We are working out modalities to give SEZ status to a few more areas, said Sen.																								BCCI president Sumit Mazumder and vice-president Biswadip Gupta were other speakers at the function.

 Thursday, October 09, 2003 				 Lupin aims to be among big three in five years
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Oct. 8: Pharmaceutical major Lupin, known for its cephalosporin and anti-TB drugs, plans to focus on various therapeutic areas and also launch herbal-based products.																								This is part of the companys strategy to be among the top- three pharma companies in the country within the next five years. The company is eyeing advanced generic markets and looking to expand active pharmaceutical ingredients by partnering with niche players.																								The company will be moving up the value chain by enhancing product and geography mix, managing director Kamal K. Sharma said here yesterday.																								Lupin chairman D. B. Gupta added that the company is looking aggressively at herbal-based products and plans to launch 8-10 products in the Rs 5000-crore market. The segments being targeted by this foray include gynaecology, pain management and paediatrics. 																								We will begin in an ethical way, gain experience and go over the counter. Subsequently, we will expand to international markets. Some countries like Germany and France are open to natural products, Gupta said.																								Senior officials said that though the contribution of the anti-TB segment to Lupins topline has been coming down (with cephalosporins and cardio-vascular gaining) over the past couple of years, its R amp;D programme, which includes the development of a new anti-TB drug, looks promising. 																								We have obtained a good lead in the anti-TB molecule and it looks very promising. The company will be investing substantial sums of money into this molecule, sources added.																								Apart from this molecule, the other new chemical entities being developed include that for treating migrane, psoriasis, asthma and an anti-bacterial drug.

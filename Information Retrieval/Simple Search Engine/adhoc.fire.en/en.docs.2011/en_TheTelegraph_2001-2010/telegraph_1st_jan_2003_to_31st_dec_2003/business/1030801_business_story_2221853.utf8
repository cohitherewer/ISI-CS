 Friday, August 01, 2003 				 Infosys ADS priced at $ 49
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 31: Infosys Technologies has priced its second offering of American depositary shares at $ 49, a premium of 26 per cent on its local share price. The software technology major said almost 10,164 investors participated in the offer which saw shareholders tendering 1.48 crore shares. 																								Unlike its first offering, this time the company will not benefit from any fresh accrual of funds. However, shareholders who have offered to sell their shares will earn the proceeds as local shares are switched to ADS format. Market circles tout it as the first such exercise of an Indian company making its shares fungible. 																								The sponsored secondary offering of 52.18 lakh ADS represents 26.09 lakh equity shares which means that every ADS has an underlying two Infosys shares. It is a good pricing as it works out to an 26 per cent premium to the current price of the share in the domestic market, an analyst said.																								Infosys was among the index heavyweights to close higher on the bourses today. The share gained Rs 27.45 to close at Rs 3593.30.																								The Indian invitation to offer concluded with 10,164 offers for 1.48 crore equity shares being offered for sale in the sponsored ADS offering. The unallocated shares will be returned to all the selling shareholders by August 16, the company said.																								The company will not receive any proceeds of this offering, and the net proceeds after the issue expenses, will be returned to all the selling shareholders within 30 days of the closing of the offering, merchant bankers said.																								The ADS offer also envisages the underwriters to have a seven-day option to purchase up to 7.82 lakh additional ADS, representing 3.91 lakh equity shares. The offering was lead-managed by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC and Merrill Lynch amp;Co and co-managed by Deutsche Bank Securities and UBS Investment Bank. 																								The listing of the issue on Nasdaq is scheduled later today.

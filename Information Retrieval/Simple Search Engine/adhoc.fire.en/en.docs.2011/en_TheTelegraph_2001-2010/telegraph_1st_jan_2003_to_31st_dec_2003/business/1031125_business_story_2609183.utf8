 Tuesday, November 25, 2003 				 Iran team on pipeline mission
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Nov. 24: An Iranian delegation is scheduled to meet officials from the petroleum and foreign ministries in the next two days to revive the Indo-Iran gas pipeline project.																								Irans deputy foreign minister for economic affairs S. M. H. Adeli said one of the proposals to be presented before petroleum minister Ram Naik is to include Pakistan in the pipeline project.																								Other proposals include a take-and-pay arrangement, insurance guarantee, and formation of a commercial agreement with the involved parties.																								Adeli said he would try to convince the minister to hold another meeting of the Indo-Iran joint gas committee, which was last held in August last year.																								Our national oil company will hold a meeting next month with Indias state-run oil majors comprising Indian Oil, Gail (India) and ONGC to work out the modalities, said Adeli.																								We have offered Pakistan one-third of the gas, while India will receive the rest, Adeli told The Telegraph, adding Iran is ready to incur the maximum expenditure in the project.																								We are ready to incur 60 per cent of the cost that would be required to build the pipeline starting from Assaluyeh in Iran to Delhi and passing through Baluchistan in Pakistan, the minister said.

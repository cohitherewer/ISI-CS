Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, March 7: KMG Infotech, the Indian subsidiary of the $ 10-million US-based Key Management Group (KMG), is setting up an offshore development centre here. It will be the third such centre set up by the company in India, the other two being in Bangalore and Delhi.																								The Calcutta centre will start operations in the first week of April. We have entered into a service partnership agreement with Luminex Technologies, says Rahul Gupta, managing director of KMG Infotech. They will act as facilitators and help us set up the infrastructure.																								KMG caters to the software development and maintenance requirements of large and medium-sized insurance companies in the US and India. It also provides similar service to the government sector in India. KMG has employed 70 people in its two centres at Bangalore and Delhi. 																								Luminex Technologies has been set up recently by city-based professionals to provide IT-enabled-services in the business process outsourcing (BPO) segment. The company has former Tisco chairman Russi Mody and former United Bank of India chairman Basudeb Sen on its board. 																								Chief executive of Luminex, G. B. Thakur, said: We are in the process of formulating two to three projects worth around Rs 50 crore. There are plans to provide ITeS for customer communication and transactions. Luminex will provide complete solutions for use in intelligent cards and bar-coding services in hospitals, large shopping centres, transport operators and other industries.																								The Calcutta centre will have 15 to 20 employees. We expect to generate revenue around $ 3000 to $ 5000 per person per month. This is the average revenue generated from our operations at the other two centres, says Gupta. The Indian operations of KMG generates $ 2 million revenue annually.																								Our operations in the US and Germany provide us with a very large marketing bandwidth. We have 15 clients worldwide in the insurance sector. The Calcutta centre will help us ramp up the Indian operations and contribute largely to the growth of the company, he added.

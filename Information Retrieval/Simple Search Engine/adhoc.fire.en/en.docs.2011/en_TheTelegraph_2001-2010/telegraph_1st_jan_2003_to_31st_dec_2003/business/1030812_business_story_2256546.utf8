 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 11: The Union commerce ministry may award special-economic-zone status to Manikanchan, the much-hyped gem and jewellery park developed by the government of West Bengal, in another 10 days.																								The approval is expected to be issued by the commerce ministry following West Bengal governments assurance to the Centre that it will come up with an SEZ Act soon.																								This was announced by Sabyasachi Sen, the state commerce and industry secretary, at a seminar organised by Bharat Chamber of Commerce.																								The commerce ministry had earlier given an in-principle SEZ approval to Manikanchan. They had asked us to come up with notifications regarding SEZ and a SEZ Act. We have given assurance to the ministry that we will do the needful, Sen said.																								He added that the government had also recast the SEZ policy according to the directions of the commerce ministry. The new policy is applicable not only to Maniknachan but to any SEZ coming up in the state, he said.																								Manikanchan, the gem and jewellery park, is coming up on a five-acre plot at Salt Lake. The park is expected to house 72 gem and jewellery units.																								Sen invited private sector to develop SEZs and added that the government is contemplating SEZ facilities for stand-alone export-oriented units. It is under examination, he said.

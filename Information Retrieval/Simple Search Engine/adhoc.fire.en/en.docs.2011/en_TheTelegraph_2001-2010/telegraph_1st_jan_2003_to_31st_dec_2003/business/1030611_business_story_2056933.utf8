 Wednesday, June 11, 2003 				 Honda Accord gets more power
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Roll call: Honda Siel Cars president and CEO H. Yamada with the new variant of the Accord, powered by a 2.4-litre VTEC DOHC engine, in New Delhi on Tuesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, June 10: Honda Motor today rolled out its new Accord  powered by a 2.4-litre VTEC DOHC engine and a sticker price between Rs 14.7-15.7 lakh  but said it would come out with an even more powerful 3-litre V6 model in January.																								Hondas move is expected to put pressure on the competition  GMs Opel Vectra, Hyundai Sonata, Ford Mondeo and Toyota Camry  to come out with powerful versions of their sedans as fat-cat executives become more knowledgeable and demanding about riding styles and comfort.																								The 2.4-litre Accord will initially have 25 per cent local content, which is expected to go up to 34 per cent by October.																								We expect to retail a cumulative 2,000 units of Accords in the next nine months of the financial year, said Neeraj Garg, head of marketing at Honda Siel Cars India Ltd (HSCI).																								Garg said the company expects a 40 per cent rise in net profits in 2003-04, driven by a 50 per cent growth in sales volumes. The automaker hopes to register a net profit of Rs 70 crore on the back of cumulative sales of 20,000 units.

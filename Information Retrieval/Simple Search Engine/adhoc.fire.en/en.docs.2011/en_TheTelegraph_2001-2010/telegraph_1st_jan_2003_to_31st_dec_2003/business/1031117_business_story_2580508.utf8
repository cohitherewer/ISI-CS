 Monday, November 17, 2003 				 Intel boots up for 20% increase in revenues
																								Mumbai, Nov. 16 (PTI): Intel Corporation, global major in semiconductor, is expecting a 20 per cent increase in market share and sales revenue in India during this financial year, of which 70 to 80 per cent is expected from mobile computing and notebook segments. 																								The increase will be mainly due to the rise in sales of laptops and notebooks as major companies and other clients would move over to mobile computing from the conventional mode of personal computing, said R. K. Amar Babu, south asia director (sales and marketing) at Intel Technologies India Private Limited. 																								With more staff and executives on the move, a shift to mobile computing is expected, he said adding, companies and educational institutions are stressing on the need for mobile computing.																								The increase in bandwidth and the number of hotspots would also lead to the rise in sales of personal digital assistants (PDA) and hand- held devices among others, he said. 																								The introduction of Intels Pentium-IV processors embedded with hyper-threading technology and the recent launch of Centrino processors, which are expected to result in faster computing, would also lead to a rise in sales, he noted. 																								An expected fall in peripheral and microprocessor prices would lead to an increased sales of notebooks from the educational sector and small and medium businesses in the country, he said. 																								The semiconductor major offers technology and services to all major peripheral makers, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba and Acer among others.

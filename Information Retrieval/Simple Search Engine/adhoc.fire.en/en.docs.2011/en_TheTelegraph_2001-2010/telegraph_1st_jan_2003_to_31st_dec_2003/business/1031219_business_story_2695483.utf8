 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Gail pipeline deal under scanner
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Dec. 18: The government has ordered a probe into the Gail (India) Ltd pipeline deal in which the company is alleged to have spent an extra Rs 450 crore on pipelines for the Dahej-Bijaipur project even though cheaper options were available.																								The matter is under examination, minister of state for petroleum Sumitra Mahajan informed the Lok Sabha today in response to a written question.																								The Telegraph had first broken the story about Gail having gone in for longitudinally-welded pipes for laying the Dahej-Bijaipur pipeline and excluded the cheaper spirally-welded pipes from the tender which have been used recently in projects in China and India. Around 3 lakh metric tonnes of longitudinal pipes were supplied by Mann Industries, Welspun and the Jindal family-controlled SAW Pipes at a hefty price of $920 per tonne.

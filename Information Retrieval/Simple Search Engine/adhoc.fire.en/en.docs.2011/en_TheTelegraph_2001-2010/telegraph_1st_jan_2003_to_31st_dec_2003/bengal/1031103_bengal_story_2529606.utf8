The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, November 03, 2003 				 Chased doctor hides on roof
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Burdwan, Nov. 2: A mob  today chased and heckled a lady doctor over the death of  a woman during delivery in a nursing home here. 																								Relatives of Laxmi Kaity, 23, forced Dr Sharmila Dubey to climb up to the terrace and hide on the roof of an adjoining house at Borhat, 120 km from Calcutta. They refused to accept the death certificate and demonstrated for six hours with the body, protesting against what they called negligence. 																								Laxmis husband Nitai, a businessman, said: There was no anaesthetist or blood when my wife was taken to the operation theatre. She died because of lack of care. 																								After the officer-in-charge of Burdwan police station and the local CPM councillor arrived, Dubey came out of her hiding and issued a statement, recounting step by step how Laxmi was treated.																								The patient died of excessive bleeding from muscles. We tried our best but did not succeed. There was no bleeding during the Caesarean operation, said Dubey. Laxmi gave birth to a boy on Saturday. Early this morning, she started bleeding profusely.

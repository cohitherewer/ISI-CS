 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Behrampore, Aug. 27: Hirua  Oraon, a mentally unstable man, was taken into custody today  for bludgeoning to death one person and seriously wounding  another at Gorabazaar here before dawn. 																								The 30-year-old was escorted to this town yesterday by Subir Oraon, 33, his brother-in-law, and neighbour Shukra Oraon, 35, from Kalaidanga village, in Chopra in North Dinajpur, for treatment. 																								As they had not made an appointment with the doctor, they were turned away yesterday. Forced to stay here, the trio hired a room across the road from the doctors chamber and retired for the night. 																								Around 2.30 am, Hirua picked up the thick wooden bar used to bolt the door and attacked his sleeping companions. He first set upon his brother-in-law, smashing his skull. 																								Roused by the noise, Shukra opened his eyes to see Hirua banging the bar repeatedly on Subirs head. When he flung himself between the two to protect Subir, Hirua turned on him. 																								By then the residents of the adjacent houses had come out to find out what the commotion was all about. They overpowered Hirua and rushed the two bleeding men to hospital, where Subir was pronounced dead. 																								We have informed the North Dinajpur police about the incident and taken the man into custody. Whether he is a mental patient or not will be established in court, said Murshidabad police superintendent Gyanwanth Singh. Hirua was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

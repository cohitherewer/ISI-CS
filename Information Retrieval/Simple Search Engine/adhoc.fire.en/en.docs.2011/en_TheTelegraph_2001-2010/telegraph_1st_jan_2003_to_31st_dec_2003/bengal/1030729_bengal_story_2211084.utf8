The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, July 29, 2003 				 Twice without power in two weeks 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, July 28: The medical college hospital here was again without power. The supply snapped after lightning struck a transformer last evening and could only be restored this afternoon, after about 20 hours. 																								A fortnight ago, a fault had rendered most parts of the hospital power-less for more than a day. Around 8 last evening, lightning struck the transformer and plunged the entire premises into darkness. Though the authorities managed to perform emergency surgical procedures, thanks to two stand-by generator sets, other work was seriously hampered. 																								The power failure led to a water scarcity scare, said hospital sources. The Cat-scan machine did not work and many operations had to be postponed.																								Smarting under the twin power breakdowns, hospital superintendent Sarit Chowdhury said: The electricity board supplies power through a makeshift system, we have asked them to solve the problem once and for all. 																								A power board official said the lightning strike destroyed an important component of the transformer and it would take at least a week to repair. He added that a temporary connection had been established and that will ensure uninterrupted power supply.

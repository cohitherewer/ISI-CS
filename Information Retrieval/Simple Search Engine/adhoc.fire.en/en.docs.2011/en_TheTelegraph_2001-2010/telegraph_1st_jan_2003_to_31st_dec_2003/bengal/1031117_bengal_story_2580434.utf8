 Monday, November 17, 2003 				 Party probe into college land sale 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhangor (South 24-Parganas) Nov. 16: The district CPM brass is probing allegations against partymen that they sold off two bighas belonging to a college illegally. 																								A section of the CPM had alleged that president of Bhangor College Abdus Sattar, a powerful member of the partys district unit, had masterminded the illegal sale of college property.																								A notice signed by principal Pradeep Basu was issued in April declaring the colleges intent to sell the land. About 60 people evinced interest in it. After some time, construction began but the college administration asked the investors to stop work. 																								Basu said he did not issue the notice. He added that he could not remember every document that he signed but the college had no plan to sell the land. 																								We have heard about some partymens involvement in the illegal sale of the college land. The probe was ordered to ascertain if it was sold conforming to rules, said CPMs district secretary Santimoy Bhattacharya. 																								Asked about Sattar, he said: Let us first complete the probe. We shall not spare those indicted by the panel comprising four senior party members.																								The college was founded in 1997 on five bighas donated by the irrigation department after an agreement barring the sale of the land. The funds came from local CPI MP Ajoy Chakroborty, minister and Bhangor MLA Abdur Rezzak Mollah and even villagers in the area.

 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Aug. 1: Wipro  has asked for more land. A team of senior officials from  the companys Bangalore office called on infotech minister  Manab Mukherjee at Writers Buildings today to voice the  demand and discuss future plans in the state. 																								Work for their development centre in Salt Lake is in full swing and it seems they are keen on expanding.

The representatives of the IT leader, who also met infotech secretary G.D. Gautama, pleaded for a four-lane road in front of its complex at Saltlec (Salt Lake Electronics Complex), the states information technology hub. 																								Wipro is setting up a software development centre with an investment of Rs 50 crore and the company has plans to complete the first phase of the project by next year. To begin with, it will employ around 1,000 IT professionals at its 80,000 sq ft complex at Saltlec.

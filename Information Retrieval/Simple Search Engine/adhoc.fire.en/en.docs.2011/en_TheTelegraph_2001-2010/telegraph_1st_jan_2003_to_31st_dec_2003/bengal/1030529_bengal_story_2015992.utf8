 CPM slaps Congress tilt slur on Jamboni BDO
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Midnapore, May 28: CPM West Midnapore district secretary Dipak Sarkar today levelled charges of corruption against the block development officer (BDO) of Jamboni, accusing him of colluding with parties like the Congress and the Jharkhand Party. Speaking at a meeting in Gidhni, about 80 km from here, Dipak Sarkar alleged that BDO Sital Sarkar had helped the two Opposition parties procure arms. He was condemning the murder of Basudeb Bhakat, a CPM panchayat candidate who was kidnapped and killed in the evening of polling day on May 11. Funds meant for development of the Jamboni panchayat samity, which was controlled by the Congress-Jharkhand Party combine, were used to procure arms and to hire killers. I have heard that the BDO is with these people, the CPM leader said. The CPM won control of the panchayat samity in the recent elections. To back his allegation of the BDOs links to the evil ways of the Opposition, Dipak Sarkar said former panchayat samity sabhapati, Budheswar Tudu, had drawn a cheque for Rs 1,00,000 without citing any reason and the BDO had countersigned it. He charged that the officer had helped the Opposition organise violence against the CPM. The BDO shrugged off the allegations, saying: If he has said these things, let me assure you these allegations are baseless and, therefore, I find no reason to comment on them. Dipak Sarkar added that he had learnt the BDO had expressed doubts on whether the CPM would be able to run the Jamboni panchayat samity. He has commented before our men that he had doubts whether we would be able to run the panchayat. I would like to know how a person like a BDO can utter this kind of words standing on the soil of Bengal, he said. The district CPM secretary advised the BDO to begin seeking a transfer. Let me advice him to contact his senior officers and seek a transfer as the former panchayat samity sabhapati, Budheswar Tudu, is now in jail and the CPM has come to power.

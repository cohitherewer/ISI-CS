The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 29, 2003 				 Doctor death case spearhead run over
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, April 28: The  family of Chandan Sen, the general surgeon of Ranaghat Subdivisional  Hospital found murdered in a pond, lost an ally in their  quest for justice today when Madhusudan Gupta, 55, was run  over by a speeding tempo in north Calcutta.																								Gupta, an uncle of Sens wife Bidisha and a high court advocate, died around 1 pm when the tempo knocked him down at the Bagbazar Street-Bidhan Sarani crossing in the Shyampukur police station area. 																								He was the driving force behind getting the CID to probe Sens death, which was initially passed off as a heart attack.																								Deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, K.L. Tamta did not know Guptas relation with the Sens while briefing newsmen at the Lalbazar police headquarters this evening. He said the incident took place when Gupta was trying to cross the road.																								The driver of the tempo rescued the injured and rushed him to R.G. Kar Hospital. Doctors tried their best to save Gupta. But their efforts proved futile and he succumbed to injuries after an hour. Later, we came to know the victim is a resident of the Shyambazar area, was the statement Tamta made. 																								The driver of the killer tempo surrendered before the officials of Shyampukur police station with his vehicle.																								As the news reached Shyambazar, members of Guptas family rushed to the hospital. Bidisha broke down when she heard about Guptas death at her Baguihati residence. She left for Shyambazar with her 10-year-old son.																								Her brother Hindol Gupta, who lodged the official complaint at the Ranaghat police station alleging Sen was murdered, was among the mourners.																								 While the local (Ranaghat) police were not paying any heed to our allegations despite lodging an official complaint, my uncle contacted the CID officials at Bhabani Bhavan and other officials at Writers Buildings. He stood by us as a legal advisor, said Hindol.																								My husband was found murdered on the night of February 26. From the next morning, my uncle was present at the sub-divisional hospital. He was also at hand when the body was being examined by the magistrate and during the inquest at the hospital, said Bidisha.																								The CID officials had spoken to Gupta to enquire about the scene at the Ranaghat hospital on the day following Sens death. The officials of the district intelligence branch had sought his opinion and observations. 																								Guptas body has been sent for post-mortem at the NRS Medical College and Hospital.

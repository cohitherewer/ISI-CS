 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 7: Uday Sinha, who had told his wife to keep quiet when she first reported his father had been raping her for not bringing dowry, was denied bail today.																								The high court rejected Udays bail prayer for not lodging a complaint against his father Hari Sadhan Sinha. The division bench of Justice .A. Chowdhury and Justice A. Barua, however, granted bail to the womans mother-in-law and Udays brother.																								A case against Hari Sadhan was initiated after the housewife lodged a complaint with the Ranibandh police station of Bankura alleging that her father-in-law used to rape her. When she reported the torture to her husband, the complaint said, he asked her to keep quiet. 																								The housewife also told the police that her in-laws tortured her both physically and mentally for want of more dowry from her father. 																								On the basis of the complaint, the police arrested all the in-laws. The father-in-law, the main accused, did not move court for bail but his two sons and wife did. They pleaded Calcutta High Court.																								Opposing their prayer, additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami requested for strong action against the offenders. He claimed all the family members were aware of Hari Sadhans torture of his daughter-in-law. But they remained silent. These people should not be spared, pleaded Goswami. Hari Sadhan and his son will remain in Bankura jail.

 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Two KLO pioneers in police custody
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, Dec. 25: Two first-batch KLO militants were handed over to police by the Indian Army today even as another gave up arms at Kumargram.																								KLO vice-chairman Harshavardhan Das alias Vardhaman Das was arrested by the Royal Bhutan Army from the central headquarters of the Ulfa in Samdrup Jongkhar on December 15 along with Debananda Das alias Mama. 																								Gajen Singh Kongar alias Gopi Singha, who surrendered, is a member of the second batch and a resident of Uttar Haldibari of Kumargram.																								The Jalpaiguri police said Harshavardhan, 39, was the senior-most member of the KLO and one of the outfits founders. 																								He is a member of the first batch of the KLO and was arrested by the Bhutan force from the Ulfa headquarters in Samdrup Jongkhar along with Debananda Das. Both were holed up there with 15 other KLO militants, of whom one was killed in an encounter at Assams Nalbari district on December 21. Another militant, Sanjoy Adhikary, is in our custody now. We are yet to trace the remaining 13, said Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Siddh Nath Gupta. 																								Harshavardhan, a resident of Changmari in Kumargram, had persuaded Debananda who lived in the same village to join the outfit and fight for a Kamtapur state, intelligence sources said.																								Asked about Gajen, Gupta said: The man was in-charge of ration supply at Nautale, a KLO camp near Piping. He was alone in the camp on December 15 and fled into the jungle hearing gun shots. He came out of hiding yesterday and was going home via Sankosh tea garden this morning when we confronted him. He surrendered without protest. An AK-56 rifle and 30 rounds of cartridges were found on him. It is a good sign that the militants are now laying down their arms.																								Four women and four children were also handed over to the district police today by the Bhutan authorities. Anjana Roy, the wife of arrested KLO general secretary Pabitra Singha, Kamala Das, Bithika Roy and Jyotsna Roy were handed over by subdivisional officer of Bhutans Kalikhola district S. Wangdi Dumpa to additional district magistrate Rahul Srivastava.																								They children belong to Kamala and Bithika.

 Wednesday, November 05, 2003 				 Husband held after suicide
																								Bongaon (North 24-Parganas), Nov. 4: A mother gave poisoned milk to her 10-year-old son and committed suicide last night, allegedly unable to bear her husbands torture, reports our correspondent.																								At a village in Gobardanga, about 70 km from Calcutta, Shyamali was married to Ram Sardar, 42, for 12 years. Police arrested him today on charges of torturing her and provoking her to commit suicide.																								Rams first wife, Shikha, had also committed suicide, nearly 13 years ago. Shyamali, 30, mixed poison with milk and gave it to her son Sarajit. Then she consumed the poison, said Bhuban Mondal, the subdivisional police officer of Barasat. Sarajit was a student of Class IV at a local primary school. 																								Shyamalis brother Shyamal alleged that Ram used to torture her. She suffered a fracture on the leg when Ram beat her up earlier. She had to be hospitalised, he said.

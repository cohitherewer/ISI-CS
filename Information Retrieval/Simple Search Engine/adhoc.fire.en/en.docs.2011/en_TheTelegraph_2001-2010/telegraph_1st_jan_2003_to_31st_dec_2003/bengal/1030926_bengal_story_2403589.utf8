 Friday, September 26, 2003 				 Minister rules out mine shutdown
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Durgapur, Sept. 25: Union  coal minister Kariya Munda today said the Centre is trying  to avoid an immediate shutdown of non-profitable mines in  the Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL) area.																								We have no immediate plan to close down any coal mine in the ECL area. But if we see a particular mine is suffering chronic losses, we may have to close it, said Munda. ECL will soon take up measures to upgrade the old mines. 																								His comments have come at a time when political circles are abuzz with reports that Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee did not accept the coal portfolio during the last cabinet shuffle because of Delhis alleged plans to shut down several mines in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, October 10, 2003 				 Naidu caught in roadblock
																								Calcutta, Oct. 9: A roadblock to protest waterlogging forced BJP national president M. Venkaiah Naidu to change his route to the city from the airport tonight, says a staff reporter.																								Some residents of Dum Dum Park who blocked the VIP Road around 10.30 pm refused to relent despite repeated requests by police. 																								Naidu was eventually escorted to the BJP party office on College Street through Jessore Road. The blockade was lifted at 11.25 pm.																								Plastic ban: The Burdwan municipality has decided to ban plastic and polythene bags, tentatively from next month, to keep the town free from pollution. It will also impose spot fines on offenders dumping garbage on the streets instead of in the vats.

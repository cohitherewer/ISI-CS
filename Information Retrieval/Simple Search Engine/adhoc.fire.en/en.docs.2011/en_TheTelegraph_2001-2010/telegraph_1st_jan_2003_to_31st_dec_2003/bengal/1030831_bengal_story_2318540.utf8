 Sunday, August 31, 2003 				 Recruiters in police net
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Krishnagar, Aug. 30: Three  persons claiming to be labour recruiters were arrested from  a hotel here last night and a number of fake Indian passports  seized from them.																								Last night, the Kotwali police station received information that Jagdish Dogra, Tarani Prasad Mishra and Gurbux Lal were interviewing job applicants, to be sent as labourers to Saudi Arabia, Yemen and other countries in the region. The applicants had come from Nadia, Murshidabad and North 24-Parganas districts.																								These persons were carrying 171 passports and most of them were forged as there were more than one issued in the same name and there were anomalies regarding the addresses and police station areas, Nadia superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty said after the arrests.																								Chakraborty received a call this morning in which a voice claimed that it was the inspector-general of Maharashtra police calling. Are you SP Nadia on the line? I am IG Maharashtra police, Ramachandran, calling. Why are you harassing these people as they are recruiting people for work in foreign countries with valid documents? the voice asked.																								I have informed the entire matter to my superiors in the state police and they will look into it, Chakraborty said.																								The trio claimed that they had arrived here last Wednesday to recruit 400 carpenters for the Gulf countries and that they represented a Delhi-based employment consultant firm.																								I have informed the intelligence branch and suggested that the CID take over the investigation as this is too big an event to be handled by the district police, the district police chief said.																								He hinted that the arrests would lead to the nabbing of a large number of people involved in the racket throughout the country.																								The trio have claimed before the police superintendent that they had arrived here last Wednesday with a target to recruit 400 carpenters for the Middle-Eastern countries, and that they represented a Delhi based employment consultant firm.																								During interrogation they said that they had documents attested by the union labour ministry, but they turned out to be forged as well, and it is not true that they have been only interviewing carpenters as very poor unskilled people have also come and spoken to them from areas close to the border with Bangladesh, like Karimpur and Tehatta, Chakraborty said.																								It is plain that these people were recruiting poor young men for unauthorised jobs in the Middle-East, they jobs may include illegal trafficking or even terrorist activities, the district police chief said.

 Thursday, January 16, 2003 				 Transport trouble at Bandel
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Bandel, Jan. 15: Differences between two factions of three-wheeler operators stalled transport services from the station here, inconveniencing tourists to the Bandel Church and commuters. 																								The auto operators belonging to the Citu-affiliated West Bengal Auto-rickshaw Operators Union, who ply their vehicles from the station to Dunlopghat, did not allow even buses to pick up passengers from the station. 																								Last Sunday, the three-wheelers plying the station-Dunlopghat route, took their vehicles off route, resulting in a clash with those ferrying passengers on the route between the Grand Trunk Road here and Chinsurah, said Chandan Chayan Guha, the Chinsurah sub-divisional officer. 																								Today, drivers with permission to ply between Chinsurah and G.T. Road were told to pick up passengers from the station by district magistrate Subrata Biswas. But the other faction set up a roadblock and prevented all traffic from the Grand Trunk Road route from coming near the station. 																								Thousands of people bound for Bandel Church had to walk for half-an-hour to get to G.T. Road to take transport. 																								New steel plant 																								Small industries minister Bansagopal Chowdhury has extended full cooperation to industrialists to invest in the state without fear of interference from locals demanding jobs and money. 																								He was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Rs 200-crore Shree Ramrupai Balaji Steels Ltd, a plant which will be constructed and commissioned in two phases.

 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Fraud probe officer in bribe net
 OUR BUREAU																								Nov. 11: A sub-inspector of the enforcement branch in Burdwan who was probing an alleged fraud was caught taking Rs 5,000 from a bank employee at Howrah station this morning. 																								District superintendent of police K.C. Meena led a team in plainclothes to nab Ramesh Biswas. The enforcement officer was inquiring into a fraud of Rs 3 lakh involving the Nadanghat branch of the Allahabad Bank in November 1997. A bank clerk, Tarun Bhattacharya, was arrested in the case.																								Biswas was allegedly threatening the branch manager, Madhusudan Sarkar, that he would drag him into the case if he did not cough up Rs 30,000. Sarkar, who was shifted as manager of the banks Sonarpur branch in South 24-Parganas, panicked and agreed to pay the amount in instalments. An appointment was fixed and the enforcement officer arrived at the station on time.																								Sarkar, however, had got in touch with Meena in the meanwhile. Biswas was trapped. A regional manager of the bank in Asansol, D. Bhattacharya, said he knew that Biswas was demanding money from Sarkar.

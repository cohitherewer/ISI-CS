 Wednesday, August 06, 2003 				 FIR alleges negligence in baby death
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Suri, Aug. 5: The parents of a newborn who died at the district hospital here today filed an FIR alleging negligence on the part of the doctor who attended on the mother.																								The chief medical officer of health and the additional district magistrate arrived at the hospital with a large police force to defuse the tension sparked by the death. Chief medical officer S.P. Basak later said a probe team had been formed and the baby sent for post-mortem.																								Jahinur Bibi, who gave birth to a boy by caesarian section on August 1, was handed the boy, swathed in bandages, the next day. The doctor said the baby was in a serious condition. He died last evening. When the body was handed over to the parents today, they discovered a scar in the nape with a stitch. The relatives then created a commotion in front of the maternity ward and the tension spread. 																								My grandson died because of the doctor. He must have injured the baby during delivery and hidden the wound with bandage. He never came to see the mother or the child, said grandfather Chand Mohammed Khan. Father Atakul demanded punishment for the doctor in the FIR. The hospital superintendents room was locked througout the day.

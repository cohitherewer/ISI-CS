The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 Call to pull Naxalites into front
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 16: Two CPM leaders today advocated the induction of parties on the fringes of the Left, like the Naxalites and the SUCI, into the ruling front to intensify the campaign against communalism and the economic policies of the BJP-led Centre.																								Former minister and ideologue Ashok Mitra and the partys state secretariat member, Dipak Dasgupta, suggested the inclusion of the Naxalites in the states ruling coalition. RSPs state secretary Debabrata Banerjee echoed them.																								Addressing a meeting to condole the death of Naxalite leader Arijit Mitra at the Moulali Youth Centre, Dasgupta said: We still have ideological differences with the Naxalites. But we seriously believe that their induction will help us fight the communal forces and the BJP government.																								We dont think the Naxalites had followed a wrong path in every respect. We have a lot to learn from them, said Banerjee.																								The idea of inducting the Naxalites and the SUCI in the Front is, however, not new. Months back, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas had visited the CPI (ML) office in the city to meet its leader, Kartick Pal. But what transpired between them was not known.

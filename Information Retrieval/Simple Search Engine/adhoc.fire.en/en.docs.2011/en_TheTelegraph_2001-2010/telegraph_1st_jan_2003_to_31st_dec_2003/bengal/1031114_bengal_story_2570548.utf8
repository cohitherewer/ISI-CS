The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, November 14, 2003 				 Jawan-to-be held with dummy
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Asansol, Nov. 13: When an overweight candidate for a Railway Protection Force recruitment test here turned slim within hours of reporting for the exam, the authorities smelt a rat.																								The RPF arrested both Ram Shankar Joshi of Munger in Bihar and his stand-in, Pintu Kumar of Bhagalpur.																								Joshi resorted to the substitution when, after being called for the test for a jawans post, he realised he could not run the obligatory 1,500 metres at the Railway Stadium here, 200 km from Calcutta. So he paid athlete Kumar Rs 9,000 in advance and promised Rs 3,000 more.																								Anup Srivastav, chairman of the forces recruitment board, noticed Joshis absence and his conversion into a slim man. The duo was then arrested and an FIR lodged.																								Hunt for engineer																								Coal India chairman Laxmi Chand will arrive at the Eastern Coalfields headquarters in Sanktoria from Delhi tomorrow to meet senior officials over an engineers abduction. Ramkrishnan Saini, employed at the Rajmahal project in Jharkhand, was kidnapped two days ago.

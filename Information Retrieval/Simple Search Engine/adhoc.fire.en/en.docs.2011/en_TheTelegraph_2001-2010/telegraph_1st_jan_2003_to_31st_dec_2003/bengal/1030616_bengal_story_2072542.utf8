 OUR CORRESPONDENT Burdwan, June 15: Another  fly buzzed out of the crotch of Chandan Goswami, the 13-year-old  boy admitted to Burdwan Medical College Hospital with the  rare disease of myiasis on Saturday. 																								Flies were coming out of a perforation in Chandans body and taking wings. The boy had complained of pain in the lower abdomen and when he said he saw a fly pop out, not many people believed. When doctors finally had evidence of what was happening, they were stunned.																								Chandans pain recurred last night. Dr Snehangshu Pan, who has been supervising treatment, rushed him to the OT and took out another fly. 																								Some of the flies that emerged from Chandans body have been sent to the School of Tropical Medicine in Calcutta for tests. Director of medical education C.R. Maity came to the hospital today to examine him. Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee saw Chandan yesterday. 																								Maity said the health department might bring in experts from the School of Tropical Medicine to treat him. The hospital authorities are awaiting a urogram report, which might indicate the exact location of the flies or the larvae.

Villagers are flocking the hospital to take a look at the boy, who is ailing and nervous.

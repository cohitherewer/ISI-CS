 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kalyani, Aug. 16: The police have gunned down a notorious criminal, Kala Bachar, 32, wanted in several cases of loot and murder, including the killings of two brothers during Independence Day eve last year.																								Police said early last morning, Kala and six of his associates had entered an abandoned paper mill near this Nadia town with gas-cutters and other implements to strip the factory of its idle machinery.																								According to circle inspector Pranab Dutta, the gang used to cut metal parts and sold them to scrap dealers in Nadia and North 24-Parganas.																								On being informed by a former mill employee that the gang had entered the factory, a police party led by the officer-in-charge of Kalyani police station left for the spot.																								When the police asked them to give up, the criminals burst bombs. Kakoli Ghosh, a sub-inspector, was injured when splinters hit her. Realising that the gang would not give up easily and that they were also firing from improvised guns, the police opened fire.																								In the encounter that followed, Kala was found writhing in pain while there was no sign of the other gang members. He was declared dead at the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital here.

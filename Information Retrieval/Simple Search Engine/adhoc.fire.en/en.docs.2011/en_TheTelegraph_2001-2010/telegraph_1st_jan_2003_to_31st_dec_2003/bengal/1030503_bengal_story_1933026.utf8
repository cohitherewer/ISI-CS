The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Minority bridge between foes
 UTTAM DUTTA  Polba (Hooghly), May 2: The reality of grassroots politics has led the Trinamul Congress here to forge an alliance with a sworn enemy and shun an ally.The BJP has been replaced by the Congress in Trinamuls rural poll ploy, apparently to woo the minority community. Out of 12 anchals in the region, Trinamul has a seat-sharing agreement with the Congress in five, all dominated by the minority population. Where Trinamul has not entered into a pact with the Congress, a panchayat uppradhan and a gram panchayat member have joined the Congress. They were not sure of winning the poll on Trinamul tickets in view of the partys ties with the BJP.

Mamata had challenged the CPM to face the Trinamul-BJP alliance in the panchayat poll even as she referred to the Congress as the CPMs B-team. Hooghly secretary of the Congress Mainul Haque said: We entered into an alliance with Trinamul as they insisted on it, we were approached by their district leaders. The alliance was a political necessity. The Trinamul-BJP combine does not stand a chance in the areas dominated by the minority community.MP from Serampore and Trinamul district president Akbar Ali Khondakar, however, washed his hands of the matter, saying there was a party whip against an alliance with the Congress.

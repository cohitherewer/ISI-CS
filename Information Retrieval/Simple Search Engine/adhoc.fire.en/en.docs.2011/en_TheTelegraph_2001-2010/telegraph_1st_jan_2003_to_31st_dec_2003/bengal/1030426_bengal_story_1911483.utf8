The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, April 26, 2003 				 Gameshow, but different
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 25: Come May and one-day cricket will be back on television. On a different pitch though.																								Siddharth Basu, the mastermind of the mother of all Indian gameshows, Kaun Banega Crorepati, will be on Bangla channel Tara with a quiz show on cricket that would follow the one-day format. 																								The programme will have two parts. Howzzat Hungama and Howzzat, Basu told The Telegraph. The first, an interactive part, is on air from April 20 and being shown four times a week. The second, a weekly quiz show based on the ODI format will be on air from May. 																								Howzzat Hungama will initially have 216 episodes and Howzzat 52.																								Producer Jayant Kripalani said three questions on cricket will be shown from 6 pm to 5 pm next day. Viewers will be able to answer over phone or through SMS, said Kripalani. The winners will get Rs 5,000. From two winners everyday, a computer would select the ultimate winners.																								Howzzat will be a duel between two teams. Like one-day cricket, a team will set a target for the other, said the producer, who has played quizmaster on television himself. The participants can be two companies, clubs, educational institutions or anybody for that matter.																								In Calcutta, adda is still a popular culture. We can choose two adda groups from different areas who will take on each other at Howzzat, Kripalani said. The winners of this weekly contest will take away Rs 20,000. 																								The hosts promised that the production would be different from the usual fare on the Bangla channels. 																								The entire show will be based on a proprietary software. With lots of fun and games, it will be unique, said Basu, who hosts Mastermind, a show for hardcore quizzards on BBC.																								Basu said Howzzat will be no KBC. Here the winner is ensured of the amount, unlike KBC, where the participant ran the risk of losing at any stage.																								Launched on the springboard of the most popular game in India, this gameshow is bound to become popular. No specialists are required to take part in the game, said Basu. Only allrounders.

 Thursday, August 14, 2003 				 Tourist fear for fishermen
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, Aug. 13: About two lakh fishermen in the Sunderbans fear for their livelihood once the proposed tourism project by the Sahara group comes up. 																								Fishermens organisations have approached fisheries minister Kironmoy Nanda and told him that catamarans and other motorised boats carrying tourists to the heart of the Sunderbans could upset their nets cast in the rivers. 																								The fishermens concerns were taken up today at a meeting to review the progress of the tourism project. Officials of the fisheries department said the boats carrying tourists would not disturb fishing nets. 																								We have suggested that the fishermens routes should be clearly demarcated with the help of buoys so that tourist boats dont encroach on their territory, said fisheries secretary A.K. Patnaik.

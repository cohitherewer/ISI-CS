 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 CPM passes the hat
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								Calcutta, Jan. 12: The CPM will set up a special fund of Rs 40 lakh to meet its expenses for the panchayat elections slated for May. The decision to raise funds was taken during the partys state committee meeting last week. 																								Left Front chairman Biman Bose said the money will be collected from the common people. Our party members will also donate generously to the fund, he said. We generally organise such a collection drive. We have instructed party members and local units to collect 50 per cent of our estimated target (Rs 40 lakh) by February. 																								The state leadership has instructed panchayat functionaries to complete pending rural development projects by March. Money will not be a problem for the panchayats. The government has sanctioned the required amount to the panchayats, Bose said.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Basanti (South 24-Parganas), March 28: Twelve persons were injured in clashes between CPM and RSP supporters over the control of a bheri at Harekrishnapur in Jyotishpur panchayat.																								A local committee secretary of the CPM and six women were among those injured. Both the parties have claimed that they own the bheri.																								Several houses were set on fire and the local police station ransacked. The Rapid Action Force (RAF) was deployed to restore peace. Senior police officers, including additional superintendent of police S.S. Panda, have rushed to the spot.																								Those hurt were at first admitted to the local government hospital but later two of them were transferred to the Nil Ratan Sarkar Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta as their condition deteriorated.																								Four persons have been arrested and raids are continuing to nab the other culprits.																								Trouble had been brewing since March 16. Yesterday, matters took a serious turn when fishery workers belonging to the RSP were allegedly attacked by some CPM supporters while they were busy netting a catch. Nine persons, including six women, were injured in the incident.																								Today at daybreak, some RSP supporters went to the Basanti police station to protest against police inaction during the clash. Some of them became violent and ransacked the police station. 																								Another group went to the local market and destroyed a number of shops. They tried to set fire to some houses belonging to CPM supporters. Local residents, however, quickly doused the flames before the fire could spread.																								The mob also ransacked the CPM office and injured the local committee secretary and two other workers.																								As the situation deteriorated, the officer-in-charge of the Basanti police station, Mainak Banerjee, sent a message to the district police headquarters at Alipore requesting deployment of RAF. A company of RAF was sent but it proved inadequate for controlling the mob. Two more companies had to be rushed.																								Leaders of both the parties have blamed each other for the violence.																								SUCI supporter killed																								A SUCI supporter was killed, allegedly by CPM cadres, in Kultali late this evening. SUCI MLA Probodh Purkait alleged that Dilip Sardars murder was part of the CPM programme to hunt down political opponents in the runup to the panchayat polls. The party has called a 12-hour bandh in Kultali on April 1.

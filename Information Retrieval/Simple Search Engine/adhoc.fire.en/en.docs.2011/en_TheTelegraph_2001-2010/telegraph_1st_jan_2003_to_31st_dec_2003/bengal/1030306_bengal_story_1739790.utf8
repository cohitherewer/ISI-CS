 Thursday, March 06, 2003 				 Driver saves bus from horror replay
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Birbhum, March 5: Passengers of a South Bengal State Transport Corporation bus had a narrow escape as the driver managed to elude a gang of dacoits who hurled bombs to stop the vehicle passing through Ganpur forest in the Mohammad Bazar police station area here late last night.																								Police said the gang of more than 10 men had put up a roadblock using gunny bags packed with rice looted from a truck earlier. When the Siliguri-bound bus from Durgapur arrived at the scene around 10.30 pm, they burst bombs to scare the driver to a halt. 																								Dipendranath Das, who was at the steering and saved the passengers from a gory replay of the Dhantola incident in Nadia, suffered splinter injuries. Conductor Subhas Pramanik and several passengers, too, were injured.																								Das drove through the roadblock and a series of explosions. Once sure that he had left the dacoits far behind, he headed for the Rampurhat sub-divisional hospital. 																								The police said though there was an armed policeman in the bus, he did not get an opportunity to fire at the dacoits.																								The SBSTC sent two buses, one bound for Siliguri and the other for Durgapur for the passengers who did not want to continue with their journey.

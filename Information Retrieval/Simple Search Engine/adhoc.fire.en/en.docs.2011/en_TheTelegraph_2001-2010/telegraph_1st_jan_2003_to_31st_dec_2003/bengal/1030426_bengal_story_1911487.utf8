 Saturday, April 26, 2003 				 Advani balm on Mamata
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, April 25: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani has asked Union home secretary N. Gopalswami to raise with the Bengal chief secretary the issue of large-scale rejection of nomination papers filed by Trinamul Congress candidates for the panchayat elections.																								Advanis directive follows Mamata Banerjees meeting with him on Wednesday with a list of complaints against the CPM-led government. 																								Mamata had alleged that the CPM was trying to ensure that nomination papers filed by her partys candidates were rejected on one pretext or the other. This, according to Trinamul, is in keeping with the CPMs penchant of scientific rigging. 																								After Trinamul was routed in the last Assembly elections, Mamatas party had alleged that the CPM has perfected the art of scientific rigging.																								Advani listened to Trinamuls complaints and accepted the memorandum from Mamata. However, he did not make any other move on the issue.																								Trinamul had raised the issue in Parliament, asking for Central intervention under Article 355 to stop the CPM from rigging the panchayat elections. 																								However, Advani did not plead Mamatas case with the chief minister, who has co-operated with the Centre on the war against terrorism.

 Thursday, June 12, 2003 				 Trinamul leader butchered
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, June 11: A primary school teacher was murdered at Mongolkote, about 60 km from here, this morning by a gang of men, among whom the victim apparently identified CPM panchayat members in his dying statement to the police. 																								Mahaprasad Pal, 57, also an influential Trinamul Congress leader, was hacked to death when he was going to his school at Baragarh in the Mongolkote police station area. Police said he was waylaid near a canal and attacked with iron rods and sharp weapons. 																								Residents chanced upon the critically injured man and took him to a local health centre. Pal died while being taken to the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. 																								Police said Pal managed to make a statement before officer-in-charge Amitava Sen, in which he apparently named some of his assailants. Sources at the Mongolkote police station said Pal had named CPM panchayat members Mahendranath Sil and Abdullah Sheikh as leading the gang of about 10 men. The dying man said he had no chance to resist the attackers, a source said.																								The area became tense as the news spread because Pal, the area secretary of Trinamul, had played a pivotal role in his partys wresting of the local gram panchayat from the CPM in last months election. 																								The area had seen a lot of violence between the two parties both during the run-up and after the polls. His popularity and great organisational skills had led to him becoming a target of the Opposition parties, his collegaues said.

 Tuesday, November 25, 2003 				 Naxalites kill CPM leader 
 OUR BUREAU 																								Rampurhat/Calcutta, Nov. 24: Naxalites struck at Birbhum last night, a little more than a month after their worst attack in south Bengal in Purulia, killing the Dakshinkashilla block secretary of the CPMs peasant wing. 																								Police said an armed gang of Naxalites raided the house of Izajul Sheikh, 40, at Dakshinkashilla village under the Murarai police station around midnight yesterday and took the All-India Kishan Sabha leaderto a nearby field. 																								There they brutally hacked Sheikh and pumped bullets into him to make sure he was dead before melting into the darkness shouting: Inquilab zindabad, Naxalbari indabad. 																								Family members and neighbours raised an alarm when they found him lying in a pool of blood. Sheikh was declared brought dead in hospital. 																								Alerted, police conducted night-long raids and arrested four extremists, said to be of the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC). State Armed Police personnel have been deployed in the village. 																								On October 11, Nilmadhab Das, the officer-in-charge of Bandwan police station, was shot dead by MCC activists in Purulia and five police personnel were seriously injured in a landmine blast and ambush. 																								Inspector-general of police Chayan Mukherjee said at Writers Buildings this afternoon that the government has taken a serious view of the attack and put the police administration on its toes. 																								Senior officials, including the SP, are conducting marathon raids to arrest those who are absconding after the incident, he said. The arrested are being interrogated to ascertain if they were linked to the Purulia ambush. 																								CPM district secretary Dilip Ganguly condemned the killing and demanded a probe into the incident. He said his party will start a campaign to isolate the extremist groups.

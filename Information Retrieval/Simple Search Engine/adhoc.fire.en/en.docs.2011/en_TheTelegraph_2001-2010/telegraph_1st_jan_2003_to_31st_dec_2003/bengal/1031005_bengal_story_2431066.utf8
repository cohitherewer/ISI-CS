 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mamata Banerjee																								Calcutta, Oct. 4: Worried over the Marxists bid to capitalise on the inordinate delay in the allocation of a portfolio to Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamul Youth Congress has decided to start a campaign at the all-India level with the party chairpersons cutouts to highlight her political struggle against the CPMs terror.																								The party will train 200 young men and women after the puja holidays for this purpose. These dedicated party workers will fan out in different towns with our leaders cutouts and undertake an intensive campaign on the partys ideology and policies, said Madan Mitra, president of all-India Trinamul Youth Congress, today. They will also cite specific instances to expose the ruling Marxists reign of terror in Bengal.																								Mamata has been left out in the cold by the BJPs apex leadership after her re-induction to the NDA cabinet last month as she reportedly declined to accept coal. She has since then been continuing as a Union minister without a portfolio, but did not attend any cabinet meeting. The Trinamul leader is expected to leave for Delhi after the immersion ceremony to discuss her fate with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Mamata kin suicide																								Jhansi Banerjee, sister-in-law of Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, was found hanging from the ceiling of her south Calcutta residence on Saturday evening. A suicide note was found at the spot. She was taken to SSKM Hospital about 8 pm and declared brought dead. We received the body and apparently it is a case of hanging. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said hospital superintendent D.D. Chatterjee.

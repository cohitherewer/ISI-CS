 Wednesday, October 29, 2003 				 Guesthouse deaths 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Oct. 28: Amit Kumar Mazumdar, his wife and 8-year-old daughter checked into Chandrakala Guest House here on Sunday afternoon, claiming that they were residents of Chittaranjan Avenue in Calcutta. 																								This morning, guesthouse employees unlocked the door to Room 103 to find the bodies of Mazumdars wife and daughter in a pool of vomit.																								The husband is believed to have left the room a day before without informing anyone. 																								Hours after the forty-something Mazumdar quietly left the scene of crime, Bhubaneswar police said he might have poisoned his wife and daughter. Packs of Frooti and Jooz soft drinks lay on the floor of the room today. The police said Mazumdar could have laced them with poison. A small canister of poison was recovered from a dustbin nearby.																								Mazumdar checked into the guesthouse at 3.30 pm on October 26, depositing Rs 500 as advance for the air-conditioned room. 																								But the police in Calcutta said the Chittaranjan Avenue address that Mazumdar gave as his is a college. They could not confirm whether the family was from the city.																								On Sunday, the three went out and returned at 9.30 pm. They had brought their dinner. Minutes later, Mazumdar asked for a kitchen knife to make salad, said Niranjan Das, the assistant manager of the guesthouse.																								At 10 last morning, the guesthouse employees knocked on the door to clean up the room and found it locked. Thinking that the family might be sleeping, they did not persist. At 3.30 pm, their scheduled check-out time, we again found the room locked. We were suspicious but decided to wait till night, said Das. 																								However, no one saw Mazumdar leaving the guesthouse. This morning, a worried management decided to unlock the door with a duplicate key. The vomit around the bodies had dried up. Officials of Capital police station have sent them for post-mortem.

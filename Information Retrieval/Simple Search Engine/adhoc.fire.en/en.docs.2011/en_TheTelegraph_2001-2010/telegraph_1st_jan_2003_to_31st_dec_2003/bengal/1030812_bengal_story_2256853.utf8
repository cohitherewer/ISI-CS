 Tuesday, August 12, 2003 				 Acid death for girl after village meet deadlock
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Behrampore, Aug. 11: A  teenage girl died today after unknown persons sprayed acid  on her through a hut window at a village in Sagardihi, about  240 km from Calcutta.																								Police sources said Chamela Khatun, 14, of Binodchaltatala had an affair with Imadur Sheikh, 21, the son of a local mason. She ran away with him on Wednesday and was later traced by relatives to a platform at Azimgunj station, about 5 km from the village.																								Imadur managed to flee but Chamela, though reluctant, was brought back home. On Saturday, the villagers met to sort out the matter.																								Police said during the Saturday meeting, where the village elders had summoned both the families and the girl, a proposal was mooted that Imadur should marry Chamela and the controversy would end there. But the youths family members refused to recognise the marriage saying they did not support the match. The meeting broke off.																								Soon after, the police sources said, villagers rushed out of huts hearing Chamela scream in pain. They ran to her room to find her writhing in agony as the acid on her was burning her skin and clothes. 																								Chamela was taken to the Krishnapur rural hospital. From there, she was referred to the Murshidabad district hospital here. She died this morning. 																								Her uncle has filed an FIR against Imadur and his relatives. We have started a probe. I still do not know the details of what happened before the death or the persons against whom the complaint has been lodged, said the sub-divisional police officer of Jangipur.

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY 																								Calcutta, Dec. 21: Rowing on the Hooghly made a comeback and stole the Sunday centrestage for many who thronged the banks of the river to watch participants from four clubs compete in six sleek and colourful boats. 																								They raced 14 km from Panihati in North 24-Parganas to Ahiritollah in north Calcutta. Sporting T-shirts with Nadike Bhalobasun (Love the River) printed on their backs, the participants of Lake Rowing Club, Bengal Rowing Club, Calcutta University Rowing Club and Calcutta Rowing Club sweated it out amid cheers from spectators at 90 ghats on either side of the Hooghly.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Nov. 30: The wife of a CPM local committee member was arrested here last night for allegedly duping youths after promising them jobs.																								Police said Indrani Dhibar was picked up from her home in Ausgram, about 180 km from Calcutta, on the basis of a specific complaint. We are interrogating her and an investigation is on, said district superintendent of police K.C. Meena. 																								Indrani, the police said, told the youths about her reach in the CPM because of her husband and her sons father-in-law Sunil Nayek, a party leader and the sabhapati of a panchayat samiti. The subdivisional judicial magistrate today remanded her in a fortnights jail custody. 																								An unemployed Prabir Sarkar had told the police Indrani introduced herself as an influential person and claimed that her husband Manik was an MLA. She used to take us to the employment exchange and plead our cases. She appeared to be quite influential as everyone showed her respect. She took about Rs 4 lakh from five of us promising jobs in the health or the PWD departments, said Sarkar. He added that she had introduced them to several local CPM leaders.																								Prabir Dey from Bankura said he had given her Rs 80,000. We became suspicious when we did not get a job even after six months, he told the police.

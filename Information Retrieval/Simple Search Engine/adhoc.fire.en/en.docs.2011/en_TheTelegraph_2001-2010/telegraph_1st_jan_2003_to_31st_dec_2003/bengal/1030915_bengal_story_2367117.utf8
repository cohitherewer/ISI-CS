 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 14: Police claimed to have unearthed a girl-running racket in South 24-Parganas and sent a team, which included three persons who were detained, to rescue a girl from Pune. 																								The girl was allegedly sold to a brothel there. The existence of the racket came to light days ago when the police were investigating the disappearance of Ayesha Khatun, 16, a Class IX student of a school at Mathurapur. She was missing since early August.																								This is the second girl-trafficking syndicate busted in the district in the past few months. The earlier gang used to send girls to brothels in Mumbai, said an investigating officer. The trio held includes a couple from Mandir Bazaar in the district.

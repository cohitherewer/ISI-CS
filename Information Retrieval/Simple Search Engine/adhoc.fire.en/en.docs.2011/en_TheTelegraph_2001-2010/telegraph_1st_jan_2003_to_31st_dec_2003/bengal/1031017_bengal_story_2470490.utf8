 Friday, October 17, 2003 				 Prized Kalu cracks killer puzzle
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Oct. 16: When police reached Ausgram here on September 27 to find local trader Uttam Basuri, his wife and five-year-old daughter lying dead in pools of blood, they groped for an initial lead.																								The force was clueless about the murderer, or maybe a group of killers, in the absence of any perceivable motive. Basuris wife was nine months pregnant. She was butchered and her foetus thrown away. 																								After policemen split hairs over a host of possibilities, Kalu came in. The sniffer Dobermann from the district police was taken to the Basuris house later in the day.																								It was raining heavily and we were surrounded by about 10,000 agitated villagers. Kalu sniffed around and guided his handler to a spot a kilometre away. We found the murder weapon, a chopper, from a pond there. In less than a fortnight after the gruesome killings, we zeroed in on the main accused with the help of Kalu, said deputy superintendent of police (headquarters) Ambika Mukherjee.																								After cracking the case in no time, the district police have decided to recommend Kalu for an award. We will recommend the prized member of our police force for an award on Republic Day, said district superintendent of police K.C. Meena.																								Naba Kumar Ganguly, who handles Kalu, said after identifying the murder weapon he pointed out the main accused, Shankar Pramanick. 																								After helping us recover the chopper, he went straight to Shankar Pramanicks house and sniffed out a blood-stained shirt. When Shankar came out, Kalu lunged at him and barked furiously. Shankar confessed to his crime and helped us arrest two others who were present with him at the time of murder. The arrests were made within days, said Ganguly.																								It was easy for the police to identify the motive after that. The chargesheet, the police said, was framed in record time. Uttam Basuri had sold a plot of land and had a lot of cash at home. Shankar and two of his associates had planned to loot the money after murdering them.																								Officials said word about Kalus success spread fast. He is much sought after now. We are being flooded with requests from neighbouring districts to send Kalu to solve complicated cases. But we cannot keep doing that regularly because we have our cases, too. We are proud of Kalu, said a senior officer.

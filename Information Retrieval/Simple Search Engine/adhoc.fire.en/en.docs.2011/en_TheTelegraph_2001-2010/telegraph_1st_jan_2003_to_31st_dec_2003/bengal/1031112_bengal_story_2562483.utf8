 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Bhikhari wife seeks swift trial
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 11: The wife of Bhikhari Paswan, the jute mill worker in Hooghly who could not be traced after police took him away from home 10 years ago, moved a petition before the high court today seeking speedy disposal of the habeas corpus she filed in 1994. 																								The high court had asked the CBI to inquire into the incident and file a report. The CBI had said Bhikhari was picked up by a force led by then additional superintendent of police, Hooghly, Harmanpreet Singh on the night of October 30, 1993, Lalti Devis counsel said today.																								The high court had then sent the case to the Alipore court. The trial court held the police guilty and sent the case to the additional sessions judge for conviction of the accused. The additional sessions judge sought two clarifications from the high court  whether he had the jurisdiction to hear the case following an incident in Hooghly and not South 24-Parganas and if he had the right to convict senior government officials, said the counsel. 																								Lalti requested chief justice A.K. Mathur to speed up the case. The petition was admitted and the hearing fixed for December 3.

 Sunday, February 09, 2003 				 KLO cloud on Bhutan murder
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Alipurduar, Feb. 8: An Indian businessman was killed and another seriously injured in Bhutan allegedly by militants who opened fire on them in the Mainatar area today. 																								Sources said Apurba Chatterjee, an accountant with Hindustan Construction Company, was attacked by four unidentified persons while travelling with Rs 9 lakh. The money was to be paid to HCC employees constructing the Tala hydroelectric project in Bhutan.																								The attackers snatched the money and beat up Chatterjee, injuring him seriously. His driver, Aita Singh, managed to escape and informed the Mainatar police station in Bhutans Gedu subdivision.																								Animesh Ghosh, 30, a cable operator of Hamiltonganj in Alipurduar, happened to pass by then and was gunned down. Ghosh had distributed cable television lines to staff quarters at the Tala project.																								We suspect the offenders to be KLO militants. They were equipped with sophisticated arms and spoke in Bengali, a senior police officer said, requesting anonymity.																								The sources added that all senior police officers from Phuntsholing, including Raju Silvester Chhetry, the officer-in-charge of Jaigaon police station, have rushed to the spot. A 12-hour bandh has been called in Hamiltonganj. 																								Ghoshs body was brought to his residence late this afternoon. Chatterjee, who resides in Calcutta, has been shifted to Siliguri for treatment.

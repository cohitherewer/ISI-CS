The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Boulders on farmers fate
 															- Begging amp; odd jobs only resort for more than 200 tillers ALAMGIR HOSSAIN				 	 Sabina Bewa squats on her land. Telegraph picture 																								Alaipur (Murshidabad), Dec. 26: With every dawn at Alaipur village, 60-year-old Sabina Bewa gets out of tattered blankets, washes her mouth with water from an earthen pot and hurriedly has a mouthful of panta bhaat. 																								The occasional bite at a green chilly is the only spice in her only meal in a day. After consuming the rice kept overnight, she sets out for Bhagabangola market, 14 km away, to beg. Some days, she trudges to the adjacent villages of Shibnagar, Kharibona and Nasipur. 																								Despite owning 15 cottahs of farmland, this has been Sabina Bewas daily routine for the past three years. Unused boulders that the contractors had piled up for work to prevent erosion along the bank of the Ganga lie all over her land. 																								The work was undertaken in 2000 but no one bothered to remove the boulders rejected by irrigation engineers. They cover about 6,000 cottahs of farmland in Alaipur, 245 km from Calcutta. 																								More than 200 small and marginal farmers cannot cultivate their land. They earn about Rs 25 to Rs 30 a day working as labourers and doing odd jobs. 																								When the erosion prevention work was completed, the contractors paid some compensation to the affected farmers. Sabina Bewa had received Rs 1,000. They disappeared after that. 																								Repeated appeals to the block development officer and the panchayat authorities have evoked no response. We are very poor. Since I have no other means of income, I am forced to beg for a living though I own 15 cottahs, said Sabina between sobs. 																								All my life I have lived with my head held high. I feel shy to beg in my own village. So, I go to other places to beg. Please have the rocks removed from my land so that I can sow rice and wheat. I cant take the humiliation of begging any longer. Sabina lives alone. Her son left her long ago.																								Azahar Sheikh, who now works as a labourer, had gone to the office of the block development officer to protest against the farmers predicament. Next day, police came to my house and reprimanded me for raising voice at the BDOs office. I was so scared that I fled the village for a few days, said Azahar. 																								The sabhadhipati of the Congress-led zilla parishad, Siddika Begum, said: The boulders were rejected during the work to prevent erosion. The matter was handled by the previous CPM-led parishad. I do not understand where the boulders will now be removed. 																								Block development officer of Bhagabangola Block-II Prasanta Kumar Das said he had received a petition from the farmers requesting him to remove the boulders from their land. 																								But where do I shift the boulders? This year there will be some work where some boulders will be required. We will have to see whether these boulders can be used. I cant think of any other solution immediately, said Das.

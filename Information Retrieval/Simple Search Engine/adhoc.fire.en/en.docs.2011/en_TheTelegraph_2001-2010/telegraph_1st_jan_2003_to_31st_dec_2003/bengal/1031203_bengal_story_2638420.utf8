 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Nakashipara (Nadia), Dec. 2: A sunshade of an under-construction building collapsed here yesterday afternoon, unable to bear the weight of four boys who had climbed up to see a neighbourhood cricket match.																								Gour Sardar, 11, died immediately. Bachan Ghosh, 14, succumbed to injuries in hospital. Both the boys of Muragachha village, about 130 km from Calcutta, were injured in the head.																								The match was being played between two teams of the village and Gour and Bachan were part of one of them, said additional superintendent of police Pallab Kanti Ghosh. 																								Villagers said the boys were excited seeing a friend hit a six and jumped in excitement. The shade came crashing when they landed. The other boys who fell stood up on their own. We removed the rubble to bring out Gour and Bachan, who were bleeding from the head, said Tiku Ghosh, a resident. 																								Gour was declared brought dead at the Bethuadahari primary health centre. His friend died at the Saktinagar State General Hospital in Krishnagar at night. The two other boys had to be treated for minor injuries.

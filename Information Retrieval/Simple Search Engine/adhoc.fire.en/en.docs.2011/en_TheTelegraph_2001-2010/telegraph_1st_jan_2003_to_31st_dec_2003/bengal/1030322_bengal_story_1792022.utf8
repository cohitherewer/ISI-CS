The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, March 22, 2003 				 Spy cloud on garrison suspect
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, March 21: Has Binnaguri army cantonment, the second biggest in the region, become the focal point of Pakistani espionage? Police and intelligence agencies believe so, after the arrest of a Bangladeshi national, the second in six months. 																								Obendu Chanda was taken into custody on Wednesday evening after he was caught trying to sneak into the garrison. Maps of army bases and other vital installations in north Bengal were found on him, police sources said.																								On September 10 last year, a rickshaw-puller, Sattar Ali, was caught in the cantonment area with sensitive documents. The man was later linked to Mohammad Najrul, an Inter-Services Intelligence agent arrested in Rajasthans Jaisalmer two days earlier. Najrul, too, hailed from Bangladesh. 																								Chanda was spotted while trying to sneak into the sprawling cantonment under cover of darkness. 																								He said he had some work inside, but could not say what it was when the guard pressed him, an army intelligence source said.																								The suspicious sentry informed his superior immediately and the man was detained. He was later handed over to the Banarhat police station. During questioning, he confessed that he was a Bangladeshi national. But he could not produce his passport or any travel documents, raising suspicions that he had sneaked into India. 																								Police suspect Chanda is a seasoned informer having ties with the ISI. The police have booked him under the Foreigners Act for not holding valid documents to travel in the country.

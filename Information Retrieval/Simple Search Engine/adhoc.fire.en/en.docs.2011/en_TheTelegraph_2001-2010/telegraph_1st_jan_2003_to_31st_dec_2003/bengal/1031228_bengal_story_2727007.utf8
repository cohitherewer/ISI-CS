The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Cops on Naxalite chase fatigued
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bansgarh (Purulia), Dec. 27: Policemen posted at a camp here since July are a relieved lot since BSF jawans were deployed to tackle the Naxalites active in this region.																								Most of the policemen were said to be suffering from fatigue and tension before the jawans arrived.																								The camp, 330 km from Calcutta, in a building on a knoll, which Anandamargis claim to be theirs, was set up after a landmine explosion on the dirt track outside. The track leads to the house of Jagdish Tiwary, the local landlord who was beheaded by Maoist Communist Centre rebels on November 26, 2002.																								In June this year, the MCC rebels who operate mostly from adjacent Jharkhand, blasted the landmine. Though no one was injured, it was the first explosive device set off by extremists in south Bengal and was a cause of concern for the administration.																								It led to the posting of about 45 armed personnel at the building, which became the base from where anti-extremist operations were conducted.																								The declining morale of the force first came to light when a medical team led by chief medical officer of health Asit Biswas visited the camp about a month ago. The team, which visits the camp twice a month to collect blood samples for malaria tests, detected three malignant cases. 																								But I also found that quite a few of the policemen were suffering mentally as a result of continuous isolation in the remote area, said Biswas. Sparsely populated, Bansgarh is located amid forests, 22 km off the Ranchi-Purulia highway. They were complaining about not being able to see their families for months, Biswas said.																								Superintendent of police V.K. Goyal said he had not received any complaint. But a constable lamented that he was unable to go home for the pujas. We have to send our salaries home through money orders and quite an amount is wasted on postal commission fees, said another. The BSF, they admitted, will relieve their burden and anxiety.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, August 30, 2003 				 Saddam shot dead while looting bus
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Sonadanga (Nadia), Aug. 29:  Three dacoits of a gang looting a bus crammed with passengers  were gunned down by police about 110 km from Calcutta this  afternoon.																								Among the dead was notorious Bangladeshi criminal Saddam Hussain, who was one of the prime accused in the church heist at Maliapota in the district on Christmas eve. He was allegedly involved in several incidents of looting and murder in Nadia. Another dacoit shot dead was identified as Madhu Sardar, a resident of Chapra, also a murder accused. The third was yet to be identified.																								The police said the looting started about two hours after the bus left Plassey around 10 am, en route to Krishnagar. Around 11, the officer in charge of Tehatta received information that Hussain, who was out on bail, had boarded a bus with his gang. He informed Chapra police station (about 10 km from the scene of the crime) and left with two constables in a jeep to try intercept the bus, said Nadia superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty.																								The rest of the gang managed to escape into a field of jute plants and apparently headed to the Bangladesh border, about 4 km away. When the Tehatta officer spotted the bus, many passengers had been looted. Some members of the gang were also on the roof, looting passengers sitting there.

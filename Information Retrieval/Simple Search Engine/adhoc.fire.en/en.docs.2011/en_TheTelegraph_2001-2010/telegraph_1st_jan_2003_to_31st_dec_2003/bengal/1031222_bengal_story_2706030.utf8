The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Writers whip on hospital bosses
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR  Calcutta, Dec. 21: Tired  of complaints from doctors and nurses that special private  attendants, who were banished from hospitals, are back,  the government today decided to ask the superintendents  to fan out to the wards and identify them.																								The government woke up to the fact that the drive against special private attendants in its showpiece hospitals has flopped after the death of a patient in Kalyanis Jawahar Lal Nehru Hospital. 																								Namita Sarkar died after falling from her bed when a special private attendant who had taken charge of her care was away. The attendant, Anima Mondol, disappeared from the hospital after the death.																								About a year ago, the government decided that private attendants were of no use. Instead, special access (green) cards were issued to patients relatives, who were asked to stay back. The attendants were asked to leave the hospitals. 																								However, the government initiative stopped at that and no one took notice that they were lurking in the corridors and swooping down on patients relatives with promises to look after the ailing for a fee between Rs 50 and Rs 75 per day. 																								Health department officials and doctors say about 30-40 special private attendants work in each hospital. They first claim to have easy access to medicines and doctors and then warn of dire consequences if their services are not hired. Once the intimidating part is over, they grab the green access card issued to the patients relative and get into the ward posing as a family member. The guard has no choice but to allow them inside, said a senior doctor at Vidyasagar Hospital.																								They are everywhere. I have seen them in every hospital in the city and even the districts. We have now decided to ask the hospital superintendents to get up from their chairs and move around the wards to identify the illegal attendants, director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said today.																								The hospital authorities should be able to identify them and bar them from entering even if they claim to be relatives, simply because they see them every day, he added.																								One such attendant, Sumita Mondol, was found today in the maternity ward of Calcutta Medical College and Hosptial looking after three patients. I am their relative and have a right to be here, she said. Her colleagues were roaming all over the premises, chatting with ward boys and nurses. A nurse in the cardiology department said most of them do not even bother to go near their new found relatives.																								Hospital deputy superintendent A. Biswas said: We have thrown them out on several occasions but relatives of patients often come to their rescue, complicating matters.

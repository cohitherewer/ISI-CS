The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, July 19, 2003 				 Boy hit by headmaster in hospital, father held
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Kalikapur (Murshidabad), July  18: Police here have arrested the father of a Class  V student who had to be hospitalised after being hit by  the headmaster of his school. 																								Murtaza Ali, 12, is still at the Islampur rural hospital. Doctors said the thrashing by the headmaster of Kalikapur High School had affected his spine.																								But the police picked up Murtazas father, Belal, after the headmaster complained that he was assaulted. He said the father had accosted him and threatened to kill him, district superintendent of police Gyanwanth Singh said today. He added: We will also arrest the headmaster once the investigation is complete. Belal is now out on bail.																								On Wednesday, Abdul Kasem Sarkar used a wooden window bar to dole out punishment to Murtaza for pulling a bench at which Sarkars nephew, Hossain Mobarak, fell off.																								Mobarak came at me fists flying and I resisted. He then complained to head sir, who beat me up like cattle, Murtaza said, lying in the hospital bed. He had bruises on his hands, legs and waist. Doctors said he was hurt in the spine near the neck. There is no justice for the poor, Belal wept. 																								The headmaster was not apologetic for the state in which one of his students lay. I was very angry with the boy (Murtaza) and merely gave him three hits from a cane. For that, his father beat me up outside the school. I run an educational institution and have to be strict. I do not think that I have committed an offence, said Sarkar. Asked how Murtaza was injured  in his spine, Sarkar said: I have not had the time to enquire  about him. He added: I had hit him from behind when he  was running away.

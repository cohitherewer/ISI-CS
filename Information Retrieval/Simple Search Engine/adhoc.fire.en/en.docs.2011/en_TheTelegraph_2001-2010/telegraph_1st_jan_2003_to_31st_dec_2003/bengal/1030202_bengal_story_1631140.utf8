 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Serampore (Hooghly), Feb. 1: A man accused of dealing in unlicensed arms and ammunition escaped from the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court here today.																								Police said Shyambabu Bind was arrested last night from Sandhyabazar under Rishra police station. He was to be produced in court today. But Bind managed to escape from the prison van used as court lock-up as there is no permanent lock-up inside the court premises.																								Bind was taken to the court along with other criminals and kept in the prison van. He then requested the three constables guarding the prison van to accompany him to the lavatory.																								As one of the constables escorted him, Bind suddenly freed himself and started running. The unarmed constables gave chase but failed to apprehend the arms dealer who escaped from the jail compound by scaling the boundary wall.																								Superintendent of police Ajoy Kumar said he had ordered an inquiry into the incident. Police are hunting for the criminal and personnel on duty will not be spared if found guilty, he added. Bind is wanted in connection with three cases of dacoities.																								 But the police could not arrest him till last night as he had abandoned the Serampore-Rishra belt, though he had his residence in Rishra. Last night, acting on a tip-off, the Rishra police raided a hideout near Hastings Jute Mill and arrested Ben following a minor scuffle. 																								Rail disruption:Rail services on the Howrah-Tarakeswar section of the Eastern Railway were disrupted for about an hour after a minibus knocked down a 40-year-old woman on the level crossing near Sheoraphuli station at about 12 noon on Saturday. 																								Local people squatted on the level crossing demanding the arrest of the bus driver who had left the spot immediately after the incident. The woman was identified as Arati Ghosh, a resident of Sheoraphuli. The local people also blocked the G.T.Road in protest against the killing of the woman.

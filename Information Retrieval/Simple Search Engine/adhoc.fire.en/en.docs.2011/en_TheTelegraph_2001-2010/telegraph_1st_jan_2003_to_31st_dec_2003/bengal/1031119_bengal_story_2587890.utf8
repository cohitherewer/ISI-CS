 Wednesday, November 19, 2003 				 Home shuffle for girls in Liluah
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Nov. 18: The  inmates of a vagrants home in Howrahs Andul will be shifted  to the home for destitute women in Liluah, where growing  roots of criminals had troubled the social welfare department  several times in the past.																								Social welfare officials said the Liluah home is not properly managed and the continuance of employees for a very long time has led to vested interests. The inmates of the home will be transferred to Andul where, the officials said, there would be lesser trouble. 																								The women, one of the officials said, will be safer away from the industrial town. The vagrants from Andul, he presumed, will be a lesser target of the anti-socials in Liluah.																								An arrangement with West Bank Hospital, which now runs a 250-bed facility in Howrah, is also on the cards. The hospital authorities have proposed to build a 400-bed multi-speciality hospital on a portion of the 7.5 acres on which stands the Andul Home for Vagrants. They have also promised to train some of the girls to be shifted from Liluah in nursing and para-medical services.																								The social welfare department is planning to hand over a plot on the premises that now lies unutilised. A new building for the home that will house 500 inmates will be constructed over 60,000 square feet along with a building for counselling and vocational training. 																								The inmates of the two homes would be transferred after the public works department finishes construction of the new block. 																								In lieu of the land, the West Bank Hospital has been asked to reserve 15 beds for inmates of homes across the state without cost. It will also have to bear the expense of shifting the inmates of the two homes.  Kidnapped girl back																								Dibyasha Agarwal, who was kidnapped from the doorstep of her Phulbagan home in Durgapur on Sunday evening, was found today on a tea stall bench at Dishergarh Ghat in Kulti near Asansol, about 250 km from Calcutta.																								Her parents had earlier received a call from the alleged kidnappers who said they wanted to return her home but warned against informing police.

 Wednesday, April 30, 2003 				 Pre-poll violence
 OUR BUREAU																								April 29: With 11 days to go for the polls, there was more bloodshed as a CPM supporter was murdered near Behrampore and a Trinamul Congress candidate narrowly escaped an attempt on her life in North 24-Parganas.																								Nazim Seikh, 26, was bombed at Bahara last night. Police said the killing was not political but sources in Murshidabad said Seikhs murder was a result of squabbles within the CPM.																								Four alleged CPM supporters attacked Kalpana Biswas at Kalupur near Gaighata. She was rushed to a hospital in Bongaon, where her condition was stated to be critical. This is how the CPM has unleashed terror on our candidates, Mamata Banerjee said this afternoon, while reacting to the incident.

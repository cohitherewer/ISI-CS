 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kharagpur, March 13: For once, the macho men have been outmatched. 																								In two separate incidents, motorcycle-riders in the town were robbed of their vehicles recently by young women who asked for lifts. But the men could not go to police as it hurt their ego.																								Both the women had thumbed the motorcyclists to halt. I was proceeding towards Jamna. A young woman with one of her legs wrapped in bandage stopped my vehicle and asked me for a lift, said Anil Bera (name changed on request) of Gopinathpur. 																								Not realising her intentions, Bera agreed. But as soon as I was about to start my motorcycle, she requested me to pick up her dupatta, which had fallen off and was lying metres away. The moment Bera walked back, the girl zipped away with his vehicle.																								He has still not got over the insult.																								At a bus stop in Madpur, a girl initiated a conversation with the young owner of a brand new motorcycle and convinced him that his vehicle was making a peculiar noise. 																								As the youth got off to listen to the rumbling engine, the girl shoved him and off she went.																								The second youth, too, has not registered a complaint with the police. Being males, they were ashamed of being cheated by young women.																								I am ashamed of myself, said Bera.																								The police said they were helpless if the victims would not file FIRs.

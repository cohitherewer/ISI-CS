The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, July 02, 2003 				 Off to LA with jackets in place
 TAMAL SENGUPTA				 	 Biman Bose Calcutta, July 1: His passion  for the ideals of Vidyasagar and education of women in Bengal  has wafted CPM leader Biman Bose to the land of Coke and  Pepsi and home of Hollywood. 																								Bose, a politburo member and Left Front chairman, left for Los Angeles tonight to seek financial support from non-resident Indians (NRIs) to open schools for girls in the districts.																								In the US, Bose will not be a visiting communist leader. He will be there as a key functionary of the Vidyasagar Foundation for Education, Research, Development and Social Service, which is dedicated to the cause of women in Bengal.																								By tomorrow night, Bose is expected to shed his spotless dhuti and panjabi and take a stroll down the lanes of Los Angels in trousers, shirt and jacket. I will carry suits with me if they are required in America, Bose had said earlier. 																								In his mission to set up schools for girls in each district, Bose chose not to seek favour or financial support from his government. He realises, probably more than others, the cash crunch it is faced with. 																								Bose had set up the foundation in 1997 and, following in Iswarchandra Vidyasagars footsteps, worked towards a better future for women. Vidyasagar had never crossed the Bay of Bengal. But I will work hard to take him to the United States and spread his message among the Indians there. The great soul from Bengal was a revolutionary in his time and dedicated his life for the uplift of women. Another reason for my trip is to raise funds from the NRIs to open schools for girls, the CPM leader said before leaving the city.																								Los Angels will host the Bisva Banga Sammelan between July 4 and 6. We have taken a permanent stall at the conference venue there. We have published materials on Vidyasagar, made gold-plated badges with the picture of the great personality of Bengal Renaissance on them and T-shirts. We will campaign throughout the three-day conference to create awareness on his life and works. We will also highlight our intention to spread education among women, said Bose.

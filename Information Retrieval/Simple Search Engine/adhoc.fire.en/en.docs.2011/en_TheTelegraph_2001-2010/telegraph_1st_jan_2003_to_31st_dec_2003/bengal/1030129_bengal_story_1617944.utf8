One of my relatives from Calcutta rang me around 7 am and told me about the accident. My son, Sankarshan Behra, and his friend, Ranjan Jana, were travelling in the bus. I hired a Tata Sumo and rushed to Calcutta with some of my friends. Neither police nor the block development officer of Panchla could offer any information about my son. The doctors here advised me to go to the Howrah morgue and enquire about him there, said Ashok Kumar Behra.																								Badal Dalui arrived in Calcutta by bus in search of his brother, Bimal, but failed to trace him. Having failed to locate his brother in any hospital or the Howrah morgue, Badal returned to the Uluberia hospital.																								I do not know whether my brother is alive or dead. The hospital authorities told me he was not admitted here and I could not identify anyone at the morgue because the bodies were just charred lumps. I returned to Uluberia to see if he is admitted later, Badal said. His friends convinced him to return and check carefully at the Howrah morgue.																								Suman Patra was lucky to discover that his son, Madan, had survived the accident and had been admitted to the Uluberia hospital. One of my relatives in Calcutta informed me over telephone that a bus from Baripada was involved in an accident. Without telling anyone at home, I left for Calcutta by hitching a ride on a truck, he said, sitting next to his son.

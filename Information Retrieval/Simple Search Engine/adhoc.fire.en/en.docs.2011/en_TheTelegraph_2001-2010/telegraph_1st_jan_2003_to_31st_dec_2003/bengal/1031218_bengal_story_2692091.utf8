The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 None like Tom, say sleuths
 PROBIR PRAMANIK 				 	 Indian soldiers stand guard next to a group of children near the border with Bhutan in Dhumchi, 300 km north of Siliguri. (Reuters)																								Siliguri, Dec. 17: The arrest of two top Kamtapur Liberation Organisation leaders today will break the backbone of the outfit, said intelligence sources here.																								The KLOs crack squad chief Tom Adhikary alias Joydeb Roy and second-in-command Milton Burman alias Mihir Das were today picked up from their hideouts in Bhutan. 																								The arrests are going to have a telling effect on the KLOs future, provided the outfit survives the military offensive launched by the Royal Bhutan Army in the southern districts of the Himalayan kingdom. Burman is known to be the brain of the KLO. A master planner, he is an associate of the self-styled chief, Jeevan Singh, since childhood. The two along with Adhikary are the founder members of the outfit. Their arrests are a major blow to the separatist movement in north Bengal, said a military intelligence officer. 																								The three are worshipped by a section of Rajbonshi youths and have over the years enjoyed cult figure status, inspiring many young men to trail the path of militancy. They enjoyed publicity earlier elusive to the KLO brass and used to attract a large number youths to the armed rebellion, said an officer.																								According to police, even if the outfit survives the military attack, it would be difficult to replace Adhikary. As chief of the action squad, Adhikary was credited by his Ulfa and National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) comrades for planning and executing daring operations with precision. 																								Surrendered KLO militants have often spoken of Adikarys ruthlessness, said a senior officer. Adhikary and Burman were among the first batch of KLO militants who were trained by the Ulfa and the NDFB in the camps in Bhutan. The two controlled KLOs major operations and undertook recruitment drives. 																								Adhikary was also the groups principal fundraiser. His name inspired fear in the tea industry and the trading community in north Bengal, helping the KLO extort money from businessmen, said a senior police officer. A fugitive, he always managed to give the security agencies the slip after major strikes. 																								The Ulfa used to hire out KLOs arsenal and expertise mainly because of its crack squad chief, who could complete a job with finesse, said a senior Jalpaiguri police official.																								Security agencies feel the KLO will now lose contact with international gunrunners and rebels, including the Maoists in Nepal. Burman was reportedly in Bangladesh recently to purchase assault rifles and communication devices, a sleuth said.

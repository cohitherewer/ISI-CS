 NARESH JANA 																								Midnapore, Oct. 25: The state Intelligence Branch has asked the district police authorities to keep a watch on former Peoples War activists who recently returned to the mainstream and joined political parties. 																								District police officials said it is suspected that some of these surrendered activists, now with the CPM and the Congress, are still in touch with the Naxalites and could be passing on information on the movement of police and CPM workers. 																								We have specific information that some former Peoples War activists are maintaining regular contact with those associated with the group. Their return to the mainstream was just an eyewash. We are keeping a close watch on their movement, said additional superintendent of police Anil Srinivasan. 																								Of the six persons police arrested in connection with the murder of a CPM worker at Banspahari, four are surrendered Naxalites. 																								At least 20 Peoples War activists surrendered in recent times, with 14 joining the Congress and the rest opting for the CPM.

 Tuesday, September 09, 2003 				 Subhas voice for water body fill-up 
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Sept. 8: Buddhadeb  Bhattacharjee has said time and again those filling up water  bodies must be punished, but one of his ministers sang a  different tune today.																								Subhas Chakraborty, who has left the government red-faced several times before, justified filling up of water bodies and marshy land, albeit in a roundabout way. 																								The transport and sports minister made a mockery of the hue and cry over preventing water bodies from being filled up. As an excuse, he added that Salt Lake, Rajarhat, Ballygunge and Tollygunge had all been built by filling up marshy tracts and water bodies. 																								A city like Rome and parts of London were built similarly, said Chakraborty. 																								If filling up of water bodies is reason for grave threat and damage to humanity, why has it not affected the people of Ballygunge and Salt Lake?  Ganga alert																								The Ganga is flowing above the extreme danger level in Malda since early morning with water beginning to trickle into villages in the low-lying areas.																								A red alert has been sounded in Manikchak and Englishbazar and three blocks of Kaliachak. At Panchanandapur, where the river washed away an irrigation department bungalow last Friday, the water is 12 cm above the extreme danger mark and still rising.

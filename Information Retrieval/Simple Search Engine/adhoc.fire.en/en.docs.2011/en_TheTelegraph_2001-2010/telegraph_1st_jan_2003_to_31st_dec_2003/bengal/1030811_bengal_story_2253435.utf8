 Monday, August 11, 2003 				 Torture trio loses drug body licence
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Burdwan Aug. 10: The three  persons accused of torturing a medicine shop employee here  for a theft he did not commit today lost their memberships  of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association.																								Pradip Majhi, an employee of a medicine wholesaler, was allegedly lashed with leather belts, hit with wooden planks and slashed on the wrists for about 10 hours by Saugata Chatterjee, Mrinal Tah and Srimanta Hajra. The trio was named in the FIR lodged by Pradips elder brother Dilip, but they obtained bail before the police could arrest them. 																								The association has also asked the owners of the shop to bear the expenses for Pradips treatment. 																								The three accused, who had charged Pradip with stealing money from the shop, had dragged him to the druggists association office here on July 19 and tortured him for about 10 hours to extract a confession. When he went to open the shop that day the trio charged him with the theft. Around 9 pm, he was thrown out of the office at Khoshbagan here. 																								Between the lashing, clobbering and slashing, burning bidis were pressed against his hands and chips of ice held against his scrotum.																								District secretary of the association Ranendra Nath Roy said: We have cancelled the memberships of these three persons (Chatterjee, Tah and Hajra) and driven them out of our organisation for beating up and brutally torturing Pradip Majhi. We have also asked the owner of the shop where Pradip worked to bear all his medical expenses.																								Pradip has also moved the human rights commission for justice. The money he was charged with stealing was found elsewhere later. His case will come up for hearing at the court here on Tuesday.

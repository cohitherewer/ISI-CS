 Wednesday, September 24, 2003 				 Ambulance summons to sick cop
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER Calcutta, Sept. 23: Calcutta  High Court today ordered that the Nadia superintendent of  police should be brought to the court in an ambulance  if he continues to be unwell when the next hearing is due  on Friday.																								The stern directive came after police filed an unsigned report on an allegation by a 73-year-old disabled woman though the court had specifically asked the police superintendent, Benoy Chakraborty, to do so.																								The petitioner, Renuka Pal, had complained of persistent harassment by alleged CPM supporters who had snatched her land. She told the court that the police refused to register her complaint and turned her away. Two weeks ago, Justice Pranab Kumar Chattopadhyay directed Chakraborty to file a report.																								Seeing the unsigned report, a furious Justice Chattopadhyay asked: I wonder how the police can so casually handle a directive from the court. How can the report be sent to the court without the SPs signature? The government lawyer said the officer could not file the report as he had been ailing for some time.																								The judge said the police officer should attend the court on September 26 and asked the chief medical officer to arrange an ambulance for him.

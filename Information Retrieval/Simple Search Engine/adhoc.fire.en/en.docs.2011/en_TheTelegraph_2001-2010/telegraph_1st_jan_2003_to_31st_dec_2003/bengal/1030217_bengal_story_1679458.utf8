 OUR BUREAU																								Feb. 16: A killing over a bizarre love triangle had Dhananjaypur village in Nadia district shaken up this morning. Police had to intervene to prevent the situation from getting out of hands.																								Asar Sheikh shot dead Munif Mullah, brother-in-law of the girl with whom he had eloped last week.																								As news of Mullahs death spread, residents laid siege to Sheikhs house, ransacked it and attacked his mother and two brothers. Police arrived on the scene and rescued them from the mobs fury. Sheikh was arrested.																								The killing was apparently the result of an argument between Munif and Asar earlier in the morning. During the altercation, Munif had demanded to know the whereabouts of his sister-in-law, Noormi Bibi, police said.																								Asar Sheikh, 32, married to Noormi Bibi, had fallen in love with Rami Bibi, the wife of his close friend, Rezauddin Mullah.																								Sheikh and Mullah were neighbours in Dhananjaypur for the past two decades.																								Sheikh had fallen for Rami and both were madly in love, said Murshidabad deputy inspector-general of police D.P. Tarenia.																								Sheikh had managed to convince his wife, Noormi, to stay together under the same roof. He had arranged for a place in another village where the three of them would live for about a year till the heat cooled down at home, Tarenia added.																								Sheikh eloped with Rami last week with the help of his wife.																								Rezauddin was devastated on discovering his wife had deserted him. He stopped eating and would often break into tears.																								Munif was extremely close to his brother and could not bear to watch him depressed, said a local police official.																								This morning, while on way to the fields, Munif spotted Asar walking along a dirt track on the village outskirts. Some eyewitnesses later recalled them quarrelling and gesticulating wildly.																								But the argument didnt last long  Asar took out a revolver and shot Munif.																								On hearing the gunshot, alarmed villagers rushed to the spot to discover Munif lying in a pool of blood oozing from the wound in his chest.																								Irate villagers caught Asar and thrashed him after snatching away his revolver.																								Policemen arrived on the scene, posted a picket on the spot, took Asar into custody and sent Munifs body for post-mortem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, September 10, 2003 				 Front fare hike meet on Friday
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Sept. 9: The Left Front has convened an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the proposed transport fare hike. 																								The meeting was called after transport minister Subhas Chakraborty wrote to the front partners saying the minimum fare should be around Rs 4 and valid for an 8-km ride.																								We resented the manner in which Chakraborty proposed to hike the fares by simply writing to us. We had demanded a front meeting to discuss the issue, said former PWD minister and RSP leader Kshiti Goswami. 																								Chakraborty said he had sent a proposal to the front partners. It was just a proposal. I want to discuss it with them threadbare, he said. 																								Transporters had demanded a minimum fare of Rs 3 in the wake of the increase in fuel prices.

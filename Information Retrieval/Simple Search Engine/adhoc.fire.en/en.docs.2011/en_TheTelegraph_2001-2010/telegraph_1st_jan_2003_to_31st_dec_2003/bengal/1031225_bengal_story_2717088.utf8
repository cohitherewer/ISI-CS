 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Higher property tax kicks in
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Dec. 24: Armed  with a high court ruling, authorities of Salt Lake, south  Dum Dum and several other municipalities today moved to  collect property tax with arrears from residents as assessed  by the Central Valuation Board.																								A division bench of Justices Ashok Ganguly and Debi Prosad Sengupta today set aside a 1998 single-bench order that restrained the municipal authorities from collecting the property tax as recommended by the board.																								The 1998 order had been passed in response to a petition by the Salt Lake Welfare Association, a prominent lobby of residents.																								The bench observed that the municipalities had taken the correct decision to have the assessment conducted by the board and added that the recommendations were balanced and in no way violated any provision of the governing legislations.																								We are very happy about the court judgment because it gives us the opportunity to collect the tax at the rate devised by the valuation board. What is also heartening is the fact that the court has not restrained us from collecting arrears from 1998, Salt Lake municipality chairman Dilip Gupta said.																								By a reliable estimate, the Salt Lake municipality alone will fetch an additional Rs 2 crore, thanks to the court verdict.																								The figures relating to the projected additional earnings of the other municipalities were not readily available.																								Soon after todays court ruling, the heads of various municipalities held a meeting where the future course of action was discussed. As far as Salt Lake is concerned, the property tax may go up by 22 per cent and the increase could be as high as 30 per cent in respect of several other municipalities, Gupta said.																								Association secretary Ramen Das said they would shortly move the Supreme Court against the ruling.

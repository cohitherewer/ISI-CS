 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, Jan. 24: The president and secretary of a school management committee were arrested after teachers complained to police that they had beaten up the headmaster and his assistant yesterday. 																								The teachers of Kedarmoyee Vidyamandir in Pandua alleged headmaster Indranarayan Ghosh and his assistant, Gopal Sandhukhan, were arbitrarily suspended on Wednesday. The duo sat on a fast yesterday and locked up the school gates. As students were prevented from entering, a mob, allegedly comprising CPM supporters, raided the school. 																								The suspended teachers were not maintaining procedures. They were allowing CPM leaders to have a free hand in the school administration, said Bholanath Pal, the secretary.

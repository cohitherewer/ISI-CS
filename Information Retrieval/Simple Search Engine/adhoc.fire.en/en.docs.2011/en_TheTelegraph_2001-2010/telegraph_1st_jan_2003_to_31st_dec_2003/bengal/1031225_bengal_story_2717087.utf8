The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Prayers for midnight marauders
 RABI BANERJEE				 	 Policemen on the church premises on Wednesday morning. A Telegraph picture																								Maliapota (Nadia), Dec. 24: On Christmas Eve exactly a year ago, the Catholic church here was plundered by a gang of dacoits. The operation was allegedly masterminded by a villager actively involved in church activities.																								The dacoits had beaten up head priest Father T.J. Abraham and others and looted the church vault  the repository of the villagers earnings  of several lakhs of rupees at gunpoint.																								A year later, Father Abraham feels sorry for the marauders and has forgiven them all.																								Even as the church  located in Tehatta, 130 km from Calcutta  geared up for Christmas this evening amid tight security, Father Abraham promised to pray for the 20 persons arrested on the charge of looting it. The villagers are poor and poverty dragged them to commit such a crime. That is why we decided to forgive them and asked the villagers to do the same, he said.																								Father Abraham has sent a nun from the church, Sister Mary Lobo, to speak to the prisoners and pray for them. He said Sister Lobo has been told to visit the prisoners once a week in Krishnagar jail.																								She is giving sermons from the Holy Bible to them (prisoners) and is asking them to forget the past and return to the mainstream once they are out of jail, the chief priest said.																								The prisoners sometimes break down in tears in front of me and repent for what they have done. I tell them that they will have to undergo the punishment due to them but, at the same time, encourage them for the life after the punishment is over, said Sister Lobo.																								About 40 armed men had barged into the church as the midnight mass was in progress. At gun-point, the dacoits looted the villagers attending the mass and plundered the church vault, broke open the cash box and made of with other valuables, including a camera, a synthesiser and a harmonium.																								It was revealed during investigation that Suranjan Biswas, a villager, was the mastermind.																								Father Abraham said Suranjan was an active participant in various church activities. So how can we blame the villagers who attacked us when someone so near to us like Suranjan was the mastermind? he asked.																								Suranjan is absconding since the incident.																								Father Abrahams message of forgiveness has had an impact on the villagers. Those who ravaged the church last year are cruel indeed. We feel ashamed that most of them were from villages adjacent to Maliapota. But still the church head priest asked us to forgive them. So, it is important for us to forgive them, said Probhadan Mandol, a panchayat member in Maliapota.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purbasthali (Burdwan), May 31: Spurned by his paramours family for being the son of a poor weaver, a youth shot dead the girl and killed himself at Tamaghata in the Purbasthali police station area late last night.																								Sanjoy Mondol, 20, and Mira Sarkar, 18, had known each other for two years. But Miras father was firm that his daughter would not marry into a poor family.																								Police said that Sanjoy, unable to bear the humiliation and the fact that he would never get to marry the girl of his dreams, procured a country-made pistol and entered Miras house last night. 																								He shot Mira from point-blank range as soon as he entered her room. Reloading the gun, Sanjoy then shot himself through the head.																								Basabi Ghosh, a friend of the lovers, said the two had known each other for quite some time. Last year, both of them sat for the Madhyamik examination from the same school. While Sanjoy passed, Mira did not get through, Basabi said.																								Sanjoys friend, Dipak Sen, said his friend used to work with his father in their loom at home, weaving towels and other cloth. He had spoken to Miras father about his intentions of marriage but he refused outright and threw him out of the house. Both of them had been depressed for the past few days, Dipak added.																								Police said the girls father had lodged a complaint with them and added that an investigation was on.

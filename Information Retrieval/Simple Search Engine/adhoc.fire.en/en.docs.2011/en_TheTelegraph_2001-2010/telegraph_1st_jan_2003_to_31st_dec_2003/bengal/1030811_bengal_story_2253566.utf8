 Monday, August 11, 2003 				 Frame-up cry in ragging case
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, Aug. 10: Five days after a fresher at Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College complained of mental and physical torture at the hands of his seniors, parents of the accused students said they had been framed.																								Sudip Naha, father of Subhadeep Naha, one of the four students arrested on charges of ragging Sayandip Bandopadhyay, said he did not believe that his son could be brutal to a fellow student. 																								Its not like our son at all. We do not believe he can injure someone so badly, Naha, a resident of Nadia, said. We met our son in jail and he said he is innocent. We believe him. There is no doubt that he has been framed. 																								Sayandip was slashed and beaten up by seniors after being called for an introduction session in one of the hostel rooms on Tuesday evening, forcing him to leave the college. 																								The student of electronics and communications from Calcutta has refused to return to the college, fearing reprisal. He requested the government to let him continue his engineering course at Jadavpur University. The government, though sympathetic to the boys plight, ruled out the possibility. 																								Apart from Subhadeep, Parashore Kishore, Mainak Choudhury and Nigam Kundu were arrested. Kishore was a fourth-year student and a former general secretary of the college union, the others were in the second year. 																								They were identified by Sayandip victim a day after the incident. The fresher accused them of coercing him into writing a suicide note																								Subhadeeps mother Bina Naha said she arrived with her husband in Jalpaiguri on Friday. They read about their sons arrest in a newspaper. My son had opted out of the degree course in medicine to avoid dissecting human bodies though he had been selected for both in the Joint Entrance Examination. He could not have been so brutal, she said, choking up.																								The father accused Sayandip, who filed the police complaint, of trying to get into Jadavpur or Sibpur Engineering College using our son as a scapegoat. 																								Mantu Choudhury, Mainaks father, echoed the Nahas.																								Why should he do it? When I met him in jail, he kept on asking how he would show his face to his neighbours and friends? I feel he might commit suicide. We dont know what the government wants, said Choudhury, of Calcuttas Badridas Temple Street.																								The parents of Parashar, who hails from Belghoria on the fringes of Calcutta, and Nigam, a resident of West Midnapore, are yet to arrive here.

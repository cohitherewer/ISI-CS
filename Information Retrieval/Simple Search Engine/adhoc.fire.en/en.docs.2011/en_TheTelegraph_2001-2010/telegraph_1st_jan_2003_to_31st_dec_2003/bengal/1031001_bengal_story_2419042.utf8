 Wednesday, October 01, 2003 				 Teacher held after bribe charge 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 30: A teacher was arrested on the last day of his working life for swindling his schools money. 																								Chittaranjan Gayen, the teacher-in-charge of Narayanpur Lakshminarayan Junior High School in Kakdwip, South 24-Parganas, about 75 km from the city, was arrested this morning on charges of taking bribe and defalcating funds to the tune of Rs 9 lakh in connivance with a non-teaching employee. Tapan Pradhan was arrested along with Gayen. 																								After questioning the duo, police said the amount of money swindled might be more. The case against Gayen and Pradhan was started on the basis of a complaint by Ganesh Maity, the schools secretary. 																								The duo allegedly took bribe promising employment to local youths. They also assured students of sure success in examinations and siphoned out a portion of the money provided by the local MLA for the school.																								Additional superintendent of police B. Garg said Maity had alleged that in the absence of a school managing committee, the duo was running the racket for the past 12 years. 																								During this period, Gayen maintained no accounts book and the money he received from different sources for the school cannot be ascertained, said Garg. Gayen and Pradhan have been remanded in custody. But the teacher complained of chest pain and was admitted to a local hospital.

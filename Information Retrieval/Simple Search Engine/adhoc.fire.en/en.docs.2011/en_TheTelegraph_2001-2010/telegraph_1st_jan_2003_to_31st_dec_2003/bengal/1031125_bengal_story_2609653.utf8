 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 24: Jagaddal police today rescued 15-year-old Mahua Biswas from a brothel on the Haryana-Delhi border. Four persons, including two women, were arrested. 																								Mahua was taken to Delhi on October 18 from her Kalinara village, in North 24-Parganas, by Zia-ul Huda and Noori Bibi, who told her parents they would get her married to Ramfal Singh, a truck driver in Haryana. Instead, they sold the girl for Rs 18,000. 																								Acting on a tip-off, the Jagaddal police left for Haryana the day before yesterday and located Mahua. 																								Jagaddal police station officer-in-charge Shyamal Sarkar said Huda and Noori, both arrested, are involved in a girl-running racket in Titagarh.																								Mahua said there were many more girls in the brothel who were being made to dance in hotels or join brothels, Sarkar said.

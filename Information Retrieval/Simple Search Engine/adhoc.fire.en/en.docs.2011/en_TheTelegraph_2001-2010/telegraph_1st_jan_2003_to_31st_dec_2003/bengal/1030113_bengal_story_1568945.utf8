 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 Probe into derailment
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Alipurduar, Jan. 12: The railways have set up an inquiry committee to probe the derailment of 12 coaches of the Kamrup Express on Friday night. The divisional safety officer of the Alipurduar Railway Division, Madhukar Rote, will head the panel. 																								Alipurduar divisional operating manager Sandip Tripathi said there are three primary reasons behind fracture in tracks: old tracks, stress due to the cold weather and poor maintenance. 																								Technical experts of the division claim that tracks in this sector were changed in November 2002 and subsequently checked by a flow detection machine. They are not sure how a derailment could occur within 45 days of the last maintenance exercise.																								North-east Frontier Railway had initially blamed the mishap on cracks in the rail weld because of extreme cold conditions.

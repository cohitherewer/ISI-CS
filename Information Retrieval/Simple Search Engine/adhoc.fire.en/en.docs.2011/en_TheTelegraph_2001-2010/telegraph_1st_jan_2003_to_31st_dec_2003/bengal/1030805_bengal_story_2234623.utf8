 Tuesday, August 05, 2003 				 Leak charge on varsity teachers
 OUR BUREAU Aug. 4: Calcutta High Court  today rejected the anticipatory bail prayers of two lecturers  of colleges affiliated to Vidyasagar University who were  accused of leaking out question papers.																								In Midnapore, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested an employee of the universitys distance education department during the day and charged him with forging marksheets .																								A division bench of Justice Nure Alam Chowdhury and Justice Arunava Baruah disallowed the bail pleas of Ashraf Ali, a lecturer of Contai College, and Manoranjan Pradhan, a teacher at Mugberia College in East Midnapore. 																								Both were named in an FIR filed by the registrar of the university last month, accusing them of leaking out papers of the Part-I physics examination to students who took private classes from them.																								Appearing on behalf of the state, Rashbehari Mahato opposed the bail petitions. 																								Many guardians of physics students had approached the university alleging that the lecturers had handed out suggestions that tallied entirely with the question papers, said Mahato.																								The university had then approached the police superintendent of East Midnapore and requested him to look into the allegations. Mahato told the court that the police had found both teachers guilty of leaking out question papers.																								Bishnupada Gayen was today picked up from the university premises by a CID team and charged with supplying marksheets with enhanced scores to candidates of distance education courses. 																								Gayen, too, had approached the high court for anticipatory bail, which was rejected.																								The CID had asked the varsity authorities to inform their sleuths as soon as Gayen reported for duty. He came for work today.

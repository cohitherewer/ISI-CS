 Tuesday, July 22, 2003 				 Court order on ghost school
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER Calcutta, July 21: The  high court today directed the school education department  to recover money spent on paying officials and teachers  of a school with no building and a few students. 																								The order followed a report by the assistant inspector of schools that Alipara Ambedkar Siksha Niketan in Kulpi, 80 km from here, had neither infrastructure nor students to enjoy the status of a state-aided institution, which it had done for the past six years.																								The Alipara Ambedkar School is running in a rented room of the house of Bibhuti Gharami and all classes (from V to VIII) are being held in a 30-foot by 20-foot room, said the report. The inspector said 18 students were attending classes during his visit. But there were five teachers and two non-teaching employees.																								Justice Barin Ghosh today asked the education department to take steps against the school authorities. He said: Government money is being misused by officers of the department.

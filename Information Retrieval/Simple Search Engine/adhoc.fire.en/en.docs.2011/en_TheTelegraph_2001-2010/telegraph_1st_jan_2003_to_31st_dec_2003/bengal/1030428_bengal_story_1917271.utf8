The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, April 28, 2003 				 Mamata trains terror gun on CM
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, April 27: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today charged chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with violating the Constitution and instigating CPM cadre against the Opposition before the May 11 panchayat polls.																								Mamata was reacting to Bhattacharjees comments at Patharpratima and Mandirbazar yesterday that he would break the heads of those who try to let loose terror and communalism.																								As head of the state, Bhattacharjee cannot say such things, Mamata said. She added that she would write to deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani seeking his intervention.																								He (Bhattacharjee) is saying things that are totally unconstitutional. He is, in fact, inciting his party cadre and police against the Opposition parties to intimidate them on the eve of the panchayat polls, Mamata said.																								A senior Trinamul leader said the CPM systematically terrorised the Opposition parties in the districts. A glaring example is the number of uncontested seats. More than 3,000 seats are uncontested in Hooghly and Burdwan alone.																								CPM state secretary Anil Biswas refuted Mamatas charges. He (Bhattacharjee) had only said he would break the heads of those who would try to foment communalism in the state. The chief minister was right. He will repeat what he said.																								Hooghly alert																								The Hooghly administration is keeping its fingers crossed over tomorrows twin meetings by the CPM and Trinamul at Polba. 																								Mamata will launch her partys joint campaign with the BJP for the rural polls at Rajhat. She would be accompanied by state BJP chief Tathagata Roy.																								CPMs Benoy Konar will hold a rally near Polba police station.

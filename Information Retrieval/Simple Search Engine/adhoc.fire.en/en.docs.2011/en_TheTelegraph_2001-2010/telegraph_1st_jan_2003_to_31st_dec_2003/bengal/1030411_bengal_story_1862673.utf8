The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 11, 2003 				 Panchayat member murdered 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Midnapore, April 10: A young panchayat samity member of Burulia village in the Nandigram area of East Midnapore district was murdered last night. 																								Drawn by his groans, villagers found Jagat Jyoti Das, 30, last night from a dark patch by a village road. They rushed the CPM member, who could barely move, to the Rayapara rural hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Sources at the hospital said he had been throttled. 																								Barely two days ago, Das married a local woman who was slated to replace him as the CPM candidate for the forthcoming panchayat elections because the seat has been reserved for women. She would have definitely succeeded in the polls as Das was a very popular figure in the village, CPM sources said. 																								Panchayat samity sabhapati Durga Shankar Giri said Das bride, Namita, would have been the ideal choice for candidate as residents wanted Das as their de facto representative. Of the 18 samity seats in the Nandigram II block, 16 belong to the CPM. 																								Nandigram zonal committee member Amal Manna blamed the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine for the murder. This group plotted to kill Jagat as they are out to create panic among our candidates, Manna said. 																								Police, however, said Das could have made enemies as he was supervising the eviction of some shops from the Gholpukur market to make way for a road. 																								Condemning the murder, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said Trinamul is indulging in the politics of murder.

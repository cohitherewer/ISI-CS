 Sunday, March 23, 2003 				 Denied leave, constable ends life 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, March 22: Denied leave to visit his ailing wife, a 28-year-old head constable of a police camp at Basanti in South 24-Parganas committed suicide this morning. 																								Officials said Biswajit Bhowmik was found lying in a pool of blood at the Pirkhali camp around 6 am with a bullet in his head. The body has been sent for post-mortem. 																								Last week, a constable killed himself with his service revolver at Hasanabad after he was denied leave to attend a family function. His wife has brought murder charges against the officer-in-charge of the police station before the state human rights commission. 																								Policemen at the camp woke this morning to the sound of a shot and found Bhowmik writhing in pain. They rushed him to a nearby hospital, where he was declared brought dead. 																								As news spread, senior police officials, including additional superintendent of police S. Ponda and Canning sub-divisional police officer Sudhangshu Sinha Sarkar, arrived. They were seen questioning several of Bhowmiks colleagues throughout the day, but refused comment till the investigation is complete.

 Thursday, April 03, 2003 				 Teen raped in Malda
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, April 2: A teenage widow living with her impoverished parents in a village was gangraped in yet another assault on women in the state, police and the victim said today. 																								As her parents, gagged and trussed, looked on, three armed local goons assaulted the 17-year-old for more than four hours at Sahapur near Malda on Saturday night.																								The victim lodged a complaint with the Old Malda police station on Sunday, but no one has been arrested. 																								District superintendent of police Pankaj Dutta said a hunt was on for the assailants, but they appeared to have fled the area. In the FIR, the victim identified the thugs as Sanjay Ghosh, Gautam Ghosh and Milan Das.																								The Trinamul Congress alleged that the three belonged to the CPM and the Congress. This is why police have not made any arrests so far, a party leader said.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 31: The CPM today expelled 339 members who had violated party norms on the formation of panchayat bodies and tried to grab official positions with support from Opposition parties.																								The expulsion of such a large number of members for violating party guidelines is unparalleled in the CPM. In Cooch Behar, 86 party members were expelled and 84 in East Midnapore. 																								CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said the leadership had asked the 2.2 lakh party members not to seek help from the Trinamul Congress, BJP or the Congress to secure berths in any of the three tiers of the panchayat. 																								These members violated our instruction and we had to throw them out, said Biswas.

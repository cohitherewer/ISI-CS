 Monday, March 17, 2003 				 Subhas springs insurance hope
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 16: More than eight lakh school students in the state will be brought under a health insurance scheme, transport and sports minister Subhas Chakraborty said today.																								I will send a proposal to the government after Holi to bring the students under the insurance cover, Chakraborty said at Salt Lake stadium during a programme to bring economically weak mothers and their children under a health insurance scheme that was launched today.																								I will propose that the managing committees of the schools should be directed to ask the parents to pay the premiums. The meagre sum can be paid by the parents, the minister said. 																								In a state with a 10 per cent student population, the scheme will yield a two-fold benefit, Chakraborty added. With the insurance cover, there will be a sense of security in the society and employment opportunities will increase.																								The insurance sector will see an employment boom in the next five years, said the minister. 																								The health insurance scheme for below-poverty-line mothers was jointly launched by the sports department, Pather Panchali  an NGO headed by the sports ministers wife, Ramala Chakraborty, the Students Health Home, the Indian Medical Association, National Insurance, Health 21Net, Peerless and Prudential ICICI. 																								The organisers said about 50,000 mothers and children were registered at the day-long programme.

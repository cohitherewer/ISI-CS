 Saturday, August 30, 2003 				 Plea to uncover cola reports
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 29: The green bench of the high court today admitted a public interest litigation demanding that the state pollution control board make public the results of the laboratory tests to detect the presence of toxins in samples of soft drinks.																								The petitioner said both the board and the environment minister had told media that the test results would not be disclosed but sent to the Centre and the state health department. 																								 When government pleader Debashis Kar Gupta asked the judges why the petitioner had not made Coke and Pepsi, the two companies accused of selling soft drinks with traces of pesticides, party to the case, the petitioner said he did not have their addresses. The case will again come up for hearing three weeks later.																								The petition said expert opinion should be sought on the effects of the pesticides and other harmful elements in the drinks and they be declared to the public. 																								The companies should be made to reveal the contents of the concentrates used to make the soft drinks, said the petitioner. Health and hygiene of consumers are at risk and they should be informed about what these concentrates have in them.

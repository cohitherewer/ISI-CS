 Friday, September 19, 2003 				 Police fire in air after Congress assault
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Behrampore (Murshidabad), Sept.  18: Police had to fire in the air and lathicharge when  Congress supporters in front of a police station turned  violent this afternoon. 																								Four policemen, including the subdivisional officer and officer-in-charge of Khargram police station, about 250 km from Calcutta, were among 15 policemen injured in stone pelting and alleged manhandling. 																								The Congress supporters were protesting against police atrocities on party workers and the forces alleged collusion with the CPM.																								Murshidabad superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh said the Congress workers had come to the police station to submit a memorandum. Subdivisional police officer of Kandi Kallol Ganai was there to receive it. The Congress workers handed over the memorandum and even held a meeting with the police officers. They demanded an apology from the officer in charge of Khargram for harassing Congress activists. As we refused to accept what we believed was untrue, they went out of the police station but soon became violent and attacked, said Singh.																								The police station was ransacked after six teargas shells were lobbed to disperse the stone-pelting protesters. They tore files, broke furniture and the glass tops on tables. Some of the policemen were allegedly beaten up. 																								At least 10 Congress supporters were arrested after reinforcements arrived.																								 The police alleged that the Congress workers had come with a plan to create trouble. Otherwise, why should they turn violent and return with brickbats after leaving the police station peacefully? an officer asked. He added that there was no substance in the Congress allegations against the police.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, October 11, 2003 				 Mishra scan on officer postings
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Oct. 10: The government has formed a six-member committee headed by health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra to oversee postings of West Bengal Civil Services officers. The panel is expected to check increasing interference by politicians, including ministers.																								Mishra told The Telegraph that the government would not tolerate intervention in the postings and transfers of WBCS officers. We intend to follow in toto the existing rules and regulations and will not allow anyone to wield any influence in this regard, he said.																								No minister will have the liberty to personally choose his departmental officers. A minister and his departmental secretary will have to work with the officers posted in the department. However, we shall take action against officers found inefficient or corrupt, asserted the minister.																								Mishra said computers would be used to monitor postings to ensure greater transparency and check corruption.																								The panel, which also includes finance minister Asim Dasgupta, home secretary (PAR) D.K. Chakraborty and a representative of the WBCS Association, will also oversee officers performance and redress grievances.																								The home secretary will prepare the list of officers to fill up vacancies in the 1,767 sanctioned posts in the state and issue orders on getting Mishras approval.																								Some ministers and senior officers opt for WBCS officers of their choice. There are also some officers who obtain prize postings with the help of a minister or political leader. We want to stop this practice and feel that the government should strictly enforce the rules regarding transfers and postings, said a senior WBCS officer at Writers Buildings.																								A delegation from the WBCS Association had recently urged the chief minister to check political interference in postings.

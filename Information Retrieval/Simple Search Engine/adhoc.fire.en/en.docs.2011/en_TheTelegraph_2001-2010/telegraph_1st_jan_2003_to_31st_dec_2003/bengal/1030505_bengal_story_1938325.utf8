 Monday, May 05, 2003 				 Four hurt in poll clashes 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Basanti (South 24-Parganas), May 4: Four persons, including a woman, were injured in clashes between supporters of the RSP and the CPM at Charabidya here and at Canning. The injured have been admitted to a local hospital in a serious condition. 																								Around noon, some armed men owing allegiance to the CPM allegedly attacked the house of a local RSP leader, Sanyasi Haldar, when the family was taking lunch. The raiders pounced on Haldar and injured him grievously. His daughter-in-law was also critically injured when she tried to save Haldar. Another family member was also hurt in the melee. 																								Haldars colleague Lokman Mollah said the CPM had targeted Haldar as he was an important cog in the local RSP. Mollah said CPM workers had also attacked their panchayat samity candidate Golam Rauf Laskar at Kanthalberia in Canning and injured him. 																								CPM zonal committee member Sudhangshu Sekhar Dubey said the RSP allegations were baseless. 																								Police teams have reached the spot to maintain law and order.

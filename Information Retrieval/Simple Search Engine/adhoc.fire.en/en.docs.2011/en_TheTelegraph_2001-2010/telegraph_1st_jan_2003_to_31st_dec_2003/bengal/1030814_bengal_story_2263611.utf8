The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, August 14, 2003 				 Mother waits, sister gives up 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Rampurhat, Aug. 13: Sukhendu Dey of Kalisara Palli here had promised his mother that he would be back soon so that she could hunt for a bride for her youngest son. He wanted to be home by Rakhi Purnima, to make sister Saswati happy, too. 																								Last Sunday he called from Mumbai to say that he had got a few days leave and would be home soon. On Tuesday, a chopper carrying Sukhendu and 24 other ONGC employees, including Santi Ranjan Roy of Bethuadahari and Ramaprasanna Biswas of Jalpaiguri, plunged into the Arabian sea shortly after taking off from an off-shore oil rig. 																								The fate of 24 employees in the helicopter is not known. 																								Sukhendus mother, Mayarani, is in a daze. She doesnt believe her son is no more. He promised to be here soon and he never breaks his word, she said, before clamping up. 																								But Saswati has given up hope. He wanted to be home this week during Rakhi Purnima, but he will never be able to do so now. 																								Sukhendus elder brother Sanjib, an air force employee, and his father-in-law left for Mumbai today. 																								The young man had joined ONGC two years ago as an engineer and was posted at Mumbai. His visits were infrequent as he worked on the off-shore oil rig. Sukhendu fulfilled all the dreams we had of him and when he got the job, we were proud of our brother, said Satyajit, another elder sibling.

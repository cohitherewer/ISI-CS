 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 20: The state government is mulling revamping the drinking water and sanitation system in and around the city with financial assistance from the World Bank.																								Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya met representatives of the World Bank and departmental secretary S. Rajendrakumar at Writers Buildings today to discuss the issue.																								According to the plan conceived by Bhattacharya, a new company will be formed where majority shares will be held by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. The other shareholders will be the funding agency and private parties.																								The proposed company will have experts in the field of water supply and sanitation. It will be the sole authority of the company to draw up plans, mobilise the sources of funds and implement it. The company will also have power to raise funds to implement any major project by taking loan from banks and other financial institutions.																								Rajendrakumar said the government had taken up both short-term and long-term projects to improve the sanitation system in greater Calcutta.																								It is not wise to entrust any single government agency to take the full responsibilities of the matter. In order to get a better result, we feel it necessary to engage private parties and experts in this field. A separate company for a specific work will be very much effective to work fast and efficiently, he added.

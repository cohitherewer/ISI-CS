 Thursday, November 20, 2003 				 Wait for blood ends in death
 ALAMGIR HUSSAIN																								Behrampore, Nov. 19: A 25-year-old pregnant woman died at Behrampore district hospital in Murshidabad this morning, waiting for blood.																								Alimara Bibi was admitted to Jangipur sub-divisional hospital around 2 am. Although doctors had planned a normal delivery, Alimara was referred to the district hospital after she started bleeding profusely.																								It was around 6 am when Muzzammal Haque reached the hospital with his wife, but a bleeding Alimara was left on the floor of the labour ward for want of a bed.																								I waited for over two hours and there was not a single doctor to attend to her, Haque said in a complaint lodged with chief medical officer of health Bijon Kumar Mondal and district magistrate Manoj Panth.																								A visiting doctor later attended to Alimara and asked her family to arrange for AB+ blood immediately.																								Turned down by the hospital, Haque rushed to the blood bank in Behrampore town, where, after waiting for more than two hours, he was told that blood was not available.																								Jibu Roy, an employee of the blood bank, told Haque he could arrange for it if paid Rs 1,800. I did not have the cash, Haque said.																								When he returned to the hospital empty-handed, he found Alimara had died.

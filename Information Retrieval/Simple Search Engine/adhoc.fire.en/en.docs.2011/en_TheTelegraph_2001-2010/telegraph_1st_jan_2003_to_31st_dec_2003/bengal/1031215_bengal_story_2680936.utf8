The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, December 15, 2003  Housing boom bound for districts
 The inauguration of Sonar Tari phase-II.  Telegraph picture Santiniketan (Birbhum), Dec.  14: Decrepit houses, potholed roads, drains full to  the brim and shabby hospitals: district towns in the state  are easy to describe. But the government, often accused  of being biased towards Calcutta, is now trying to makeover  towns to attract investors beyond the city.  Good housing is a key to making  the towns look better and, for the government, the model  of housing and infrastructure development being followed  in Santiniketan is worth replicating elsewhere.  The emphasis here is on joint  sector projects with companies like Peerless and Bengal  Ambuja and the town made famous for its serenity by Rabindranath  Tagore is now witnessing a housing boom. Our objective  is to create adequate housing as part of the industrialisation  roadmap, said housing minister Gautam Deb. If the investor  has to go to the districts, weve got to fulfil their requirements,  he added. Bengal Peerless Housing Development  Company is planning housing projects across the state,  managing director of Peerless General Finance and Investment  Company S.K. Roy said yesterday while laying the foundation  stone of the second phase of Sonar Tari, a housing project  at Prantik in Santiniketan. This phase will have 130 duplex  units.  We are conducting an extensive  survey in several towns on the nature of land available  and types of buildings required, said the managing director  of the housing company, K.S. Bagchi. According to plans, Peerless will  build a school and hand it over to Ramakrishna Mission Seva  Pratisthan. We have received the proposal and will discuss  it, said Swami Sarbolokananda, the Pratisthan secretary. Housing being lucrative, it is  easy to rope in entrepreneurs, said Somnath Chatterjee,  the CPM MP from Bolpur and chairman of the Santiniketan-Sriniketan  Development Authority.

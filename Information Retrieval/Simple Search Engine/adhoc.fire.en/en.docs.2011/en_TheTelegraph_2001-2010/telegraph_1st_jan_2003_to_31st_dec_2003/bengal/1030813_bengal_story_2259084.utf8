 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Bacteria found in hospital water
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 12: The civic health department has found samples of potable water collected from reservoirs of some city hospitals and institutions to be teeming with bacteria.																								Member mayor-in-council (health) Pradip Ghosh said the level of contamination at St Pauls Cathedral, SSKM Hospital and B.R. Singh Hospital was alarming as the coliform bacteria count in the samples was found to be as high as 180 per cubic centimetres.																								The bacteria count ought to have been zero in case of filtered potable water, Ghosh said.																								The health department has passed on the findings to the water supply department so it can take steps for purification.																								The discovery of the bacteria led Ghosh to direct health officials at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to collect samples of tap water from public institutions, including Writers Buildings, Raj Bhavan, and the Lalbazar police headquarters.																								Health inspectors at the borough level have been asked to collect samples of tap water from schools and colleges in their areas, Ghosh said.																								Chief engineer (water supply) Dibyendu Roychaudhury contested Ghoshs claim, saying: Subsequent conformity tests conducted by the public analyst in the civic laboratory today showed that the bacteria found in the samples were not pathogenic (harmful for the system).																								Roychaudhury said coliform bacteria may be found in almost all reservoirs at public institutions since they were not cleaned regularly.																								Elsewhere, complaints have begun pouring complaining of contamination in filtered water supplied by the corporation in Park Street, Mullick Bazar, McLeod Street and in some parts of east Calcutta.

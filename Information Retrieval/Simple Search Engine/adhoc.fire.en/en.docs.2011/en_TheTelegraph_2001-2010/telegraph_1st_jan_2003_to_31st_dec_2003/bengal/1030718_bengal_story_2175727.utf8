 Friday, July 18, 2003 				 Panja truce with party put off
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, July 17: Rapprochement between Mamata Banerjee and estranged Trinamul Congress MP Ajit Panja proved elusive with the rebel refusing to appeal in writing for the withdrawal of suspension.																								Panja came up for discussion at a meeting of the partys working committee this afternoon where members insisted on a written appeal for revoking the disciplinary action. 																								Sources said Mamata told the committee that Panja had met her in Delhi and wanted an early revoking of the suspension. She felt the committee should consider his plea and take a decision.																								We cannot rely on a verbal plea to withdraw suspension. He should give it in writing, city mayor and MLA Subrata Mukherjee said. Panja declined to write to the party when told about the decision.

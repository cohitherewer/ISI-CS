The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, July 09, 2003 				 Cremated amid tears and cries of neglect 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, July 8: Subhas Mukhopadhyay was cremated at Keoratala this afternoon. 																								From filmmaker Mrinal Sen, writer Sunil Gangopadhyay, poet Joy Goswami to actor Dilip Roy and admiring readers descended on the south Calcutta crematorium to pay their last respects to the revered poet.																								On his way home from Writers Buildings, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stopped near the lift and recited: Lakho lakho haat ek holey bolo paroa kakey/aamar daabi ke rokhey, ke rokhey lal jhandakey (If lakhs of hands unite there is no fearing anyone/ who will block our demand, who will block the red flag). This is my homage to the poet, said the chief minister.																								Minister for water resources development Nandagopal Bhattacharya and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty were at the crematorium on behalf of the government. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee were also there. 																								Leaders from Mamatas party, the Trinamul Congress, sought to kick up a row over the poets demise. They alleged that the leftist-turned-Mamata admirer, who attended some of her programmes and wrote limericks for election campaigns, was left languishing without care at the SSKM Hospital.																								However, they also pointed out that the allegations of neglect had primarily come from his family. He (Mukhopadhyay) had developed a bedsore and the nurses on duty had misplaced his blood report, said a relative. 																								We helped Subhasbabus family members shift him to Belle Vue Clinic last night. They had complained that he was being neglected by a section of the employees at SSKM, said Mukherjee. 																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra denied the allegations. I even inquired about his condition last evening and there were no complaints, he said.

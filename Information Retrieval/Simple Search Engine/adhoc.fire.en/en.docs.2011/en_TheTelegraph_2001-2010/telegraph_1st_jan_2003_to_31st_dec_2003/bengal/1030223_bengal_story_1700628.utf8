 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 Censure spectre on 8 errant inspectors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Feb. 22: Bengal police chief Dinesh Vajpai has asked police authorities here to pull up eight inspectors for not obeying orders issued by their superiors and failing to prepare on time inspection reports of police stations in their jurisdiction.																								The director-general of police yesterday held a meeting with senior officers in the district at the CMERI auditorium at Durgapur, where he had come to inaugurate a badminton tournament. A senior officer said that besides reviewing the latest activities of Naxalites, Vajpai took special note of the service records of 10 inspectors posted in the district.																								It was found that barring two inspector-in-charge of the Burdwan police station Parag Ghosh and circle inspector of the Hirapur area Uma Shankar Mukherjee  none had performed well. Vajpai asked inspector general of police, western range, Gautam Mohan Chakraborty, to censure the eight.																								Sources said the inspectors had failed to carry out even routine inspections of police stations under their jurisdiction. These inspectors have not even properly carried out the instructions sent to them from the office of the director-general of police through the inspector general, Vajpai observed.																								At a separate meeting with Chakraborty, Burdwan police superintendent B.N. Ramesh and deputy inspector general, Burdwan range, R. Harirajan, Vajpai asked for details of activities of Naxalite outfits like Peoples War and the Maoist Communist Centre.																								The deputy superintendent of police in charge of the district intelligence branch, Sunil Chatterjee, told Vajpai that the Peoples War did not have a marked presence, but there were other Naxalite factions operating in the district. Vajpai was told that though there were Naxalites active in the industrial areas, they had no link with the Peoples War or the MCC. The murder of CPI(M-L) leader Ganesh Pal, in the Pandabeswar area on January 8, was also discussed. 																								Vajpai also questioned the efficacy of Rameshs move last year to set up a mobile police station and said the decision was taken without informing the state police headquarters. He asked Ramesh to explain the reasons for having a mobile police station.

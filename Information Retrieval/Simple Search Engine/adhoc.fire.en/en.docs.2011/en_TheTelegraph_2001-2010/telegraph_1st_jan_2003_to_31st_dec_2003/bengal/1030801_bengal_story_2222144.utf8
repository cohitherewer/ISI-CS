 Friday, August 01, 2003 				 Civic bodies face flak
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 31: The  government has stopped sanctioning funds to Kulti municipality  in Burdwan after allegations of financial irregularities  were proved true, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya  said in the Assembly.																								His department had received specific complaints, said Bhattacharya. In reply to a question from Trinamul Congress MLA Malay Ghatak, the minister said: We have information that the municipality has constructed a party office misusing the funds provided by the government for construction of a community hall. 																								Kulti municipality is run by a Trinamul-Congress alliance. Ghatak alleged that the government had stopped disbursing funds because the municipality was run by Opposition parties. There is no supply of drinking water and the municipality is not in a position to render civic amenities to the people as the government is not giving money, said Ghatak. 																								Baidyabati municipality  also run by an Opposition alliance  in Hooghly has flouted norms in recruiting employees, the minister said. The municipality appointed 121 people without the mandatory government clearance. 																								Bhattacharya, however, added that if the civic body follows norms, the government will pay salaries to those appointed to the 60 sanctioned posts lying vacant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, September 14, 2003 				 Explosives truck owner clears air
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Sept. 13: Owners of the mysterious consignment of ammonium nitrate, an essential ingredient for explosives and detonators, turned up today with the requisite documents and satisfied Purulia police that the 18 metric tonnes of the chemical were legitimate. 																								The truck will be released on Monday, after the fines are paid. 																								When the truck was stopped on Thursday evening at Chas More, an important junction on the Purulia-Ranchi highway from where vehicles branch off to Bokaro and other parts of Jharkhand and Bihar, the helper fled with the papers, leading to the arrest of driver Paras Yadav, alias Madan. 																								Yadav claimed he was taking the truck from Haldia port to the Indian Explosives Limited factory at Gomia in Bokaro. But he could not explain why he was travelling without the relevant papers and was arrested.																								Truck owner Manoj Pande today arrived in Purulia with the missing helper and met senior police officials. He produced the relevant papers and consignment notes, convincing the police that the shipment was genuine.																								Even officials from the Indian Explosives factory in Gomia turned up, corroborating his explanations.

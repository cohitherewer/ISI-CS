The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, April 12, 2003 				 June second chance for voter cards
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, April 11: Chief electoral officer S.N. Haque today said those without a voters identity card would be given another opportunity to get it.																								At a meeting with representatives of all political parties at Writers Buildings, Haque said about 3.99 crore out of 4.64 crore voters had identity cards. He said nearly 22 per cent of the voters in Darjeeling and Calcutta are yet to get theirs.																								In Calcutta, the voters cards will be given for three weeks from June 27 and in Darjeeling, from April 25.																								In other north Bengal districts, like Murshidabad, Nadia, Birbhum, Hooghly, East Midnapore, Burdwan Sadar, Kalna and Katwa, the three-week exercise would begin from June 5. In other districts, the cards would be given from June 27.																								Another all-party meeting convened by the West Bengal Election Commission to discuss arrangements for next months panchayat elections ended in a fiasco today after representatives of the Trinamul Congress and the BJP staged a walkout. The representatives accused the poll panel of serving the interest of the ruling CPM and staged a demonstration at the commissions office.																								Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said they were critical of state election commissioner Ajoy Sinhas refusal to listen to complaints about intimidation of party candidates by CPM activists. Sinha did not take action to enable candidates of the Trinamul-BJP combine to file nomination papers, despite specific complaints, Roy alleged.

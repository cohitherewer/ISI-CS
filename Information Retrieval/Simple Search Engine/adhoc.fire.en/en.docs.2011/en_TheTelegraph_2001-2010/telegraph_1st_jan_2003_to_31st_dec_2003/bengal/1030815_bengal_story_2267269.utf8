 Friday, August 15, 2003 				 Mob assault in court
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranaghat (Nadia), Aug. 14: A mob shoved and slapped the seven accused in the murder of surgeon Chandan Sen at the subdivisional judicial magistrates court here today.																								Police had to lathi-charge to disperse the mob of about 200 people, mostly Trinamul Congress supporters.																								The mob was waiting in front of the court for the police to bring the accused this morning from the jail a few hundred metres away. Some among the crowd carried placards condemning the murder and blaming the CPM for providing shelter to Rahamat Alam, Sens colleague at the sub-divisional hospital here who gave himself up before the magistrate yesterday.																								Sen, a surgeon at the subdivisional hospital here, was murdered on February 26. He had gone to attend a dinner hosted by Sunil Ganguly, a retired employee of the hospital, at his house on the outskirts of the town. His body was found in a shallow pond after the dinner.																								Ganguly and his son were later arrested in connection with Sens death. 																								At 10.15 am, when a police van drove in with Alam, Subhoranjan and Arundhati Khara, Sunil and Gautam Ganguly, Apurba Sanyal and Abbas Ali Karigar, the crowd prevented it from entering the court compound. When the seven policemen escorting the accused tried to take them inside, there was chaos.																								Some among the protestors slapped Alam, others beat up Gautam and Subhoranjan with the sticks that had held up placards. Sanyal was almost pushed to the floor in the melee, which went on for about 10 minutes till circle inspector Samir Guha arrived with reinforcements and ordered the lathi-charge.																								Around 1.30 pm, when the seven accused were being marched into the courtroom from the lock-up, Subhoranjan Khara, a doctor arrested along with his physician wife Arundhati, shouted out to the magistrate some lawyers had instigated the attack on them.																								This is the second time that my wife and I were assaulted. We were also assaulted when we were produced in court for the first time (March 17). Some people of this institution are behind this attack, I want justice, said Khara.																								After the lawyers of the accused pleaded that it was becoming difficult for them to appear in court, magistrate P. S. Mukherjee directed Guha to file an FIR and round up the attackers.

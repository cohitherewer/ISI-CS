The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Patriotic militants boo Ulfa amp; KLO 
 AVIJIT SINHA The blindfolded rebels after the handover  on Monday night. Telegraph picture																								Jalpaiguri, Dec. 30: Around 10 last night, the mobile phones of several newspaper correspondents buzzed to life. The Jalpaiguri superintendent of police said from the other end: The arrested militants could be brought over tonight. It might be late.																								In no time, about a dozen reporters, heavily fortified against the chill, flocked to Kotwali police station here. The station wore a sleepy look with only two lights glowing on the approachway and a couple of security guards patrolling outside. 																								Around midnight, a siren was heard screaming and the scene changed. A van screeched to a halt outside the police station and a convoy of jeeps followed. CRPF jawans rushed out of the vehicles and threw a cordon around the police station. 																								As the blindfolded KLO militants were herded into the police station amid the ceaseless whir of shutters, one of them shouted: Bharat mata ki jai, KLO murdabad, Ulfa murdabad (long live India, down with KLO and Ulfa). To the surprise of the security personnel and the scribes alike, all 12 handcuffed rebels who had slowly trooped into the police station shouted Bharat mata ki jai, KLO murdabad, Ulfa murdabad in chorus.																								The militants were arrested from the Ulfa central headquarters in Samdrup Jongkhar district of Bhutan, some time after the Himalayan kingdom launched Operation All Clear. 																								The KLO militants and leaders have lost their strength. They are now determined to return to the mainstream. The slogans raised against their own establishment are a sign of their state of mind, said a senior police official. These militants, an officer said, were close to the Ulfa. 																								After their training, they were required to do odd jobs for the Ulfa and senior KLO militants. They also worked in the farms near the headquarters and looked after the children staying there. Sometimes, they were also sent to patrol nearby areas, said Siddh Nath Gupta, the Jalpaiguri superintendent of police. 																								The 12 youths, produced in court today, were remanded in seven days police custody by subdivisional judicial magistrate of Jalpaiguri S.S. Bhatta. 																								Dipesh Roy, who had come to the court to see his cousin, one of the 12 rebels, said: Hriday left home three years ago after completing his HS examination. He told us he was going to look for a job. Since then, he never contacted us. A few days ago, the police told us he had been arrested in Bhutan. Dipesh did not tell his mother this morning where he was going.

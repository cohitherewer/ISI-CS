 Thursday, March 20, 2003 				 Keshpur arrest
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Midnapore, March 19: Police claimed to have thwarted another bloodbath at Keshpur before the panchayat polls with the arrest of Trinamul Congress leader Ajit Bhowmik yesterday. 																								He was one of the main organisers of the attempt last year by the party to take control of several villages in Keshpur. This time around, the plan being chalked out was the same, said West Midnapore police superintendent K.C. Meena. 																								Bhowmik was the leader of a motorcycle-borne hit squad accused of murdering a few CPM leaders. A recent letter seized from a Peoples War hideout showed that he was seeking trained men from among the Naxalites to oust the CPM.

 Friday, April 04, 2003 				 Couple murdered, hunt for motive amp; managers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Manteswar (Burdwan), April 3: Mystery shrouds the murder of a well-to-do, elderly childless couple, who was found gagged with sand and strangled to death, on their farm in Kusumgram village near here. 																								Dhruba Chaitra Rej, 64, and Chhabirani Rej, 55, owned a farm and a dairy. Chhabirani was a popular teacher of history at the Sati Krishnamani Girls High School here. Police are yet to fathom a motive but are on the lookout for two farm managers, who are absconding. 																								Police claimed that cash and valuables were found intact in the house, but a .38-bore revolver and a licensed firearm owned by Dhruba were missing. Investigators found the couples dinner lying untouched in one of the rooms.																								An employee Shantiranjan Das found the two bodies when he arrived early in the morning as always to tend to the cattle. Like every morning, I went to the cow shed to feed the animals at 6 am. I called out to kakima and when no one responded, I entered the shed and saw the lights on in the room where the two managers, Farookh and Chhotu Khan, used to spend the night. There I saw kakababu lying on the floor with his hands and legs tied with a thick rope, he said. 																								Das rushed out in panic and raised an alarm. Villagers trooped in and found Chhabiranis body, similarly tied, in the shed. Both had been gagged by stuffing sand in their mouths and then strangled. 																								After initial investigations, police said it seems that like every evening, Dhruba went to the cow shed, which also housed the familys ancestral deity, as his wife waited in the house across the courtyard with dinner. Chhabirani, it appears, went to look for him as he was not returning from his prayers and was also killed, said an officer at the spot. 																								We think the murders are a handiwork of the two missing managers, who came from Malda. My cousin always warned me not to mess with those two as they seemed dangerous. They worked in the farm during the monsoons and returned to Malda. They came back about five days ago, said Debesnath Rej, Dhrubas cousin. He said Dhrubas elder brother in Calcutta and younger sibling, who stays in Germany, have been informed.

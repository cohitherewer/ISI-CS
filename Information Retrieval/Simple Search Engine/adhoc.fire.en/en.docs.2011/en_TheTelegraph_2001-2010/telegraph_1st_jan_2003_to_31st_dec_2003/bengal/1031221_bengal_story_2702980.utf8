 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								Diamond Harbour, Dec. 20: The entire neighbourhood has taken up arms. But, for once, police dont seem to mind.																								In fact, they are the ones to have come up with the idea.																								The police in South 24-Parganas are helping set up local resistance groups  commonly known as RG party and sponsored by local businessmen  to deal with crime in the rural areas. This also helps stop villagers from committing crimes when they have no work.																								The programme has already been launched in the Diamond Harbour sub-division. Sub-divisional police officer Mehmood Akhtar said the idea was based on community policing.																								We want to make people confident and involve them more actively in maintenance of law and order. If we can successfully work it out, people will feel that policing does not mean beating up people, it also means working with the common man, Akhtar said.																								He added that a section of villagers usually engaged in criminal activities after the harvesting season.																								Our idea is to involve these people in guarding villages rather than arresting them after they have committed some crime, Akhtar said.																								The police officer said members of the local resistance groups were being provided with torches. 																								We also gave them caps sponsored by local businessmen, he added.																								Diamond Harbour has possibly drawn the greatest attention among the five sub-divisions of South 24-Parganas. It consists of eight police station areas: Diamond Harbour, Falta, Kulpi, Usthi, Mandirbazar, Mathurapur, Raidighi and Mograhat.																								Earlier, almost the entire area was known for criminal activities. Mograhat had earned a bad reputation because of Selim, who is now in jail. Its former MLA, Abul Basar, was also arrested for alleged involvement in a murder case. The worst of the lot was Mathurapur, where a series of dacoities took place. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself visited the area.																								However, with the government talking several measures, the crime rate has come down. The number of robberies this year has come down to seven from 14 in 2000, while incidents of theft have fallen to 30 from 159.																								We have also convicted a number of criminals who were involved in robberies, Akhtar said. He rated the convictions of Khairul Mollah, Sahamed Haldar and Rehan Sardar, who were involved in a bus dacoity in 2001 in Kulpi, as the most important. All three were sentenced to ten years imprisonment. This conviction has definitely sent messages to his gang members, the police officer added.																								The idea to form RG parties is to let people know that the role of police is not to terrorise the common man. But at the same time, we want to let the community believe that police will not be lenient to criminals, and the communitys support is necessary to achieve our goal, he said.

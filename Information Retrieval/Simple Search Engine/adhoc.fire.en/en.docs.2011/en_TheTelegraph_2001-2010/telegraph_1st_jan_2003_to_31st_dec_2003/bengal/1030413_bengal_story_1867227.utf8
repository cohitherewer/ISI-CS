The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, April 13, 2003 				 Polio campaign
																								Calcutta, April 12: The state health department has come down heavily on officials for a disastrous pulse-polio campaign on April 6, says a staff reporter.																								Immunisation fell well short of the target set for the programme. Many polio cases have been reported from the state, including three from the city, in the past 12 months. Nearly 4 to 5 per cent of the children below five years could not be immunised.																								Health services director Prabhakar Chatterjee convened an emergency meeting today to plug all loopholes before the next pulse-polio campaign on June 1.

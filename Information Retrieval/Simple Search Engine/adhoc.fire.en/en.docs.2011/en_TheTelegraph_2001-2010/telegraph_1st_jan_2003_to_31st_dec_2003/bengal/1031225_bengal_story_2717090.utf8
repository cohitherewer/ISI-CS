 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 New tax for Sagar pilgrims
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 24: For the first time, pilgrims travelling to the Ganga Sagar mela will have to pay a separate tax for staying on the mela premises in addition to the existing pilgrim tax of Rs 5 per person. The mela will be held from January 12 to 15.																								The South 24-Parganas district administration has decided to impose the new tax to meet part of the expenses incurred to organise the mela every year.																								District magistrate Vivek Kumar said the additional revenue will help tide over the financial crisis. It is likely that a pilgrim will have to pay Rs 5 per person. Besides, pilgrims travelling to the mela in a car will have to pay a special fee of Rs 150 to Rs 200 per day. We will take a decision in this regard within a day or two, he said. Murder arrest																								Police arrested Sheikh Akhtar, a criminal from the Entally area, on Wednesday night for killing Gopia of Tangra.																								It was alleged that on November 22, Akhtar had shot Gopia from close range and then hacked his body with a sharp weapon. Akhtar has confessed to the crime.

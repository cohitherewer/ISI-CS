Students of the college will finally be able to observe the birthday of Bethune  the man their institution is named after  from next year.																								After extensive research, the college authorities today said it has been concluded that Bethune was born on July 12, 1801.

The college souvenir, released by Governor Viren J. Shah at a programme organised to launch the institutions 125th anniversary celebrations, announced Bethunes birthday. 																								The first college for girls in India, Bethune College was set up in 1879 as a continuation of the school founded by Bethune in 1849.

A team of college teachers initiated a research last year to trace the date of birth of Bethune.

We are happy that we have been able to confirm the date of birth of Bethune, said Uttara Chakraborty, an assistant professor of history and a driving force in the research. 																								The state archives, Bethunes will, libraries of universities across India, England and Scotland and the Internet were the prime sources of information in the date hunt. Chakraborty said the descendants of Bethune in Scotland were also contacted.																								The Trinity College, Cambridge, has confirmed the date is correct, said Chakraborty.																								Bethune died in 1851, two years after he established Bethune School.

 Thursday, October 09, 2003 				 Mishra raps tests malaise
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Suri (Birbhum), Oct. 8: Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra today unveiled a CT scan unit here with a word of advice to doctors against overuse of the modern diagnostic methods. 																								He complained that nowadays many doctors abuse their position by forcing helpless patients into heavy expenditure by ordering various unnecessary medical tests. 																								These days, patients are too often asked to undergo USG (ultrasonography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests. I want doctors to discourage such tests. Instead, they should be careful about diagnosis, said the minister. 																								After inaugurating the joint venture scan unit here, about 150 km from Calcutta, he said a central grant of Rs 100 crore would be used to purchase modern equipment for the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta. 																								The Union joint health secretary announced yesterday that the Centre would provide the grant for upgrade of the medical college on a par with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. During her recent visit to Calcutta, Union health minister Sushma Swaraj had promised the funds. 																								I do not know whether there will be any condition on spending the amount. If the fund is sanctioned, we will try to utilise it for upgradation of the medical college, Mishra said.

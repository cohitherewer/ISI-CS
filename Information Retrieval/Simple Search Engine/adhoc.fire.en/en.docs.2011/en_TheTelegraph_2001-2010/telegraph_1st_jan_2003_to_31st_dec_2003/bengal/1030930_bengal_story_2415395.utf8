 Tuesday, September 30, 2003 				 Suspension of work in Howrah jute mill
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 29: More than 4,000 workers of a jute-mill in Howrah were rendered jobless days before the Puja after the management put up a suspension of work notice today. 																								The managements move at Ladlo Jute Mill in Sankrail, about 30 km from here, follows a string of workers protests demanding festival bonus. A settlement was likely today but the workers said the mill was shut down without prior notice. 																								Policemen have been deployed to ward off trouble in the area, tense after the closure. 																								Howrah district magistrate S. Kishore said several unions had joined in a protest against irregular salary and non-payment of bonus at the loss-making mill.

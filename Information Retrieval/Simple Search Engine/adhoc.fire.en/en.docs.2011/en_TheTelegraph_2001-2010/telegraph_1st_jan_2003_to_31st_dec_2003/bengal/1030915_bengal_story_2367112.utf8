 							 - DYFI member admits to plotting Trinamul leaders murder OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, Sept. 14: Nadia police today claimed to have got to the bottom of the murder of Trinamul Congress leader Samir Nag with the arrest of a member of the youth wing of the CPM. 																								The police said Rajat Kanti Ghosh, a DYFI member who was arrested on Thursday, and two others, Gosai Das and Gopal Roy, who were picked up last night, were named in the FIR. 																								Ghosh was nabbed from Gopal Nagar in North 24-Parganas, the other two were arrested in Shantipur, 110 km from Calcutta.																								The police said the trio was the prime accused in the murder of Nag. Two others named in the FIR  a CPM local committee secretary in Bishnupur, Chakdah, and a committee member  are still at large.																								District superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty said those rounded up have confessed to hatching the murder plot. He added that the killing was a result of rivalry between two gangs. Nag used to control one of them.																								Nag, the block president of Trinamul in Chakdah, 85 km from Calcutta, was shot dead on the evening of September 8 on his way home from a party meeting. 																								As news of the murder spread, Trinamul supporters went on the rampage setting ablaze two CPM offices, a library and 30 houses. Party chief Mamata Banerjee had rushed to Chakdah from Delhi a day after being sworn in Union minister without portfolio and held the CPM responsible for Nags murder. 																								Local Trinamul leaders had said the CPM was unhappy about the soaring popularity of Nag, who was the panchayat chief of Dubra and said to be running an NGO. CPM leaders had claimed that Nag was at the helm of a gang and was killed as a result of gang rivalry. 																								The district police chief said there was no evidence that the murder was political. Chakraborty said a special team led by additional superintendent Pallab Kanti Ghosh found that the murder was to settle a score against Nag. 																								Ghosh and his men were in constant threat from the Trinamul leader, he added.																								CPMs zonal committee secretary Amal Bhowmick admitted that Ghosh was a whole-hearted party supporter. He could not recall whether he was a DYFI member. 																								District CPM secretary Ashu Ghosh said it was not possible to find out one name among thousands of party members. He did not deny that Ghosh was a local party leader. We will have to find out whether he is a member of our party, said Ashu Ghosh. 																								DYFIs state vice-president and MP Alakesh Das said: I cannot recall the name (Rajat). He claimed that the two local committee members named in the FIR were innocent.																								Trinamul leaders said the CPM is trying to disown Ghosh. It is natural that they will disown an activist when he has figured on the list of criminals. We saw the same thing happen after the Dhantola loot-and-rape incident, in which party members and a panchayat pradhan were accused, said Mukul Roy, a Trinamul general secretary.

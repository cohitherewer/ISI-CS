The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, June 07, 2003 				 Rivals count on sympathy wave in twin bypolls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, June 6: After suffering a rout in the panchayat poll, Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress is faced with another electoral showdown, with arch rival CPM. 																								In the twin bypolls on Sunday  for the Nabadwip Lok Sabha seat in Nadia and the Vidyasagar Assembly constituency in Calcutta  sympathy waves seem to be playing the most crucial roles. 																								In Vidyasagar, which fell vacant following CPM legislator and Left Front chief whip Lakshmi Des death, CPM nominee Anadi Sahu has been carrying Des portrait at election meetings and seeking the peoples mandate to complete our late party leaders unfinished agenda. 																								In Nabadwip, where the bypoll was necessitated by Trinamul MP Ananda Mohan Biswas heart attack aboard Rajdhani Express, Mamata Banerjee has been carrying out the campaign in the same vein, urging voters to ensure the victory of Abir Biswas, the late MPs son, to help him finish the latters work.																								Both the seats will witness triangular contests with the CPM, the Congress and the Trinamul-BJP combine fighting each other.																								Buoyed by its performance in the rural poll, the Congress is sparing no effort to win Vidyasagar. By the look of it, at least, suspended Trinamul MP Ajit Panjas daughter Mahua Mondal, who is fighting on a Congress ticket, is ahead of Trinamul-backed BJP candidate Ashok Sinha in organisation and electioneering. 																								However, in Nabadwip, Mamata sees a chance. Though the triangular contest has given the CPM much to hope for, Abir Biswas is aiming to ride the crest of a sympathy surge.

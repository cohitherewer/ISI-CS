 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 26: Author Bimal Kar died today at his Salt Lake residence following protracted illness. He was 83 and left behind his wife, son and three daughters.																								Born in Taki, North 24-Parganas, on September 19, 1921, Kar spent his early youth in Asansol and parts of Bihar. He was involved in myriad professions that later helped him write on varied subjects. His first short story, Bara Saheber Meye, was published in literary magazine Desh in 1952. He served as the editor of Parag, another literary magazine, between 1946 and 1952 and worked as a sub-editor in a Bengali daily for a few years. 																								From 1954 to 1982, he was associated with Desh where his novel Grahan was published in 1964. Asamay, also published in Desh, won him the Akademi award.																								Kars other works include novels like Dewal, Purna Apurna, Jadubansa and Balika Badhu. He introduced a new trend in Bengali short stories with his lucid language. He could win over the heart of the average reader of Bengali literature with his ability to craft characters and the fine art of storytelling. Many of his novels were made into films.																								A pall of gloom descended on literary circles as the news of Kars death spread. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee expressed grief. 																								He played a very important role in the sphere of Bengali novels and short stories. His writings reflected a modern mind and inspired many young writers, said Bhattacharjee.																								Kar won the Ananda Puraskar in 1967 and the Saratchandra award from Calcutta University in 1981, among other honours.

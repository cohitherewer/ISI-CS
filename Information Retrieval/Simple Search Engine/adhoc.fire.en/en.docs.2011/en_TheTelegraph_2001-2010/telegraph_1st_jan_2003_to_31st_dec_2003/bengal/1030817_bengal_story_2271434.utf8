 Sunday, August 17, 2003 				 Sulphur bars seized, tribals held
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Siliguri, Aug. 16: Police officials are probing how two tribal youths were found with about 40 kg of highly-refined sulphur bars, the kind that can be used effectively with other ingredients to devise crude, but powerful explosives.																								The youths were arrested from Naxalbari last night after an informer tipped off police that the duo had brought in two large packets from the jungle.																								Sanichar Murmu, 30, alias Moila and Appan Mardia, 35, alias Bangalee told police they had discovered the packets in the forests near Kakarvitta on the Indo-Nepal border.																								Senior police officers believe that the sulphur bars were meant to be handed over to local militants for preparing explosives. Initially the arrested duo told us that they were planning to sell off the bars. We are exploring all angles, including the youths connections with extremist outfits, if any, said Siliguri additional superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra.																								Although Murmu and Mardia have claimed that they brought the unclaimed packets home out of curiosity, police have refused to buy the logic. Chances are high that the two could be maintaining clandestine links with underground anti-national groups, said a senior officer of Naxalbari police station.

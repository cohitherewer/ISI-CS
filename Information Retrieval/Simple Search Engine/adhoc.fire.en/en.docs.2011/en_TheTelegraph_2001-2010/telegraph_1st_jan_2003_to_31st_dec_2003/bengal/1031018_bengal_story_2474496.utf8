The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, October 18, 2003 				 Police issue Ayodhya alert
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Oct. 17: Police  have sounded an alert across the state to prevent any untoward  incident in the wake of the developments in Ayodhya. 																								Whatever the situation there (in Ayodhya), peace must prevail here. We have to keep a constant watch so that there is no unrest in the state, said deputy inspector-general Narayan Ghosh. 																								About 3,000 kar sevaks on way to the temple town in Uttar Pradesh have been detained in the past four days from railway stations at Sealdah, Burdwan, Kharagpur, Malda and Asansol. The police said they have all been sent back home. 																								Though the kar sevaks here do not have much of a presence, we are not taking chances. We are in touch with the Uttar Pradesh government to prevent any adverse impact of Ayodhya on the states law and order situation, said Ghosh.																								A Vishwa Hindu Parishad spokesman, however, claimed tonight that thousands of kar sevaks from Bengal have already made it to Ayodhya.

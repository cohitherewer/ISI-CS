 Tuesday, July 15, 2003 				 Police thrash 55-yr woman and father 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, July 14: A sub-inspector here has been accused of beating up 55-year-old Mayarani Ghosh and her 95-year-old father.																								Her son Prasanta said he was at a relatives place when police raided his home at Kadamati, about 210 km from Calcutta, late last night. 																								My mother had to be admitted to hospital. She was beaten by a police team led by town inspector Sandip Sen. I will file a complaint in court tomorrow, said Prasanta. He has already sent a letter of complaint to the superintendent of police.																								It was past midnight when the police knocked on the door and asked for my son. As soon as I opened the door they set upon me with lathis, hitting me on my waist and legs. When I fell on the floor, they kicked me. They were smelling of liquor and were abusive, said Mayarani, from her bed in the Behrampore General Hospital.																								Prasanta said the police probably wanted to recover his dues to the land department.

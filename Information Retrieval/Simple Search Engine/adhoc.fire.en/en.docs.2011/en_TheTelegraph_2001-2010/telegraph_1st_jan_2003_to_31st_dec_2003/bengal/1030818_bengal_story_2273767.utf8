 Monday, August 18, 2003 				 Doctor slaps father
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Midnapore, Aug. 17: A father  was beaten up by a government doctor for pleading that his  four-year-old girl could not be admitted to a nursing home  as he would not be able to bear the expense. 																								Manas Ghorai went to the chamber of Bijan Kumar Bhaduri, a child specialist at Ghatal Sub-divisional Hospital in West Midnapore, on Friday. After examining Smritikana, Bhaduri advised blood and urine tests.																								Ghorai, a daily wager from Soai village, went to Bhaduris chamber the next day with the test reports. He asked me to get Smritikana admitted to a nursing home. But it was impossible for me and I told him so, Ghorai said.																								Bhaduri told the father he could not treat his child if she was not admitted to the nursing home. I told him to write his observations on the clinical test reports, said Ghorai. I also told him that I would admit my daughter to the sub-divisional hospital under the supervision of another child specialist. Bhaduri turned furious. He slapped me, used filthy language and shoved me out of the chamber, Ghorai recalled.																								Ghorai went straight to the Ghatal police station. He also complained to the superintendent of the sub-divisional hospital. 																								An official at the hospital said Bhaduri went on leave yesterday. We will ask him to submit a written report after he rejoins. The districts chief medical officer said an inquiry will be initiated.

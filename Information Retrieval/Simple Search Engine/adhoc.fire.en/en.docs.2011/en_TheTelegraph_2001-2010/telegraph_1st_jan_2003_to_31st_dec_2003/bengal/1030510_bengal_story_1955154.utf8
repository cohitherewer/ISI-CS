 Saturday, May 10, 2003 				 Fingers at police in girls assault
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Midnapore, May 9: A team  from the National Commission for Women went to Omrapota  village in Goaltore today to probe the alleged rape of five  teenagers after a looting incident and returned dissatisfied  about the role of police and the administration.																								The delegation pledged to return to the village on Saturday as the administration failed to arrange their meeting with all the alleged victims. The panel members only heard the horror tale of one of the girls.																								A vehicle carrying marriage revellers was intercepted by a gang of looters on the night of April 26 and five girls were singled out, dragged to an adjoining forest and tortured. The other passengers, who were forced to leave, raised alarm on reaching the nearest village. They took about two hours to trace four of the girls. The other was later found tied to a tree. 																								If we cannot meet the other victims on Saturday, the police will be asked to produce the girls before the commission in Delhi, the panel members said.																								At a news conference, the delegation of Nasisa Hussain, Gouri Sen, Kalyanmoi Ganguly and Jalil Ahmed expressed unhappiness with the roles of the police and the administration.																								They asked why the police had sent the girls for medical examination 80 hours after the incident. They also raised questions on why no lady officer was sent to probe the case. 																								After looking at the medical report, we cannot call it a case of rape but it can be concluded beyond doubt that those minor girls were severely molested by the miscreants that night, said Hussain.

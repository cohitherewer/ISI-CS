 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 Hooghly ammo stolen on ordnance transit 
 OUR BUREAU																								Dec. 26: The arms and ammunition seized from Hooghly on Wednesday were manufactured in ordnance factories and stolen in transit, police said today.																								Army officers examined the cache, which included 5,000 rounds of ammunition, grenade shells, carbines and landmines. 																								All the arms and ammunition seized from Baidyabati and Amarpur were manufactured in the ordnance factories of our country, said inspector-general of police, headquarters, Narayan Ghosh. 																								A part of the consignment, including sophisticated arms, was sent to areas infested by Naxalite factions in Bengal and Jharkhand before police could carry out the raids, he added. 																								A police officer said the consignment that has already reached the Naxalites may be used to target them. 																								The police have launched a manhunt for Ajit Mandal alias Dulal, from whose rented house in Baidyabati most of the arms were recovered. Initially, we found two different names  Ajit and Dulal. But during interrogation, Mandals wife said his real name is Dulal, said Ghosh. A police team has left for Orissa to track him down. 																								A photograph of the fugitive from his family album is now with the police. Copies of it have been sent to Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore. 																								Mandal left his family 12 years ago and joined the CPI(ML)s Liberation Front, an ultra-Left faction. He is an active member of the organisations Bankura unit, said an intelligence branch official.																								The police have detained a woman who lived with Mandal. She said she used to accompany him to Orissa, Assam and districts across the state where the Naxalites are active. Mandal would ask her to hand over bags to people whom she never saw before. But she claimed that she did not know what the bags contained, said an officer.																								An officer of the armys intelligence wing said the grenades were manufactured at the Kirki ordnance factory in Pune in 1996. The thread portion of the grenade-shells suggests that it cannot be manufactured in a private unit, he added. The carbines are also sophisticated. 																								Mandal had rented a room at Hooghlys Serampore five years ago. Jhantu Saha, the landlord, said: He had claimed to be a businessman and bought a second-hand Maruti van. There were a number of trunks in his room.

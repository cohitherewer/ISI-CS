 OUR CORRESPONDENT Kultali (South 24-Parganas)  July 10: Banmali Pradhan was arrested today for throttling  his five-day daughter from his third wife. 																								The 45-year-old man from Purba Gurguri village here, about 120 km from Calcutta, has two adult daughters from his previous marriages.																								Police said Pradhan married for a third time last year because he was desperate for a son. He had got his two daughters married to local youths earlier. He was crestfallen when his wife Amala gave birth to a girl child on Saturday. 																								Last night, when his wife was fast asleep, Pradhan took away the child from her side and strangled her. He then buried her outside the house.																								On seeing the child missing, Amala raised an alarm this morning. Members of the family, including the father, mounted a search.																								Some of them contacted a leader of the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti, the womens wing of the CPM, here. Pradhan broke down and confessed to the murder while facing questions from her. I had expected a boy, said Pradhan. 																								We were horrified, said Arati Kayal of the samity. She said he sounded unrepentant.																								He thought that he would gain powers by the act and would be able to sire a male child, she added.

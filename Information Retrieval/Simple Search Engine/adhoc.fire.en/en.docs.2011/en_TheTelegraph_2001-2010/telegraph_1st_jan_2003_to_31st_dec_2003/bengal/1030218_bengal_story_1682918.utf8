 Tuesday, February 18, 2003 				 Looters pick on police
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, Feb. 17: Policemen travelling in a jeep in the Jamboni police station area of West Midnapore had to open fire when a gang tried to loot their arms late last night.																								The gang had blocked the road on a forest stretch in the Kusboni-Barsole area. 																								The police said they were fired at first. When they retaliated, Dulal Sabar, 25, was hit on the leg. The gang shot arrows and continued firing from behind the cover of trees. The police claimed that only a single round was fired but sources said the exchange went on for some time.																								Sub-inspector Samir Bhuin and a constable suffered arrow wounds. Dulal was admitted to the district hospital. On February 4, a team from the district intelligence branch was attacked. The police, however, ruled out the involvement of Naxalites.

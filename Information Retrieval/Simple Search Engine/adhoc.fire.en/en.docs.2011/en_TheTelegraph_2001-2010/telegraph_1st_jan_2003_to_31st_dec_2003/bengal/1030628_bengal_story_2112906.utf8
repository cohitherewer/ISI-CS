The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, June 28, 2003 				 Students pay price for school not paying up 
 MITA MUKHERJEE Calcutta, June 27: A month  after the publication of their results, the Class X CBSE  examinees of the Sainik School here do not know what lies  ahead. They are yet to receive marksheets and their admission  to higher secondary institutions hangs on hope.																								A default of Rs 300 on the part of the school has cost 47 students dear.																								With no information coming in from the Central Board of Secondary Educations regional headquarters in Allahabad, the school authorities got in touch with it. The reason for withholding the marksheets, the board said, was that the school had not paid the late fees for sending the forms of six candidates after the due date.																								School sources said the examination fees had been paid in full for all the candidates. But the forms and papers of six of them were sent late for various reasons. 																								Principal of the school Commander Anand Yadnik said over phone he has sent an emissary with Rs 300 after learning about the dues. The marksheets would arrive at the school by Monday, he added.																								But the delay in releasing the marksheets has taken its toll of the students. 																								Though most students know the marks they have scored, thanks to the Internet, many of them have yet to be admitted to Class XI. 																								Admissions to the higher secondary courses are cleared only after the students produce their marksheets. Many of the students had sought admissions to other institutions and were refused.																								My son may lose a year if his marksheet does not arrive by Monday, said a parent of a student who had applied for admission to a central school in Calcutta.																								We are extremely concerned over the inconvenience caused to the students. We had contacted the authorities at the CBSE offices in Allahabad and Delhi several times. They have now given us an assurance that the marksheets will be sent as soon as the dues are cleared, said Yadnik.																								Though we got in touch with the CBSE officials several times during the past month, only in the beginning of this week we were told over telephone that an amount of Rs 300 on account of late fees was due to them, Yadnik added. 																								No CBSE official was available for comment at the boards office in Allahabad.

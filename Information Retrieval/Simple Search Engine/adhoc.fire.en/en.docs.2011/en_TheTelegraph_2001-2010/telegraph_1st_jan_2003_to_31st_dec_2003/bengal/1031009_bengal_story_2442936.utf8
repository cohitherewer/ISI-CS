The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, October 09, 2003 				 Govt plans rally challenge earlier
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Oct. 8: The state government today received a certified copy of the order passed by Justice Amitava Lala of Calcutta High Court on September 29 banning rallies on city roads on working days between 8 am to 8 pm. A copy of the judgment has been sent to the city police headquarters at Lalbazar. 																								On receiving the copy, the government unveiled its plan to file a fresh application before the vacation bench of the high court on October 13 for a stay on Justice Lalas order. 																								During the day, Tarun Roy, advocate-general of Tripura, moved the division bench of Justice Aloke Chakraborty and Justice Subhrakamal Mukherjee, saying the government was yet to receive the judgments copy. 																								He told the court that different political parties and trade unions in the state were putting pressure on the government to challenge the order before a higher bench of the high court. 																								After hearing Roys plea, the judges told him they had already directed the registrar of the court to hand over a copy of the judgment to the advocate-on-record, Ashim Chatterjee. 																								Later, Roy informed the bench they had received the copy of the order from the office of the registrar general and he had sent it to Balai Ray, the Bengal advocate-general. 																								Earlier it was decided that the government would move the higher bench only after the reopening of the court after the Puja vacation on October 28. But the situation is very grave and we are planning to change our strategy and make a fresh move before the vacation bench on October 13, Roy said. 																								A meeting of senior legal personalities of the state government with law minister Nisith Adhikari would be held within a couple of days to discuss the future course of action, he added. 																								When contacted, Balai Ray refused to comment on the development.																								However, chief secretary Sourin Roy said he had received a copy of Justice Lalas order. Tomorrow is a holiday on account of Lakshmi puja. So we shall discuss the implications of the order on Friday, he said. 																								Two separate petitions were moved before the division bench  one by Idris Ali on behalf the All India Minority Forum and the other by advocate Kallol Guha Thakurta  demanding contempt proceedings against Left Front chairman Biman Basu for his alleged personal attack on Justice Lala. 																								The bench directed the petitioners to make written applications and said the petitions would be heard by the vacation bench on October 13.

 Monday, September 08, 2003 				 Taste of Angur twists Tiger tale
 SOUMI BHATTACHARYA  Suri, Sept. 7: Angur Khan  is Angur Khan, not Tiger Singh. 																								Polices claim that the real name of Tiger, who shot a person after a hostage drama in Suri hospital on Wednesday night, is Angur fell flat today when a raid on Bikrampur village in Jharkhand led to the arrest of Khan. 																								He was brought to Suri and is now being interrogated.																								Investigators digging into the background of Tiger were more confused than before after todays find. Tiger had said he was from Dharampur near Asansol in Burdwan but residents there had said that they never heard about him.																								Tiger had said he killed Sadananda Mondal in the hospital to avenge his fathers death. The police began looking for Khan after investigations revealed that the story of revenge was similar to Khans. The police detained Khan today to find out if there was any link between him and Tiger.																								The police are gradually shifting focus from the coal mafia to the iron smuggling rackets in Asansol. They think Sadananda, an Eastern Coalfields Limited employee, could be linked to the iron smugglers as well. 																								A senior police officer said Tiger could be a trained killer hired by the iron mafia. May be he owed them big money. Tiger may have come to the hospital to take him out to those looking for him but could not as the police arrived, he added. 																								A police team again questioned Tiger at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital today. 																								A bomb squad team checked the explosives that Tiger had strapped around his hostages at the Suri hospital.

 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 Teacher held for role in fake note ring
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Jan. 10: A schoolteacher from Birbhum has been arrested on charges of dealing in fake currency notes. 																								Earlier, the Border Security Force held two persons from a village close to the India-Bangladesh border and handed them over to the police. 																								The BSFs intelligence wing had received a tip-off that Raghunath Das from Sagardihi and Alim Shiekh, a trader from Dhulian, would be coming to Ramnagar village in Murshidabad district to collect the fake notes that were to arrive from Bangladesh in exchange for goods from India.																								While Das and Sheikh were arrested after the transaction, the person who carried the fake notes from Bangladesh managed to escape.																								During interrogation, the duo revealed that the schoolteacher was the kingpin of the racket. 																								We sent a police team to Mohammad Rezauls house at Bhadisar village and picked him up last night, district superintendent of police Virendra said. All the fake note deals were carried out in his house, he added.																								Fake notes, of Rs 100 and 500 denomination, amounting to Rs 68,000, were recovered from the teacher, who also faces charges of manufacturing and supplying counterfeit currency.																								The ISI has been using Bangladesh as a conduit to bring in these fake currency notes into India in order to hurt the countrys economy, said an officer of the district intelligence branch.

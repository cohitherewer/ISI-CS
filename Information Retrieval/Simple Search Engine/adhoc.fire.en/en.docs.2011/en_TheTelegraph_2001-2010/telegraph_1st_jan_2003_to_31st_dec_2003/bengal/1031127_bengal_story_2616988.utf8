 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 After widow witness, life for murderers 
 RABI BANERJEE																								Krishnagar (Nadia), Nov. 26: Four people who tried to mislead the district police after a murder found themselves behind bars for the crime following a widows account of the actual incident. 																								Bidyut Chakraborty, Jiban Krishna Biswas, Sukhen Chakraborty and Bikash Chakraborty were found guilty of murdering Bapi Bagchi, a hawker, in 1999. District sessions judge S.K. Halder sentenced them to life imprisonment. The convicts will also have to pay fines of Rs 4,000 each. 																								Police said Bidyut and Jiban beat Bapi to death with the help of Sukhen and Bikash, two nightguards posted at Mahisbathan market. Initially, none of the four was accused of the murder. Bidyut and Jiban told police that Bapi was lynched by an angry mob when he tried to steal goods from the market at midnight on April 29, 1999. 																								The duo spun a tale to distract the police. But septuagenarian Shyama Dashi Ghosh spoilt the case for them. 																								Ghosh was on the roof of her house near the market, waiting for her daughter and son-in-law to return. She saw the two night guards and two other persons intercepting Bapi in front of her house. The four of them, she said, tied up Bapi and killed him. The widow also said the killers scratched their hands with blades to show the injuries to claim that they were attacked first, said circle inspector of Karimpore Nirmal Mukherjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, March 28, 2003 				 Two-day trade bandh 
																								Calcutta, March 27: The Federation of West Bengal Trade Associations has called a two-day trade bandh in the state from March 31 in protest against imposition of Value Added Tax (VAT). It coincides with the all-India trade bandh called by the Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal, of which the federation is a partner, says a staff reporter. 																								 A federation member said finance minister Asim Dasgupta has called them for a meeting tomorrow, but they were determined on the strike unless the government withdraws VAT. It is surprising that a number of states are not imposing VAT but West Bengal has taken the decision to implement it. How this will be done is not clear, he complained.

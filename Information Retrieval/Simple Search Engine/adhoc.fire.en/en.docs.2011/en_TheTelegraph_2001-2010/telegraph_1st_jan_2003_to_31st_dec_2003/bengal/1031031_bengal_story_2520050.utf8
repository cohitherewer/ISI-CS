The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, October 31, 2003 				 Biman potshot in judge town
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mohammad Bazar (Birbhum), Oct. 30: Left Front chairman Biman Bose today again criticised Justice Amitava Lala  this time in the home district of the judge who had passed the ruling restricting rallies in Calcutta  but without naming him.																								The CPM politburo members comments come as a jolt at a time when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has unveiled draft proposals on a rally code in Calcutta, which stop short of Lalas order restricting rallies during working hours on weekdays.																								With a view to satisfy the capitalist system of the society one after another unwanted verdicts are being given. A judge was delayed by a rally of tribals in Calcutta and soon after the high court ordered a ban on rallies, said Bose at a rally today.																								I have never asked Lala to leave Bengal. But, perhaps a section of the people said it. If court verdicts evoke such sharp reaction, the common man will lose confidence in the judiciary.

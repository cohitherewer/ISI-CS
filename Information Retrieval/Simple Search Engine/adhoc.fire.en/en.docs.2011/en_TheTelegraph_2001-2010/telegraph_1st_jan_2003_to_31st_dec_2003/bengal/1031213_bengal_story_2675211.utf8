 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Twin cases send cops rushing to Andhra
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kharagpur, Dec 12: Rafique Hussain, a businessman here, was picked up by Andhra Pradesh police a fortnight ago in connection with a cheating case. His mother and two others who went to the state on December 6 to see him in custody went missing. 																								A dozen policemen from here left for Andhra yesterday to inquire into the twin cases. 																								Additional superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the Andhra police did not take us into confidence about Rafiques arrest. We came to know about it only when his parents arrived at my office, Verma said.																								Rafiques father Mehedi Hussain learnt later that a case of cheating was pending against him in a Rajahmundri court. Suspecting the hand of his business rivals, the parents decided to fight the case.																								Rajanurnisa Bibi, lawyer Pradip Neogi and Ramna Rao, a neighbour originally from Andhra, went to Rajahmundri. The residents of Bhabanipur were reportedly kidnapped there and the abductors demanded Rs 5 lakh as the price of Rafiques release. 																								I talked to my wife over phone on December 6, but lost all contact with her and the two others from the next day. Since Monday, I have been receiving calls demanding money. If I fail to pay up, the caller said all of them will be killed, Mehedi told the police.																								Rafique, the only bread-earner of the family, used to purchase onions in bulk from Andhra Pradesh and sell them here.

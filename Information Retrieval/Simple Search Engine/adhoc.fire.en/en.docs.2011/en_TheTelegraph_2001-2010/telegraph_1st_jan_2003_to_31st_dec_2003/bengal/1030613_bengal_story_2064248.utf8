 Friday, June 13, 2003 				 CID files doctor death charges
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 12: The CID submitted a chargesheet today against seven persons allegedly involved in the murder of surgeon Chandan Sen.																								The sleuths took 87 days to wrap up probe into the murder of the general surgeon of Ranaghat Subdivisional Hospital. 																								Two of those charged today were a doctor couple, said deputy inspector-general of the CID Raj Kanojia. The officers investigating the case have already arrested six of those chargesheeted and booked them under three charges, including murder with common intention.																								A key accused, whose name we have mentioned in the chargesheet, is absconding, Kanojia added. Rehman Alam, a senior doctor in the hospital, has so far managed to give the slip. 																								The motive behind the assassination was clear to the investigators. Professional rivalry and misappropriation of hospital funds led to the incident, says the chargesheet. 																								On the evening of February 26, Sen had gone to the house of Sunil Ganguly, the retired head clerk of his hospital, to attend a dinner. According to statements made by the arrested six, Sen went missing after dinner. A packet of cigarettes, they said, led them to a pond near Gangulys house. Sens body was in the middle of it, under ankle-deep water.																								It was initially passed off as a death from drowning after heart attack. The CID was given charge of the investigation after the unnatural demise became public. 																								The post-mortem report pointed out that he died of asphyxiation and not a heart attack as declared by the police. The CID first arrested ENT specialist of the hospital Subharanjan Khara, his wife Arundhati, a doctor in Kalyani, and Gangulys son Gautam. Social welfare officer of the hospital Apurba Sanyal, Ganguly and Alams driver Abbas Ali Karigar were picked up later.

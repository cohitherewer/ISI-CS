 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Jan. 25: Murshidabad municipality chairman Biswajit Dhar is on the run after non-bailable charges were filed against him for allegedly assaulting an official of the commercial tax department.																								The official has filed a complaint at Murshidabad police station on January 23 that Dhar and another trader had assaulted him while he was on duty, said district magistrate Manoj Panth.																								Manik Mondal was assaulted by Dhar and the trader, Tapas Modak, alleged the complaint.																								However, Dhar told The Telegraph over phone that the charges were filed with political motives. CPM and Forward Bloc leaders are trying to remove me from the municipality, claimed Dhar, a Congress member.																								On January 22, Mondal and another tax official had demanded to see the stock list of Modaks shop. The trader asked to see the identity cards of the officials, the chairman said.																								As the two could not produce any identification, traders confined them thinking they were frauds, Dhar said.

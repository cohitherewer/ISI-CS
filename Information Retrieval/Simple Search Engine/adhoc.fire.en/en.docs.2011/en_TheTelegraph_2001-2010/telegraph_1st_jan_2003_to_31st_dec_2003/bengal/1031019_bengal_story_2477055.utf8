 Sunday, October 19, 2003 				 Mystery murders
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Habra (North 24-Parganas), Oct. 18: The bodies of two unidentified persons in their late twenties were found in a playground beside the government-run destitute home at Banipur, about 50 km from Calcutta, this morning.																								Police investigations revealed that a gang of miscreants first murdered the duo, then shot at another person at Ashokenagar station and finally threw a fourth person out of a train compartment at the same station. The two injured are battling for life at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta.																								As the news spread, residents blocked the tracks for over an hour between 12.35 pm and 1.40 pm demanding immediate arrest of the culprits. As a result, train services between Barasat and Bongaon stations of Eastern Railway were affected.																								Although senior officials are clueless about the motive behind the murders, sources said all four might be the victims of a long-standing feud among drug peddlers in the area.																								While the dead duo remained unidentified till late tonight, the two others have been identified as Gopal alias Bocha and Sujit.																								Gopal bore bullet injuries in his stomach and neck while Sujit was injured in the head.																								We have come to know that the miscreants had chased all four from a common location and fired at them near the field. While the two died on the spot, two others managed to flee to Ashokenagar railway station, said M. Dasgupta, officer-in-charge of Habra police station. 																								According to police, Gopal is a drug addict and also deals in heroine.  Recently he came out from the jail after serving a short term on charges of drug peddling. When contacted, Basudeb Bag, district police superintendent, refused to comment on the incident.																								Railway officials said two passenger trains had to be detained for half an hour en route due to the blockade. However, train services became normal when the blockade was lifted.

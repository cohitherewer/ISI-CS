 Sunday, July 13, 2003 				 CM against troops to Iraq
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 12: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said he had urged deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani not to send Indian troops to Iraq.																								I dont know whether the Centre is really sending our soldiers to Iraq. I wanted to know from him (Advani) during his visit to Calcutta last week about the Centres strategy. But he did not specify anything and just listened to me. However, I requested him to give up the idea, Bhattacharjee said at a convention organised by the Left Front to oppose the Centres move to despatch Indian troops to Iraq. The convention was held at the Centenary Hall of Calcutta University.																								Bhattacharjee said he had told Advani that communists would never support the Centre on sending troops to Iraq.

 Wednesday, January 08, 2003 				 Furore over railway recruitment
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purulia, Jan. 7: South-Eastern Railway employees associations of the Adra division have alleged that the procedures being employed in filling up 1,100 vacant posts are faulty and biased.																								The employees have been joined by thousands of candidates who responded to advertisements for the vacancies in the agitation that began in November. 																								The railway intended to recruit 1,100 Group-D staff in two phases but with the agitation showing no signs of dying down, the district administration has decided to send a report to the state chief secretary and copies of it to the railway board and the divisional railway manager, Adra.																								The employees said the physical efficiency tests that the applicants  who would mostly be employed as gangmen  are being asked to take are in violation of a railway board order. Both male and female candidates are being required to carry a 50 kg weight and cover 100 m in one minute, instead of the stipulated 35 kg for males and 20 kg for females. They also alleged that proxy candidates were getting call letters.

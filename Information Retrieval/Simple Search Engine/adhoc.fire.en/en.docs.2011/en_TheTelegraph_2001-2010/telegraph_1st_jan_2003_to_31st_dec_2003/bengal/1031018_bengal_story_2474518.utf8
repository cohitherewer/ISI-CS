The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, October 18, 2003 				 HC summons Biman in contempt case
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Biman Bose																								Calcutta, Oct 17: A Calcutta High Court division bench today issued a contempt notice to Left Front chairman Biman Bose for alleged derogatory remarks on Justice Amitava Lalas verdict restricting rallies and processions in the city on working days.																								Justices Ashok Kumar Ganguly and S.P. Talukdar, who had earlier stayed Justice Lalas verdict in response to an appeal petition filed by the government, asked Bose to appear before the court on November 7.																								The state CPM was cautious while reacting to the high courts notice to one of the partys politburo members.																								The division benchs summons to Bose came in the wake of a contempt petition filed by Kallol Guha Thakurta, who alleged that the leaders remarks on the verdict regulating rallies amounted to contempt of court.																								The CPM leader had announced at a news conference that the Left Front constituents would defy Justice Lalas verdict. Though he was on television that day, Bose claimed later that his statements at the news conference were distorted. Media reports also quoted him making disparaging remarks about the order. 																								Asked about todays directive, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said: Let Bimanda get the notice from the court first.																								Idris Ali, the counsel for Guha Thakurta, said the front chairmans statements in the context of Justice Lalas September 29 verdict amount to contempt of the judiciary.																								Biswas alerted cadre at a party programme this evening against designs by right-wing forces to snatch democratic rights from the people using the state machinery. 																								The restriction on rallies should not be viewed in isolation. We should remain alert about rising fascism in the country, said Biswas.

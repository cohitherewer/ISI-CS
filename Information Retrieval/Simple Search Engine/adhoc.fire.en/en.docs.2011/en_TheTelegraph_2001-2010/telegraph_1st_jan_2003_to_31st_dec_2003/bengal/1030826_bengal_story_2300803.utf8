 Tuesday, August 26, 2003 				 Buddha to talk terror at CM meet
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 25: The spurt in subversive activities across the state involving the ISI, Ulfa and KLO activists will figure at the inter-state council meeting beginning Wednesday in Srinagar.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today he would attend the meeting along with his Tripura counterpart Manik Sarkar to highlight the problems the two border states have been facing in recent years because of the spate in terrorist activities. Bhattacharjee is likely to meet deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani after the meeting.																								 Addressing a rally organised by the Left Front to commemorate the killings in Tripura on the eve of Independence Day, Bhattacharjee said he would request the Centre to send more forces for deployment along the border. We want more BSF personnel to protect the porous border. I have information that KLO and Ulfa militants are being trained in Bhutan by ISI agents and they cross over to Bangladesh after committing crime here, he said.

 Wednesday, February 26, 2003 				 Doctor faces Citu ire for firing rogue help
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 25: A delegation of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today to seek his intervention in a case in which a private medical practitioners chamber in the Jhargram sub-division was sealed by Citu for sacking an employee.																								The general practitioner, Dr A.K. Sengupta, who has put in decades of service to the poor in and around Ghoradhora village in Jhargram, remains confined to his residence and cannot venture out of his house after dark as local Citu activists have prevented him from practising medicine for the past four months.																								Repeated attempts by the local IMA branch to get the clinic reopened have yielded no result.																								We tried everything but failed. Therefore, we decided to inform our headquarters in Calcutta, said secretary of Jhargram IMA unit Sadhucharan Patra.																								Even the IMAs state unit has not been able to restore the doctor to his chamber despite complaints to health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.																								On November 2, Sengupta rushing out to attend a serious patient in a neighbouring village asked his assistant to administer an antibiotic injection to a patient waiting at his clinic.																								The assistant, identified as Dolly De, allegedly took the antibiotic ampoule from the doctor and replaced it with another one that had apparently expired, but was prevented by the patients relatives from doing so.																								The patients relatives later complained to the physician about how they had caught his assistant administering an injection that had expired. We saw her put the original injection that you handed her into her bag and take out another injection, they alleged.																								Sengupta asked Dolly to leave, but she returned to the clinic accompanied by local Citu leaders, demanding immediate reinstatement.																								On being refused reinstatement, the Citu activists sealed the doctors chamber and also hoisted flags at its entrance.																								When I personally met the chief minister today and told him about what had happened, he was taken aback, said IMA state president Subir Ganguly. He (Bhattacharjee) has promised us immediate action. If the government does not step in, then we will.																								The IMA has decided to send a team to Jhargram to help open the chamber.

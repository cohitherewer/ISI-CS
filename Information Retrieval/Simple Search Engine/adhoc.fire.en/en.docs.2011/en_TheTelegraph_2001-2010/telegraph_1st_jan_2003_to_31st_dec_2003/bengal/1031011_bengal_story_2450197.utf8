 A STAFF REPORTER																								Behrampore, Oct. 10: A woman recuperating in the maternity ward of the Behrampore district hospital, after delivering a girl, was bitten by a dog on Tuesday while in bed.																								The incident came to light yesterday when the womans father lodged a complaint with district magistrate Manoj Panth soon after the patients release. Aloke Bhattacharya alleged that the hospital authorities did not attend to her daughter, though she had informed them about the dog-bite.																								Alo Dey Roy from Niallispara village in the Behrampore police station area was admitted to the hospital a week ago and was under observation after she gave birth to a girl.																								On Tuesday afternoon, Dey Roy noticed a stray dog in the ward. Dey Roy tried to fend off the dog with her right leg, as he was unable to move after a caesarean operation, when it bit her.																								Hospital authorities hurriedly released my daughter yesterday morning, though she had drawn their attention to Tuesdays incident in which a street dog had entered the maternity ward and bitten her. I have brought charges of medical negligence against the hospital superintendent, Bhattacharya told journalists this morning.																								Women either in later stages of pregnancy or having already delivered babies have been passing their days in fear as stray dogs are roaming freely in the ward, claims Dey Roy.																								The district magistrate confirmed that he had received a complaint from Dey Roys family. I have already instructed the chief medical officer of health, Bijon Mondal, and the superintendent of the hospital to inquire into the matter and to submit a report to me by Monday, said Panth.

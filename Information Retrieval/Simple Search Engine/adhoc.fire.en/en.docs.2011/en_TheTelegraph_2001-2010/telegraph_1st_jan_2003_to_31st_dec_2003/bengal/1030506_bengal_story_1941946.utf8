 Tuesday, May 06, 2003 				 To-be approver turns silent in Sen death case
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranaghat, May 5: Failing to turn an accused in the Chandan Sen murder case into a state witness, the Criminal Investigation Department today appealed before the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate to record the statements of two other witnesses.																								Namita Ghosh and Gautam Biswas were present at the dinner after which Sen, a general surgeon at the Ranaghat Sub-divisional Hospital, was found dead on February 26. 																								The CID has so far not been able to get any confessional statement out of Apurba Sanyal, the social welfare officer of the hospital who was present at the dinner and who, the police earlier said, could turn an approver. 																								Sanyal has so far said nothing to indicate that he was involved in the murder, said sources. 																								The post-mortem report of the victim revealed he was drugged and then asphyxiated before being thrown into a shallow pond adjacent to the house of Sunil Ganguly, the retired head clerk of the hospital who was hosting the dinner.																								Ganguly and his son Gautam have been arrested. So have been the physician couple, Suvaranjan and Arundhati Khara.																								Sub-divisional judicial magistrate Yasmin Fatima today rejected the bail pleas by the lawyers representing the Gangulys and the Kharas. Though the prayers for their bails have been moved by the defence lawyers on the ground of lack of evidence, I have perused the statements of Apurba Sanyal and Namita Ghosh. And the evidence is forthcoming. Investigation needs time and I do not want any hindrance before that, said Fatima.																								As an accused, Sanyal needs to confess to the crime, but he did not do so before the CID officers or before the magistrate, said assistant public prosecutor K.C. Bhawal. 																								With Sanyal not saying anything that could link him to the murder, the CIDs hopes of turning him into a state witness have suffered a setback.																								Ghosh, a close friend of Sanyal, and Gangulys neighbour Biswas have not been named in the FIR. Sources said the CID is now trying to make them prime witnesses.																								Bhawal said it would be easier for the CID to get the truth out of Ghosh and Biswas as they do not figure on the list of accused.

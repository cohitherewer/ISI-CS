 Monday, June 30, 2003 				 Cop-turned-con man walks into CID net
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 29: So what if he was kicked out from police four years ago. Surya Bose Roychowdhury proved himself competent enough  in extorting people posing as high-profile police officers.																								In a late night swoop, sleuths of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) netted 29-year-old Roychowdhury, who was sacked in 1999 during training as a to-be sub-inspector. Roychowdhury was rounded up from a hotel in central Calcutta while trying to get himself a free-of-cost weekend by pretending to be a deputy superintendent.																								Manoj Malaviya, a special superintendent of the CID, said he had earlier posed as an IPS officer and enjoyed free access to hotels, restaurants and discos. He tried to fool our officers before he was rounded up. He pretended to be an additional superintendent of the Subsidiary Intelligence Branch when the CID officials started questioning him at the hotel, said Malaviya.																								Police said Roychowdhury, a resident of Behala, was selected for training for the post of a state police sub-inspector in 1999. He was undergoing training at the Police Training School here, said a CID official. He was caught red-handed while snatching valuables from a Japanese couple on Free School Street, months into the training. Officials of Taltala police station arrested him on charges of snatching. Roychowdhury was kicked out from the force. After coming out of jail, he swung into action, said a CID officer.																								The youth used his policeman-like build to the hilt and picked on upscale localities like New Market, Park Street, Esplanade and Gariahat to con people. He was extorting money since 1999. Complaints started coming to us a few months ago. In the past few days, we received at least 30 complaints of extortion against him, said an official.																								The CID sleuths were stunned when they started working on the leads to nab the extortionist. Initially, they were also led to believe that it was an IPS officer. Of late, he had started operating in the suburbs of Behala and Thakurpukur. We came to know that he took computers from a businessman in Behala pretending to be an assistant commandant of a security force, stated Malaviya.																								He changed ground frequently and the CID learnt he was in central Calcutta recently. A trap was laid. The sleuths reached the hotel before Roychowdhury arrived. As soon as he walked in, a detective engaged him in a conversation.

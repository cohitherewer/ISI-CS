 Tuesday, June 17, 2003 				 Jailed crime kingpin convicted again
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rambabu																								Midnapore, June 16: Basab Rambabu, who once spelt terror in Kharagpur, and seven of his accomplices were today found guilty of murdering Manas Choubey, the son of late CPI leader Narayan Choubey. The additional sessions judge will deliver the sentence tomorrow.																								Rambabu and 19 of his associates are already serving life term for the murder of Manas brother Gautam. 																								Manas was shot dead from point blank range on June 26, 1999. He was reading a newspaper in front of a pan shop about half-a-kilometre from his residence when the miscreants zeroed in on him. 																								Police picked up four persons with arms the same night. After their interrogation, the police raided the Forward Bloc office in Kharagpur town and seized more arms and some incriminating evidence.																								Rambabu, at the time, was a frontline Bloc leader and the police began probing his whereabouts and that of another leader of the partys district unit, H.. Pandey.																								Gautam was murdered on September 11, 2001. The police stepped up probe. Rambabu was arrested in Hyderabad on November 1 that year. 																								The district court found Rambabu, his wife Manju, brother Shrinu, brother-in-law Ashok Tadi and sixteen others guilty of killing Gautam and sentenced them to life imprisonment in August last year.																								At 10 am today, he was brought to court from jail along with eight others and produced before additional district sessions judge Bhim Charan Maity. 																								The judge pronounced R. Mohan Rao as not guilty for lack of evidence.																								Rambabu stood with a stoic expression through the hearing. Apart from him, Pandey, K. Chinna, K. Shiva, Sunil Sharma, Babu Rao, Suresh Singh and Rajeev Sinha were pronounced guilty. 																								Like his boss, Pandey, too, has been convicted for murders of both the brothers.																								A massive police bundobast kept a large crowd of onlookers at bay while the hearing was on. More than a thousand people jostled in the court premises for a sneak glimpse of the once-dreaded crime lord.

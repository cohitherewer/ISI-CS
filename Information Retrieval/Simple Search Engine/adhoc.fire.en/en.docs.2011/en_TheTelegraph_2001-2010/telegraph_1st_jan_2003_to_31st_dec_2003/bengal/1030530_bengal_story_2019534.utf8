The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, May 30, 2003 				 A govt fair on careers, at last
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 29: For the first time ever, the state will see a government-sponsored career fair. 																								Starting June 17, the three-day meet at Netaji Indoor Stadium is being seen as the first serious government attempt to tackle brain drain from the state.																								Career Plan 2003 will act as an interface between students eyeing job opportunities and experts who can show how they can be tapped in Calcutta or elsewhere in the state. 																								Targeted primarily at high school students, the fair has been branded as one on technical, professional, conventional and other upcoming unconventional modern professions.																								The fair will showcase professional courses on offer in institutions across the state. 																								We want to create a milieu where, like all other buyers and sellers, students and institutions can exchange views. While this will enable students to learn about the changing job market in the country, the institutions, on their part, will know the kind of options the students are looking for, said youth services minister Mohammed Salim.																								The departments of technical education and youth services have roped in several professional organisations to make the meet a success on its debut. 																								We have to meet the challenges of the changing economic scenario in the country and make students in the state adapt to them, said Salim. Careers have become customised. The employer might want to hire someone who has a diploma in computers, knows the English language well and also has a grasp over Urdu.																								The government intends to create a synergy between the private sector, public sector, educational institutions and industry, said Salim, one of the younger faces in the government. Signals stall trains 																								Train services, both suburban and long distance, were disrupted for more than one-and-a-half hours in the Howrah division tonight. A snag in the signalling system halted trains at 9.05 pm.

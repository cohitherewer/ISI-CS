 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Cong leaders call for tax boycott
 AMIT UKIL																								Joypur (Purulia), Dec. 14: Congress leaders today pledged to oppose tooth and nail the new taxes being imposed by the Left Front government.																								Dubbing it the last resort of a penniless administration, the leaders announced a total boycott of the new taxes. Speaking at a two-day training camp for party workers and a public meeting here, about 300 km from Calcutta, Somen Mitra, Atish Sinha, Pradeep Bhattacharya and Manas Bhuniya lashed out at the front.																								Proposing taxes on cows, goats, cycles used for commercial purposes, houses and on entry to places of pilgrimage is anti-people and shows the extreme emptiness of the governments coffers after 26 years of misrule, said Mitra, a former state party chief. 																								Accompanied by local legislators Shantiram Mahato and Nepal Mahata, the leaders urged Congress supporters to resort to rallies and gheraos as the government sends the taxman knocking on the doors.

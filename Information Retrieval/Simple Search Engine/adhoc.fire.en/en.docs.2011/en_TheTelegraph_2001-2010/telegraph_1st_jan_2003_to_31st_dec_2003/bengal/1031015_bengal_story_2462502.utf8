The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, October 15, 2003 				 March a day: America, if not Ayodhya
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Oct. 14: After Justice Amitava Lala, it is the turn of George W. Bush.																								Hitting the streets a day after Justice Lalas order restricting rallies was stayed, the Left has resurrected a host of pet themes to keep the roads clogged with unfailing regularity.																								Among the issues that have been handpicked for protests through rallies are policies followed by the US imperialist forces. Ayodhya and the Supreme Courts order against strikes by government employees are the other hot favourites.																								The ranks have been told to fan out in the districts, too, to wage the war against US imperialism.																								The decision to keep up the rally tempo was taken at an emergency meeting of the front. 																								Front chairman Biman Bose told coalition leaders that rallies could be held but people should not be inconvenienced. Outside, in the heart of Calcutta, Left unions, led by the Citu, choked roads around Shahid Minar to hold a convention.																								He (Justice Lala), perhaps, doesnt know that our Independence had come after a lot of processions and rallies. He could become a judge only after our own judiciary was set up after Independence. Under no circumstances will we allow any court to impose any verdict restricting processions and rallies, former finance minister Ashok Mitra told the convention.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, December 08, 2003 				 Halt-Guha meet
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 7: CPM leaders will meet their Forward Bloc counterparts on December 10 to discuss ways to rein in agriculture minister Kamal Guha, who has made it a habit to take on the government.																								We would like to know how a cabinet minister can go against the spirit of the oath of office and speak against his own government without resigning, said state CPM secretary Anil Biswas.																								Guhas detractors accuse him of being a spoiler for his high-decibel criticism of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other senior CPM leaders. Those close to the Bloc chairman see an evolving plan in Guhas tirades against Bhattacharjee and front chairman Biman Bose, also a CPM politburo member. The attacks, one of them said, are aimed at dealing a blow to the eroding base of the CPM, its labour arm Citu and other frontal organisations in north Bengal.																								The Bloc has been a partner in the ruling front all along but Guhas relentless criticism has rattled the CPM. He had earlier called the party pro-moneyed class and blamed the Citu for the crises in the tea gardens of the north.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 28: The CPM will take action against party officials who had formed panchayat boards in several places in Birbhum district with support from Opposition parties like the Trinamul Congress, the Congress and the BJP.																								The CPM had formed panchayat boards at Murarai in Birbhum with support from the Congress and the Trinamul. The Forward Bloc had also taken support from the Congress in forming boards in villages like Patkar, Nandigram and Mitrapur under Murarai Block II.																								Left Front chairman Biman Bose said action would be taken against any Front constituent if it was found that panchayat boards had been formed with Opposition support.																								Asked whether the Left partners would come forward to support any Opposition party in forming boards, Bose said: No. Neither will we seek support from the Opposition parties nor will we support them in forming boards at any level of the three-tier (panchayat) system.																								The Front chairman informed that the Left Front leadership was sending instructions to the district units regarding guidelines for forming panchayat boards. All the district Left Fronts will receive the instructions within a day or two and they are bound to go by the instructions while forming boards at any levels. We will not encourage any sort of deviation from our guideline in forming panchayat boards, Bose said.

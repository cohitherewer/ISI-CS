 Friday, April 25, 2003 				 Witchhunt claims man
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Asadullapur (Birbhum), April 24: A 52-year-old tribal, Chaitanya Tudu, was allegedly beaten to death here last night by people who suspected him to possess devilish powers.																								But the CPM and the Trinamul Congress were prompt in claiming that he was killed for political reasons.																								Superintendent of police Akhil Roy said Tudus wife and two sons have been taken for interrogation and the body sent for post-mortem. We are investigating whether this was a case of blind superstition or has a political connection, Roy said.																								No one will say anything as the entire village had decided to kill him. The local medicine man had said Chaitanya was possessed by the devil, said a resident.

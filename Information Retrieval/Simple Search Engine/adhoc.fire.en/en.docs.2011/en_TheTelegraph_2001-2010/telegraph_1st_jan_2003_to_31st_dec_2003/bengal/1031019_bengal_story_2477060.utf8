 Sunday, October 19, 2003 				 Assault chaos in hospital
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Oct. 18: Chaos prevailed at the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital this morning after a female group-D staff alleged that she had been assaulted by a doctor.																								A patient of the hospitals infectious diseases ward turned critical and the nursing staff on duty gave the call book  used to summon doctors to attend to a patient  to Parul Roy, who went to call medical officer Pranab Das. Parul alleged that when she went to call Das, he misbehaved with her.																								At 4.30 am, one patient turned critical and the sister asked me to call the doctor who was at the first-floor superintendents office, she said in her complaint. 																								Parul said the doctor became angry when she went to call him but he attended to the patient. But at 7 am, when I called him again to attend to another critical patient, he abused me, she alleged.																								The doctor, however, denied the charge. I have not misbehaved with her. I did not like the tone of her voice when she was calling me and so I asked her not to call me like that, Das said.																								Hospital superintendent Sarit Chowdhury said an emergency meeting has been called tomorrow to discuss the issue. An inquiry is being conducted and we will take action after receiving the report, he said.																								Only last week, the hospital witnessed pandemonium when some residents, including the relatives of a patient, gheraoed the superintendent to protest the alleged assault by a doctor on a patients daughter.																								Quick to cash in on todays incident, the State Government Employees Federations in the hospital said they would launch a movement demanding action against the doctor concerned. We will launch a movement if no action is taken against the doctor within 72 hours, said Samir Chakraborty, president of the unit.																								Minutes after the incident, Parul Roy filed a written complaint with the superintendent of the hospital and also sought permission to lodged an FIR against the doctor. She has also approached the state Human Rights Commission too.

 OUR BUREAU																								Jan. 7: The peasants wing of the Maoist Communist Centre today denied involvement in the murder of Lakshmi Bagh, the DYFI leader, in Hooghlys Bhimpur village on December 31.																								In a statement issued in Calcutta, a Biplabi Krishak Committee leader, identified as Subhas, claimed that the organisation was in no way involved in the killing of the CPMs youth-wing leader. He also proposed to co-operate with the administration in detecting the real killer. 																								Bagh was found dead with his throat slit in his house at Bhimpur. CPM state secretary, Anil Biswas and local CPM leaders had alleged that the MCC activists were involved in the murder. 																								The police had arrested seven persons, five of them activists of the Biplabi Krishak Committee.																								Subhas said Bagh was a landlord and his family owned about 25 bighas. Our organisation had launched a movement against the local landowners demanding an increase in the wages of the agriculture labourers. But Bagh and some local CPM leaders had ransacked the houses of our supporters, he added.

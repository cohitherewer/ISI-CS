 Thursday, March 13, 2003 				 Minor molested in health centre
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Krishnagar, March 12: A minor girls father has lodged a complaint with police in Nabadwip near here, saying his daughter was molested by the staff of a health centre on Monday. 																								Raising the issue in the Assembly today, local Trinamul Congress MLA Pundarikaksha Saha drew the Speakers attention to repeated attacks on women. The government should take steps to ensure that the state does not become a place where women are not safe, Saha said. 																								The incident comes close on the heels of the rape of several women at Dhantola in Nadia allegedly by CPM-backed goons and the incident in Cooch Behar, in which CPM members are accused of gang-raping a woman belonging to the same party. 																								Farmer Swapan Ghosh of Niranjannagar village said in the complaint that his 12-year-old daughter was admitted to the government-run health centre at Nidya on Monday morning as she was suffering from a skin irritation and was running a temperature. 																								My daughter was given some medicine after having which she fell asleep. When she awoke in the room, she found her clothes in disarray. Frightened and disoriented, she kept whatever had happened to herself. But she told her mother the next day that she had been abused by the lone male staff of the health centre, Ghosh said. 																								His daughter was traumatised and had become withdrawn since she returned from the health centre, Ghosh added. She still hasnt recovered from the ordeal she has gone through. She is refusing to talk to us and is frightened to go out of the house, even with us to a doctor. 																								Chhabi, the girls mother, had told her neighbours about the incident after her daughter finally opened her mouth. They promptly formed a group and went to the health centre. But Shankar Das, the staffer who allegedly molested the girl, was not there. 																								We wanted to grill the man but we were told that he had left the area, said Surya Sarkar, a Maheshgunj gram panchayat member. Later, the group, along with the girls father, went to the police station to lodge a formal complaint. 																								District chief medical officer Prabhas Chowdhury said Das went to the block medical officer after the group had come looking for him and asked for leave, saying some residents were trying to beat him up as he had failed to cure a girl. 																								The block medical officer granted him leave as Das gave the impression that he was in danger, Chowdhury said. 																								Chowdhury said the Nidya health centre was manned by two workers, a man and a woman. On the day of the incident, the woman was absent. He said the assistant chief medical officer of the district, K.P. Das, has been asked to probe the incident. 																								Another rape charge																								Tension is brewing in Basanti in South 24-Parganas after local RSP legislator Subhas Naskar alleged that the wife of a party panchayat member was gang-raped last night by CPM-backed miscreants. 																								RSP panchayat member Dilip Mirdha is in jail custody for his alleged involvement in a murder case. A gang of about seven men forcibly entered Mirdhas house and raped his wife apparently to malign the man before the panchayat polls, Naskar said. 																								Additional police superintendent S.S. Panda said she is being sent for medical examination.

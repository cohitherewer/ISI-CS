The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, March 11, 2003 				 Biswas and Bose in Basu steps
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, March 10: Taking a cue from Jyoti Basu, CPM politburo members Anil Biswas and Biman Bose have also pledged to donate their bodies for medical research.																								A day after The Telegraph reported Basus pledge, officials of Ganadarpan  an NGO conducting a campaign for donation of human bodies after death  said the two senior CPM leaders, too, have signed the pledge at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street.																								I think it is better to donate the body for a better cause than burning, said Biswas. 																								Basu had said he would donate his body to spare his family the trouble of taking it to the crematorium and to save the administration from public fuss. He would formally sign the pledge at a programme on April 4. Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, law minister Nisith Adhikari and the CPMs peasant wing chief, Benoy Konar, have already pledged their bodies.

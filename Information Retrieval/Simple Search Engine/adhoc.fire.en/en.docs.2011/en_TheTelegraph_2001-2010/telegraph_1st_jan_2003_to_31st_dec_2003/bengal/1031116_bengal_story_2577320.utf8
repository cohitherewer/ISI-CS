 Sunday, November 16, 2003 				 Chilli powder used in theft
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Dankuni (Hooghly), Nov. 15: A transport agent in Dankuni was today robbed of Rs 2.5 lakh by three persons who threw chilli powder in his eyes.																								The motorcycle-borne robbers waylaid Subhas Singh, 35, on the Delhi Road and tried to snatch his bag. They did not have any revolvers with them. But one of them pulled out some powdery substance, which I later learnt was chilli, and hurled it into my eyes after his two accomplices grabbed me from behind, Singh told police.																								Singh was on his way to deposit the money in the Dankuni branch of the State Bank of India. An eyewitness told the police that the miscreants had been roaming in the area for the last few days. No one has been arrested yet.

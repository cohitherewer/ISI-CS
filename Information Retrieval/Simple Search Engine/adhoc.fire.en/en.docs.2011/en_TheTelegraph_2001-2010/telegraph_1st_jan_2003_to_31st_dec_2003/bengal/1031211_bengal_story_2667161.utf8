 Thursday, December 11, 2003 				 CPM wields clean-up broom
 RABI BANERJEE																								Krishnagar (Nadia), Dec. 10: The district CPM has axed two leaders apparently for being in touch with Subol Bagchi, the alleged mastermind of the bus loot and rape outrage at Dhantola in February.																								Bagchi, a former Aranghata zonal committee secretary of the party and school teacher, is now out on bail.																								Narayan Majumder, a branch secretary of Aranghata, and Rabi Biswas, a party member, were suspended from the CPM a couple of days ago. But party leaders here remained tight-lipped. It is an internal matter, said one of them. Sunil Biswas, the Ranaghat (East) zonal committee secretary, said the duo was suspended for anti-party activities.																								Majumder and Biswas, however, said the axe was a fallout of their personal relations with Bagchi. The party suspended us because we did not snap our ties with him. We still believe he is innocent. He could not have taken part in the dastardly incident and has been made a scape goat, said Majumder.																								Passengers of two buses returning from wedding receptions were looted and some of the women raped on February 6.

 Tuesday, March 25, 2003 				 Chandan Sen murder case
																								Ranaghat, March 24: All the three accused in the Chandan Sen murder case were denied bail today. The sub-divisional judicial magistrate said the report of the post-mortem conducted by a Calcutta doctor rejected that the death was caused by simple drowning, reports our correspondent.																								The doctor couple, Ranjan and Arundhuti Khara, both attached to the sub-divisional hospital and colleagues of the murdered doctor, and Gautam Ganguly, the son of a retired clerk of the hospital were produced in court. 																								After perusing the case diary and the post-mortem report, I do not find the case is a simple one of drowning as has been tried to be established by the defence lawyers. As evidence is emerging against the accused persons, a deep-rooted conspiracy requires to be unearthed, said Yasmain Fatima, the magistrate, while denying bail.																								The Telegraph yesterday published details of the post mortem report conducted on the body of Chandan Sen, by a doctor at the Calcutta Medical College. The report indicated that Sen had been asphyxiated to death with the help of a plastic bag or a similar item. Sen was found dead on February  26 night and his body was found lying in a pond with shallow  water adjacent to the house of Sunil Ganguly, a retired  clerk attached to the sub-divisional hospital. Sen had gone  to Gangulys residence that night to attend a dinner to  mark the clerks retirement.

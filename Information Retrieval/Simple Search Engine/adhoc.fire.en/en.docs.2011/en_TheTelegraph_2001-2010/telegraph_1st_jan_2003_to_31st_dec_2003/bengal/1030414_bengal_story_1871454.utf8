The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, April 14, 2003 				 Judges to move court over pay
 SUNANDO SARKAR AND BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Calcutta, April 13: For years, they held centrestage in courtroom, dispensing justice. Now, its their turn to sit on the other side, pleading with the court that justice be done to them.																								Judges who have served in the West Bengal Judicial Service have now decided to haul the government to the Supreme Court for allegedly going against the courts directive by not implementing recommendations of a commission set up to rationalise their pay and other benefits.																								Several norms laid down by the first National Judicial Pay Commission, which the Supreme Court had asked every state government to implement before the start of this financial year, had been given a wide berth, alleged West Bengal Retired Judges Association vice-president Ranabir Mahapatra. 																								Both serving and retired judges are paying for the governments refusal to heed the norms, he said today.																								The association, which has more than 200 members, has decided to move the Supreme Court to draw its attention to the alleged flouting of the directives. We will ask the court to slap a contempt notice on the state government, Mahapatra said.																								The West Bengal Civil Service (Judicial) and the West Bengal Higher Judicial Service (Revision of Pay and Allowance) Act-2003 came into force earlier this month after the Bill was passed by the Assembly on March 31. It got Governor Viren J. Shahs assent two days later.																								Judges  both serving and retired  however, found the rules swerved off many of the recommendations of the Justice K.J. Shetty Commission that was set up in March 1996 to rationalise the pay of judges.																								Initially, many state governments dilly-dallied with the implementation, forcing the apex court to issue a directive (last November) to enforce the commissions recommendations before April 1, 2003. 																								The court asked for a uniform implementation of the rules and decreed that there must be no difference between the scales implemented in one state and those in another, Mahapatra said.																								WBRJA president Monotosh Ray wrote a letter to the chief ministers office last month, asking the government to ensure that the states judges were not denied in any way. Unfortunately, there has been no response till date, a senior association member said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, February 21, 2003 				 Pen-down by BSNL officers
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 20: The timing could not have been worse. As BSNL braces to ward off the Reliance challenge, more than 40,000 of its officers have gone on an indefinite agitation.																								The officers said they could not be faulted over the timing of their first-ever agitation. Twenty-eight months after BSNL was formed, they have not been absorbed in the public-sector unit. 																								We are clueless about our status, complained a spokesperson of the central co-ordination committee of the officers associations of the department of telecom. We have been working for the BSNL but we still belong to the department of telecom. We are on deputation. But over 40,000 officers cannot remain on deputation forever, he said.

 Monday, September 08, 2003 				 CBI wing to crack finance frauds
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 7: Increasing bank frauds have forced the CBI to set up a separate wing headquartered in the city to investigate economic offences.																								CBI director P.C. Sharma said here today the unit would soon start working from the agencys Nizam Palace address. This wing will be handling, exclusively, the bank frauds committed across the eastern region, said Sharma. 																								Officials said the unit would make the city office of the CBI the biggest operational headquarters after Delhi and Mumbai.																								To speed up work, a video-conferencing facility will connect the office with the agencys national headquarters. Officers sitting here will be able to discuss cases with their superiors in Delhi soon, Sharma said. The unit here will also get a DNA-matching facility.																								The spate of economic offences in the city and elsewhere in the region prompted the plan for the new wing. Several senior central officials, including superintendents of the Airports Authority of India and customs, were caught red-handed while taking bribes in the city.																								An officer of superintendent rank would supervise operations of the new wing. T.P. Jha has been asked to oversee the bank-fraud unit, said an official.																								The new unit will help us curb all types of economic offences which, on many occasions, end up in banks, an official of the economic offences wing said. With the headquarters here, we will be able to work without the inter-city bureaucratic wranglings, he added.

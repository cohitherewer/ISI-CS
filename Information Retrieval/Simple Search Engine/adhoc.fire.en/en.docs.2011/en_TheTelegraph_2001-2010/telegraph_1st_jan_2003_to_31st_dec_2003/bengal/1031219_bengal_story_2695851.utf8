 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE  Calcutta, Dec. 18: A four-member  Japanese team has finalised with the government the technical  alignments for the East-West Metro, connecting Rajarhat  on the eastern fringes of the city with Ramrajatala in Howrah.																								The team led by Kanji Maeda from Pacific Consultant International, the project consultants engaged by Japan Economic Trade Organisation (Jetro), has already surveyed areas along the proposed stretch and will submit a draft feasibility report before leaving the city.																								A team from Jetro, the funding agency for the Rs 4,000-crore project, will be here tomorrow for the final round of discussions. Government officials, experts from the consultants and representatives of Jetro will attend the meeting. 																								Another Japanese team conducted an extensive survey in September. Its final report is expected in January.

Chief secretary Ashok Gupta met senior officials of eastern, south-eastern and Metro railways, the Calcutta Port Trust, the CMDA, the Calcutta corporation and the transport department to review the groundwork for the project. 																								The experts from Japan met the same officials yesterday at Unnayan Bhavan, the CMDA headquarters in Salt Lake, and wanted to know to what extent they will help implement the project, which includes the construction of an under-water tunnel across the Hooghly river and tracks on the surface, underground and above.																								The Japanese appeared satisfied after we answered their queries. We are very optimistic about the project, said CMDA director Tushar Mitra.

 Tuesday, April 08, 2003 				 Medics denied bail
																								Ranaghat, April 7: A doctor couple and another person arrested in connection with the murder of Chandan Sen, a general surgeon of the sub-divisional hospital here, was today again denied bail, reports our correspondent.																								The bail plea was moved by the lawyer of ENT surgeon of the same hospital Subhoranjan Khara and his doctor wife, Arundhati, as well as by the counsel of the third accused, Gautam Ganguly.																								Rejecting the petition, the sub-divisional judicial magistrate Yasmin Fatima observed that the investigation was not yet complete.																								Gautam is the son of Sunil Ganguly, a retired clerk of the hospital, where Sen was last seen at a dinner on February 26 before his body was found in a pond.																								The delay in the investigation is mainly because of the differences in submission by the arrested persons during various stages of their interrogation, say sources in the CID, which is probing the case.

 Sunday, October 26, 2003 				 Babys body sent for forensic test
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Uttarpara, Oct. 25: The body of a day-old girl who died at Uttarpara State General Hospital on Thursday has been sent to the forensic department to ascertain the cause of death. 																								Her father, Rambabu Mondal, alleged on Friday that the death was due to the negligence of the hospital staff. 																								We have sent the body to the forensic department for examination. We are expecting the report within a couple of days, hospital superintendent Banamali Bala said this morning. 																								Bala said he has learnt that Rambabus wife, Parbati, fed the baby twice on Thursday. The child developed a breathing problem after that and was apparently choked to death, he added. 																								But Rambabu, a rickshaw-puller, said his daughter was suffocated to death after a nurse covered her with a blanket. 																								Trinamul Youth Congress supporters today held a demonstration inside the hospital, defying the chief ministers ban. How can the superintendent confirm that the child developed a breathing problem and died after the mother fed her twice when the report by the four-member inquiry committee is yet to be made public? asked Tridib Yadav, a Trinamul member.

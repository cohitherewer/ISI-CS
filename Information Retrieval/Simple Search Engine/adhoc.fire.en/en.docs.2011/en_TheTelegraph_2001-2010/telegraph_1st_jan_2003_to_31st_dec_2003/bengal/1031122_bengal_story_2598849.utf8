 Saturday, November 22, 2003 				 Mayor toes Mamata tax line
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Nov. 21: Mayor  Subrata Mukherjee today said no water tax will be levied  on the basis of the value of a plot. 																								After a meeting with municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, Mukherjee said: We (the corporation) may have adopted a resolution in our budget saying water tax would be collected on the basis of the valuation of a plot but changes are made even in state budgets and railway budgets. How can there be a problem if we change our stand now? 																								Bhattacharya had said the government would write to the corporation asking whether it had taken a decision not to collect the tax. The controversy began when Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee announced last week that the tax would not be levied. 																								Mukherjee said: We will continue to collect water tax on the basis of the ferrule size but the tax on the basis of a plots valuation is being put on hold.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Burdwan, July 3: Mystery  shrouds the suicide of twin brothers who jumped in front  of a running train at Paraj station, about 155 kilometres  from Calcutta, this morning. 																								Tathagata and Jatabrata Nag threw themselves in front of the Up Samastipur Express and were killed instantly. We are trying to probe the reason for their action, said Jaynal Sah, officer-in-charge of the government railway police station here. 																								Police said the brothers had returned home for rath yatra from Bolpur, where they appeared for Part-I examinations. This morning, they left their Ausgram house and took a bus to Mankarh. There they boarded a Burdwan-Asansol local and got off at Paraj, where they jumped on the tracks holding hands. 																								The brothers, under-graduate students of Guskara College, were inseparable, their father Mihir Nag told police. They left behind a note in their room, saying no one was to blame for their deaths. Their parents were both high school teachers.

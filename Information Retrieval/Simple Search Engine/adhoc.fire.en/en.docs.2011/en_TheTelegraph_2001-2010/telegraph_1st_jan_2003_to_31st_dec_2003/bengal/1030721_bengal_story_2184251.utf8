 Monday, July 21, 2003 				 Citu man held for L amp;T fracas
 OUR BUREAU																								July 20: Police got cracking, two days after operations in Larsen amp; Toubros cement plant here were disrupted following attacks by transporters union members on some of its employees. 																								Thirteen people, including a local Citu leader, were arrested in connection with Fridays incident. Normal operations at the factory had resumed yesterday. 																								A group of lorry drivers and helpers roughed up two transport contractors and factory officials on Friday morning. Hooligans, who had laid siege to the factory gates, had been attacking vehicles going in and coming out of the factory since Tuesday when the company had slashed its transport costs by 15 per cent. 																								With local truck owners refusing to accept the new rate, the transport contractors had stopped hiring their vehicles, resulting in the crisis. 																								An FIR was filed naming Manik Dakkha, the Citu leader held today. State home secretary Amit Kiran Deb had instructed the administration yesterday to make sure L amp;T had no reason for any complaints in future.																								Dakkha and 12 others were produced before the subdivisional judicial magistrate in Durgapur today. Circle inspector Pravat Chakraborty said they were booked for rioting, theft and breach of trust. All of them were granted bail. 																								We had raided various places in Durgapur and adjoining areas last night to arrest those named in the FIR. We are on the lookout for 13 others. Most of those involved had fled after the assault, said Chakraborty. 																								Citu leader Benoy Krishna Chakraborty, however, said they had written to the chief minister that neither the CPM nor the Citu had anything to do with the incident.

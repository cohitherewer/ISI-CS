The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, March 04, 2003 				 Five-year jail for bribe cop
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, March 3: The district court today sentenced an inspector of the Railway Protection Force to five years in prison, eight years after he was picked up by a Central Bureau of Investigation team for accepting a bribe.																								First special court judge B.K. Moitra also slapped a fine of Rs 3,000 on Bansidhar Singh. He will have to spend an additional three months behind bars if he failed to pay up the amount.																								The CBI had laid a trap for the officer following a complaint lodged by a scrap dealer that Singh had seized one of his trucks and was refusing to part with it despite a court order. The trader complained in a letter to the CBI in Calcutta that the officer had demanded Rs 10,000 for the release of the truck.																								The trap was sprung on September 26, 1995, and Singh was caught red-handed accepting the bribe from the trader, Manwar Hussain. He, however, managed to escape from the station here, where the bribe was to be handed over. The officer later surrendered before court.																								Singhs lawyer said they would decide on whether to appeal against the verdict after getting a copy of it.

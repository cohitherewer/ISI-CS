 Tuesday, July 01, 2003 				 Raid to rein in plastic bags
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bandel, June 30: A pollution control board team raided shops around the Bandel Church this morning and seized plastic bags that do not conform to the standards laid down by the Centre.																								As part of an inspection of heritage sites where use of plastic has been banned, the team raided 14 establishments near the church. A dozen shops were found storing plastic bags thicker than the prescribed two-hundredths of a millimetre thickness.																								We have taken the bags for testing and if they are proven to be above the prescribed thickness, action will be taken as per the law, a board engineer said after the raid. 																								Banned plastic bags cannot be used within 100 m of the church, built in 1599 and the oldest in the state. The board officials spoke to the church administration today to chalk out a plan to implement the Recycled Plastics, Manufacture and Usage Rules, 1999.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bongaon, Jan. 1: Armed miscreants snatched a service gun and ammunition from two guards at the Haridaspur police outpost here last night.																								Policeman Kamal Bhattacharjee, 52, and National Volunteer Force guard Niranjan Hazra, 45, were seriously injured in the attack and have been admitted to the government hospital here. 																								Police said the two were on duty outside a customs godown, used to store goods worth lakhs of rupees seized by customs, near the checkpost at Petrapole. 																								Around 2 am, eight miscreants barged into the (guard) room and overpowered the policemen. Six cartridges were snatched from Bhattacharjee and Hazras gun was taken away by the miscreants, said an official of the Bongaon police station. 																								Others joined the miscreants and demanded the key to the godown. On being refused, they struck the guards repeatedly. The raiders, who tried to force the godown lock, fled when a customs guard reached the spot and raised an alarm. 																								Police sources did not rule out the involvement of Bangladeshi criminals.

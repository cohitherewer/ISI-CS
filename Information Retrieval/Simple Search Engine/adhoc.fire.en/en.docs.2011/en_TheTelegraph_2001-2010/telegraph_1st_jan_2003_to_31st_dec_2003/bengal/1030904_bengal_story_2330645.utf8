The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, September 04, 2003 				 Ganesh chant out
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Sept. 3: The state primary education board has announced that the controversial chapter dealing with Ganesh Bandana in Kisholoy  a textbook taught to class IV book students in state-aided primary schools  has been scrapped. 																								The book asks teachers and students to recite the Ganesh Bandana in class to illustrate the Chhau dance form. The book is read by more than 14 lakh students in the 53,000 state-aided primary schools across the state. 																								We understand many of our students who attend our schools belong to Muslim and other minority communities. The Ganesh Bandana should not have been there. We will make sure that the books prescribed and published by the state education boards in future do not contain such mistakes, school education minister Kanti Biswas said. 																								The Telegraph had recently highlighted the resentment against the mistake in minority communities. 																								The board had no intention to hurt the sentiments of our minority students. The lines on the Ganesh Bandana actually intended to illustrate the Chhau tradition, said Biswas.

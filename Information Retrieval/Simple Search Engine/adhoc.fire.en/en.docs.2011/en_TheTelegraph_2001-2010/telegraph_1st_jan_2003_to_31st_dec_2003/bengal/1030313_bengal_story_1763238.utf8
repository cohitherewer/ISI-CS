 Thursday, March 13, 2003 				 Guha fears rape hush-up 
 MAIN UDDIN CHISTI																								Chheramari (Cooch Behar), March 12: Agriculture minister Kamal Guha met with wall of silence in this scarred village today as he tried to dredge out the truth about a gang-rape from fearful villagers. 																								Even relatives of the 28-year-old victim threw up their hands, pleading ignorance about the sordid sexual attack on the housewife, blamed on nine local CPM activists. 																								The villagers seem fearful. It looks like attempts are being made to hush up something, Guha, a senior Forward Bloc leader, on a fact-finding mission, said. 																								An SUCI-sponsored strike to protest the gang-rape hobbled parts of the Mathabhanga subdivision today. 																								Policeman killed																								Nemai Mandi, a 45-year old policeman, was killed and five others injured when a police jeep coming from West Midnapore collided with a lorry on Vidyasagar Setu on Wednesday night.

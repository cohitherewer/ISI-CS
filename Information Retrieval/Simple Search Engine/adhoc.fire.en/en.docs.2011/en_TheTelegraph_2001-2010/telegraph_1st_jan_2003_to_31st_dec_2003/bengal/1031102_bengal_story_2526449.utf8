 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Buxa Duar (Alipurduar), Nov. 1: Two Kamtapur Liberation Organisation militants were killed in an encounter on the banks of the Katlung river between Dalandi and Tashigaon on the Indo-Bhutan border this morning.																								One of the militants was identified as Rahul Sinha, a resident of Salkumarhat under Alipurduar police station. He is learnt to have been trained by the fourth batch of the KLO.

Deputy inspector-general of police, headquarters, Narayan Ghosh said in Calcutta tonight that with todays killings, a total of 26 extremists have been killed since June last year, of which, 17 were from Jalpaiguri district alone.																								Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Siddinath Gupta said for the last one month, police have been getting information that KLO militants had come near Buxa Hills to collect goods for their camps at Bhutan.																								Yesterday morning, we laid a trap, though they did not come. However, last night, police trekked 15 km from Jayanti through Buxa Tiger resort and reached the banks of the Katlung river between Dalandi and Tashigaon on the Indo-Bhutan border, he said.																								Around 6.30 am, the militants were located and when they were challenged, they started firing on the CRPF personnel and the police. The militants were killed in the encounter that followed.																								R. Rajshekharan, additional superintendent of police, Alipurduar, Sumanjit Roy, sub-divisional police officer (Alipurduar) and A. Jaychandran, assistant commander of battalion number 138  one of the four special operation groups of the CRPF in the country  also took part in the operation.																								Gupta said during the joint operation, the forces also destroyed a hut where the militants had stocked up their goods.  It is the toughest place to reach  and the militants hardly imagined that police could have  tracked them at such a desolate spot, which is why they  were caught unawares, Gupta added.

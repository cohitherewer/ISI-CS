 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, Dec. 22: Police today confirmed what was suspected all along: Tom Adhikary, the action squad chief of the KLO, led the attack on the CPM office in Dhupguri in which five party workers were killed.																								Along with Tom, Kalyan Roy, Anirban Rava, Babulal Marandi and Trideb Roy took part in the strike, the most daring carried out by the KLO ever. 																								Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Siddh Nath Gupta said Tom has admitted during interrogation that the blueprint of the attack was drawn up by the KLOs commander-in-chief, Jeevan Singha, along with United Liberation Front of Asom (Ulfa) leader Biju Chakrobarty. 																								Tom was entrusted with the job of executing the operation. He has given us all details of the plan, Gupta said. But no Ulfa cadet was involved in the operation as was initially believed.																								In a daring assault at dusk on August 17, 2002, the militants arrived at the crowded CPM office in Dhupguri on bicycles and gunned down five senior leaders before melting into the darkness. Fifteen CPM workers were wounded in the attack. 																								Gupta said the militants had fired 63 rounds. During interrogation, they told us that Tom, Kalyan, Anirban and Babulal were carrying AK rifles. While the first three attacked the party office, Babulal stood by to cover them. 																								The police have also gathered information on the abduction of Naresh Das, a businessman of Kumargram, from Santivan on April 4, 1998. This being the first case of kidnapping by militants in north Bengal, the Jalpaiguri police had initially suspected the National Democratic Front of Boroland. Now we have learnt that the job was done by the KLO with help from the Ulfa. Das kidnapping was executed by Milton Burma, Harshavardhan Das and Pabitra Singha, aided by Ulfas Jitu Rava, Gupta said. 																								Das, the rebels have said, was taken to a KLO camp at Kalikhola, where the Ulfa reportedly failed to strike a deal for ransom.

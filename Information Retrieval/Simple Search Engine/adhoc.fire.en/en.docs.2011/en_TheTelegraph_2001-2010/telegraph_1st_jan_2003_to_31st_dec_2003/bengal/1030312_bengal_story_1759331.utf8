 Wednesday, March 12, 2003 				 Undertrial hangs himself
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar (Nadia), March 11: Sarthak Sheikh, 30, an undertrial lodged in a jail here, was today found hanging from the exhaust fan in the prison toilet.																								Sheikh was arrested last November on charges of murdering his paramour.																								Prison sources blamed the jail staff for the death. Warders are mostly busy playing cards. If they were alert, he (Sheikh) could not have committed suicide, they said.																								Inspector-general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty was in no doubt that it was a case of pure suicide. But we have ordered a probe to look into the matter, he added.

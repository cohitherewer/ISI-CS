 Thursday, August 14, 2003 				 Robbery on train to Patna 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Purulia, Aug. 13: Dacoits  robbed passengers travelling in two reserved compartments  of the 8624 Up Hatia-Patna Maurya Express last night between  Kotshila and Pundag stations, bordering Jharkhand. 																								The 10 robbers had boarded the train as passengers and, as soon as the train left Kotshila around 9.30 pm, they took out firearms and bhojalis and started looting the travellers. It took a little over 30 minutes to rob the 100-odd passengers, a few of whom offered resistance. In the process, five of them were injured. One had to be hospitalised. 																								The miscreants pulled the chain as the train was passing Domraghati village, on the border of Jhalda and Joypur police stations, got down and vanished in the darkness. The train reached Bokaro around 10.30 pm, where the victims lodged an FIR at the RPF post. 																								Four of the injured passengers were given first-aid and released. It is estimated that the gang looted valuables worth over Rs 1.5 lakh. Railway officials from Adra have gone to Bokaro, while police rushed from Jhalda and Joypur. No arrests have been made. 																								This is the third dacoity on a train in Purulia under South Eastern Railway since April 1 this year, when passengers on Purshottam Express were looted. Travellers on the Tata-Chhapra Express were robbed near Kustaur station on the Purulia-Adra section on June 12.

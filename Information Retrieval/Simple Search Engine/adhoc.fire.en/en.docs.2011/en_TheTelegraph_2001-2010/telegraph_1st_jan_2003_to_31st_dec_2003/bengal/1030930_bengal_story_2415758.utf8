The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, September 30, 2003 				 No Advani but security still part of CMspeak 
 SEEMA GUHA New Delhi, Sept. 29: Buddhadeb  Bhattacharjee could not call on deputy Prime Minister L.K.  Advani today but an issue dear to both was still very much  on his mind.																								The eastern border is very vulnerable and threat from terrorists very real, the chief minister told The Telegraph. I dont want to name any country but the entire border is open.																								There are fundamentalist groups and separatist outfits operating along the border states. Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence is very active and operates across the Nepal border. ISI activity in Kathmandu has been stepped up in the past few years, said Bhattacharjee.																								There has never been an occasion in the recent past when the chief minister did not call on Advani during a trip to the capital. But he was not in Delhi for the better part of the day. The deputy Prime Minister, who also has the home portfolio, shares Bhattacharjees concern over security and enjoys an excellent rapport with him. 																								Bengal needs central support to stand up to the threat facing every state, more so those with porous borders. Since the shootout outside the American Center in Calcutta exposed the chinks in the security setup, Bhattacharjee has made it a point to keep Advani briefed on the border situation.

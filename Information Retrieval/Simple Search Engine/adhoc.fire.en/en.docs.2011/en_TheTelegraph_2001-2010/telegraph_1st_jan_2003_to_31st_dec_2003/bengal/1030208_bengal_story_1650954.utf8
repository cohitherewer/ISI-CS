 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ainsmali (Nadia), Feb. 7: The orgy of looting and molestation of women passengers of two buses returning from wedding receptions here on Wednesday night opened a can of worms today with the arrest of a CPM member and the former chief of a village panchayat.																								Police identified zonal CPM member of Aranghata Subal Bagchi and former pradhan Saidul Karigar, also a CPM member, as the main accused.																								Alimuddin Street maintained a studied silence. At Writers Buildings, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee described the incidents as unfortunate. The government is waiting for a report from the police officers visiting the site, he added. 																								Cautious not to disturb the balance of power in the local CPM, Hanskhali MLA and refugee rehabilitation minister Nayan Sarkar confined his reaction to a routine statement. Steps would be taken against the two if their involvement is proved.																								Villagers today gheraoed an educational institution near the scene of the crimes, pelted stones and ripped off windows. The dacoits had allegedly dragged some of the women to the school and tortured them. The men were asked to climb on to the roofs of the buses and confined there at gunpoint. 																								The gang of 30 first waylaid a bus coming from a marriage reception in Birnagar and on its way to Bagda in North 24-Parganas around 11:30 pm on Wednesday.

The driver of Kundus bus, Samir Ghosh, recognised some of the looters, who were from Chakdaha. He was shot dead.																								In a series of raids on the Dhantola police station area last night, the police picked up Bagchi and Karigar. Most of the looted ornaments and cash were recovered from Saiduls house. Ten others were arrested. About 40 were detained for questioning.																								Bagchi said he was being framed. 																								Police sources said he had an intense rivalry with Sanath Dhali, the CPMs local committee secretary in Panikhali. One of the buses was returning from Dhalis daughters wedding. 																								Bagchi recruited Saidul to put together a gang and loot the bus, said Nadia superintendent of police B.B. Chakraborty,																								In Calcutta, the Trinamul Congress and the BJP demanded Bhattacharjees resignation.

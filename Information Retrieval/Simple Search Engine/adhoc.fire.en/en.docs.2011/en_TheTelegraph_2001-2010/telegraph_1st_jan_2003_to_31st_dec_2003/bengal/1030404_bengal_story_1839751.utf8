The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 04, 2003 				 Flawed results on panel plate 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, April 3: The government seems to have been prompted by its concern over increasing complaints of mistakes in Madhyamik and Higher Secondary Examination results in giving a six-month second extension to the school education revamp committee. 																								The 13-member committee headed by Ranjugopal Mukherjee, a former vice-chancellor of North Bengal University, had got a fresh lease for three months till March 31 after it submitted its final report to the government on December 31 last year. Now it has been asked to continue till September. 																								Sources said that embarrassed by a large number of examinees challenging their results in court, the government asked the committee to work out methods to introduce a flawless evaluation system by the respective boards. 																								We are seriously concerned about the number of mistakes detected in Madhyamik and Higher Secondary results and a faulty evaluation system is one of the reasons. We are determined to introduce a system by which we can ensure completely flawless results, said an education official. 																								The government plans to frame an evaluation process on the lines of the system followed by the state boards in Karnataka. The Ranjugopal Mukherjee committee will visit the state and examine whether the system can be adopted here. 																								The panel was reportedly asked to continue initially as it avoided giving clear-cut recommendations on certain major issues  teaching of English, language policy and development of vocational education in schools. The government is said to have directed the committee to organise workshops and carry out a detailed exercise to frame clear policies on these major issues. 																								School education minister Kanti Biswas said the report submitted on December 31 is final. However, he added: There are certain important areas which, we feel, the committee needs to examine in more detail. The committee has been asked to organise workshops covering those areas and give their observation in detail to the government by September.

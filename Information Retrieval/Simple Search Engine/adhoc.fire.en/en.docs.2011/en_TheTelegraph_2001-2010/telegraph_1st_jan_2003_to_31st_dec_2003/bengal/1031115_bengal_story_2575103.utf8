 Bongaon, Nov. 14: Four  undertrials escaped from a prison van in which they were  to be taken back to police stations from a subdivisional  court here after their associates shot at police.																								The four were arrested in connection with a dacoity in Habra, about 70 km from the city, last week. After the judge remanded them in custody, the alleged dacoits were escorted to a jeep outside the court premises. Their accomplices lay in wait by the vehicle. A bullet hit subinspector Gautam Dirghanghi on the forehead. Late in the night, the police said one of the undertrials was re-arrested.

 Wednesday, January 15, 2003 				 Cong-Trinamul pact ousts CPM
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, Jan. 14: The Congress and the Trinamul Congress joined hands today to dislodge the CPM-led Jalpaiguri municipal board.																								The Opposition parties polled 13 votes against the Left Fronts 11 to win a no-confidence motion in the 25-member municipality. A CPM councillor was absent from the voting and an Independent voted for the Opposition, tilting the balance in its favour.																								The CPM and the Congress had won 10 seats each in the municipal elections two-and-a-half-years ago. The CPM managed to form the board with the help of the Forward Bloc, which had two seats, and the lone Independent. The Congress and Trinamul, which had two seats, stayed in the Opposition. 																								District Left Front chairman Sibapada Bhowmik attributed todays loss to the Oppositions desire to grab power. The no-confidence motion was based on false and unfounded allegations, he said. One of our councillors is undergoing treatment for cancer in Mumbai. So, we lost the game. We are going to contest for the chairmans post.																								Over the past few months, the CPM had ousted Trinamul and the Congress from civic bodies in several south Bengal districts. 																								Lost idols found																								The idols of Krishna crafted in stone and Radha in brass, which were stolen from a shrine in Madhukali village near Canning in South 24-Parganas on Friday, were fished out of a pond today. 																								Police had guessed the burglars couldnt have gone far with the idols, which together weighed around 60 kg, and had the ponds in the vicinity of the village drained out. Villagers came to their aid. The idols were found close to the house from where they were stolen, said the sub-divisional police officer of Canning.

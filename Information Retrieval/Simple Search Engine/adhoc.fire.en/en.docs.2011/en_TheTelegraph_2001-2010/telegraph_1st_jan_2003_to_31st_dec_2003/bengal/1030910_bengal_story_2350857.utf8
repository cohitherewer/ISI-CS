It is they who spoil the image of the force, Bhattacharjee said at the investiture ceremony of the state police. 																								Police personnel today received awards for their outstanding contribution to the profession and gallantry.																								I urge you to prevent your colleagues from indulging in corrupt practices. If you find your superiors resorting to malpractice, inform us, he said.

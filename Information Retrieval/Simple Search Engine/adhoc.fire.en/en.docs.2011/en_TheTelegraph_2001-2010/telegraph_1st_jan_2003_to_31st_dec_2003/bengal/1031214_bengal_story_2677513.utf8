 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Police at sea over childs kidnap
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Malda, Dec. 13: Police  are still clueless about yesterdays kidnapping of five-year-old  Pratibha Sharma on her way to school.																								The class I student was abducted around 10 am by two motorcyclists on Kotuali bridge when she was going to school with her sister, Madhurima, a class IV student.																								Pratibhas mother, Mili Sharma, got a call in the afternoon.																								The caller told me in Hindi that my daughter was with them and hung up immediately. I was called again to be told that I would not see my daughter alive if I informed the police, she said.																								Shyam Pahari said two men in motorbikes stopped his van rickshaw near the school and took Pratibha away, saying her mother had been taken ill. They had urged Madhurima to accompany them, but she had refused, Pahari said.																								We received the next call between 7.30 and 8 pm, and were told that Pratibha was fine. The caller claimed to be speaking from Bihar, said Pratibhas father, Rabindranath Sharma. There has been no call since, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, October 30, 2003 				 Fury after birth on road
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Taherpur (Nadia), Oct. 29:  A housewife was forced to deliver a daughter without assistance  on the road outside a primary health centre this morning  after the nurse on duty refused her admission on the ground  that the doctor she was consulting was out of station. 																								As news spread, a mob grilled the nurse at the health centre here, about 75 km from Calcutta. Angered by her explanations, they began hurling stones at the clinic. 																								District health authorities have ordered an inquiry.																								When Latika, 25, arrived at the clinic at 7 am with husband Kshinath Ghosh as her labour pain had begun, they could neither find the doctor she was consulting, nor his replacement. 																								When I asked for the doctor, the nurse said he was out of station. I asked her to admit my wife, but the nurse said she could not take any risk as the doctor concerned was on leave, said Ghosh, a hawker. 																								So I started with her in a van for Birnagar (health centre). Minutes later, my wife gave birth to a daughter.

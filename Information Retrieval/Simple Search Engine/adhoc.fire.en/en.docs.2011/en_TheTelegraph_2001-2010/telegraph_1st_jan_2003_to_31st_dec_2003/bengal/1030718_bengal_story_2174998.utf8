 Friday, July 18, 2003 				 Free pass to engineering college
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, July 17: Sudam Das, who had never before travelled outside his village in North Dinajpur, will study electrical engineering at B.E. College, Shibpur. 																								The government today arranged the admission for the boy from Itahar who ranked 697 in Joint Entrance Examination but could not afford an engineering course minus assistance. The son of a poor rice trader will study free of cost at the college.																								Sudam came to Calcutta for the first time in his life for the admission. This is also the first time he ventured out of his village. He will, however, have to pay for his hostel, said civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee, the legislator from Itahar.																								But the admission and tuition fees are not the only expenses in an engineering course. The minister admitted as much and urged people to help for Sudams other expenses, buying books and food for instance.

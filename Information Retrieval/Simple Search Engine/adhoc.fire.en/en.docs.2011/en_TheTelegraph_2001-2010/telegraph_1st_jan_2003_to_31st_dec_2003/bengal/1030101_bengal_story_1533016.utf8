 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 Bodo rebels arrested in Jalpaiguri forest
 ANIRBAN CHOWDHURY																								Alipurduar, Dec. 31: Security forces arrested two alleged Bodo militants today from a forest in the Alipurduar sub-division and seized Rs 12 lakh and a cache of arms, including an assault rifle, explosives and Chinese-made grenades.																								The members of the National Democratic Front of Boroland, Amarendra Chandra Daimari also known as Organ or Anthony and Praneswar Narjinari, were picked up after a 10-hour search through the Chhipra forest under the Samukhtala police station in Jalpaiguri. Two other militants, who were also hiding in the jungle, managed to escape.																								Paraded before journalists, Organ said the Rs 12 lakh found on him was collected from tea gardens in Assam as Bodoland tax. My duty was to carry it to Coxs Bazar, the present NDFB headquarters. In Coxs Bazar, there are two officers who control the NDFB movements, he said. 																								District superintendent of police Siddh Nath Gupta said the four heavily-armed militants were on their way to Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh with the money to buy arms. He said Daimari, 22, was wanted for the May 26 Bhutan Ghat bomb blast.																								Gupta said Daimari was an expert in handling explosives and was involved in three devastating blasts in Assams Darrang district, which killed several armymen. He described Daimari as a militant of the corporal rank of the outfit.																								Along with the AK-47 rifle, three magazines, 114 rounds of ammunition, several Chinese-made grenades and explosives were recovered from the duo. 																								The suspected militants were also carrying a powerful radio transmitter, search lights, a cassette recorder and documents espousing their outfits philosophy.																								Acting on a tip-off, a joint team of the CRPF and the combat force of the police cordoned off a portion of the forest. Gupta said Daimari and his two security guards were asleep when the forces landed on them.

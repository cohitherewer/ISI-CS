 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, Dec. 19: Bhutans offensive against insurgents has forced a lull at the orchard plantations dotting Samchi district in the Himalayan kingdom. 																								The loss, however, is not worrying the traders who are mostly residents of Totopara on the India-Bhutan border. The loss, they say, is temporary and better than the extortion threats and harassment they regularly faced at the hands of the militants now on the run. 																								The profits of the orange industry there dipped early this year after the militants shifted base from the Kumargram belt in Sarpang district of Bhutan to Samchi because of stepped-up police vigil. 																								As the militants settled down in places like Bucca, Tading, Panbari, the orange traders became a regular target. 																								With the plantations located in Bhutan, the Totopara traders had little choice but to pay the militants commission.																								Operation Flushout, launched by the Royal Bhutan Army with air and ground support from Indian forces, has rekindled hopes for these traders.																								Sanjib Toto, a resident of Totopara who has taken on lease an orange plantation at Bansdera located between Bucca and Khempa, said: It has been a decade-old trend to hire orchards located in areas like Tading, Bansdera, Simanibusty, Bucca, Bathan and Khempa, all in Bhutan. The oranges are then carried back to Totopara by porters and then sent to areas like Falakata, Siliguri, Jalpaiguri and even to Bangladesh. 																								From the start of this year, we have had to pay hefty commissions to the militants to cross over the hills and go over to Bhutan. We do not mind this loss as long as the militants are gone.

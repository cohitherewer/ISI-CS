 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 26: The search for the first AIDS vaccine in India gathered momentum after business leaders decided to back the mission. 																								After a meeting in Mumbai, attended by top corporate houses, research organisations and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), the business leaders promised to help the government by speeding up access to the vaccine, now in its trial stage, once it is ready.																								The International AIDS Vaccine Initiative is spearheading the drive to develop the HIV/AIDS vaccine in India in partnership with the Union ministry of health and family welfare and research organisations like the Indian Council for Medical Research.																								The vaccine has been designed to counter the HIV strain (HIV-1 subtype C) prevalent in India. The country recorded 610,000 new AIDS cases in 2002.																								Captains of industry like Ratan Tata, the chairman of Tata Sons, and .R. Narayana Murthy of Infosys pledged support to help the vaccine reach those who are at maximum risk and back manufacturers. 																								The AIDS menace is a direct concern to global business, threatening work forces and markets. It is the moral imperative of Indian businessmen to join hands in this crusade against AIDS. This can only be possible through an extensive and effective intervention programme, including development of an effective HIV vaccine, said Tata.																								The participants at the meet agreed to allow volunteers in the vaccine trials time off to attend the programme. The volunteers are making a real commitment to defend their friends and their country from AIDS. The employers said they would publicly applaud them, said Dr Seth Berkley, the Initiatives CEO.

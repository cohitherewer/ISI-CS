 Saturday, March 22, 2003 				 Lock-out at Lever factory
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, March 21: The Hindustan Lever management tonight declared a lock-out at its Garden Reach factory from Saturday following a three-day strike by the labour union since March 19. 																								The company said in a release that it was forced to take the decision due to the intransigent attitude of the union and workmen. 																								While declaring the lock-out, Lever said it will review its decision on or before April 11, provided workmen give an undertaking that they would create an environment conducive for healthy industrial activity in the factory. 																								Kicking off the three-day strike, Amit Choudhury, general secretary of Hindustan Lever Shramik Karmachari Congress, had said the management was jeopardising the livelihood of workmen. The company had already closed down the two major soap and detergent manufacturing facilities at the factory, he had charged. 																								The company statement said HLL was making serious efforts to modernise the 70-year-old factory, for which the production lines needed to be re-aligned. 																								The workers have alleged that their wages had not been revised as per their demands. To this, the HLL management said the average wages of workers were Rs 9,500 per month, the highest in all factories of the firm in the eastern region.

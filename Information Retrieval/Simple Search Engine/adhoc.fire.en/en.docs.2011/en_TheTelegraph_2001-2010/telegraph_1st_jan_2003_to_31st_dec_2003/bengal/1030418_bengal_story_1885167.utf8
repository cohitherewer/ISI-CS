The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 18, 2003 				 Doctor found dead at home
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Beherampur, April 17: Even before the mystery over the death of the general surgeon of Ranaghat sub-divisional hospital, Chandan Sen, was cracked, a doctor of the Jangipur sub-divisional hospital was found dead in his quarters last night. 																								A syringe with traces of a toxic chemical substance was found in the room of Kanak Das, a 32-year-old anaesthetist.																								Wiser after Sens death, senior Murshidabad officials were prompt in ordering a probe and sending a preliminary report to the government. We cannot say whether it is a case of suicide till the investigation is complete, said a police official. 																								Das wife Kakoli, who was sleeping with their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter in an adjacent room, first saw the lifeless body in the morning.																								Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee constituted a team of four local doctors to oversee the post-mortem. Experts from N.R.S. Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta might be roped in to help the forensic examination of the viscera. 																								District superintendent of police Virendra went to the quarters, where his personnel had a tough time controlling a mob. 																								Virendra said Das, who returned home late from work, was found seated in a chair. The syringe was found nearby. 																								The clotted blood on the arm suggests that a lethal dose of poison killed him. We have to find out whether he killed himself or it was murder, said Virendra. 																								Neighbours, many of them health-care professionals, said Das had picked up a quarrel with his wife last night.

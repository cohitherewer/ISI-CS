 Sunday, May 04, 2003 				 Tug-of-war over mango symbol
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Malda, May 3: The returning officer of Kaliachak I in Malda is caught in a frap over a fruity faux pas. 																								Mrinal Kanti Das allotted the mango as an election symbol to an Independent candidate for the panchayat samity elections, only to discover that the king of fruits does not find favour with the state election commission. The mango is not on the commissions list of symbols for the samity polls. 																								Das now wants the candidate to change his symbol to a bucket. But the candidate is adamant about not changing the symbol officially allotted to him. 																								Setabuddin, contesting the Jalalpur 17 panchayat samity seat, said he has invested a lot of money in the campaign and staring afresh with a new symbol was not possible. 																								I was officially given the symbol (on April 22) and I have printed a large number of posters, festoons and sample vote papers. I have also completed the wall writings with the symbol and now, it is impossible to change it, Setabuddin said. 																								I have spent a lot of money and voters have become familiar with the mango symbol. If it is changed, it will create confusion among them, he reasoned.

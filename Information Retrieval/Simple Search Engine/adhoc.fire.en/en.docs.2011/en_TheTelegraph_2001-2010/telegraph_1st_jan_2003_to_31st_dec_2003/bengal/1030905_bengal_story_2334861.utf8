Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee raised the issue at a cabinet meeting today and asked urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya to prepare the plan in consultation with Anandadeb Mukherjee, the chairman of Digha Development Authority and vice-chancellor of Vidyasagar University. 																								Digha has to be developed at any cost, he told colleagues. 																								The cabinet cleared a proposal to extend the jurisdiction of the development authority to Shankarpur, a fishing harbour about 20 km from Digha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Citu arrests after spanner
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Behrampore (Murshidabad), Dec.  30: Fifteen members of the Citu were arrested today  for obstructing beautification work at the cemetery where  Nawab Sirajuddaula was interred.																								The members of the CPMs labour arm fear that the Archaeological Survey of Indias decision to appoint two contractors for the work will render them jobless as they are casual workers.																								They have threatened not to report for work from tomorrow. The union was left with no option but to lodge its protest this way, Citus Murshidabad secretary Tushar Dey told a news conference.																								We are sure that once the contractors are allowed to do the beautification, they will start engaging casual workers of their choice. This will render a large number of workers who have been working for more than 10 years with the ASI jobless. We want the administration to ensure that no casual worker loses his job, Dey added.																								The Roshanbagh cemetery is one of the countrys most significant historical monuments where the last independent nawab of Bengal was laid to rest after the Battle of Plassey.																								It was pitchforked into controversy after Citu workers hoisted their party flag atop a bamboo stick in the cemeterys lush green lawn to protest the surveys decision.																								Alarmed at reports that the standoff might affect tourist inflow to the cemetery, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today directed the district administration to ensure normal work at the earliest. The police responded by rounding up the Citu members.																								District superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh said the 15 were arrested because they were preventing willing workers from reporting for work. However, the contractors are also unwilling to begin the beautification work tomorrow. We are ready to provide all possible support to both parties.																								The shocked contractors alleged an attack today by the Citu members in front of a police team. If the police fail to stop them, we will not resume work, said contractor Indrajit Dhar. Survey officials were unavailable for comment.

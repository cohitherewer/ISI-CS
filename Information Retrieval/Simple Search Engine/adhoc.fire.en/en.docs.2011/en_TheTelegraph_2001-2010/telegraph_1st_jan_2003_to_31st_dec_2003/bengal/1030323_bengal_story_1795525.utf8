The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, March 23, 2003 				 Top tussle deepens rifts in KPP 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Siliguri, March 22: The bitter power struggle within the Kamtapur Peoples Party (KPP) bubbled out in the open again today with the outfits Darjeeling district committee criticising the undemocratic and unceremonious exit of founder-president Atul Roy, who was pushed out by hardliner Nikhil Roy in a clandestine central committee meeting held at Maynaguri recently. 																								Several senior Darjeeling unit members even took potshots at the Nikhil Roy lobby and demanded that Atul Roy be reinstated. The district committee, which went into a huddle for the second time in less than a week since the hush-hush removal of the founder-president, said the KPPs political future is uncertain in the hands of the new president. 																								Nikhil Roys surrender on Monday soon after his political coup raised suspicion that the entire thing was orchestrated by the police. Atul Roy and his loyalists grabbed the opportunity to hit out, calling him a CPM stooge in a press communiqu. 																								Todays meeting raised serious objections to the manner Atul Roy was removed from the KPP helm. It was undemocratic and runs contrary to the avowed democratic policies of the KPP, said former central committee adviser Sunil Roy. 																								Terming Nikhil Roys surrender as injudicious and untimely, the Atul Roy loyalists alleged that he is a history-sheeter and will, in all likelihood, play into the hands of the CPM before the panchayat elections. 																								Nikhil Roys fugitive status would work to the advantage of the CPM during the panchayat elections in Darjeeling district, said Mohanlal Ganesh, the district committee president. 																								Reacting to the resolution in his favour, Atul Roy told The Telegraph: The passing of the resolution and the fact that members of the Darjeeling party unit have reposed full faith in my leadership abilities will enable me to rise above petty intra-party rivalry and fight for the lofty ideals that the KPP preaches.																								Political analysts feel it would be difficult for Atul Roy to get back the presidents post since five of the partys nine central committee members are opposed to him. 																								This has fired speculation that Atul Roy might break off to form his own party, an idea not dismissed by the former president. 																								Not willing to attach too much importance to the resolution, a senior central committee member and a Nikhil Roy loyalist said: We do not care much for the decisions framed at the KPPs Darjeeling unit. Atul Roy was removed from the presidents post on grounds of moral depravity coupled with an overall inadequacy to steer the Kamtapuri movement.

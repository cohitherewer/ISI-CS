The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, March 15, 2003 				 Rajnath harps on Trinamul alliance 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 14: With barely two months for the panchayat polls, the BJPs state unit has started repair works on its wobbly alliance with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress.																								On a days visit to inaugurate a workshop on the panchayat elections, party general secretary Rajnath Singh called for a consolidation of the alliance that could be an effective alternative to the ruling communists.																								The coming together of the BJP and Trinamul is the need of the hour to counter the CPMs atrocities on innocent people of Bengal, he said. But he wouldnt comment on Mamatas return to the Union Cabinet.																								Singh added that only a united Opposition could take on the inefficient and oppressive communist regime. He pointed at the sorry state of affairs in Bengal, referring to the deteriorating law and order, increasing incidents of rape and economic bankruptcy. 																								He asked party workers present at the workshop to build up a campaign cashing in on the current issues. 																								Use the current atrocities on women in villages as a major plank for the coming panchayat polls to corner the CPM, he told the gathering. There should be an all-out effort to establish a non-CPM government after the next Assembly elections in the interest of common people, said the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister. 																								Singh accused the front government of failing to stem the flow of Bangladeshi infiltrators.																								The government here has failed to manage the economy and solve the unemployment problem. It has also been unable to provide security to women with the CPM cadre involved in incidents of rape.																								Later in the day, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said the panchayat polls should be a fitting reply to Singhs charges.

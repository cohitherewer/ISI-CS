 Friday, May 30, 2003 				 Tarred BDO finds shelter
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, May 29: Jamboni block development officer Sital Chandra Sarker, lambasted yesterday by the West Midnapore CPM for corruption in collusion with Opposition parties, has found friends in the Congress and the Jharkhand Party.																								Terming the outburst of district CPM secretary Dipak Sarkar against the BDO at a public rally in Gidhni yesterday as an indication that the CPM could do as it pleased with government servants, Congress district secretary Nirmal Ghosh said the leader was inciting violence in the area.																								The statements he (Sarkar) made yesterday clearly indicate that the CPM-led Left Front government wants to use the administration for its own narrow purposes, Ghosh said.																								He wondered how the CPM managed to wrest the panchayat samity in Jamboni if the officer did work for the Congress and the Jharkhand Party.																								If the Jamboni BDO is singled out and termed a Jharkhand sympathiser just on the grounds of not listening to the CPMs diktats, it should be taken for granted that the rest of the BDOs in the district are all discharging their duties according to the whims of the party leadership, Ghosh said.																								He also took exception to Sarkars comments, telling supporters of both the Congress and the Jharkhand Party to keep quiet or leave Jamboni.

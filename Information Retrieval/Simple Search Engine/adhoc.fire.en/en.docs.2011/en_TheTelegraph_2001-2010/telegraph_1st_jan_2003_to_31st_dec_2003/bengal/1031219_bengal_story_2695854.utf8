The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Way back to college for IIT alumni
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 18: Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, is organising its first global alumni meet on January 3 and 4 and plans are afoot to make it an annual affair. 																								The departments organise their respective alumni meets but we wanted to have one on a bigger scale, said M. Chakraborty, the dean, alumni affairs. Though students from all batches are invited to the two-day carnival in Kharagpur, the focus will be on those completing 25 and 50 years of graduation. 																								The meet will begin with a tribute to Satyendra Dubey, the IIT Kanpur alumnus who was killed in Bihar recently after raising a voice of protest against corruption in the Prime Ministers dream Golden Quadrilateral highway project. 																								I think the issue (of Dubeys death) will come up for discussion time and again as I have received a lot of enquiries from alumni, who want to speak on the subject, said Chakraborty. 																								IIT Kharagpur is taking a lead role in demanding action against those who hatched the conspiracy to kill the young engineer. We would all like to see that the guilty are brought to justice, said Chakraborty. 																								Besides Dubey, working out ways for regular and increased interaction of the institute with the alumni will form the core of the celebrations. A panel discussion, symposium, visits to departments and hostels and cultural performances will be part of the two-day communion. 																								The response is good as 300 alumni have already registered for the programme. We have intensified our initiatives to be in touch with the alumni as we want their greater involvement with the alma mater, said the dean. In sync with the theme, Arjun Malhotra, the HCL co-founder and chairman and chief executive officer of Techspan, will speak on how the alumni are planning to help IIT Kharagpur.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, Feb. 5: Police have rescued a teenage girl, who was kidnapped seven months ago, from a village near Hardwar in Uttaranchal and arrested two women allegedly involved in trafficking. 																								A district police team brought her back by train yesterday and has kept her in custody to help with the investigation. 																								The 14-year-old girl was kidnapped from Dubrajdighi here last July and allegedly sold off to one Amjad Ali in Jwalapur near Hardwar for Rs 2,000, police sources said. 																								After beginning investigation on a complaint by Parsia Bibi, the girls mother, the police had arrested Nisara Bibi and her daughter, Aneja, from Burdwan. Right after the mothers complaint, we began a probe and detained Nisara and Aneja for questioning. They gave us Amjads address. A police team was despatched there and they rescued the girl. Amjad gave them the slip, but we have arrested the two women, said additional police superintendent Shiv Narayan Dutta. 																								Reconstructing the kidnap, the police sources said Nisara had invited the girl to her house while her parents were away. She spiked her food with sedatives and when the girl fell unconscious, they took her to Hardwar on Doon Express the same day, they said. 																								The girl was sold for Rs 2,000 and was being pushed towards prostitution, the investigating officer added. She said Amjad had finalised plans to sell her to another person for Rs 5,000. She has also claimed that this ring was involved in trafficking.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Thirsting for revenue, party uncorks liquor logic 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Biswas: Stout defence Calcutta, Dec. 29: The  CPM today made it clear that it was not opposed to the governments  bid to earn more revenue by issuing new liquor licences  across the state. 																								State party secretary Anil Biswas today said Bengal earns only Rs 511 crore as excise revenue while Andhra Pradesh earns Rs 2,958 crore and Maharashtra Rs 7,151 crore. 																								Reacting to Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjees decision to call a bandh in January to protest against the governments liquor policy, Biswas said issuing new licences will stop the sale of illicit liquor and help the administration earn more revenue.																								We have categorically said in our manifesto that the government will make an all-out effort to increase revenue. It has drawn up a plan to increase excise revenue from Rs 511 crore to Rs 633 crore, which is still less compared to states like Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, said Biswas. He denied Mamatas allegation that liquor would be sold in grocery shops after the new licences are issued. 																								I dont know from where they (Trinamul) got such baseless information, Biswas said.																								The CPM leader added that the government will work hard to earn more revenue even in rural Bengal. The panchayats and zilla parishads have been instructed to explore possibilities of earning more revenue to meet their own financial requirements. 																								The resources available in the rural areas will be utilised to generate more revenue, Biswas said. But I have no knowledge whether our government is going to impose taxes on domestic animals in rural Bengal. What the Trinamul Congress is saying about this is bogus. I dont know from where they have received such information, Biswas said. Mamata had told a news conference yesterday that the government could even impose a tax on domestic animals in the villages.																								Biswas, however, confirmed that the government was considering proposals on imposing taxes on business in the rural areas. Suppose someone is running a poultry farm and making profits. In that case, a tax might be imposed. 																								Reacting to the proposed Trinamul bandh, Biswas said the party was in the habit of organising agitations in the run-up to elections. If an election is not knocking on the doors, Trinamul does not launch such movements, said Biswas. 																								The Congress announced an agitation programme against the governments decision to issue liquor licences and levy new taxes. State party general secretary Manas Bhunia today said the Congress is not planning to go for a bandh but protest demonstrations will be held across the state on January 7.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, November 21, 2003 				 Leased land under tax umbrella 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 20: The cash-strapped government has decided to include in the revenue net those who have taken its land on lease for more than 30 years. 																								The decision will affect a large number of Salt Lake residents, most of who have taken their land on lease for either 99 years or 999 years. 																								The cabinet today decided to amend the Calcutta Land Revenue Act, 2003, to include the lease-holders under Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Bidhannagar municipality, Howrah Municipal Corporation and 38 other civic bodies in the CMDA area. The proposed bill will be placed in the Assemblys winter session.																								After the new land revenue act came into force, the government realised that it could not collect taxes from the lease-holders. The revised act will declare them raiyats. Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla said the terms and conditions of the lease-holders will remain unchanged but the government will no longer collect token rents from them.

 Monday, July 28, 2003 				 MLA brother
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Krishnagar, July 27: Gautam  Dey, the brother of Congress MLA from Shantipur Ajoy Dey,  was arrested today for torturing his wife. 																								He was picked up on the basis of a complaint lodged by the wife, Paramita, 32. I was told to bring money from my father. But he is a retired schoolteacher and it was not possible for me, she said in her complaint. 																								After 17 years of marriage, Paramita summoned courage to tell police she was tortured from the first year. She left home on Friday after Dey allegedly tried to throw her from the roof of her in-laws house, said a police official.

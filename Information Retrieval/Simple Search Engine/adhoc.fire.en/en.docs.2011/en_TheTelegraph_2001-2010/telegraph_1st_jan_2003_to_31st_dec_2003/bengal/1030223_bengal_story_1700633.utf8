 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 CPM activist hacked to death
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Behrampore, Feb. 22: CPM supporter Akbar Ali was hacked to death by miscreants at Kumarpur in the Beldanga police station area last night. 																								Police sources said Ali was on his way to the market when some people accosted him and threw bombs at him. Seriously injured, Ali fell on the ground. Eyewitnesses told police the miscreants then surrounded him and repeatedly struck him with sharp weapons. 																								Priya Ranjan Ghosh, secretary of the CPM Beldanga local committee, accused the Congress for the killing. As the panchayat election is approaching, they (the Congress) are trying to terrorise our workers, said Ghosh. 																								Local Congress MLA Golam Kibria denied any Congress link with the miscreants. This is an old ploy of the CPM. Whenever any party worker is murdered, they accuse our workers. Akbar was a seasoned criminal and had a police record. Gang rivalry between two criminal factions within the CPM is the reason behind the murder, he said. 																								The police sources confirmed that Akbar was a criminal. He had recently walked out of police custody on bail. There is tension in the area and we have posted a picket. We also got a tip-off about some persons who might be involved in the murder. We are searching for them though nobody has been arrested in this connection yet, said district police superintendent Virendra.

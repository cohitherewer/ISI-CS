 Tuesday, September 23, 2003 				 HC power order hits SC wall
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Sept. 22: Electricity will continue to be dearer by 52 paise per unit in Bengal.																								The Supreme Court today stayed a Calcutta High Court order on a petition filed by Vasavi Industries Ltd challenging the hike applicable to all consumers in areas served by the State Electricity Board (SEB), with effect from April.																								The apex court directed that notices be issued to all parties, including Vasavi Industries , and ordered them to file counter replies within three weeks. 																								In its September 8 order, the high court had ruled that the SEB was not authorised to increase power tariff and had asked the State Electricity Regulatory Commission to draw up a fresh tariff structure. 																								It had also said the board would adjust the excess amount taken from consumers since April.

 Friday, February 14, 2003 				 Govt rap for Governor aide
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Feb. 13: The state government today censured a senior IPS officer, who was serving till Wednesday as aide-de-camp to Governor Viren J. Shah, for making unsubstantiated charges against him.																								Chief secretary S.N. Roy said at Writers Buildings that Anirban Roy, the Governors ADC, was not mentally and physically sound.																								The officer had convened a midnight press conference at a city guesthouse yesterday and made the charges.																								We know nothing about the charges and saw them only in some newspapers this morning. We have not received anything in writing from the officer but are keeping in touch with him. It appears to us that the officer is not in good physical and mental health, he said.																								The chief secretary made it clear that the officer had violated service conduct rules by speaking to the media without permission from the authorities. 																								A government officer cannot brief the media like this. It is in clear violation of the service conduct rules. We have taken this seriously and are examining the matter. We will take appropriate action against him, the chief secretary said. Officials from the Centre have not contacted the state government yet, he added.																								Raj Bhavan refused comment. A spokesman said the state government was the competent authority to offer a view.																								The press conference has landed the government in a spot. This afternoon, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and home secretary A.K. Deb declined to make any comment on the charges made.																								Officials said this is not the first time the IPS officer has been involved in a controversy. He had levelled allegations of a nexus between the coal mafia and senior police officials when he was additional superintendent of police in Burdwan, they said. He had brought charges of corruption against senior officials but could not prove them.																								Director-general of police D.C. Vajpai had initiated an inquiry into the allegations.																								Officials said the state government cannot suspend the officer because he is a Union government recruit.

 Wednesday, September 03, 2003 				 Tormentor mates ask Sayandip to come back
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, Sept. 2: A prayer on their lips, Sayandip Bandopadhyays alleged tormentors today appealed to the fresher to bury the past and come back to the engineering college. 																								Come back Sayandip. The past is past. We want you to continue your studies in this college where you had taken admission. We can settle the matter among ourselves. We value brotherhood and friendship. We are ready to ensure your security, Parashar Kishore Singh said in his appeal to the Calcutta boy after attending evening prayer at the Ramakrishna Mission Ashram. 																								Parashar and his friends  Mainak Choudhury, Subhadip Naha and Nigam Prasad Kundu  were expelled from the Jalpaiguri college after Sayandip, who had come to study electronics and communication, filed a police complaint on August 6, accusing the quartet of torturing him and forcing him to write a suicide note in the hostel the previous evening. The four boys were sent to jail and their bail pleas twice turned down by the subdivisional judicial magistrate. 																								They were granted conditional bail yesterday after the police tabled the chargesheet, which said the investigations did not suggest attempt to murder as alleged by the fresher.																								Sayandip had returned to Calcutta and vowed that he would not come back to the college, despite assurances from the authorities and the government that he would be given security. 																								Parashar, a fourth-year student of computer science who was accused of forcing the fresher to pen the suicide note, said he and his friends were willing to sit down with Sayandip and sort things out. If he still thinks that we are responsible for his problem, we are ready to sit down and settle the matter as he is like our younger brother. We will provide him all security in case he perceives a threat. We are ready to talk to him and make him feel comfortable, he said. 																								As instructed by the court, the four boys went to the Ramakrishna Mission for the evening prayer. They will have to do so every evening till September 19, the day of the next hearing. 																								The students of the college, who had rallied around the four boys alleging that they had been framed, said they were doing everything they could to help them overcome their trauma. They are still behaving unnaturally. They are continuously muttering that they were in jail though innocent. We feel they need some time to get over from the shock, said Abhishek Bandopadhyay, general secretary of the Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College Students Union. 																								The four students have submitted a written request to the principal that they be allowed to attend classes.

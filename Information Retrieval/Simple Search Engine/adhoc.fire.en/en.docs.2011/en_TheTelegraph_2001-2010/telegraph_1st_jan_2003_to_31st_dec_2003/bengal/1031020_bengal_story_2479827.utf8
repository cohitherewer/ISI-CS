 Monday, October 20, 2003 				 Twin arrests after gang war
																								Barasat, Oct. 19: Two persons were arrested and 10 detained in connection with Fridays clash at Ashokenagar in which two youths were murdered and two injured, reports our correspondent.																								North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Basudeb Bag said raids are on to arrest the other miscreants. The clash, Bag said, was the fallout of an old feud among local drug peddlers and extortionists. One of those killed yesterday has been identified as Laloo, who came from Madhya Pradesh and had been active in the local crime scene.																								A gang led by Sentu and Pintu had come to Habra from adjoining New Barrackpore and Dum Dum to take on a rival group, said Bag. RAF personnel are patrolling the area now.

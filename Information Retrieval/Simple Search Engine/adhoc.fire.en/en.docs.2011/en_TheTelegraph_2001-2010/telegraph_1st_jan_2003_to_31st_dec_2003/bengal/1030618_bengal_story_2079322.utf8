 sealed flat after the raid. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta, June 17: Sleuths  swooped down on the Salt Lake residence of retired CBI officer  Upen Biswas this afternoon in Round-II of their crackdown  on a drug racket allegedly operating out of his ground floor  flat.																								The Narcotics Control Bureau raid continued for more than two hours and reportedly led to a haul of documents. 																								The bureau had arrested five of Biswas tenants after a raid on May 17 for being part of an international drug cartel. Their immediate boss, San Niang Thanga, had given the slip. The bureau had recovered from the flat 24 kg of ephedrine hydrochloride, which is used to make drugs, worth Rs 10 crore. 																								Three of those arrested were Myanmarese, the other two Chinese. Thanga, a member of the inner circle of the Ah Hua gang based in China, is being tailed by the FBI and the US drug enforcement agency. 																								The kingpin of Ah Hua, Kin Cheung Wong, was arrested later from Fuzhon city in China. 																								The bureau officials said todays raid was conducted following a court order and the documents seized will be placed before it. Biswas was not at home but the detectives spoke to his wife Renuka. 																								Zonal director of the bureau R.M. Meena said: We have collected half-a-dozen documents and will produce them in court. The documents include identity cards and bank pass-books of the arrested five. The sleuths could not find the passports of the miscreants, which they had hoped to recover. 																								An investigating official said they have come to know from reliable sources that one of the arrested Myanmarese nationals has terrorist links. They have found his driving licence from the flat. 																								The place has to be searched again because some documents are still missing. We hope that these documents will speed up the investigation, said .C. Patra, the assistant director of the bureau. 																								The hunt for Thanga is on, said the officials.

 Saturday, November 01, 2003 				 Job-promising jawan in the dock
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, Oct. 31: A BSF jawan caught promising youths jobs in the border force is facing court martial.																								Biswanath Patil of the 122 battalion in Jalpaiguri has been charged with misconduct and violation of service rules. Nadia police caught him at Karimpur accepting money from local youths with the promise of jobs in the BSF.																								Officer-in-charge of Karimpur police station Kanchan Roy Chowdhury said Patil collected a lot of money during the fortnight he spent at the Raninagar camp of the BSF in the district.																								Local youths realised after a few days that Patil was a fraud and contacted us. After receiving a written complaint, we nabbed him and informed the BSF, the officer said.																								Patil took Rs 4,000 from me earlier this month with the promise of taking my son to Calcutta and getting him a job. But he failed to keep his commitment. I learnt from other youths in the area that they had a similar experience, said Bhabesh Mandol, a farmer. 																								BSF officials who took Patil, a resident of Karnataka, into custody on October 19, found that he committed similar fraud in South 24-Parganas.																								During interrogation, it was revealed that Patil was moving freely at Raninagar without taking leave. He indulged in anti-social activities in various districts. We are sending special teams to look into the allegations against him, said BSF deputy inspector-general R.C. Saxena. Patil has been sent back to the battalion to face court martial.

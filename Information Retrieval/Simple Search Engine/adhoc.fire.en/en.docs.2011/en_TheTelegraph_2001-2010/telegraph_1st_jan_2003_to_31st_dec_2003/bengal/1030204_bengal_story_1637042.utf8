 Tuesday, February 04, 2003 				 Distress sale of paddy continues
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Feb 3: Distress sale of paddy continued in the districts today despite the governments move to buy the crop at a higher support price.																								Agriculture department sources said aman paddy was selling between Rs 430 and Rs 500 per quintal. The government had announced a support price of Rs 530 for the crop.																								Co-operation minister Naren De said the government had gone in for the purchase of paddy to prevent a repeat of last years distress sale. He, however, admitted that the efforts were meagre. 																								When his department started buying paddy last week, De said, there were reports of distress sale from 12 districts. The department has purchased a little over 24,680 tonnes so far against a target of one-lakh tonnes. However, our entry into the market gave it a boost, said De. There has been a bumper harvest of 150 lakh tonnes of paddy this season, said sources.																								Salt Lake heist bid 																								Residents chased away two motorcycle lifters from AC block in Salt Lake tonight but one of them was seriously hurt when the fleeing miscreants hurled bombs. 																								Police said the residents had spotted the youths trying to lift a motorcycle. The injured youth has been admitted to the Bidhannagore State Hospital. No arrests were made till late night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 17, 2003 				 Malda board on fine balance 
 OUR BUREAU																								May 16: With hard bargaining between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress continuing for the formation of the Malda zilla parishad, the CPM made it clear that it will not take any Opposition help to wrest its control.																								Out of 33 seats in the zilla parishad, the Left Front has won 16 and the Congress 15. Trinamul and the BJP have won a seat each. To form the zilla parishad, the Congress will have to persuade the victorious Trinamul-BJP candidates to back it. 																								Though the state Congress has not decided yet on whether to seek the BJPs support to form the parishad, the Malda unit of the party is against it. District Congress leader and MLA Sabitri Mitra has informed the leadership that the party will not join hands with the BJP. Sources said it would rather take support from the CPM or a front partner.																								However, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas today reiterated the partys stand to not align with an Opposition party.

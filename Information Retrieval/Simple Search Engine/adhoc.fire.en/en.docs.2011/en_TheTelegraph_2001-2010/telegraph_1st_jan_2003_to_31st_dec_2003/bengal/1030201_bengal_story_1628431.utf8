 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purulia, Jan. 31: Minister for backward classes welfare Bilashibala Sahis escaped a major accident and a possible attack by dacoits when the two tyres of her Ambassador burst while she was on her way home in Rangadih village from Adra station late last night.																								The minister had got off a train at the station around 9.45 pm and was travelling the 35-km distance by road when, about 15 km from her destination, both left tyres of her car burst. Dacoits had placed mud balls with iron spikes, locally known as panifal, on the road. 																								One of the tyres of her pilot car, a police jeep, had also ruptured. Sahis was stranded on the road in pitch darkness for almost half-an-hour. By the time she returned home, it was almost midnight.																								Had she not had police escort, something serious could have happened, said district superintendent of police V.K. Goyal. Additional superintendent of police Anil Kumar went to the spot early this morning. Two persons from the area with criminal backgrounds have been detained. We are taking the incident seriously, Goyal said. Police stations in the region have been alerted.

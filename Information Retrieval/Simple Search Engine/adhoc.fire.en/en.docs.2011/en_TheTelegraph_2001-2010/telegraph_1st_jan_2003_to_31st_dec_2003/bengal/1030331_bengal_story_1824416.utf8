 Monday, March 31, 2003 				 Ranjit Panja blow to Trinamul 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, March 30: Trinamul Congress chief whip in Parliament Ranjit Panja has resigned from the post and other positions he held in the party in protest against the dirty politics of a section of his colleagues. 																								It has become impossible for me to continue with dignity in various posts in the party because of the uncivilised behaviour of a section of my party leaders. I have a certain status in different circles and people respect me at high levels of society. I refuse to share the same platform with uncivilised and indisciplined leaders. So I submitted my resignation, said Panja, also a well-known dermatologist. 																								Panja was also president of Trinamuls North 24-Parganas district committee and member of various party committees. 																								He said he had submitted his resignation to Trinamul chairperson Mamata Banerjee on February 15. My resignation was accepted by Mamata in a meeting yesterday. I am relieved that she accepted my resignation. She, however, has requested me to continue as chief whip till an alternative arrangement is made, he added.																								Party officials said the development is a major setback for the party as his younger brother, Ajit Panja, had revolted against the leadership before the last Assembly elections two years ago and formed his own faction. Ranjit Panja, however, said he was not quitting Trinamul immediately. 																								I want to remain an MP and an ordinary party worker. If MPs do not listen to their chief whip on the floor of the Lok Sabha and, similarly, if I am not paid proper respect by colleagues in my district as Trinamul president, there is no use holding such posts, he said.

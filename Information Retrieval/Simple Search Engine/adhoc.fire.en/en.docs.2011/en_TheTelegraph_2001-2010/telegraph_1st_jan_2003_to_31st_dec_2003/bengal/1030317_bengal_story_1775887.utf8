 Monday, March 17, 2003 				 Suspension slap on OC for slapping
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chakdah (Nadia), March 16: A police officer here despatched a barber to hospital with a punctured eardrum because he refused to rush to his house to cut his newborns nails this afternoon.																								Officer in-charge Surajit Dey had summoned Ratan Sil, 32, but the barber failed to attend to the officers call because of the clients waiting in his saloon.																								Residents said Dey had called Sil to his house to get the nails of his six-day baby cut. But Sil was unable to leave shop immediately. When Dey sent a constable to fetch him, Sil asked the man to find another if it was an emergency.																								A furious Dey arrived minutes later, caught the barber by the scruff of his neck and beat him. Locals rushed to Sils assistance on hearing him plead for help. 																								I could not control myself and slapped him, said Dey. 																								The residents laid siege to the Chakdah police station demanding punishment for Dey. Superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty assured the protesters action against the OC. 																								Dey was suspended from duty later in the day.

 Sunday, October 12, 2003 				 NCC staff gangrape widow
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Suri, Oct. 11: A middle-aged  widow, working as a cook at the Suri National Cadet Corps  (NCC) barrack, was allegedly gangraped by a Group D staff  and four parade inspectors on the night of Vijaya Dashami.  She was also threatened with dire consequences if she made  it public.																								The Suri police yesterday received the complaint from the widow in the form of a letter that she had sent from her daughters house at Md Bazar.																								Minutes after the letter reached the police, Ajoy Chakroborty, the officer-in-charge of Suri police station, rushed to Md Bazar to bring the victim to Suri where she lodged a specific complaint against the five.																								Birbhum superintendent of police Akhil Roy said the victim had been sent to Suri Sadar Hospital for a medical check-up. We have also started a probe on the basis of the womans allegation but all the persons named in the FIR have been absconding, he added.																								Chakroborty said police are conducting raids to arrest the miscreants. We are trying our best to arrest the accused within a day or two, he added.																								The woman, from Kendua village in Suri police station, had also sent a letter to officials at the NCC barrack informing them of the incident. However, when contacted, the commanding officer-in-charge of Suri NCC barrack (15 battalion) refused to comment.																								According to police, Sujit Ghosh, a Group D staff in the barrack, called the widow when she was busy cooking in the barrack, for the celebration of Bijaya. He took her to a room where four other accused were present. Then all five allegedly raped her. 																								And after committing the crime, the miscreants asked her to leave the place and face consequences if she makes it public. The very next morning she left for Md. Bazar where her daughter lives with her family. From there, she wrote a letter to the officer-in-charge of the Suri police station and also to the in Charge of NCC (15 Battalion) Barrack under certificate of posting.

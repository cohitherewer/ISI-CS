 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 23: Muslim intellectuals have written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asking for confiscation of copies of Taslima Nasreens Dwikhandita (Amar Meyebela-III). 																								The book contains passages that denigrate Prophet Mohammed and Islam and could come in handy for mischief-makers, the petition says. It has been signed by, among others, litterateur Syed Mustafa Siraj, state planning commission member and Islamic history scholar Osman Ghani and editor of the weekly, Qalam, Ahmad Hassan Imran.

The chief minister asked the authorities in the affected districts to arrange quick payment for those who had their crop insured.																								Trivedi said agriculture officials submitted a report on the devastation today and minister Kamal Guha had convened a meeting on Wednesday to discuss how the farmers could be assisted in planting some cash crop immediately.																								In Hooghly, crops on more than 20,792 hectares were destroyed, Trivedi said. About three lakh tonnes of potato went waste in Tarakeswar, Haripal, Singur, Arambagh and Goghat blocks.

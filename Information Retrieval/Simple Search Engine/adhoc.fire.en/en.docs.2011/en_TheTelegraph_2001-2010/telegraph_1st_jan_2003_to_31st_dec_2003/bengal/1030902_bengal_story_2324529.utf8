The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, September 02, 2003 				 Office goes dry, minister cries foul
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Sept. 1: About  150 employees of the public works department working from  the annexe building of the Calcutta Improvement Trust at  Poddar Court are without water for over a week.																								The supply was disconnected by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation because of non-payment of property tax to the tune of Rs 4 crore for the entire CIT building . 																								PWD minister Amar Chowdhury said he failed to understand why only the water connection of the annexe was disconnected. Supply to other parts of the CIT building is normal. About 150 of my employees are facing difficulty attending office, where there is no water, he said. The PWD had organised water from Kashi Viswanath Seva Samity, a welfare organisation, but some unknown people prevented its representatives from carrying water inside. 																								Disconnecting water supply to human beings like this is illegal and goes against all norms and principle. I doubt whether the CMC can disconnect supply according to the existing laws, said Chowdhury. The minister added that his department had cleared a water tax bill of Rs 68,000 for its portion.

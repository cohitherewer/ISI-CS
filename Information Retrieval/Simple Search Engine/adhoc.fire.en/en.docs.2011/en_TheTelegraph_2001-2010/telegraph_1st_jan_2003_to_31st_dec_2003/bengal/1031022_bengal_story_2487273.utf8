The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, October 22, 2003 				 Three women butchered, kids missing
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chapra (Nadia), Oct. 21: Three women of a family were mutilated and two children abducted near here last night.																								Residents of Bangalji village, about 110 km from Calcutta, found the bodies this morning, limbs severed and eyes gouged out. 																								Aasia Bibi, 40, her daughter Papiya Khatun, 16, and daughter-in-law Rukia Bibi, 18, could hardly be recognised. Police said they were probably killed in sleep. Aasias sons, 10-year-old Sajid and Majid, 8, were missing.																								Hours after the triple murders, the police were clueless about the possible motive. Additional superintendent Pallab Kanti Ghosh said Aasias former husband Tamaluddin Sheikh has been detained. He had pronounced talaaq about a year ago. 																								Tamaluddin alleged during interrogation that Aasia had engaged the two other women in flesh trade, said deputy superintendent of police Amitava Barma. We are certain to get the leads in a day or two. 																								Police sources said the murders could be the fallout of an old feud between Aasia and some of the villagers. Some of them were against her family as they did not approve of her life style, a source said.																								The rest of the village may not have shared a cordial relation with Aasia but they were shocked nonetheless. The women of Bangalji refused to talk about the incident.																								I know nothing. Some people have taken away Sajid and Majid. I dont know what happened after that. Please dont ask me, said Khadeja Bewa, 55, who lives in a hut next to Aasias.																								The other neighbours were equally tight-lipped, but one of them said: We suspect that one of the men who visited them regularly had a hand in the murders.																								Asif Sheikh, a daily wager in the village, said: The family did not maintain good relations with neighbours. 																								CPM legislator from Chapra Samsul Islam Mollah expressed shock but added that the women (were) of questionable character. The murders could not have been committed without the villagers knowledge. I have requested the district police to be impartial in their probe and arrest the assailants as early as possible, he said.																								Aasias son is in jail in connection with a murder case. He will be interrogated, a police source said. We may have to seek the courts permission to do that, said an official.

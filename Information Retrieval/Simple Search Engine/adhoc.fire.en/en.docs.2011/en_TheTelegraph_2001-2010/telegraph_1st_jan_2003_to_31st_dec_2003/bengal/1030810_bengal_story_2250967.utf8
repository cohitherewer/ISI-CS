 Sunday, August 10, 2003 				 Siliguri-bound bus looted
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Aug. 9: Passengers roughed up the driver and conductor of a Siliguri-bound bus after a gang of dacoits looted cash and ornaments last night.																								The five dacoits, who had boarded the state government bus at Durgapur, fled with money and ornaments worth nearly Rs 200,000 in a car that had been following the bus, claimed the passengers.																								The incident occurred on the Panagarh-Moregram highway in the Kanksa police stat- ion area of the district, about 175 km from Calcutta. The bus was then driven to the Kanksa police station, where the passengers lodged a complaint.																								It was near a place called Trilokchandpur when the five men got up  all carrying arms. One of them went straight to the driver and one stood guard near the door. The other three began snatching gold chains from the necks of women passengers and asked us to empty our pockets and hand over our wrist watches, Subrata Mondol, a doctor, told reporters at the Kanksa police station last night.																								A 21-member football team travelling in the bus was also looted and one of the players, Subodh Singh, lodged a complaint at the police station, police said.																								Subrata Banerjee, the North Bengal State Transport Corporation agent in Durgapur, said over phone that there were 37 passengers in the bus that reaches Durgapur.																								We had no way of knowing that five armed men had boar-ded the bus, claimed the corporation agent. Booty recovered																								West Midnapore police today arrested a gang of dacoits and recovered Rs 671,000 in cash and gold ornaments worth about Rs 300,000, looted last week from the house of garment trader Nabakumar Saha.																								Police superintendent K.C. Meena said they had raided several houses in villages in the Garbeta area and picked up the gang members and recovered the money from them.																								We are still looking for a few other men involved with this gang, which has been committing dacoities in other areas like Arambagh in Hooghly district, Meena said.

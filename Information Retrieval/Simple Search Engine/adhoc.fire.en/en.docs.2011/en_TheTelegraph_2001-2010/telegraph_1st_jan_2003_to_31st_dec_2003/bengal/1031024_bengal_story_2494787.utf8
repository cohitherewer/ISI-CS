 Friday, October 24, 2003 				 Man kills wife, child before suicide
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Barasat, Oct. 23: A man who allegedly suspected his wife of having an affair strangled her and their three-year-old daughter to death and committed suicide.																								Police said Amar Krishna Bose, 30, a quack by profession, had accused his wife Purnima, 22, of infidelity. 																								Boses neighbour at Gopalnagar in Bongaon, about 70 km from Calcutta, called up police around 10 this morning. He told us that the lights in the Boses house were on but no one was responding to repeated banging on the door, said Goutam Mitra, the officer-in-charge of Gopalnagar police station.																								The police broke open the door to the one-storey house. The mother and daughter lay on the bed lifeless with strangulation marks on their throats. It appeared that there was a scuffle between Bose and his wife before she was throttled, said Mitra. Bose hanged himself from the ceiling but did not leave a suicide note.																								He told some of his friends about his wifes affair, said superintendent Basudeb Bag. The police added that Bose had an illegal clinic in the village and regular patients.

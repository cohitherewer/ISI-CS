 Tuesday, April 15, 2003 				 No clues to tea garden murder
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jalpaiguri, April 14: Three days after the murder of the assistant manager of Chengmari tea garden, the police have failed to make any headway. 																								Though the police yesterday ruled out a labour dispute behind the murder, they could not say who were the murderers. Sekhar Sikdar was hacked to death by unknown assailants on Friday night near the factory gate. 																								The wife of the slain manager, Gitashri, who was in a state of shock earlier, said: He was not a person who could have enemies. I have no clue as to why he was murdered. I feel it has nothing to do with labour dispute. He had to pay with his life because of a section of the managerial staff. 																								He worked hard. How could one kill him so brutally? I want the police to find out his murderers, who have left me and my two daughters with a bleak future, she said, starting to sputter. 																								Both of us were thinking of leaving the garden. He got a call from some other garden but was hesitating to submit his resignation. I persuaded him to go ahead with it, said Mrinal Roy, also an assistant manager in the garden.

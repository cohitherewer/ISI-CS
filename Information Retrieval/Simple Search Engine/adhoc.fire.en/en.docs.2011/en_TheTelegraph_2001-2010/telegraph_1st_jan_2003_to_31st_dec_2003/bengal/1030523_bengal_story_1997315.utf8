 Friday, May 23, 2003 				 CPM poll agent abducted and killed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, May 22: The mutilated body of a CPM supporter abducted from his house at one in the morning was found in a forest near his village in Jamboni hours later. 																								Ashis Bisui, 26, of Jhapla village was a polling agent for the party in the panchayat election. The body was recovered from Kalibandh forest in the Jamboni area, said additional superintendent of police Anil Srinivas.																								West Midnapore secretariat member of the CPM Dahareswar Sen said Bisui was threatened by Jharkhand Party (Naren) supporters on the day of poll. 																								Ashis was a very able worker of the party and he was an agent in Jhapla booth. He was killed by the goons in the Jharkhand Party, Sen alleged.																								Bloodshed and tension in this part of the district, where the CPM, the Jharkhand Party, the Congress and the Naxalites have been jostling for supremacy, was common in the run-up to the poll. Today was no different. 																								Jawans of the Eastern Frontier Rifles and personnel from the district armed police were deployed. They conducted flag marches to defuse the tension. 																								Basudeb Bhakat, a CPM candidate for the panchayat from Jamboni, was abducted on the night of May 11. His body was found the next day from a nearby forest. The district CPM is organising a rally in Gidhni, close to the border with Jharkhand, to condemn his death, said district intelligence sources. 																								Fingers were also pointed at the Jharkhand Party after the death of Bhakat. Two CPM cadre who sustained injuries in a poll clash died at the district hospital here on May 12. In another incident on the same day, a Jharkhand Party supporter was hacked to death at Balia near here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 10, 2003 				 Front chief sees Left landslide
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 9: CPM politburo member and Left Front chairman Biman Bose today said the Trinamul Congress and the BJP would not be able to capture 30 per cent of the seats in the rural poll.																								The combine will not get a single zilla parishad and their performance will be worst this time. They will be nowhere after the election, Bose said at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street.																								Trinamul and its allies had captured about 200 gram panchayat seats in North 24-Parganas in the 1998 poll but this time, they will not be able to retain 50 per cent of the seats. 																								Brushing aside the allegations of triggering violence across the state in the run-up to the poll, Bose bragged the Left Front would put up one of its best shows ever in this panchayat election.

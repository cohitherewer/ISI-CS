The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, October 31, 2003 				 Whip on fake doctors
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, Oct. 30: If you are not eligible to become a doctor, dont worry.																								Aspiring doctors dont have to sit for a joint entrance examination and study for five years to obtain an MBBS degree of an UGC-approved university in Bengal. You just pay Rs 5,000-10,000 and get an MBBS or MD certificate from any alternative medicine teaching institution.																								The thriving racket is a matter of concern for physicians in the Durgapur-Ranigunj area as people who buy such degrees treat patients in rural areas with allopathic medicines.																								These institutions are not affiliated to any university approved by the University Grants Commission. The Medical Council of India and the Union health ministry do not approve alternative medicine therapy. We are not responsible for the patients who are victims of wrong treatment of these fake doctors, medical education director C.R. Maiti told The Telegraph today, when contacted over phone.																								Whenever his department received any complaint, it took immediate action, claimed the director. But the people should be more aware about the malpractice, he said.																								Recently, the Indian Medical Association, Ranigunj branch, had started a movement to abolish these institutions. We are identifying the doctors and asking the people of the coal belt not go to them for treatment, said assistant secretary of the association, S.K. Basu.																								An institution in Ranigunj named Institute of Medical Science is one of the popular institutions of Burdwan producing such doctors in alternative medicine for the last 11 years.																								Nothing is wrong. I am giving MBBS and MD certificates to the persons who are eligible to get them. This is a sort of social service, said the proprietor and principal of the institution, J.P. Burnawal.																								Burnawal claimed that his institute is affiliated to the B.C. Roy Memorial Complementary Medical Research Centre in Calcutta. But the centre itself has no affiliation.																								We are affiliated to the Open International University for Complementary Medicine in Sri Lanka, said an employee of the centre, when contacted over phone. But Maiti said he had not heard of such a university.																								Burnawal had been running a private health centre without permission from chief medical officer of heath of the district. The health centre was closed following complaints made by the IMA to the medical officer.																								Puja security																								Elaborate security arrangements have been made by police in and around Chandernagore for the Jagadhatri Puja beginning tomorrow. Several lakh tourists would visit Chandernagore during the puja, which will continue for four days, the district authorities said. District superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said traffic movement in the town has been restricted to keep the area chaos free.

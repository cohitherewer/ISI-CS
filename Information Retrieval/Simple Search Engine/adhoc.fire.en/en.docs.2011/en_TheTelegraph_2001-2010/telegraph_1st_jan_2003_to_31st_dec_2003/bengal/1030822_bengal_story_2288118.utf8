 Friday, August 22, 2003 				 Brothers held for killing mother 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Aug. 21: A couple of men and their wives were arrested in the town today for allegedly killing their mother in cold blood last night. 																								Keshora Bewa, 60, was probably killed as a result of a dispute over sharing property. Her middle son, Haser Sheikh, alleged that Arshad and Samsuddin and their wives, Rahima and Sulekha, throttled the widow.																								My mother owned one-and-half cottahs on which my elder brother, Arshad, had constructed a building. The plot in the heart of Behrampore was valued at Rs 3 lakh but my brother wanted mother to transfer the property to his name in lieu of some small amount. She had disagreed and since then there was tension in the family, Haser said.																								When I returned home last night, I found my mother dead. My brothers said she was throttled to death for being a witch. But she was not one, said a crestfallen Haser.

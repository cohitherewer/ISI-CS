 Friday, January 10, 2003 				 Mother, child murdered
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bolpur, Jan. 9: The wife and daughter of a hotel-owner in Rampurhat near here were found dead in their bedroom last night.																								Pradip Acharya, the owner of Gouri Hotel on the Panagarh-Moregram highway, finished work around 11.30 pm and headed home. As usual, the door to the second-floor residence was bolted from inside and the television blaring.																								But unlike other days, there was no response to his repeated knocks.																								Acharya called the police. The door was broken open and his wife, Mamata, and five-year-old daughter Mandira were found lying in a pool of blood. Apparently, they were hacked to death.																								The police recovered the murder weapon, a blood-stained chopper, and the clothes of the domestic cook, which had patches of blood on them.																								The prime suspect is the cook, Babu, who was not seen in the premises after 7.30 pm yesterday. Acharya has pointed out that some cash and jewellery are missing, but we think there is some motive other than theft behind the murders, said the officer in-charge of the local police station, Deepnarayan Bhattacharya.																								A police team has set out for the cooks residence in Bandel, Hooghly. The police said the murders took place while Acharya was busy attending to customers in his restaurant-cum-lodge in the evening. No one had heard or seen anything to raise suspicion.																								Drug dealer held																								Police in Purulia have arrested a woman on charges of peddling drugs, reports our correspondent. 																								A heroin derivative and 28 g of brown sugar were recovered from Ruksana Begum, 34. The narcotic would have fetched around Rs 28,000 in the drug mart. This is the second time Ruksana has been arrested on the same charge, said Jiten Mukherjee, officer in-charge of the Town police station. This time, she wont get away on bail. 																								Ruksana has been remanded in custody.

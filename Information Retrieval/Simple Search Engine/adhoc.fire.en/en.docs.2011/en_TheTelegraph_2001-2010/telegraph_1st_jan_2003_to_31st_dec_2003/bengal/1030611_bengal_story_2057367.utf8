 Wednesday, June 11, 2003 				 Rebels tale of life on the run
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, June 10: Funds and arms are no problem. Neither are food and provisions. 																								Produced at the subdivisional judicial magistrates court, KLO rebel Tushar Roy told reporters that supply lines to the Bhutan-based KLO camps were intact. 																								This flies in the face of claims made by security agencies that supply lines to the militant camps had been snapped. It also contradicts intelligence reports that the militant organisation was running low on cash and arms.																								The rebel, nabbed by the police yesterday in Telipara, claimed that he had never felt a shortage of funds in the camps. I got enough money when I came down to recruit youths for the new batch. When I wanted to bring my wife to Siliguri for a check up, I informed my higher authorities and was given Rs 25,000. 																								Asked about the Piping camp, Roy gave a detailed picture. Life at the camp begins as early as 4 am and ends at eight in the night. The camp comprises 18 tents, where cadets stay with their wives. The nearest Ulfa camp is at a place known as Alekatari. It takes two days to reach the place on foot from the KLO base, he said.																								Their diet, he added, was fine. The food is supplied from Tintale, Debitar and Papchi in Bhutan.																								An assistant of the camp doctor, Roy would conduct blood tests, treat patients and control operations in the Mainaguri-Dhupguri-Banarhat belt. A few months experience as a lab assistant at a pathological laboratory in Alipurduar helped me get a job at the camp, Roy said. 																								The rebel said he could operate 9 mm pistols, AK rifles, rocket launchers and US carbines. 																								I was taking my wife to the doctors in Siliguri. Sonali is sick. We first came to Phuentsholing from where we took a bus to Telipara. I was going home when the police arrested me, Roy said.

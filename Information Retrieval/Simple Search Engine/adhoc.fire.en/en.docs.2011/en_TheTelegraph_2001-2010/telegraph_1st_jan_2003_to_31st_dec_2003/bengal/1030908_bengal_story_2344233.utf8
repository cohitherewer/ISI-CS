 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, Sept. 7: Police here were left on the wrong side of political parties when leaders took on the force for its inability to stem a spurt in crime.																								The town, about 40 km from Calcutta, has witnessed nine murders in 10 days. The police have yet to crack a single case.																								The district CPM leadership today condemned the inefficient tackling of anti-social activities. We must admit that the police lack motivation because of reasons best known to them. We want them to be firm, said Sunil Sarkar, a party leader. 																								Trinamul MP and district party chief Akbar Ali Khondakar said: They lack motivation because they have become stooges of the communists. How will they tackle crime if they are busy keeping their CPM bosses happy? 																								Metro suicide: Taxi driver A.R. Thoi, 25, jumped in front of a Dum Dum-bound train at Girish Park station tonight. Metro services were disrupted for about 90 minutes after the incident.

 Saturday, November 15, 2003 				 Boy pulls mother out of prostitution muck 
 DEBARATI AGARWALA																								Malda, Nov. 14: A son has rescued his mother who was sold into prostitution after being lured away by a gang of women from a village in Nadia.																								Police here came to the aid of the young man who came all the way from Tehatta in Nadia after receiving a letter from a man who had visited the woman recently and had been requested by her to write to her home for help.																								Police superintendent Pankaj Dutta said a large force from the Englishbazar police station went to the towns red light area on Hansagiri Lane and rescued the woman. We have arrested a woman, Bandana Haldar, a madam in one of the brothels. We are looking for the person who abducted her and sold her here, he said.																								The woman had gone missing after Durga Puja from Tehatta village, where she worked as a farm hand. She told the police that she was sold to Bandana for a sum of Rs 5,000 after she was lured by a gang of women who had promised her a good job in Sealdah. She said she had never thought that the women would sell her into a flesh trade racket.																								Once I was brought here, the women told me that I would have to satisfy customers or I would go without food. I was mentally and physically tortured all these days, she told the police. 																								After several failed attempts to escape from the brothel, the woman finally met a man who listened to her tale of woes. He took down her address and wrote to her son, giving details about where she could be found.																								Last night, the 22-year-old youth arrived here and contacted a friend who works in a mess. The friend took him to the Englishbazar police station where the boy narrated the story of his missing mother and showed them the letter.																								A contingent led by Englishbazar police station officer-in-charge Bipul Samaddar descended on Hansagiri Lane around 10 am today, sending prostitutes and pimps scurrying indoors. Four vans full of police personnel, both men and women, were placed at the entry and exit points to Hansagiri Lane, plugging all escape routes.																								After a brief house-to-house search with the son in tow, the police located the woman from Bandanas house of sin. Women constables grabbed Bandana, clad in a bright orange sari. She was quick to cover her face. Bandana told the police: She had come looking for a room on rent. I gave her place to stay.

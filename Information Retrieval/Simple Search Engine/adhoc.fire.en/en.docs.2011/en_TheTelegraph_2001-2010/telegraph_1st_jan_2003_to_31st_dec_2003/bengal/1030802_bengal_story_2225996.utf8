 Saturday, August 02, 2003 				 Murder accused duo felled in shootout
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Fulia (Nadia), Aug. 1: Police here shot dead two persons accused of murders in an encounter that lasted more than an hour.																								Bisya Samaddar, 32, and Sanjit Malakar, 30, both said to be involved in a couple of murders in the area last week, were cornered by a force led by officer-in-charge Suman Chatterjee in a paddy field adjacent to a state electricity board sub-station around 1 this morning. 																								The police got a tip-off late last night that the duo was seen hiding in the paddy field and Chatterjee rushed with three constables, said superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty. When Chatterjee asked them to surrender, they opened fire. The encounter ensued.																								 The superintendent said the constables approached the duo from one direction and Chatterjee from the other. Realising that they were cornered, they began shooting. The entire exchange took place in the dark. When it ended, Samaddar and Malakar lay dead and Chatterjee grimacing with pain from the bullet wound on his left leg.																								Commando force: Concerned over terrorist activities in the districts, the home ministry has proposed creating a company of commandos for the state police.

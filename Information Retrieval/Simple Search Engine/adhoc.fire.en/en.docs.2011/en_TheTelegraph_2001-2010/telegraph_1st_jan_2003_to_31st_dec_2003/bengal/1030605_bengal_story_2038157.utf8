The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, June 05, 2003 				 CPM squad held for Nadia attack 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Chapra (Nadia), June 4: Thirty CPM workers, including a panchayat samity member, were arrested last night after some men barged into a meeting in a village near here and opened fire injuring about a dozen persons. 																								After a massive raid last night, we arrested 30 persons. They are close associates of Khandu Sheikh, the panchayat samity member, and includes Iaar, an anti-social against whom cases are pending in Chapra police station, said deputy superintendent of police Amitava Barma. 																								Police said the meeting was called to settle a marital dispute between Nargis Bibi, 18, and Jahirul Sheikh, 28. Jahirul, a resident of Brittihuda village, married Nargis a few months ago. But the marriage ran into problems and Jahirul wanted to divorce Nargis. Her family resisted it and the meeting was held in the house of Jabbar Mandal, a local Congress leader, to settle the issue. Around 9 pm, 15 to 30 miscreants stormed the room and opened fire. Around 20 people were inside the room, said Barma. 																								Nargis family pressed for compensation when Jahirul threatened to divorce Nargis. But Jahirul, a well-to-do farmer, refused to part with money. He is on good terms with CPM leader Sheikh, who was behind the attack, alleged Siraj Gyne, a resident of Brittihuda. 																								The district CPM leadership pleaded innocence and accused the Congress of politicising the incident. Samsul Islam Mollah, a party MLA, said: It is purely a village dispute. Our party has nothing to do with it. We will see why our partymen got arrested. 																								Villagers said CPM-backed hooligans were involved. 																								It seems the attackers tried to sabotage the meeting. It may be that the miscreants did not want the meeting to reach a conclusion. So they fired at the legs of the people taking part and went on a rampage in adjacent Noapara, Nargis village, said Barma.

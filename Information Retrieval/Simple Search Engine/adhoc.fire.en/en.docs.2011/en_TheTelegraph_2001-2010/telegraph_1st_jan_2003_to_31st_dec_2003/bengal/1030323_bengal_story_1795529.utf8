The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, March 23, 2003 				 CPM chants unity mantra
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, March 22: CPM stalwarts like secretary Anil Biswas, secretariat member Madan Ghosh and Left Front chairman Biman Bose today stressed the need for strengthening unity among the partners to combat opponents in the May panchayat polls and called upon senior party leaders to work towards that end. 																								Biswas told party leaders during the state committee meeting that the financial crisis in the state had taken a serious turn due to the policies followed by the BJP-led government in Delhi. Attempts are on to spread communal tension in the state before the panchayat polls. Opposition parties in our state have also taken a very opportunist and heinous stand. Naturally, we require better understanding and unity among our constituents, he said. 																								Madan Ghosh, who presented a political report on the ensuing rural polls, said the Opposition parties were targeting the CPM rather than the Front as a whole. Opportunist forces in rural Bengal will work hard this time to defeat our party and the ruling Front. This is because these forces are aware that the CPM will never protect their interests. It is immaterial for us whether our Opposition parties put up consensus candidates or not, they will work hard till their last breath to defeat our party, Ghosh told the party leaders.																								Party leaders were also asked to keep an eye on the Opposition parties as they might take a communal line or an opportunistic stand during the rural polls to defeat the CPM. 																								The emphasis on strengthening Front unity comes at a time when major constituents like the Forward Bloc and the RSP are unhappy with the CPMs seriousness in holding together the ruling coalition during the panchayat elections. 																								The Forward Bloc has raised questions regarding the functioning of the zilla parishads. There is an effective Left Front committee at the state level; in district levels, such committees are by and large active. But there is no such committee which can guide the functioning of the zilla parishads. The CPM has never made any attempt to set up such committees at the grassroots level, alleged Forward Bloc state secretary Asok Ghosh. 																								The state committee also adopted a resolution condemning the US attack on Iraq and decided to hold a rally in Calcutta on March 30 against the war.

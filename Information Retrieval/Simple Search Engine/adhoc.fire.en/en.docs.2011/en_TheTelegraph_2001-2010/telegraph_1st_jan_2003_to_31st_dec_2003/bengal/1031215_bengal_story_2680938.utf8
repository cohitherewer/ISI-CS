 OUR CORRESPONDENT Malda, Dec. 14: Pratibha  Sharma was kidnapped on her way to school on Friday. Police  believe persons connected to the family of the five-year-old  had a hand in it. 																								The daughter of regional officer of United Bank of India Rabindranath Sharma was abducted by two people riding a motorcycle when she was going to school with her elder sister in a van-rickshaw. The incident took place at Englishbazars Kotwali bridge, a kilometre from the girls Kachiman Nursery School. 																								A distraught Sharma said: We are anxiously awaiting a call from the kidnappers. But no one has called us. The police have been visiting us frequently. They conducted raids in Englishbazar. But so far they have not been able to get any information about my daughter.																								The kidnapping has baffled the Malda police, going through a change of guard. Superintendent of police Pankaj Dutta handed over charge to Shasikanta Poojari on Friday. Poojari, who is the superintendent of railway police, Siliguri, is yet to arrive. Additional superintendent Manoranjan Saha is now discharging his duties. 																								I personally met the girls parents and spoke to each of the family members. But we are yet to identify the gang. We dont think it is the handiwork of professional criminals. Persons closely related to the family might have been involved. Pratibhas elder sister Madhurima had addressed the kidnappers as kaku (uncle), Saha said. 																								The van-rickshaw puller, Shyam Pahari, was questioned.																								The kidnappers had told Madhurima, 9, to accompany them, saying her mother was unwell. She refused. The men then asked Pratibha. The little girl, described by her parents as a bubbly child who had no inhibitions mixing with people, readily went along.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, March 01, 2003 				 Fight over playground on burial ground
 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Calcutta, Feb. 28: A faceless village in Burdwan is posing a grave problem to two government departments, both of which are headed by CPM ministers.																								Minorities development and welfare minister Mohammad Salim and minister of state for municipal affairs Anju Kar have got embroiled in a dispute among residents of a village in Kalna over a graveyard that one section wants to use as a playground as well. 																								Kar, seemingly, has an upper-hand in the tussle now.																								The section that wants to use a part of the graveyard as a playground has succeeded in stopping a million-rupee project  to build a wall skirting 3.5-acres  sanctioned by Salims department and undertaken by the Burdwan administration.																								Kar had plunged into the standoff. A section of users of the graveyard must come to a compromise if the protective boundary is to be finished, she said.																								I have attended five meetings with both sections, the minister told The Telegraph. I have told them that the majority sentiment must be kept in mind  most residents want a portion of the land for a playground  if the wall around the graveyard is to come up at Patilpara, she said. Kar added that she was aware the work sanctioned by the minorities department had stopped.																								Patilpara, said district officials, was a mixed village with about 1,000 Muslims, 150 Hindus and around 250 Adivasis. The controversy erupted after the Muslims alleged that the adivasis let their pigs roam free inside the graveyard.																								They demanded a wall around the graveyard at the earliest. The district administration recommended the construction of a wall around the existing graveyard at an early date (to) prevent further encroachment to the minorities department.																								The zilla parishad swung into action following clearance from Writers Buildings. A tender was floated for the construction of a wall surrounding the Muslim graveyard at Patilpara and the contract  worth Rs 9.63 lakh was awarded to a local agency. It was told to complete work in three months.																								The work started in November but, after several rounds of protests from the adivasis, the masons working for the contractor were beaten up in January. They were threatened not to come back again. Work stopped and has not begun yet.																								The minister of state for municipal affairs, also the CPM MLA from Kalna, stepped in in December. Kar held a meeting at the sub-divisional officers chamber where both sections of residents and panchayat representatives were present.																								The meeting tried to convince the mutwali of the graveyard to come to a compromise, keeping in mind the sentiments of most people. He refused. More meetings were held but no solution was in sight.																								Kar said starting on the wall without a compromise being reached first was not realistic. A playground will be used by everyone. I cannot understand why a part of the graveyard cannot be used as such, she said.																								Last heard, the minorities development and welfare department has not yet tried to corner Kar in her fiefdom. The unfinished wall, too, is waiting  for a compromise  before it becomes what the administration thought it would turn out to be.

 Tuesday, September 16, 2003 				 CM casts doubts on PM Sonia
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Uttarpara (Hooghly), Sept. 15: The CPM may see political virtue in Sonia Gandhi, the chief minister does not. 																								In what looked like a departure from his partys line, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the Congress president would be out of depths if given an opportunity as Prime Minister. I have high regard for Sonia Gandhi, especially her family, which contributed to building the nation. But I have doubts whether she will be able to run a vast country like ours, Bhattacharjee said. 																								He was here to kick off the partys campaign for the byelections to the Uttarpara Assembly seat, which fell vacant following the death of Trinamul Congress MLA Swaraj Mukherjee.																								The CPM leadership, particularly party veteran and politburo member Jyoti Basu, had time and again said that it was not averse to accepting Sonia as Prime Minister if the Congress chose her as its leader. 																								Basu was reported to have said that Sonias political acumen had improved.																								Hind Motor murder: Tapan Sengupta, 45, was stabbed to death at Hind Motor in the district. He was killed in a house that police described as a gambling den.

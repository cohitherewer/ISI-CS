 Saturday, November 01, 2003 				 Action heat on jail guards
 BARUN GHOSH																								Calcutta, Oct. 31: Wiser after the recent escape of five inmates from Dum Dum Central Jail in the city, the government is working on a proposal to introduce stringent penal provisions to deal with recalcitrant warders. 																								Sheikh Binod, a dreaded criminal, and four others, including Baitha Kima who was arrested in connection with the international drug racket bust at the Salt Lake residence of former CBI joint director Upen Biswas, had slipped out of the Dum Dum jail. Ramji Singh, the head warder, was arrested and two others were suspended on charges of helping the criminals escape. 																								The CID said today the warders had struck a big deal with those who escaped. 																								It is a matter of grave concern if warders help prisoners get out for money. It has exposed our lapses, said P.K. Agrawal, principal secretary, jails. 																								He added that the government was examining if warders could be suspended immediately on being charged with unlawful activities inside jails.																								The need of the hour is to stem the rot in the jail administration, said Agrawal.

 Thursday, November 13, 2003 				 Vehicle tax target up
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 12: The government today revised its target for collection of motor vehicles tax, setting a nearly 80 per cent additional realisation task for collectors.																								Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said the new target has been pegged at Rs 650 crore because the transport sector offered room for maximising revenue generation through a revamped collection mechanism. The government, he added, was not imposing any fresh tax on motor vehicles.																								It was previously assumed that the current fiscal would see a collection of Rs 385 crore and budget provision was made accordingly. But in September last we reviewed the matter and noticed that the total collection from this sector should be increased. Now our target is Rs 650 crore and we will surely achieve it, Dasgupta said.																								Dasgupta and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty held a meeting at Writers Buildings today with senior bureaucrats like the finance and transport secretaries, senior police officers, district magistrates, district superintendents of police and other officials.																								The finance minister said the system of collection would be computerised in the districts. Computers have been introduced in 10 districts. The rest will be covered in the near future. The two ministers said they would visit the districts to oversee the process of collection.																								We will go and urge the people to pay taxes. Officials will move extensively and for that we will reimburse the minor expenses so that the work goes on smoothly. However, we dont have the capacity to purchase new cars, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, July 09, 2003  Everymans poet bids final farewell
 Obituary / Subhas Mukhopadhyay Subhas Mukhopadhyay, who died  in Calcutta on Tuesday morning at the age of 84, had ushered  in a new era of everyday idiom and revolutionary fervour  in Bengali poetry with the publication in 1940 of Padatik,  his book of poems. He rejected outright the highfalutin  in favour of the rhythms and vocabulary of daily speech,  and in both rhymes and blank verse experimented with metres  and syllabic divisions. Some of his best-known books of  verse were Chirkoot, Agnikone, Jai Saite,  Kaal Madhumash, Ektu Pa Chaliye Bhai and Chhele  Gachhe Bane in reaction to the Naxalite movement. His  Phool phutuk na phutuk is one of the best known  lines of modern verse.  His greatness lies in the fact  that Mukhopadhyay evolved from time to time, says Joy Goswami.  He never rested on his laurels where his language was concerned.  Even in his last days when he had fallen ill, his sense  of humour had not abandoned him. He would poke fun at the  decrepit old man he had become.  In his last published poem, he  was yet the radical of his Padatik days. Mukhopadhyay  spoke of the need to act and bring about change instead  of speaking about it.  Nirendranath Chakrabarty says  Mukhopadhyay had opted for a very workaday way of life that  was reflected in the language of both his prose and poetry.  Mukhopadhyay never felt there was any need for a poetic  diction. Like Wordsworth, he wrote in the living language  of men.  Chakrabarty asserts that Mukhopadhyay  may have been a Marxist to the last, but even those who  were on the opposite ideological pole could not help liking  him. He also had a keen sense of humour, which often informed  his poetry. Very fond of fishing, he would go to the Hooghly  often. Once he used a sweet as a bait. Fish never get to  eat dainty morsels. Perhaps, one will rise to the bait,  Mukhopadhyay had said.  In spite of his antecedents, he  had won over the establishment and was awarded the Jnanpith  in 1991.  Born in Krishnagore, Mukhopadhyay  was deeply involved in Left politics from his student days.  When he became a cult figure almost overnight, many of his  poems could be interpreted as slogans of Marxist parties  and were exploited as such.  Assessing Mukhopadhyays contribution  to Bengali verse, Shankha Ghosh says he was a political  person in the deepest and profoundest sense of the term.  His writing was deeply rooted in the human situation, the  many obstacles one faces and tries to overcome.  Mukhopadhyay felt he could never  write unless he could wander keeping his ears open to the  speech patterns of ordinary people. No other poet wrote  in a language so idiomatic.  Ghosh says Mukhopadhyay wrote  about leading a simple and beautiful life and about the  difficulties in doing so. His writings always reflected  the political struggles of contemporary life. But when his  fellow travellers themselves became rulers the struggle  seemed to have become purposeless.  The Marxists who had once lauded  him rejected him.

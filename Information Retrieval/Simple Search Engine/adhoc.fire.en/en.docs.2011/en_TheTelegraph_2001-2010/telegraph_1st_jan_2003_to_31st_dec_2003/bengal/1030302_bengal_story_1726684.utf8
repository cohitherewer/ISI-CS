 Sunday, March 02, 2003 				 Cable conflict
																								Barrackpore, March 1: A battle between cable operators affiliated to RPG Netcom and alleged CPM-backed goons who want to control operations between Dakshineswar and Madhyamgram took an ugly turn when the optic-fibre cable lines were severed at seven points last night, says our correspondent. 																								Acting on a complaint by RPG and Sony television authorities, 16 persons were arrested by the Khardah police last night. 																								On an SOS from local operators, RPG pressed in two repairing teams that patched up the lines for the key India-Pakistan match today. 																								The operators said the goons are trying to malign their image as the World Cup fever peaks. RPG officials confirmed there was a problem in the area which had been managed.

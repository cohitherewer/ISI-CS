 Tuesday, June 10, 2003 				 Arrests after bones are found in pond bed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Burdwan, June 9: The searing  heat is pulling skeletons out of the deep. When cowherds  spotted bones sticking out of a dry pond bed yesterday,  little did they realise that they were the remains of a  local youth who went missing in October. 																								Four persons were arrested today in connection with the murder in Galsi, about 35 km from here.																								Word spread about the skeleton and police arrived to check. They pulled out the skeleton, clothed and wrapped in a shawl. The discovery created quite a flutter in the area and soon people started flocking the police station out of curiosity, an officer in Galsi said. 																								Along with the onlookers was Ramsagar Sahni, whose 20-year-old son, Baskey, had been missing since October 10 last year. He immediately recognised the clothes and the shawl as the clothing that his son was seen wearing before he disappeared, the officer said. Soon after, the police homed in on Manik Rajak and Dilip Gosain, both Baskeys neighbours. 																								Both men buckled under persistent interrogation and confessed that they, along with Maniks wife Rashmoni and sister Sobha, had planned to take Baskeys savings of Rs 40,000 and kill him, the officer said. 																								All four were arrested today. The police recovered part of the money that had been taken from Baskey. He had a small shop at the main market in Galsi. He used to stay in a room adjacent to his shop and had made acquaintance with Manik and Dilip, the police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 24, 2003 				 Teenager shot days after bullet wound heal 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Islampur (Murshidabad), May 23: A 16-year-old Congress worker, who had just recovered from bullet injuries sustained in the run-up to the rural poll, was shot dead today even as an AICC team toured the district, listening to complaints of atrocities allegedly by the CPM and police. 																								Asiruddin Sheikh was released from hospital six days ago. He was walking to a market at Hussainnagar village in Bhagabangola when unknown miscreants shot him from point blank range.																								We are convinced that there is no law and order in Bengal. I will raise this issue in Parliament, said Santosh Mohan Deb, who is heading the two-member Congress delegation from Delhi. 																								Bijoy Krishna Handique, the Lok Sabha member from Jorhat in Assam, was the other member. The AICC members were accompanied by state party leader Pradip Bhattacharya in their tour of villages in Raninagar and Domkal. 																								After talking to the residents of Dorakati, where three huts belonging to Congress supporters were torched on May 14, Deb said: I want to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee when I am in Calcutta and tell him personally what I saw here.																								We will not only submit a report to our party president, Sonia Gandhi, we will inform the Union home ministry about the situation here, said Handique.																								The Congress leaders will talk to the partys district chief, Adhir Chowdhury, tomorrow. Jawan kills farmer																								A farmer was shot dead by a BSF jawan in the Jalangi police station area today after he snatched the rifle of another border guard and tried to flee.																								The incident occurred in Silochar, about 55 km from Behrampore, this morning when two jawans were chasing a couple of smugglers who left their consignment of sugar and cough syrup in a paddy field where Phani Mondal was working.																								The Jalangi block development officer said the jawans tried to rough up the farmer demanding to know where they had gone. Mondal hit a jawan, Appa Rao, with a sharp weapon and his son fled with the rifle, he said.

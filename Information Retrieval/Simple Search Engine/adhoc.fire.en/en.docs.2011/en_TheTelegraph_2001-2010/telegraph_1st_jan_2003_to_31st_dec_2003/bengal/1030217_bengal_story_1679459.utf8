 Monday, February 17, 2003 				 Saplings buried in office, not planted
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Feb. 16: Amid all the talk about preserving the greens and planting trees, the block office at Salan in the district has allegedly destroyed 750 saplings provided by the forest department.																								The saplings were meant to be distributed among residents and were provided to the block administration during the forest week. 																								The block officials not only destroyed the saplings but buried them in front of the block development office to cover their crime, alleged the CPM-controlled Krishak Front (the partys peasants wing). The front has lodged a complaint with the Rupnarayanpur police station.																								Ganesh Pandit, the leader of the farmers front who lodged the complaint, said the saplings were damaged because of the callous attitude of the officials. He demanded identification of the officials responsible for the crime and their punishment.																								District magistrate Manoj Agarwal said: It is a serious issue. I have asked the BDO to conduct an inquiry. 																								The BDO, Subal Saha, admitted that the saplings were not distributed. The forest department had given the saplings to the block officials but they were damaged as the officials did not distribute them in time and kept them without proper care.

 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 Bloopers in Madhyamik admit cards
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, Feb. 22: With barely a week to go for the Madhyamik examinations, admit cards of over a thousand candidates belonging to 27 schools in the Katwa sub-division here have arrived with errors.																								The distributing centre did not hand out the faulty cards to 1,573 candidates. They were also not told when the cards, which will allow them entry into the examination centres, would be re-issued with the errors rectified. 																								With the Board of Secondary Education office here shut for the weekend, anxious students and their parents will have to wait till Monday to seek clarification.																								The students of these 27 schools had been asked to collect their admit cards from the Jankilal Shiksha Sadan in Katwa. The cards were despatched to the school from the boards office here yesterday.																								Even as the students began queuing up to collect the cards this morning, the errors were detected. School authorities in charge of distributing the cards found that every card had the name of the examination centre wrong.																								We distribute admit cards from our school every year, said headmaster Kripasindhu Moulik, confirming that mistakes had been found.																								We stopped distribution once the errors were noted and we are waiting till Monday to find out what the boards office in Burdwan town will do to rectify the errors in such an important document, he added.																								Not only were the names of the examination centres wrong on the cards, there were other glaring mistakes.																								In some, the name of the school from which the candidate was appearing was not mentioned, in some others, the additional subject had been dropped.																								We heard about the matter and immediately got in touch with the Madhyamik board and informed them of the situation. They said the mistakes would be rectified and the candidates would be able to sit for the examination as scheduled, said sub-divisional officer Subir Chatterjee.																								But the students, their nerves already taut as the make-or-break examination approaches, were perturbed.																								We did not get our admit cards and neither did the headmaster tell us what we should do so that we can sit for the examination which is barely seven days away, said Sabir Ali Sheikh, a candidate.																								Added tension has been heaped on the students just before the examination. We had been waiting with our wards since morning, now we are returning home empty-handed. We are totally in the dark about the future, said Subal Santra, a guardian this afternoon.																								When contacted in Calcutta in the evening, Madhyamik board president Dibyendu Hota said the anomalies would be corrected and the cards given to the candidates by Monday. 																								There were some spelling mistakes which are being rectified. The students need not worry anymore, Hota assured.

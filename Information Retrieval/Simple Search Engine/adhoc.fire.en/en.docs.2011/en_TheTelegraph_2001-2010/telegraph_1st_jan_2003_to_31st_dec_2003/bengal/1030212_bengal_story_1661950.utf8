The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, February 12, 2003 				 Nepal seeks evidence to tackle terror
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 11: Action will be taken against ISI agents and KLO militants if India can support its claim that these outfits are operating out of Nepal with specific evidence, the countrys ambassador, Bhekh B. Thapa, said today.																								We cannot take action against anybody based on hearsay and press reports. Our government definitely does not support terrorism and will act against any perpetrators (of violence) once India places the evidence against them, he said.																								Thapas assurance comes close on the heels of allegations levelled by Delhi and the state government that the operatives of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation and the ISI were working out of bases in Nepal.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and director-general of police D.C. Vajpai had earlier voiced concern over reports that the militants were crossing the border into Nepal and Bhutan to take shelter after creating trouble in north Bengal.																								Police claimed to have cemented their arguments with photographs of KLO camps in the Himalayan Kingdom. Intelligence officials said they had information that the ISI agents were training and arming the KLO cadre and other militant groups in Nepal.																								Thapa, however, ruled out closing the border. Nepal shares a long, porous border with India and we have no intention of fencing or closing it at any point, Thapa said.																								The ambassador refused to elaborate on whether Nepals security agencies would share information with their Indian counterparts to flush out terrorists and criminals operating from there. I wont like to undermine the ongoing co-operation between our government and India, he said.																								The police had indicated to the Union home ministry that they wanted to seal the porous border after stumbling upon evidences of militant camps operating from the neighbouring country.																								Thapa met the chief minister and Governor Viren J. Shah this evening.

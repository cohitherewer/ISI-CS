The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, November 29, 2003 				 Saltlec beats hot spots in race to host US firm
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT Calcutta, Nov. 28: Come  April, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government will have  one more name to drop to showcase the states success in  luring IT companies from abroad.																								California-based Atlas Software, a leading provider of clinical connectivity between physicians and laboratories, has communicated to the government its plans to set up an offshore development centre in the states IT hub, Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec).																								Robert Atlas, the chief executive of Atlas Software, has sent us an e-mail and said that by the first quarter of 2004, the company will start its India operations from Calcutta, said G.D. Gautama, the principal secretary in the department of information technology. 																								For the government, Atlas decision comes as a boost to its infotech initiatives. A two-member team, including the CEO, came to India to decide on the location for India operations. Besides visiting Calcutta, they went to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi, added Gautama.																								Though Atlas mentions some infrastructural advantages in Hyderabad, which was in contention till the last lap, Calcutta scored over the Andhra Pradesh capital, according to the e-mail, because of low operations cost, large talent pool and low attrition rate. They wanted to meet representatives of IT companies operating from here and we organised some meetings, said Gautama, explaining how Atlas got its feedback.																								The mail from California mentions that the firm has started chalking out its Calcutta operations but details regarding investments and employment opportunities arent spelt out.

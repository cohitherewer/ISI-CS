The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 Decibel dose for hospital
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Jan. 18: Paying scant regard to Calcutta High Court rules for checking sound pollution, law minister Nisith Adhikari, industry minister Nirupam Sen and a host of top bureaucrats today took part in a meeting in front of the emergency ward of the medical college and hospital here.																								About 500 patients had to put up with the decibel onslaught that began as early as 10.30 am, when the music started. Then, for three hours, the speakers extolled the states virtues through loudspeakers without a care about the patients behind the walls.																								The sound boxes were placed within 100 metres of the emergency ward, when the pollution laws clearly state that hospitals fall within the silence zone. 																								On being asked, Adhikari passed the buck on the hospital authorities that had arranged the function.

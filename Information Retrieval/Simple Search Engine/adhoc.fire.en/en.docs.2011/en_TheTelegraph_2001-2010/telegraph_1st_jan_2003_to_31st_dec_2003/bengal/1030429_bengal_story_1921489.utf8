The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, April 29, 2003 				 Mahananda gates open to tourists
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Siliguri, April 28: Load your cameras, grab your binoculars, fasten your seatbelts and take a deep breath: You will need all of them at the Jeep safari in Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary.																								The forest department promises thrills unlimited through the 30-km stretch between Sukna and Laltong watchtower at Seventh Mile. All that stands between the launch of the one-of-its-kind circuit is the work in progress on a permanent bridge over the mighty Mahananda that slices through the forest.																								Much of the forest remains unexplored because of the absence of a permanent bridge. We expect construction to be over by May after which we will be able to start the expedition, said divisional forest officer Raju Das.																								With its share of predators like leopards and tuskers, the journey will not be a walk in a park. Though visitors will have to arrange for their own vehicles, trained guides will escort them.

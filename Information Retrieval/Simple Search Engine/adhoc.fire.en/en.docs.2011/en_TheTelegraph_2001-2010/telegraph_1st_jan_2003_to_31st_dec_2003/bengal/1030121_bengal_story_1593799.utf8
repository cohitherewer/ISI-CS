 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Jan. 20: The 43-year-old widow of a North Bengal State Transport Corporation employee set herself ablaze after waiting 10 years for a job with the corporation. Tripti Bagchi of Chuapur locality died this morning at the district hospital.																								Her husband, Mahadeb, worked at the corporation depot here. The corporations practice of providing a job to the next of kin of staffers who died in harness was stopped by a decree a year after Mahadeb died in 1993.																								With a son and daughter to fend for, Tripti earned daily wages for a few months by working as a labourer at the depot.

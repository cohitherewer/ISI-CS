 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Madhyamik amp; HS: horses for courses
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Suri (Birbhum) Dec. 29: The chief of the secondary education board today said it is impossible to bridge the gap between the Madhyamik and the Higher Secondary syllabi.																								The Madhyamik course aims at educating the masses while the higher secondary stage is crucial for students to determine the stream in which he or she wishes to pursue higher education, said Dibyendu Hota, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. He was speaking at the golden jubilee celebrations of Dubrajpur Girls High School.																								The two courses are so far apart from each other because they are meant to serve different purposes, Hota said.																								The governments policy, he added, was to make the Madhyamik syllabus such that children from every sphere of the society can avail of education till Class X. The HS syllabi have to be on a par with those taught by boards across the country. Those clearing the HS have to face competition at the national level, said Hota. 																								He did not say how the students are expected to cope with the sudden and steep change in standards. Hotas remarks come when the government has just completed a study to find out ways to reduce differences between the standards of Madhyamik and HS syllabi.																								The decision to conduct the survey followed a flurry of complaints from students and teachers saying the number of failures in the HS examination was high because the students fail to cope with the extra pressure. The government took more than four years to complete the study. 																								The recommendations of the team that prepared the report are to be implemented from the 2004 academic session.																								Hota, however, said the board has decided to offer training to secondary teachers so that they can make the process of learning joyful. Jute mills strike																								An indefinite strike in the jute industry began today as labour minister Mohammed Amins meeting with representatives of the Indian Jute Mills Association failed. 																								Unless the unions follow the agreement on productivity-linked wages, it is impossible for us to accept the demand for enhanced DA, said association chairman Sanjay Kajaria.

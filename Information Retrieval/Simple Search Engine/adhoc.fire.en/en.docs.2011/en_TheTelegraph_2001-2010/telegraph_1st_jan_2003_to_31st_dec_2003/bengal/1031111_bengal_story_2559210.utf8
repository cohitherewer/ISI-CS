 Tuesday, November 11, 2003 				 Mamata goes soft on Subrata
 OUR BUREAU Calcutta, Nov. 10: A day  after Mamata Banerjee served a 48-hour ultimatum on mayor  Subrata Mukherjee asking him to remove municipal commissioner  Debasis Som and withdraw the tax imposed on filtered water,  a move was afoot to iron out differences between the two. 																								A section of Trinamul leaders said tonight the right thing to do in view of the coming elections to four municipalities was patch up. Some of them were learnt to have requested party chief Mamata to soften her stand on Mukherjee. 																								Mamata and Mukherjee had a one-to-one meeting at the Trinamul office at Topsia tonight to sort out their differences. 																								At a party meeting yesterday, she had also asked the mayor to withdraw a circular that robbed shop owners in municipal markets the right to pass the establishment onto inheritors. She had also ordered a review committee to bring about a balance in trade licence fees, which were hiked. 																								There are no differences between us and we discussed at length some problems facing the civic body, said a smiling Mamata, minutes after the meeting. Mukherjee, however, said the situation remains unchanged. Let the party first give its decisions (the conditions it had laid on him yesterday) in writing. Only then shall I reply, he said today. He had said much the same yesterday. 																								Didi does not want to create a situation in which Subrata feels sidelined, said a Trinamul leader close to Mamata.

 Thursday, August 21, 2003 				 End in sight to Wimco strike 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 20: The nearly month-long strike at the Wimco match factory near Dakshineswar is expected to be withdrawn tomorrow after the intervention of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								At a meeting held by special secretary to the chief minister, S.A. Ahmed, at Writers Buildings, the representatives of the Citu and Intuc-led trade unions agreed to call off the strike in a meeting tomorrow. The Wimco management also attended the meeting. The factory employs about 1,000 workers. 																								The workers representatives agreed to withdraw the strike at a meeting in their factory tomorrow. They are supposed to begin work from Friday after cleaning the machines, said Ahmed. 																								Labour department sources said the employees went on strike on July 28 after the management dismissed eight workers and suspended and chargesheeted 16 others on disciplinary grounds. 																								Subsequently, three tripartite meetings were held at the labour commissioners office in the New Secretariat. But the unions at the factory remained adamant that the eight dismissed workers be reinstated and the suspension order and chargesheets served on the 16 others revoked. So the meetings fell through, said an official. 																								However, the chief minister intervened and asked Ahmed to hold a meeting with the trade unions and the management. 																								A Citu leader said after the meeting that the management has agreed to withdraw the suspension order on the 16 workers, but the eight dismissed workers will not be taken back.

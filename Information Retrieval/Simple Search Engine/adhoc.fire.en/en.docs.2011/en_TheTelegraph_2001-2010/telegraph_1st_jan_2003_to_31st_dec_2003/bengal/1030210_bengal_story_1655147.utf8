The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, February 10, 2003 				 Cong mood lifts on Sonia rally-eve
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Feb. 9: The mood is upbeat in the listless state Congress with barely 24 hours to go for Sonia Gandhis rally at the Brigade Parade Ground. 																								Sonia, who last addressed a meeting in Calcutta in 1998, will meet key state Congress leaders before formally kicking off the partys campaign for the panchayat elections slated for May. She held rallies only in the districts during her last visit to the state before the Assembly elections in 2001. 																								Leaders of the state unit, hamstrung by a poor organisational network, seemed jubilant through the day. Some were optimistic about the return of some of their colleagues who had flocked to Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress before the Assembly elections. 																								With Somen Mitra by his side, state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee today announced at the party office that the rally would be a mammoth affair with people from far-flung districts attending. Sonia would give a call for strengthening the party organisation so that it could counter the BJPs communal politics as well as the Left Fronts misrule in Bengal. 																								The danger to the countrys secular fabric due to the BJPs communal politics and a reign of terror unleashed by the ruling communists in Bengal will top the agenda for tomorrows Brigade rally, Mukherjee said. 																								Vice-president Pradip Bhattacharya said Sonias visit will act as a morale booster for the party rank and file that has been in a disarray since the poor faring at the Assembly elections. Sonias visit in the run up to the panchayat elections will not only help us reach the rural populace but also isolate Mamatas Trinamul Congress from them, he said. 																								Sonia will fly in around 11 am and go straight to the Raj Bhavan. She will reach the ground around 2 pm and leave for the airport in the evening. 																								Party leaders claimed that hundreds of supporters from the north Bengal districts had started pouring in. Activists from the adjoining districts will come tomorrow, Mukherjee said.

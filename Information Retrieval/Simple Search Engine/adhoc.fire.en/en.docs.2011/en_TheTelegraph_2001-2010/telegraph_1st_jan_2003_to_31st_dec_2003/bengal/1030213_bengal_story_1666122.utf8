 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Midnapore, Feb. 12: A 60-year-old man was beaten to death by youths after he protested against the teasing of some girls at Chiapara village in the Jamboni area of West Midnapore on Monday night.																								The police said members of a cricket club in nearby Kankra village had taken out a procession for the immersion of an idol of Saraswati on Monday evening. Local girls were accompanying the procession that was passing through Chiapara.																								When the procession reached a football ground where some youths were having a picnic, tomatoes and potatoes were hurled at the girls. 																								A brawl ensued, leading to fisticuffs between members of the procession and those having the feast.																								Elderly people in the locality intervened and the procession marched on. At night, some residents, including Timir Baran Ghosh who was killed, decided to take up the matter with the gram panchayat pradhan. While they were returning home, a group of about eight youths armed with rods intercepted them and beat them up. Ghosh was hit and collapsed on the ground while the rest fled.																								The people returned with assistance and found that Ghosh was lying on a small khatia with a local quack examining him. The quack informed the villagers that Ghosh was dead and asked them to remove him to the nearby health centre at Chichira where he was declared brought dead. No arrests were reported till this evening.

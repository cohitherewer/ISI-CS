 Wednesday, April 09, 2003 				 CPM succour for Iraq
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, April 8: The CPM will organise a statewide funds collection drive on April 17 to purchase medicine for Iraqis injured in the war raging in their country. 																								More than one lakh people have received injuries in the brutal attack on Iraq by the US and the British army. We feel it (is) most urgent to stand by the injured people of Iraq. For the purpose, we will organise a funds collection drive throughout the state on April 17. We will also collect medicine for them and have planned to despatch those to Iraq through the Indian Red Cross Society and other organisations, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said. 																								Asked whether the party will prevent US and British diplomats from landing in the city airport  as threatened by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty yesterday  or boycott American and and British commodities, Biswas said the state unit was not the appropriate authority to take a decision on the issue. Our politburo will meet on April 16 and 17 and discuss the issue, he added.

 Wednesday, July 30, 2003 				 SC puts leather hub on fast track 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 29: The Supreme Court today ordered speedy completion of the Common Effluent Treatment Plant and other facilities at the Calcutta leather complex so that closed tanneries could relocate faster.																								A bench of Justice M.B. Shah and Justice A.R. Lakshmanan directed the Bengal government to immediately give effluent discharge connection to the plant catering to tanneries ready to commence manufacturing.																								The court also asked the build-operate-transfer party, Dalmiya and Co, to construct and commission the second power station in the complex to make make sure adequate power was available to the relocated industries.																								Taking note of the discharge of wastewater by the tanneries into the Hooghly and the filth generated, the apex court had ordered closure of all tanneries in residential areas and directed their relocation in the leather complex at Bantala on the fringes of the city.

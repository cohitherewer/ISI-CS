The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, November 11, 2003 				 Impasse in hi-tech neglect trial 
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, Nov. 10: The first ever video-conferencing session in a consumer court in the country ended in fiasco last week.																								The session was arranged to gather evidence in the Anuradha Saha death case being heard by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The panel had ordered the session in Calcutta after lawyers employed by three doctors accused of negligence by Anuradhas husband Kunal said it would speed up the case. 																								Nothing much, however, happened between November 5 and 7, apart from the cross-examination dates being shifted to November 12, 13 and 14. 																								Both sides blamed each other for the deferment. The legal team employed by doctors Sukumar Mukherjee, Baidyanath Haldar and Abani Raychaudhuri said the session took place at the registered office of People for Better Treatment, an organisation founded by Saha. This defeated the very purpose. 																								Saha said from his US home the venue was selected because of available infrastructure.																								However, the doctors team was unhappy with the arrangements for the continent-to-continent exchange. We could see Saha but he could not see us, said a member of the doctors team.

 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Court finds tribe amp; justice for Zimba
 							 - Govt told to pay all arrears to officer OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 12: At the end of a 16-year battle, it was proved today that the state was wrong in questioning the Scheduled Tribe status of a senior government officer.																								The governments stand on Wangel Zimba not only caused him humiliation but deprived him of allowances since 1987. 																								Today, Calcutta High Court ordered the government to pay all the arrears to Zimba, a WBCS officer of the home (personnel and administrative reforms) department posted at Writers Buildings. 																								The officers counsel said the government would have to pay more than Rs 20 lakh.																								The division bench of Justice D. Seth and Justice S.K. Gupta also asked the government to pay the arrears within six months. Otherwise, a penalty of Rs 10,000 every month will have to be paid to Zimba till the dues are settled.																								In its judgment, the court expressed concern over the humiliation meted out to a WBCS officer and remarked that the authorities should have had definite information about the officers tribe before taking any penal action against him. 																								Before giving the verdict, the judges went through several books on tribals in India. 																								In 1987, the government had initiated departmental proceedings against Zimba alleging that he had falsely stated that he belonged to a Schedule Tribe. After the proceedings, payment of all allowances due to Zimba was stopped. The officer then moved the high court.																								Appearing for the state, Chandra Sekhar Das argued that the officer wanted to enjoy the opportunities and facilities available to persons in the reserve quota by introducing himself as an ST candidate. It is a crime, he said. According to Presidential Rules, 1950, Zimbas community does not come under the ST category, he added. 																								The officers counsel, L.C. Behani, argued that Zimba was a sub-caste of the Yolmo tribe of the Himalayas. The Yolmos come under the purview of the schedule according to the presidential rules. The lawyer handed over to the judges a book, The Gorkha Conquest, to substantiate his claims. He narrated to them the story of Zimbas humiliation. 																								His wife, an ST and a WBCS officer, joined the service much later but enjoys Scale 19 facilities as additional district magistrate of Darjeeling, Behani said. But my client is paid as per scale 16. 																								He also told the court that Zimba had made repeated appeals to the government requesting it to give him recognition as a tribal candidate but the state declined to hear his pleas. Due to indifference of the authorities, my client had to suffer for 16 long years, the counsel said.																								A government official said at least two similar cases were pending in court. Without naming the employees, he said they had been denied allowances that Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe officers enjoy despite having certificates to prove their status.																								In a recent judgment, the high court had said SC/ST candidates deserve favours, especially from government organisations.

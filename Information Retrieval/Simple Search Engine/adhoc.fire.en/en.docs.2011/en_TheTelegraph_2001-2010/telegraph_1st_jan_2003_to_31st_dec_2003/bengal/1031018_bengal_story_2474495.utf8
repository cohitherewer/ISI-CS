 Saturday, October 18, 2003 				 Biswas hints at pact with Congress 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Oct. 17: The state CPM leadership today talked about joining forces at the national level with political parties that follow a middle path to defeat the BJP in next years general elections.																								State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said there is no alternative to a coalition and no scope for an alliance led by a Left party. Biswas remarks were indicative of the partys intent to ally with the Congress before the next Lok Sabha elections to prevent the BJP from retaining power.																								We will have to join secular and democratic parties to put an end to forces propagating fascism and fundamentalism, Biswas said at a programme to observe the CPMs foundation day.  Pension woes																								About 700 retired primary teachers in Tamluk of East Midnapore are without pension for over 20 months in the absence of a finance officer in the district primary school council. The council chairman said he has taken up the matter with the government.

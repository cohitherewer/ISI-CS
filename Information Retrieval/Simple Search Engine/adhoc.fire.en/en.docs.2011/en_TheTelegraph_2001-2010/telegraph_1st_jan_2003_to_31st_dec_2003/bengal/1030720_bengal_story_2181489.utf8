 Sunday, July 20, 2003 				 Trinamul activist killed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, July 19: Trinamul Congress worker Sheikh Swapan Mandol was killed in broad daylight today at Kharidabegia in Nadia district, about 115 km from Calcutta.																								Mandols family filed an FIR accusing five persons, including the CPM panchayat pradhan of nearby Palitbegia, of the murder that took place around 9 am.																								Mandol, 46, was on his way to attend a Trinamul block committee meeting at Debagram when five armed men attacked him with sharp weapons, according to police.																								The attackers then shot Mandol in the head, the police said. Initial investigations suggest a row over distribution of land could be the reason behind the killing.																								From preliminary reports it seems the murder was not political, said deputy superintendent of police Dilip Chatterjee.																								The vested land was being badly distributed by the administration under the guidance of CPM leaders in the area. My husband vehemently opposed this, so they killed him, alleged Jharna Mandol, the wife of the deceased and a former member of the Nadia zilla parishad.																								When news of the killing spread, Trinamul activists gathered at the spot where Mandol was shot and prevented the police from taking away the body for about four hours. The Trinamul supporters also roughed up a police sub-inspector.																								The CPM, however, has denied that its party members were involved in the crime.

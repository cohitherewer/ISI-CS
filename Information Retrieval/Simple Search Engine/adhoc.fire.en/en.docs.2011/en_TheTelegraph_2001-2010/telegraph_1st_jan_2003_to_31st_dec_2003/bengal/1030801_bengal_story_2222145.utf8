 Friday, August 01, 2003 				 Trinamul ties with BJP under test
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, July 31: The BJPs relationship with the Trinamul Congress today came under strain after Mamata Banerjees party threatened to sever all links.																								Trinamul general secretary Debapriyo Saha said his party would have no trucks with the BJP from now on as it was trying to split the Trinamul in the district. He said the party was considering dismantling the Englishbazar municipal board which, the Trinamul had formed with the help of the BJP. We may withdraw support from several BJP-led panchayats as well. 																								The district Trinamul leadership seethed with rage after Pranab Ghosh, a Trinamul member of the Habibpur panchayat samiti, was elected karmadhaksya with the help of the BJP today.																								 We had asked the BJP not to vote for him as we did not want that post. But they still went ahead. They have not only broken the alliance but are trying to split our party by backing Trinamul leaders of their choice, Saha said.																								District BJP president Adhir Karmakar dismissed the no- trucks threat as hot air.

 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 Enter, correctional centres
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Jan. 18: With a dozen of inmates on their way to becoming computer literates, the Central Jail here is finally justifying the governments move to change the names of prisons to correctional centres.																								For Chand Bihari Pal of Salar, Mohammed Kazem Ali of Malda and Krishnendu Chakraborty of Calcutta, there is hope once they serve out their sentences. The three are among the dozen who have undergone a computer education courses recently, the eligibility for which was clearing the secondary examinations. 																								We are now a full-fledged correctional centre and the first batch of computer literate inmates is a tremendous achievement for us, jail superintendent Dulal Chandra Saha said. Two computers were sent here by jail minister Biswanath Chowdhury in July last year, Saha said. We allowed the 12 students to use the computers in shifts and the local MP, Adhir Chowdhury, sent a teacher to the jail to instruct the students, he added.																								At first I thought that learning to operate a computer was not my cup of tea. I last studied some time ago, but now I am always itching to sit down with a keyboard and a mouse, Pal said. 																								Fake CDs seized																								Police have seized around 700 pirated video CDs during raids conducted in Siliguri over the past few days, reports our correspondent. Two persons have been arrested and two disc writers confiscated. The seizures have brought to light the modus operandi of some organised groups, who are into the business of distributing fake CDs.

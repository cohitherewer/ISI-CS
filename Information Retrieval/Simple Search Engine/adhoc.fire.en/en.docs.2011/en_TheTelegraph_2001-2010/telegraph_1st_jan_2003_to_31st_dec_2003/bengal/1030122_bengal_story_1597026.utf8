The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, January 22, 2003 				 Sudarshan returns to taste fruits of labour
 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Calcutta, Jan. 21: Kuhapalli Sitaramaiah Sudarshan has returned to his residence for 12 years to taste the fruits of his labour between 1977 and 1989.																								Speaking to The Telegraph in between parleys with senior swayamsevaks and monks at a private, closed-door meeting in south Calcutta, the RSS chief expressed confidence that things were taking a turn for the better for his organisation and, consequently, for the country.																								Though all the anti-Hindu forces are coalescing against us, we will win the battle, he said, adding that the RSS was doing everything everywhere (including Bengal) to unite the Hindu samaj.																								The report he got about the state RSS units progress last year  it increased its strength from 1,100 shakhas to 1,500 (unparalleled in the state and a rare event for any other state unit) has pleased him, senior RSS volunteers said.																								It could be termed a personal victory for him as what we are now reaping is the result of his painstaking effort when he stayed here between 1977 and 1989, one of them said. Sudarshan was then the kshetra pracharak (area-in-charge) of the entire eastern and northeastern region, extending from Assam to Orissa, he added. 																								The region now contributes a chunk of the 30,000-odd shakhas across India.																								But the man, who used to live either at 84 Asutosh Mukherjee Road (an RSS office) or the Keshab Bhavan headquarters in north Calcutta (where he would return for the night) during the entire period, very attentively heard out  in Bengali  some worrying aspects of the consolidation as well.																								There were complaints, particularly from the Purbanchal Kalyan Ashram (state wing of the Akhil Bharatiya Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram, the same force used by Narendra Modi in Gujarats tribal areas to counter the organisationally-stronger Congress), that police officials and intelligence agencies were always tailing their volunteers, raiding their offices and coercing their followers.																								Similar complaints from the monks of the Bharat Sevashram Sangh, considered to be one of the most pacific and benevolent wings of the large Hindu parivar, made Sudarshan sit up and take notice. 																								I will definitely try to do what is possible, he said in a Bengali marked by little accent as Bharat Sevashram Sangh monks poured out their litany of complaints.

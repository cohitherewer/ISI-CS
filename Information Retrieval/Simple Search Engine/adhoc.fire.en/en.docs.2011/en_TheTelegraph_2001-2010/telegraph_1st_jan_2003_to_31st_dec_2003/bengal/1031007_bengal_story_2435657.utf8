 Tuesday, October 07, 2003 				 CPM leader butchered after quarrel over meat
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Oct. 6: A quarrel over sharing meat at a Puja feast ended in the alleged murder of a local CPM leader. 																								Two party supporters, who were picked up along with their leader by alleged Congressmen at Sujapur village in Ketugram, about 250 km from Calcutta, were seriously wounded. Bagai Ghosh and Aloka Ghosh told police from their beds in the Katwa Subdivisional Hospital how Baneswar Ghosh, 45, was hacked to death and his body mutilated. 																								The police are yet to trace Baneswars body. Superintendent K.C. Meena said four persons, including three women, have been arrested. We have launched a search for the body. Parts of it were thrown into the Bhagirathi, the injured told the police.																								Trouble erupted over sharing meat at the feast organised by villagers to celebrate Dashami. Baneswar apparently tried to settle the quarrel between two groups of women. But the intervention worsened the situation. 																								The police said a clash broke out after a group of suspected members of the Opposition party arrived. In the melee, the gang whisked away Baneswar, Bagai and Aloka. The trio was taken to the river bank, where Baneswar was cut to pieces. Residents of Sujapur arrived in time to save Bagai and Aloka. Doctors described their condition as serious,																								State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said in Calcutta Congress workers from Behrampore in Murshidabad masterminded the murder. He claimed that 13 party workers were killed in the area in the past two years.																								 Local CPM leaders admitted that clashes were common since the CPM and the Congress bagged eight seats each in the Sujapur panchayat in the May polls. The CPM, however, took control of the village body after a toss. 																								Rabindranath Chatterjee, the Congress MLA from Katwa, said last nights clash was a sequel to fights within the CPM.

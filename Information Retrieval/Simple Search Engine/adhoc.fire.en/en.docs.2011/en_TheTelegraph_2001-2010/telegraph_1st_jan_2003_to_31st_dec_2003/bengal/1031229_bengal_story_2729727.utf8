The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 CPM reviews stand on Cong
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Dec. 28: With  the Congress suffering a major setback in the Assembly polls  in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the CPM politburo  is likely to reconsider its decision to support the party  in the Lok Sabha elections next year. 																								In a shift from its traditional one-day meeting, the politburo will meet in Hyderabad for two days from January 28. A two-day meeting of the partys central committee will follow.																								In the states that went to polls, the CPM had lent support to the Congress in constituencies where it did not have its own candidate. The Congress suffered a drubbing but the CPM did not fare any better. The party, which had contested 35 seats in three states, won only two  a seat each in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The poll results will also come up for discussion at the Hyderabad meeting, sources said.																								CPM leaders in favour of backing the Congress are likely to face flak from party colleagues at the meeting. Politburo members like Jyoti Basu and party general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet, known for nursing a soft corner for the Congress, will be in the line of fire of younger leaders like Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechuri. The duo has always had reservations about ties with the Congress. 																								Some senior CPM leaders believe reviving the Third Front will be impossible for the CPM as all its former allies are directly or indirectly siding with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in Delhi. 																								Telugu Desam Party leader . Chandrababu Naidu, who was once the convener of the front, is now part of the NDA. Former Bihar chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav is eager to build ties with the Congress and has not shown any interest in the front. Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, another former front leader, has been cordial with the BJP leadership of late.

 Tuesday, November 04, 2003 				 Patient vanishes
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 3: A 45-year-old man who was admitted to the MR Bangur Hospital on Saturday with acute abdominal pain went missing from his bed today.																								Family members detected the absence of Dilip Santra when they came to see him in the evening. They demanded an explanation from the hospital authorities. How can the nurses and ward boys fail to notice a patient walking out? Is this how you run the hospital? asked Santras sister Shivani Naskar.																								The hospital authorities told Naskar they did not have any idea where Santra could be. A complaint had been lodged with the police by then. The police mounted a search in and around the hospital. It yielded no result. I have nothing to say, hospital superintendent Debasish Haldar said. Naskar alleged lack of concern and rudeness on the part of the hospital employees. 																								Santra, a resident of Champahati in Baruipur, South 24-Parganas, had been admitted to the emergency ward of the hospital.																								Two patients, Anil Jana and Swapan Mondol, went missing from the SSKM Hospital recently. Another patient, Santosh Hela, who went missing from the Howrah State General Hospital, was found dead near a garbage vat on the hospital premises.

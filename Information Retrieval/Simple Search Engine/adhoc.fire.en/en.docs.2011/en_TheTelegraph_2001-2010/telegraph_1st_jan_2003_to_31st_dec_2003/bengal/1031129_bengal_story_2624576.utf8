 Saturday, November 29, 2003 				 Policemen face probe 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 28: The high court today directed the Hooghly superintendent of police to inquire into an allegation that a Chandernagore businessman was picked up on some charge and later implicated in another case. 																								Biplad Upadhyay, a phone booth owner, was threatened with dire consequences when he finally asked policemen making calls from his shop to pay up. Since then, the police were implicating him in one case after the other just to harass him. In July, he was accused of stealing jute goods. He was denied bail by the Chandernagore court but obtained one from the high court, said his lawyer. The police then accused Upadhyay of plotting a murder. He told the court that he evaded arrest by bribing an officer. 																								The superintendent was asked to submit a report in court by December 10.

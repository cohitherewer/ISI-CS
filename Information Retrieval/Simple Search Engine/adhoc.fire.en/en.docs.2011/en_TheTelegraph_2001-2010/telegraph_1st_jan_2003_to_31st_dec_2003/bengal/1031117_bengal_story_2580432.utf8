 Monday, November 17, 2003 				 Maoist scare on Nepal border 
 PROBIR PRAMANIK																								Kakarvitta (eastern Nepal), Nov. 16: Maoist guerrillas carried out a daring ambush on a Royal Nepal Army border patrol here hours before chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was supposed to address the Citu rally, about 3 km away.																								Armed with Chinese 9mm pistols, the rebels wounded two army men before fleeing along the Mechi riverbed. The foray, 100 m from the Kakarvitta police station, is the first by the outfit on the eastern border of the Himalayan kingdom. 																								Indian security forces went into a tizzy as Bhattacharjee was to visit Naxalbari and the whereabouts of the militants were not known. The chief ministers arrival was delayed by nearly an hour as security agencies tried to ensure that the Maoists did not sneak into Indian territory. It seems they have slipped back into Nepal, police superintendent Sanjay Chander said after a futile hunt.

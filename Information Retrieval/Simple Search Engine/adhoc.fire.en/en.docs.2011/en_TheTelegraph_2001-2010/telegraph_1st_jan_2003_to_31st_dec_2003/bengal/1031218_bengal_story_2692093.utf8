The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Bid to protect varsity control 
 SUNANDO SARKAR Calcutta, Dec. 17: The  government has set out on a mission to stall a central move  that may end in universities slipping out of its control.																								A recent note from the University Grants Commission (UGC), circulated among state higher education departments, looks at prospects of varsities without governing bodies, which comprise elected members and monitor and control every aspect of the institution. 																								The note, titled Model Act for the Universities of the Twenty-First Century, seeks to ascertain the response of the governments to governing bodies without elected members and without powers to recommend guidelines to the universities.																								The Bengal government has received the note that has a detailed questionnaire tagged along. But it seems the CPM has prodded a teachers association known to be controlled by the party to frame the official response. 																								The West Bengal College and University Teachers Association discussed the issue at its general meeting on December 14. But its leaders were faced with questions from sections that oppose the governments policy of keeping higher education institutions under its wings, said sources in the largest representative organisation of college and university teachers.																								A section of the association argued that what the government and the party (or the association) are now opposing is already being implemented in some state-run institutions. They pointed out that the West Bengal University of Health Sciences does not have a single elected member in its general council or executive council and the statutes are similar in the West Bengal University of Technology and the Uttar Banga Krishi Visvavidyalay.																								The UGC note envisages a futuristic university that is less susceptible to political pressure and moots the concept of a powerless governing body (known by different names  from syndicate and senate in Calcutta University to court and executive council elsewhere) having only deliberative and consultative powers. Most of these bodies are packed with elected CPM sympathisers.

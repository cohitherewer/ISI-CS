 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, April 16: A National Volunteer Force member guarding the zilla parishad office locked himself up this morning and threatened to kill himself if any one approached the room or tried to break in.																								The standoff continued till late this evening when the man, who has two loaded rifles, said he would take a decision tomorrow at 8 am.																								Last night, 50-year-old Humayun Shiekh, along with three other men from the force, was put on duty to guard the building. This morning, Humayun ordered his three colleagues out of the room at gunpoint and locked himself in.																								He kept telling us to stay away as he would shoot himself if we tried to do anything, said Khagen Mondal, one of the guards. We were very scared as he had two .303 rifles and over 50 rounds of live ammunition.																								Police rushed to the spot but Humayun asked them to get a written order from the President if they wanted him to come out. His mother and brother, who came from Plassey, said he was having problems with his wife and was depressed.

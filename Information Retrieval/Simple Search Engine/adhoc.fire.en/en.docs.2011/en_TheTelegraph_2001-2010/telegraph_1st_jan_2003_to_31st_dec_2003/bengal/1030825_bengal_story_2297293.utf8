 UTTAM DUTTA				 	 Kalu being operated on. Telegraph picture																								Mankundu (Hooghly), Aug. 24: Kalu was crossing a busy and bustling Mankundu Station Road last week when a Sumo took a sharp turn and hit him on the head. His left eye popped out with a flush of blood. 																								Kalu lay writhing in pain. No one seemed to care, till Shamima Rahaman stumbled on the stray dog with a hanging and sore left eye on Friday. 																								Rahaman, who works in a private firm, took Kalu to veterinary surgeon Kunal Chakraborty, who cares for one of the most marginalised populations in society, stray animals. 																								Chakraborty operated on Kalus eye on Sunday. He was assisted by five others during the surgery inside a building under construction. Kalu was anaesthetised and injected saline. The blood clots were carefully removed, the eyeball put in its place, stitched and bandaged. The operation that began at 12.30 pm went on till 3. 																								Kalus other eye would have been infected and he would have turned blind if the operation was not conducted, said Chakraborty. 																								Kalu may not able to see with his left eye though. His vision in this eye could have been retained had we met him earlier, Chakraborty added. 																								The surgeons sympathy for stray animals has earned him the status of a local hero. The vet from Talikhola in Chinsurah took his degree from West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences in 2000 and became an MD in 2002. 																								Chakrabortys patients include stray cats, dogs and cattle. In July, he vaccinated 195 such animals and is now setting up Antorik, a hospital on 7 cottahs off Delhi Road.

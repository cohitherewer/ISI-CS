 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 Ballot debut in sibling rivalry
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, April 30: For Haradhan Sarkar and Krishnakanta Sarkar, the Trinamul Congress and CPM candidates for the Paharpur gram panchayat, its not quite a brotherly contest.																								The brothers will fight each other for booth 17/152 of Sadar block in Jalpaiguri on May 11. While Haradhan is a veteran  he was a Congress gram panchayat member for 15 years before switching allegiance to Mamata Banerjee in 1995  his sibling is a new entrant to politics. 																								The brothers are campaigning vigorously but are making sure that their supporters do not launch a personal attack. I am not resorting to any personal attack. As a Trinamul candidate, my campaign is focusing on the development work that I have undertaken in the district, said Haradhan. 																								Krishnakanta, on the other hand, is stressing on issues like backwardness and non-development of the area. During the Congress era, nothing was done to ensure drinking water facilities, electrification and transportation in the area. But I know that the candidate against whom I am contesting is my brother and am, therefore, cautious about what I say, he said. 																								Their house at Milpara is a picture of political bonhomie as it has been converted into a joint party office of the CPM and Trinamul. Both the sickle-hammer-star and the tri-coloured-grass-flower are fluttering side by side.																								For the 820 voters, however, its a difficult choice. Balen Roy has known the brothers for a long time. Both are known to us. While Haradhan had contested earlier and had won the seat as a Congress candidate, it is the first election for Krishnakanta. We are in a fix about whom to vote for, he said. 																								Palash Roy, a neighbour, said he would like both to win. How can I vote for just one of them? I have known them since they were children. Its a difficult choice, he said.																								Haradhan has contested several elections. Till the 1993 polls, I was a member of the gram panchayat for 15 years as a Congress candidate. Then in the byelection in 1995, I won the seat on a Trinamul ticket. 																								For Krishnakanta, it is the first ballot battle. This is the first time that I am contesting in the panchayat level. But I feel that if the people want development in the village, they will vote for me, he said.

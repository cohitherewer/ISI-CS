The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Doctors bill in pipeline
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept.16: The government today said it will bring a bill in the winter session of the Assembly making renewal of doctors registrations with the state medical council compulsory every five years after a refresher course. 																								Director of medical education C.R. Maity said the West Bengal Medical Council Act will be amended. Doctors would have to pay a fee to get their registrations renewed after the 30-hour course. 																								They need to refresh their knowhow frequently because of the rapid developments in medical science, said a health official. 																								Doctors who had passed out long ago and were busy with private practice need to update their knowledge to treat patients better, said Maity. The government will form its own panel of specialists to conduct the refresher course. We are describing it as continuous medical education that is essential for every doctor, said a health official.																								Doctors from the Indian Medical Association had met officials at Writers Buildings last year and recommended that such a move would help the doctors keep themselves abreast with the latest developments. We also stressed the need for vigil to ensure that the doctors were pursuing their lectures, said Subir Ganguly, an IMA functionary.																								A large number of doctors are dependent on medical representatives and pharmaceutical companies for new medicines and ways of treatment and they are not getting enough opportunity to research and update themselves. The governments move will be of immense help, said a physician.

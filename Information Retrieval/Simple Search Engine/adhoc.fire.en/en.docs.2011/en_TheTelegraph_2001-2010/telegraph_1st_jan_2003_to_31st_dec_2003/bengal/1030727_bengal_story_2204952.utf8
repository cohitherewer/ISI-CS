The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, July 27, 2003 				 Two transfers in 7 days for police brass
 TAMAL SENGUPTA Calcutta, July 26: Transfers  are routine in government service. But twice in seven days? 																								The unexpected happened about a week ago when the state director-general of police issued fresh transfer orders to 19 of the 29 officers he had transferred to different parts of Bengal barely seven days ago.																								Director-general D.C. Vajpai issued the first order (No. 3667/PER/GA-1/PER GA-1/2/2003) on July 11 which transferred 29 deputy superintendents of police. On July 18, he issued another order transferring 19 of these 29 officials to other places. 																								The second order has stunned the 200-odd DSP rank officials. No director-general, they said, has issued such contradictory and whimsical orders in the 26 years that the Left Front has been in power in the state. 																								The first transfer order was issued in public interest. The second one, too, was issued for the same purpose. We fail to understand why the DGP had to transfer 19 officials whom he had already transferred a week ago and ask them to join their new positions, said a senior official. 																								However, the DSPs are not in a position to take up the issue with the director-general as they do not have any union or association to argue their case. Constables and IPS officers have their own associations. But we are not allowed to form any association to highlight the problems we are facing in discharging our duties. We had approached senior police officials in the state and urged them to allow us to form an association of our own. But our plea was turned down, said a DSP. 																								The Left Front government had recognised the right of lower ranking police officials to form unions after it came to power in 1977. Following the governments green signal, these officials of Calcutta and state police formed their own unions and got affiliation from Citu, the trade union wing of the CPM, or Intuc, the labour arm of the Congress. 																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his predecessor Jyoti Basu address the open conference of the Citu-affiliated union at the city police headquarters in Lalbazar. But the DSPs are not being allowed to form their own association, reasons for which is best known to the government. 																								As per norms of the all-India police administration, 78 DSP rank officials from Bengal are supposed to be promoted to the rank of IPS officers depending on vacancies. Sixty-nine officials have already been promoted, but nine posts are still vacant. 																								The government is not sympathetic to us and does not bother to take the initiative to promote nine DSP rank officials to fill up the vacant posts of nine IPS rank officials. We cant approach the government as we dont have any association of our own, said an official.																								The director-general, when contacted, refused to comment.

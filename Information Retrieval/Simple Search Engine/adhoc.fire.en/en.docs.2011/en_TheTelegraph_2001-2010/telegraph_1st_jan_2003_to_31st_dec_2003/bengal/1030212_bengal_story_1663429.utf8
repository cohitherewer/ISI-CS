 Wednesday, February 12, 2003 				 School kids crushed by speeding van
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Suri, Feb. 11: Three infants were crushed to death and another critically injured when a speeding car ran them over here this morning. An angry mob torched the vehicle but the driver and the occupants had managed to flee by then.																								A Maruti van travelling at a very high speed lost control and ran over the four children from Rakshakalitala near Suri at about 10.30 am when they were going to a local primary school.																								Residents who witnessed the accident rushed the children to hospital, where Seema Das, 7, was declared brought dead. Shibu Das and Rupa Das, both aged 5, died in hospital. Dani Das was said to be in a critical condition.																								We saw the van going towards Sainthia at a very high speed and when it flashed past us we said that the driver was going to cause an accident. Moments later, we heard a crash and screams. I was chatting with friends and we rushed to find the bodies of the four children lying in a pool of blood and the car parked on the roadside, abandoned, said Tarun Das, an eyewitness.																								Police said a mob gathered at the spot and set the van on fire after the children were taken to hospital. 																								The residents squatted on the road and held up traffic for about an hour till police intervened and brought the situation under control.

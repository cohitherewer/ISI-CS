 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Shouting match over rail suspension
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, Dec. 28: Two supervisers were suspended today in connection with yesterdays accident in which 11 coaches of the Delhi-bound Brahmaputra Mail jumped rails near Old Malda Station. 																								Divisional manager of Northeast Frontier Railways Katihar division Kulbhushan said the accident was caused by a technical fault and lack of monitoring of track conditions. The inquiry is on. We have suspended two signalling supervisors after preliminary investigations, he said.																								A four-member team from the NFRs head office at Malegaon in Assam arrived in Old Malda last evening to probe into the cause of the disaster. The team is headed by NFRs chief safety engineer .C. Trivedi. It is learnt that the team has recommended the suspension of six officers of the signalling department.																								The divisional railway manager, however, did not agree with Trivedis recommendation. Kulbhushan had a heated argument with Trivedi regarding the suspension recommendation. It is not possible for me to place six officers under suspension. If we do this, we will have to suspend the movement of trains as well, Kulbhushan shouted while communicating with the safety engineer on his mobile, standing on the Old Malda station platform.																								Kulbhushan informed Trivedi that there was a shortage of officers and engineers since many of them had already been served showcause notices earlier for shoddy work. Dilip Kumar Agarwal, additional divisional railway manager of NFRs Katihar division, blamed the accident on the lack of preparedness of the staff. 																								The cabin man engaged the lever to ensure that the train took track number four. The hitch occurred at the point where the tracks interchange because people manning the signalling system did not work properly. The train jumped tracks when the system forced the wheels on both track four and track six, Agarwal said. He added that a goods train had passed through track six before the Brahmaputra Mail without any problem.																								Following the accident, the NFR is now busy removing derailed coaches and repairing tracks. Since yesterday, Kulbhushan and his deputy have been camping in a tent pitched near the accident site. A crane was used to remove nine of the 11 coaches of the derailed train. Normal services are expected to resume from tomorrow.

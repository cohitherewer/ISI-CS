 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, May 18: Two Congress supporters were killed in separate incidents at Shamsergunj in Murshidabad over the past two days and two men injured the day after the panchayat poll succumbed to injuries. 																								The four deaths since Saturday took the toll since the May 11 poll to 24 in the district. 																								The Congress claimed that the twin murders were the handiwork of the CPM and related to the poll but district superintendent of police Virendra said they were unrelated.																								Hossein Sheikh, 20, was killed with a sharp weapon near a video hall on Saturday evening. Bahiruddin Sheikh, 42, was pulled out of his house and shot dead by miscreants at Lashkarpur village this morning.																								After fighting for life for six days, Hasemoddin Sheikh, 35, a resident of Jhulanpur village in Nabagram, died today. He was admitted to Behrampore Hospital on May 12. Hasemoddin was injured when the bombs he was carrying exploded.																								Tansu Sheikh, a 70-year-old resident of Dihi village in Suti, died on Saturday night at Jangipur Subdivisional Hospital. A Congress supporter, Tansu was hit on the head with a stone during a clash between CPM and Congress supporters during an alleged booth-capturing incident. 																								After the deaths of three partymen in two days, Congress president of Jangipur sub-division Sheikh Nizamuddin said: One of our supporters was killed a stones throw away from the Shankarpur police picket. The police were onlookers because the CPM was involved. We will call for a bandh in Jangipur if the killers are not arrested immediately. 																								The district CPM brushed aside the charge saying old rivalry and land disputes led to the murders.

 Saturday, May 10, 2003 				 Chowdhury back in chase village
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Barasat, May 9: An aggrieved PWD minister and RSP leader Amar Chowdhury today returned to address a meeting at Jeliakhali in North 24-Parganas, where he was heckled allegedly by CPM workers two days ago. 																								Still smarting under the humiliation of being chased away from the village, Chowdhury today took on the CPM, the Big Brother in the ruling coalition. 																								The CPM is gradually losing control over its grassroots workers, who are no better than hooligans, he said amid applause from RSP supporters. If the CPM does not rein in these unwanted elements, it is difficult for parties like ours to stay within the Left Front.																								Chowdhury added that the RSP will not compromise with the CPM if it continues to pamper the goons. We may be a small party but we will not tolerate highhandedness, he said.																								Tension ran high at Jeliakhali with the CPM holding a rally close to the venue where Chowdhury addressed one late in the evening. RSP and CPM supporters demarcated their areas with party flags. 																								Elaborate police arrangements were made. Senior leaders from both parties were also seen camping in the area to desist party workers from indulging in any violence. 																								There is tension in the area and our forces have been alerted to thwart any attempt to start a fresh clash, said Swapan Purnapatra, an additional superintendent of police.

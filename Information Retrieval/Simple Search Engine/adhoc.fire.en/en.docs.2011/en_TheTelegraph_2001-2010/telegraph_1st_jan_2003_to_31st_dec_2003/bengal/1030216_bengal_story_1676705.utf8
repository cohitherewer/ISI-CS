The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 Black taint on tuition fees
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Purulia, Feb. 15: The government today fired another salvo in its battle against private tuition when school education minister Kanti Biswas said teachers still engaged in the practice are earning black money as the fees they charge are unaccounted for. 																								Inaugurating the 26th state conference of the West Bengal Government Schoolteachers Association here, Biswas said: Those teachers who offer private tuition dont disclose their earnings from their tuition to the income-tax department. They are thus generating and earning black money. What else would you call it. 																								The state government had earlier tried to clamp a ban on private tuition, but failed. Observers feel that the fresh charge against the teachers who coach students outside school is another step in its mission to stop private tuition.																								Teachers, especially those in government schools, need to be disciplined as they have the responsibility of educating and laying the foundation for the future of the majority of children in the state. I have been a minister in the education department since 1982 and all through I have seen a shortage of lady teachers. But they are required more to teach primary schoolchildren who need more care and attention, Biswas said.																								The minister lamented the delay in filling up vacant teaching posts by the West Bengal Public Service Commission (WBPSC). Each school has about seven to eight vacancies and these should be filled up immediately for the betterment of the students, he observed. 																								At the same time, he pointed out that 95 per cent of the budget outlay for education was spent on paying salaries to teachers. 																								RSP man murdered																								An RSP supporter was murdered at Basanti, allegedly by CPM activists. South 24-Parganas RSP secretary Subhas Naskar alleged that a group of CPM activists called Amir Ali Naskar from his residence early this morning and killed him.

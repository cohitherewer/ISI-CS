 Thursday, July 17, 2003 				 Workers wage war at hospital
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, July 16: Work came to a virtual standstill at the medical college and hospital here after a demonstration by Group-D employees protesting the alleged assault of a colleague by a house physician.																								Trouble at the hospital, which went without electricity from Friday evening to Monday afternoon, apparently began when Pradip De went to the enteric diseases ward with an upset stomach last Thursday.																								De alleged that the physician on duty, Aloke Singh, did not attend to him and was busy talking to nurses. When I became angry, he wrote a prescription asking me to buy an injection worth Rs 400. I then went to Dr Jaman at the emergency ward who said the injection could be fatal if I took it.., he said.																								De added that as he was returning to his quarters last night, Singh and two nurses beat him up. Singh said it was De who assaulted him on Thursday after abusing him when he was busy examining patients. 																								A probe committee has been set up but employees gave the superintendent 72 hours to take action against Singh.

 Tuesday, May 20, 2003 				 Sonia happy with Cong count, just 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 19: Sonia Gandhi is happy with the outcome of the panchayat poll. Not very happy. 																								The Congress president conveyed her views on the poll results when state unit chief Pranab Mukherjee briefed her today. 																								Sonia, Mukherjee said, was happy that the Congress re-established itself as the main alternative to the Left Front and took away the mantle from its splinter party, the Trinamul Congress. At the same time, Sonia was not very happy because she felt the party could have done better to close in on the CPM-led front. 																								She endorsed Mukherjees move to hold a convention of the newly-elected members to the three-tier panchayat. She will attend the meet, to be held in July.  Reservation snag																								Reservation of rail tickets was disrupted at 245 centres across eastern India as the system failed. The snag hit counters between 12.20 and two this afternoon.

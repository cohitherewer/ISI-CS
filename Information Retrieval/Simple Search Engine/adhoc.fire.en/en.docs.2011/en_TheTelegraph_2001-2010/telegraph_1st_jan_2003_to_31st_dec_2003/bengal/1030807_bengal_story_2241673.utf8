 Thursday, August 07, 2003 				 Border talks to trace lost girl 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Tehatta (Nadia), Aug. 6: The Border Security Force has begun talks with the Bangladesh Rifles to try and trace 13-year-old Pallabi Roy, who went missing from near her house in Sahapur village on the Indo-Bangla border a fortnight ago. 																								The move comes after preliminary police investigation said the girl was abducted by two persons from Bangladesh. Police sources said Bangladesh police has told the BDR that the kidnappers had taken the girl towards Dhaka and they were trying to trace her. 																								We are doing our best to assist the BSF in mounting pressure on the BDR by providing them the latest information about Pallabis probable location in Bangladesh, said Pallab Kanti Ghosh, additional superintendent of police. We may have to approach the Bangladesh High Commission as a last resort if the BDR does not take any fruitful action to rescue the girl, he added.																								Police said two rogues, Tutul Sheikh and Jabbar Ali, from Buripota village in Meherpur district of Bangladesh, kidnapped Pallabi when she was herding cattle in a paddy field close to her house. 																								Pallabis father first approached the SDO, who asked him to file a kidnapping case with the police and directed the Tehatta police to communicate with the BSF of the Sahapur outpost till the girl is rescued. 																								The complaint was lodged on July 5 and acting on it, Tehatta sub-divisional police officer Swapan Sarkar visited the frontier village last Friday and spoke to the BSF personnel and villagers.

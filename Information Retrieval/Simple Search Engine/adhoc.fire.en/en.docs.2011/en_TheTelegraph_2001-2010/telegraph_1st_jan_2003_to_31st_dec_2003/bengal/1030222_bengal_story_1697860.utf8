 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 21: Two days after creating history by transplanting a male sex organ, doctors at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital said the babies, the donor and the recipient, were responding to medicine.																								The seven-month boy, on whom the male organ was transplanted, was kept under immuno-suppression and a dose of steroids and antibiotics. Doctors today withdrew the intravenous feed and put the child on normal diet. 																								The baby is doing quite well and we are happy with the progress, said Ashok Roy, member of the medical faculty of the pediatric surgery department of NRS. 																								The organ was taken from a boy with two genitals. The blood groups of both the children matched, making it possible for the paediatric surgeons to carry out the operation.																								Messages poured into NRS since The Telegraph broke the news. Eminent paediatric surgeon and president of the Indian Association of Paediatric Surgery K.L. Rao congratulated Roy.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Oct. 11: The Burdwan Medical College and Hospital witnessed chaos for over two hours today when some residents, including the relatives of a patient, gheraoed the hospital superintendent to protest a doctors alleged assault on a woman.																								The agitators demanded stern action against D.P. Koner, a visiting professor of medicine at the hospital, for allegedly misbehaving with Fatema Bibi when she had gone to him yesterday to enquire about her mother, Fajera Bibi.																								An ailing Fajera, a resident of Patikhel Danga, a few kilometres from Burdwan town, was admitted to the hospital on October 7 with a high fever and headache. The doctor (Koner) not only misbehaved  with my sister when she asked him if my mother was responding  to the treatment, but even discharged my mother from the  hospital. This is gross injustice, Fajera Bibis son Fazlul  Rahman alleged in his complaint with the police.

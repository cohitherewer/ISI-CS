 Tuesday, February 25, 2003 				 Villagers lynch dacoit at large
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kakdwip (South 24-Parganas), Feb. 24: A suspected dacoit was lynched and two of his associates seriously injured early today when villagers fed up with police took law into their hands.																								Residents of Uttar Gobindapur village here attacked Uday Goal, 30, and Mahadeb Pathak as they were coming out of the house of Bapi Pathak, a notorious criminal. They had allegedly spent the night there planning a robbery.																								All the three have criminal records against their names, said Kakdwip sub-divisional police officer Amitava Verma.																								Uday died in the sub-divisional hospital of the brick and bamboo wounds he suffered at the hands of the mob. Mahadeb, who tried to flee, was rounded up and beaten up.																								Another group went to Bapis residence, dragged him out and thrashed him in front of his family members. Their repeated pleas and attempts to rescue him were in vain.																								Mahadeb and Bapi are still in hospital.																								What happened today was a natural outburst that might happen any day, said Trinamul Congress legislator from Kakdwip Mantu Pakhira. The residents were angry with the police because several complaints had been lodged in connection with a number of recent robberies in the area but the police did not react, he added.																								The residents were suspicious about the motive behind their assembly, Pakhira said. 																								Uday was wanted in at least 12 cases of murder and extortion. He had been arrested in connection with a number of cases, said Verma. The two others also had criminal records and had been in jail earlier, he added.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, July 6: Two friends left home for a park here after tuition yesterday morning. Their bodies were fished out of a lake there.																								The marks of injury on Mithun Das and Jyotirmoy Das, Class XI students in the Taraknath High School here, have led police to believe they were murdered and thrown into the pond.																								The parents had lodged complaints with the New Township police station when the boys failed to return home.																								Mithun went to Jyotirmoys house at Santosh Park around 10 am. He had just returned home from private tuition when Mithun came to our house. Both the boys left for the lake at Saptarshi Park, which is still under construction. We started panicking when neither returned home by 2 pm, said Jyotirmoys uncle, Jayanta Das.																								His father, Swapan Das, had alerted his friends in the locality and they mounted a search. The youths who accompanied Swapan found the shoes and clothes of the boys on the bank of the lake. Some of them dived in. 																								Mithuns father Pravat Kusum Das, a former employee of Hindustan Fertilizers, was among those waiting anxiously on the bank when his body was pulled out. He was bruised in the neck and under the eyes.																								Jyotirmoy remained untraced till late last night.																								A police team arrived after Mithuns body was found. Nets were laid in the lake. Jyotirmoys naked body was caught in the net around 11 pm. The marks of injury were apparent. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem tests.																								Swapan, a security staff of a bank, and his family had moved into their new house a couple of months ago. Mithun lived in neighbouring Auroville Park and his family had shared a friendly relationship with Jyotirmoys.																								The FIR lodged jointly by the two families said the boys were accompanied by another youth when they were moving around the lake yesterday, said a senior police officer. Some local cow-herds told us they had seen the two boys moving around the lake and they were accompanied by another youth. We dont know who the youth was but we suspect that our sons were murdered as their bodies bore several marks of injury, the parents said.																								Neighbours said the boys had no known rivalry with anybody. Both of them had passed the Madhyamik examination last year in the first division and taken admission in the high school, one of the better institutions in Durgapur.

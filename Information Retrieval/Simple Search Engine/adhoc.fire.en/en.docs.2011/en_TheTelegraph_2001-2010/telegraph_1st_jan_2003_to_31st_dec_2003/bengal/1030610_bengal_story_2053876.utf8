The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 10, 2003 				 Sunderbans arms channel to south
 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Calcutta, June 9: The Andhra Pradesh unit of the Peoples War Group has established a direct link with procurers who bring in arms from Bangladesh-based ISI agents via the riverine Sunderbans route.																								This marks a well-defined change in the hitherto-known and tenuous relationship between the extreme Left organisations Andhra unit and the ISI agents operating from the south Bengal delta, said officials here. The deals between the Naxalite outfit and the arms agents used to be through middlemen in the past, they added.																								Another aspect of the recent liaison between the Andhra-based guerillas and the ISIs arms-disposing wing is the complete absence of any involvement of the Peoples War unit of Bengal, said intelligence officials.																								Those in the organisation corroborated this version. We were kept in the dark about any such operation, a source from the organisation admitted, though he gave a different explanation for the lack of co-ordination.																								Two arms consignments have found their way to Andhra in the past two months, according to reports available here. Taking advantage of the links (both road and rail) between East Midnapore and Orissa, which border each other, the consignments travelled from the Contai sub-division to Koraput in Orissa before reaching Dandakaranya  the self-styled liberated region of the Naxalites. From there, the cache moved to Adilabad in Andhra.																								A rail-head  with a direct link to places in Orissa  exists near the off-loading point (in East Midnapores Khejuri block) for the arms from Bangladesh and that helps the rebels immensely, said officials. The road-route to Orissa, too, bisects Contai and, after that, transport is not a problem.																								Besides the change in the nature of the ISI-Naxalite links, the nature of arms being shipped has changed as well. Officials here said the Andhra outfit, which till very recently depended a lot on looting police stations for procuring rifles, has now turned its focus on hand-launched weapons that can target vehicles.																								The basic nature of the transaction, however, has not changed. Money still changes hands and the deal is essentially financial in nature, said officials. Its not yet a cash-less transaction to help the Naxalites, one of them said.																								But the lack of involvement of the Peoples War unit of the state is the only silver lining for intelligence agencies here. 																								Though Peoples War sources attributed the lack of involvement to a difference in goals (the Andhra unit has fewer qualms about targeting the establishment, they said), officials feel the real reason is something different. 																								The Peoples War unit here has lost all credibility in the eyes of the units elsewhere, a home department official explained. Peoples War cadre here have, from time to time, shifted loyalties to other Naxalite units like the CPI(M-L) Liberation, which is perceived to share a cordial relationship with the CPM.																								Some have even served time in mainstream political parties like the Trinamul Congress and the BJP and even Left Front constituents like the RSP, said officials, explaining why the Andhra rebels do not share super-sensitive information with the Peoples War here.

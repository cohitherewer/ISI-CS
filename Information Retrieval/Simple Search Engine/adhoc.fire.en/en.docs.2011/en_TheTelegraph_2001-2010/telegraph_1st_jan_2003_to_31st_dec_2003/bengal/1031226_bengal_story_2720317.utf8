 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Arms haul probe
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, Dec. 25: Hooghly police today detained the wife, daughter, son and a former maid of Ajit Mondal, whose rented house in Baidyabati proved to be an arms chest yesterday.																								Automatic weapons, ammunition, landmines and Peoples War manifestos were recovered after raids in Baidyabati and Amarpur in one of the biggest arms hauls in the state in recent times. 																								Mondals wife Sabita, daughter Mitra and son, an auto-rickshaw driver, were picked up from his home in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, and brought here for interrogation. The police said Mondal left home 16 years ago but kept in touch.																								The former maid, a 36-year-old woman, worked at his rented house in Serampore three years ago and was allegedly having an affair with him. The police said Mondal had recently given his former maid a mobile phone but she only knew how to receive calls. Her husband disowned her when he came to know about the affair. Mondal, who is now absconding, had told his landlord in Baidyabati that he was a potato trader. 																								Inspector-general of police (western range) Jogesh Chatterjee said the arms smuggled from other states were meant for Naxalites active in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore.

 Sunday, September 07, 2003 				 Cops register case against rifle snatcher
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, Sept. 6: A fresh controversy has erupted over the snatching of a rifle on Thursday with police registering a case against Nimai Gorai, a local Trinamul Congress leader.																								Gorai, who is allegedly involved in the rifle snatching that followed mob violence after a road accident claimed three lives, is absconding.																								After Gorai was shown on a private TV channel holding the snatched rifle, the CPM charged the Trinamul with provoking residents to go on a rampage after the mishap.																								We have all seen Gorai, who contested the last municipal polls as a Trinamul nominee, pointing a gun at the policemen after snatching it from a constable, alleged Biprendu Chakraborty, mayor-in-council member of the Durgapur Municipal Corporation and a local CPM leader.																								A three-member Trinamul team led by Pankaj Banerjee, leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly, today met the victims families and demanded a judicial inquiry into the incidents.																								We will submit a detailed report to the chief secretary and the home secretary on our return to Calcutta. We want to know why so few policemen were deployed to deal with the situation here. As far as we know, police were busy beefing up security for former chief minister Jyoti Basu at that time. That is why the mob could outnumber the force, Banerjee said.																								Trinamul legislator Apurba Mukherjee, however, said Gorai has been falsely implicated in the case. 																								He was trying to hand over to the police the rifle which had been earlier snatched by a violent mob. He was photographed while carrying out the act, Mukherjee claimed.

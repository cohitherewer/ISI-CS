 Girls tortured for keeping friends secret
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Barasat, May 2: Two girls who appeared for the higher secondary examination this year were tonsured and cigarette butts pressed against them at Uttarayan here last night. Their fault: not letting a friends parents know about her affair with a local youth and plans to elope.The parents engaged local miscreants to teach their daughters classmates a lesson for helping her out in fleeing with the youth and getting married at Haringhata in Nadia on Wednesday. We arrested four persons after receiving a complaint from the families of the girls, said Swapan Pal, officer-in-charge of Barasat police station. The two tortured girls have been admitted to Barasat State General Hospital with serious injuries. After the girls family members learnt on Wednesday she had eloped, they went to two of her classmates to enquire. When the two girls pleaded ignorance, the family members accused them of being accomplices in the act. The police said the family returned with five local youths and they allegedly dragged the girls to the house of the missing girl. Witnesses said the youths lit up cigarettes and pressed their burning ends against them. The girls called for help but none came to their rescue, said Abhranil Chatterjee, a resident.  Copyright

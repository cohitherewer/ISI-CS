 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Andal (Burdwan), Feb. 19: The marauding elephant that killed four men here yesterday took the toll to five when it trampled to death another man at a village by the Sonagara forest near here last night. 																								As in the morning, the tusker eluded the forest guards trying to trail it and in all probability entered the forest tracts of adjacent Bankura district. Worried senior forest officials said the pachyderm might be eliminated if it continued its killing spree. 																								Sheikh Sabir Ali, a villager of Palash Bonmana village, said the elephant killed Mona Chowdhury, 65, who was returning from his field last night and injured a woman, Janki Devi, 50. The animal flung the man to the ground and crushed him under its legs. Then it attacked the woman and threw her into a thicket, Ali said. The woman was admitted to the Durgapur Steel Plant hospital.																								The tusker might have crossed the Damodar and entered the Barjora forest, where another tusker is roaming. We are trying to put together trackers to locate both animals, said officiating conservator of forests (wildlife) N.V. Raja Sekhar. He arrived here this morning to oversee operations to locate and tackle the rogue elephant. 																								Durgapur divisional forest officer G.B. Roy said the elephant was located in Sonagara forest last evening, but gave its trackers the slip. It has moved to an unknown location in the cover of the night.

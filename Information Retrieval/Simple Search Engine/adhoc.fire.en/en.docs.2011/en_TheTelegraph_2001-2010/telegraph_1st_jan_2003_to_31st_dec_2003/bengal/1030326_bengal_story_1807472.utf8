The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, March 26, 2003 				 Dhantola driver widow given job 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ranaghat, March 25: The widow of bus driver Samir Ghosh, who was shot dead at Dhantola on February 26 before the loot-and-rape incident, was employed today as a volunteer under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) by the Nadia district administration. 																								Sub-divisional officer Soumendra Pathak handed her a letter of engagement, not appointment, here and said she will be attached as an anganwadi worker with an ICDS centre. 																								I thank the government for providing me with this job, but I do not know how I will make ends meet with the Rs 700 I will receive each month. My husband brought back at least Rs 3,000 at month-ends, said Madhabi, who has a four-year-old daughter.																								Pathak said she was given a job hastily on orders of the social welfare department. We had to do things in a hurry... We are looking for a better option.

 Sunday, February 09, 2003 				 Starving canines rescued in Burdwan
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Feb. 8: Nine starving dogs abandoned by their breeders and locked in kennels were rescued today by members of the animal welfare society here and despatched to Calcutta for treatment at a facility run by the Compassionate Crusaders Trust.																								Armed with a permission from the Calcutta Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Burdwan Society for Animal Welfare hired a Tata Sumo and took away the dogs from their kennels. 																								The operation was conducted under police supervision in the Kanchannagar area of the town.																								The dogs  three German Shepherds, two labradors and four spitzes  were abandoned by kennel-owners Ashis and Joydeb Ghosh, both of whom fled the area after embezzling lakhs in the name of operating a thrift fund. The duo had also borrowed money from local people to start a dog-breeding business.																								Ever since the emaciated dogs were found last Wednesday after residents complained to the animal welfare society, their fate seemed uncertain. A veterinarian, who examined them, had expressed concern over their survival. 																								We had to spend the last two days in anxiety as the police response to our pleas to rescue the dogs was lukewarm, said Tripti Chakraborty, the society secretary. 																								The police, she said, told her that they were too busy with the chief minister and other VIPs visit to the district on Monday. Yesterday, however, the subdivisional officer (headquarters), Naba Gopal Hira, took the initiative to free the dogs from confinement.																								Even though we had received the clearance from the CSPCA to get the dogs released, the police could not provide us a vehicle, Chakraborty said.																								The society finally hired a vehicle on its own to transport the dogs to Calcutta. 																								The animals had become listless and weak living in utterly unhygienic conditions for the past 10 days. They were very calm when we brought them out and put them in the car. They were too weak to attack the handlers we had brought along, she said.

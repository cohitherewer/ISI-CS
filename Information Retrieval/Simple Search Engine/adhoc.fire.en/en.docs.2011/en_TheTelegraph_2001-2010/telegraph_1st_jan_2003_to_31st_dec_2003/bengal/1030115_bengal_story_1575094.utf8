 Wednesday, January 15, 2003 				 Rush-hour snag cuts short Metro
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 14: Metro rail services were disrupted this evening following a technical snag.																								The shoe which collects the power, got entangled with the shroud of the third rail, causing extensive damage to the track, Vinod Kumar, general manager of Metro Railway, said. He added that a 150-metre stretch between Belgachia and Shyambazar stations has been affected.																								Train services were stopped between Shovabazar and Dum Dum from 7 pm and could not be resumed, a senior Metro official said, adding that trains ran between Tollygunge and Girish Park.																								Engineers are engaged in the repair work and we hope that services will be restored from tomorrow, Kumar said. He added that a probe would be conducted to find out how the shoe got entangled with the shroud. This kind of technical fault happens once in a while. But this time the damage was extensive, he said. 																								According to officials, a number of trains had to be cancelled, inconveniencing a large number of daily commuters. We had to wait for more than 30 minutes for a train instead of the usual 10-minute gap, Nirmal Tripathi, a passenger, said. The trains got overcrowded due to the late running.																								Jatra on Laden banned																								Police have banned the performance of the jatra, Biswatrash Laden, at Petbindhi village near Jhargram in West Midnapore. Sub-divisional police officer Ganesh Chowdhury said he went through the script of the play based on Osama bin Ladens life and found a lot of lines objectionable.

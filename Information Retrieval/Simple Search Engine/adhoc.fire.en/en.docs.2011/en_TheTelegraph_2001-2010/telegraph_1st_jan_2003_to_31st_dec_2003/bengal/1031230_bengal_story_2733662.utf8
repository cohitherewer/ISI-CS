 VIVEK CHHETRI				 	 The cemetery near Darjeeling Government College on Monday. Picture by Suman Tamang																								Darjeeling, Dec. 29: Clear skies, a fairy-tale ambience and the majestic mountains shimmering in the pale morning glow  it was love at first light for tourists in the frosted hill town.																								Cameras whirred and shutters clicked non-stop as visitors and residents flocked to the boulevard around Chowrasta to freeze frames of a white Darjeeling on film before the snow melted.																								Though tourists could not catch the sunrise from Tiger Hill or visit the Rock Garden, there were no complaints.																								I have been out since 6 am savouring the breathtaking sights. This is a perfect day. I just cannot stop taking photographs of the snow-clad town. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me, said Sikna Basumatary, a resident of Bongaigaon, Assam.																								For R. Johnson, a Swiss who is staying at the Sterling Resort, the scene in Ghum was reminiscent of my homeland.																								Soaking in the beauty, however, was not on the agenda of the power department or shopkeepers. Shop owners went about shovelling the snow from their premises. Power department officials worked round the clock and restored electricity in most parts of the town, ending the blackout that the snowfall brought with it.																								The police department, which was forced to call off its sports meet midway yesterday, was kept busy clearing the traffic pileup between Ghum and Dali from around 1 am.																								Vehicles kept off the slippery road in the morning, leaving many tourists stranded.																								There are very few vehicles and all of them are full. I am not sure when my turn will come, said Bijay Shah, a resident of Baguiati in Calcutta, while waiting for a jeep to Siliguri.																								Even an accident could not dampen the spirits of Banita Lama, a third-year student of Loreto College. I had a whale of a time yesterday. Our jeep skidded and fell into a drain near Tenzing Rock. Though I was hurt, it was fun to be outdoors.																								Tour operators said the snowfall could not have come at a better time. Tour consultant Soam Namchu said: We look forward to such winters. As of now, we are expecting more tourists from Calcutta.																								Dinesh Sharma, the general manager of Fortune Resort Central, echoed Namchu. Most of the rooms have been booked for the next two months and I think the lull in numbers will not set in before July-August, he said.

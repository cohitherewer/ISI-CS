The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, July 14, 2003 				 Trinamul red-faced at unity meet
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purulia, July 13: The convention was called to strengthen the NDA at the grassroots level. But the district Trinamul Congress did not bargain for one of the prominent speakers to propose that Purulia, West Midnapore and parts of Bankura should join Jharkhand.																								The participants at the meet at the Rabindra Bhavan here included Trinamul leader Mukul Roy, district party secretary K.P. Singh Deo, BJP district secretary B.P. Singh Deo and some NDA leaders from Jharkhand. 																								The neighbouring states power minister, Lalchand Mahato, said at the Trinamul-sponsored convention that a movement should be started to include the Bengal districts in Jharkhand if the people wanted faster and better development.																								Pointing out that Purulia was in Manbhum before 1956, Mahato said the situation in the district was like when Jharkhand was part of Bihar  underdeveloped and neglected. Hardly any progress in irrigation, industry, education,communications and employment, he said.																								An embarrassed K.P. Sing Deo said: We do not support this proposal and we did not know it would be raised. We wanted to improve unity within the NDA.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, August 20, 2003 				 Jail for rape after fake promise to marry
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Chinsurah, Aug. 19: In  two judgments, the Hooghly Judges Court has sentenced two  men to seven years rigorous imprisonment for cohabiting  with women after giving false assurances to marry them.																								During the hearing of bail petitions in the cases over the past couple of weeks, Calcutta High Court had observed that charges of rape will stand against men having a sexual relationship with a woman after promising to get married later.																								First assistant sessions judge Siddhartha Roy Chowdhury sentenced a lawyer, Shivram Dawn, 50, to seven years rigorous imprisonment and fined him Rs 15,000 for ditching a woman after cohabiting with her for six months.																								The 28-year-old woman had filed an FIR at Tarakeswar police station on February 24, 1996, alleging that the lawyer had employed her to look after his ailing aunt and during her stay in his house repeatedly asked her to marry him. She also alleged that Shivram had regular physical relationship with her. When I asked him to marry me, he left his home in Paschim Ramnanagar and fled to Calcutta, she said.																								On the basis of the complaint, a criminal case of rape was initiated against the lawyer.																								In the second verdict, first additional sessions judge Murari Mohan Ghosh sentenced Nirmal Baul Das alias Kalu, a farmer, to seven years rigorous imprisonment for marrying a woman in a temple with the idols as witnesses and later abandoning her. 																								The judge said Nirmals actions were tantamount to rape.																								On June 29, 1999, Dasarathi Das lodged a complaint with police at Dadpur in the district alleging that his 17-year-old daughter had been abducted by Nirmal, 24, who married her at a local temple. Nirmal vanished after returning my daughter to our home two days after the marriage, Das had alleged.

  OUR CORRESPONDENT Krishnagar, July 9: Nadia lawyers are boycotting the district judge for granting bail to a guard who had shot at and injured bar association secretary Debashis Das in May. Sabyasachi Banerjee, who admitted the bail petition of Biswajit Mondol, met with loud protests as he read out the order after noon. Bolstered by their colleagues who rushed in from other courtrooms, the lawyers shouted slogans, demanding that Banerjee reverse his order, and vented their ire on the furniture. They then decided not to attend the sessions court while Banerjee is in charge. A strong police force led by police superintendent Benoy Chakraborty arrived soon to stop events from turning ugly and stayed till the judge left for home. No one was arrested. It is true that the lawyers were agitated after the district judge granted bail to Mondol, but they were provoked by his order, said public prosecutor Sadhan Mondol. We have decided to boycott the sessions court proceedings till the removal of the judge, added Asim Saha, president of the bar association. They attacked me and threatened me with dire consequences if I did not withdraw my decision. They were also very abusive, I had no option but to go out of the courtroom, Banerjee later said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 Sick list of state units lengthens
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, Nov. 26: The management of Westinghouse Saxby Farmers, a state government undertaking, has asked all 46 employees at its unit here to opt for an early retirement scheme by December 23.																								The notice signed by managing director A.K. Dutta does not spare even the executives. The company, however, has offered compensation equivalent to the employees remaining terms. 																								The CPMs labour arm, Citu, came down heavily on the move. We are in no mood to allow liquidation of the unit. We will not allow employees to be retrenched, said Burdwan Citu secretariat member and former legislator Debabrata Banerjee. 																								Unit president of Intuc Bangshi Karmakar, too, opposed the decision. He accused the state of toeing the Centres policies.																								The unit installed in 1975 manufactured conveyor rollers, especially for Indian Railways and the power sector, said unit-in-charge Somnath Chatterjee. Fraud arrest																								A businessman was arrested in Burdwan last night for allegedly cheating a cooperative bank to the tune of Rs 12.45 lakh. 																								Police said Debnath Sharma had taken a loan to start a computer training centre in 2001 against computer accessories and furniture. But he allegedly sold the accessories, shut down the centre and was letting out the premises for wedding receptions.																								Sharma was today remanded in custody for three days.

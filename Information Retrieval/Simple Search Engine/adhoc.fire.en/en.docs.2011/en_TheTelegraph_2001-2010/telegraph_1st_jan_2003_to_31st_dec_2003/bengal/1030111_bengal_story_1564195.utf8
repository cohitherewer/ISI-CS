 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 Idols worth a crore stolen
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Canning (South 24-Parganas), Jan. 10: Burglars broke into a house at Madhukali village this morning and took away two antique idols of Krishna and Radha along with the jewellery adorning them.																								Both the idols were more than a century old and valued at more than Rs 1 crore. 																								Police have launched a hunt for the robbers but no one was arrested till late tonight.																								Dhirendra Nath Chatterjee, the owner of the house from where the idols were stolen, said the black stone idol of Krishna weighed about 29 kg while the Radha statue crafted in brass was about 28 kg. 																								Usually, I get up early in the morning and go to the thakurghar (prayer room). Today was no exception. But I was surprised to find the lock of the thakurghar door broken and the door wide open. I raised an alarm immediately and everyone came out. When we entered the room, we found the idols and ornaments missing, said Chatterjee.																								He said the idols were more than 150 years old. I inherited the idols and 18 bighas from my ancestors. Now I have the land, but have lost Krishna and Radha, he added.																								Chatterjee said everyone first scoured the village to catch the thieves but they could not be traced. Then the Canning police station was contacted. A group of policemen led by sub-divisional police officer Subhankar Sinha Sarkar rushed to Madhukali village. 																								Sarkar said all neighbouring police stations have been alerted and a combing operation is on.

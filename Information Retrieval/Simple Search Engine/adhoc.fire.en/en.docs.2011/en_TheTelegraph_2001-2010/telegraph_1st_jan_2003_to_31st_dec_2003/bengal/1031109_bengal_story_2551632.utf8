 Sunday, November 09, 2003 				 Sheikh Binod accomplice
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, Nov. 8: Mithun Saha, suspected to be a member of the gang led by Sheikh Binod, was arrested yesterday along with five others in Mayapur, about 95 km from Calcutta.																								Police said Saha, a resident of Regent Park in Calcutta, has confessed that he took part in several murders and dacoities committed by Binod, who recently escaped from Dum Dum central jail. Saha was arrested when he and his associates were returning to their hotel after buying liquor from a nearby shop, they added.																								As the ras yatra is going on in this part of the (Nadia) district, there is every possibility of miscreants making an inroad in this area, said deputy superintendent of police Amitava Barma. So the police asked the hotels in Mayapur, known for its Iskcon temple, to keep a close watch on their boarders, he said. 																								The six have been remanded in police custody.

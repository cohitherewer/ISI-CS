 Saturday, October 18, 2003 				 Heroin haul
 OUR BUREAU																								Oct. 17: Police seized 13 kg of heroin from a Calcutta-bound truck early this morning. 																								Burdwan police were tipped off about a huge narcotic consignment a few days ago. Deputy inspector-general Narayan Ghosh said: The driver of the truck, Omar alias Kasem, was detained but another person managed to flee from the vehicle.																								The heroin, worth Rs 13 crore, was found from the roof of the drivers cabin, stashed in 13 brown packets. 																								We are investigating where the drugs were coming from and where the consignment was headed. We are also checking the drivers Calcutta connections, said Ghosh. Policemen in plain clothes spotted the truck in Kulti near Asansol, about 200 km from Calcutta. It had the same number plate as the tip-off had suggested. The truck was forced to stop after a chase. 																								Omar apparently made misleading statements during interrogation. He said the truck was coming from Rajasthan and then contradicted himself saying he was travelling from Kanpur. Omar said he was from Rajasthan. The truck was registered in Gujarat.

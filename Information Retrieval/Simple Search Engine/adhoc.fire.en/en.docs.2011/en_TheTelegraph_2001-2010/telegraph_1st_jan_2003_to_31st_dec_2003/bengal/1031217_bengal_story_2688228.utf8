 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Malda girl rescued in Jharkhand
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Rajmahal (Jharkhand), Dec. 16: Blowing the lid off an inter-state kidnap racket, five-year-old Pratibha Sharma was rescued from here this afternoon. 																								The two men who abducted the girl from Malda when she was on her way to school in a rickshaw-van on Friday have been arrested. Both are residents of Barkal, where Pratibha stays.																								A Malda police team, led by additional superintendent Manoranjan Saha, rushed to Radhanagar, on the other side of the Ganga separating Bengal and Jharkhand after receiving information that residents here had nabbed two men who they suspected had held captive a child. The local people informed the Radhanagar officer-in-charge that they had detained the duo, identified as Sunil Saha and Shamim Sheikh. 																								Yesterday, police had rounded up two couples from Babla-Kamalpur village who had given shelter to the girl on Friday and Saturday. On Sunday evening, the police received a tip that the kidnappers had been to Farakka. A team went there the next day but learnt that the criminals had left the house where they had put up at 10 am and made their way to Jharkhand. Even as they hit a dead-end, the tip-off came. 																								Pratibha was saved. Her father, a bank employee, did not know how to express his joy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, February 17, 2003 				 Headmaster shot at
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 16: The headmaster of a local school was fired at from close in Bishnupur on the southern fringe of the city today. 																								Adhir Pandit was admitted to M.R. Bangur Hospital. His condition was stated to be serious. 																								No arrests had been made till late night but political parties wasted no time. 																								The Trinamul Congress claimed Pandit was a party member and the CPM had planned to eliminate him before the panchayat elections. 																								The CPM denied the allegation. The shooting was the result of an internal feud in Trinamul, it said.																								The headmaster had come to his institution, Julpia High School, to cast his vote in the guardians election around noon. A youth on a motorcycle shot at him and fled. The people around gave a chase but in vain. 																								The guardians and teachers present there took him to the hospital. 																								Trinamul MLA from Bishnupur Subrata Bakshi said: The CPM was targeting him for a long time. Today, they got the opportunity. They tried to finish him because he is very popular in the area and is likely to play a vital role in the panchayat polls. The police are with them (the CPM). The officers present at the scene made no effort to arrest the criminal.																								CPM leader and former MLA Ananda Biswas said Pandit was targeted by his own partymen.																								To save face, they are trying to pass the buck on us, he added. 																								Additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Kumar Singh said raids are on to arrest those responsible for the attack.																								We are hopeful of arresting the criminals at the earliest. We believe they were from nearby areas, Singh said.

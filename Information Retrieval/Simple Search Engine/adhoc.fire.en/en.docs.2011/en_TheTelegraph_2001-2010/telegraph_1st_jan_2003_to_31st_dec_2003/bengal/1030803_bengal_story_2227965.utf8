 Sunday, August 03, 2003 				 Party sermon for Citu leaders
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 2: The CPM state leadership today observed that many Citu leaders were functioning like bureaucrats and not paying adequate attention to trade unions.																								These leaders are giving more importance to being members of the party than the interests of the working class, claimed CPM leaders.																								Many senior Citu leaders of yesterdays are now our ministers and it is really difficult for them to work for the trade union. No serious effort has been made to fill the void in leadership, a senior Citu leader told the state party leadership.																								The party also admitted during the extended state committee meeting today that factionalism in the Citu had increased over the past few years and some members of the organisation were using it for their personal interests rather than working for the labour class.																								These self-styled and bureaucratic Citu leaders were damaging the partys image and they have to be cautioned, it said. The party had also in the past not paid adequate attention to the functioning of the Citu and left the responsibility of running the trade union arm to the Citu leadership.																								Trade union leaders, however, complained that the popularity of the Citu among the working class has come down because the trade union arm has failed to organise an effective movement.																								Our party is running the government here. Naturally, we as trade unionists are in a difficult position. We cant indulge in militant trade unionism because it might harm our governments drive for industrialisation. If we dont organise movements for the working class to protect their interest, we will lose our base, Citu leaders argued.																								The leaders observed that the organisation had not grown much in the Hindi belt in Bengal. The trade union had also failed to spread its base in the unorganised sector and industrial units run by multinational companies, they said. A large chunk of the working class belong to the unorganised sector like bidi industry, brick kilns and daily-wage earners.																								We have not been successful in strengthening our trade union in these sectors, Citu leaders reportedly told the state party leaders.																								The CPM politburo and central committee have already taken steps to amend the Citu programmes, which has not been changed in 15 years.																								Recommendations by the state leadership will be referred to district, zonal and local committees and the state committee will prepare a report for the partys central leadership.

 Monday, January 06, 2003 				 Bhikari wife surrenders to police
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, Jan. 5: Bhikari Paswans wife, Lalti Devi, who went missing on Thursday night, surrendered to police in Bhadreswar this morning.																								The 35-year-old wife of Bhikari, a jute mill worker whose disappearance from police custody turned into a major political controversy, used to stay with her mother-in-law Ratna Devi in Telinipara, about 15 km from here. 																								Lalti is a key witness in the Bhikari Paswan case, which will be heard next month. I have an apprehension that the police had a role behind her disappearance, said Trinamul Congress MP Akbar Ali Khodakar.																								I shall not return to my in-laws. I am earning a handsome amount and can afford to live (alone) with my nine-year old son, Lalti told the police.																								We will not force her if she is unwilling to return to her mother-in-law, said superintendent Ajoy Kumar. As news about her return spread, hundreds gathered outside the police station.

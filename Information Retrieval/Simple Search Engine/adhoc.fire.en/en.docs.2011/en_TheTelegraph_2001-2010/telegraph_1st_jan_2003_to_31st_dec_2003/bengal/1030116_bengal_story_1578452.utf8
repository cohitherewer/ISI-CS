The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, January 16, 2003 				 Mamata meet
																								Calcutta, Jan. 15: Mamata Banerjee tonight asked mayor Subrata Mukherjee to take steps to address the grievances of the members of the mayors council. 																								After a three-hour meeting, she is believed to have asked him either to change or monitor the functioning of commissioner Debasis Som, who is seen by the bulk of the mayors council as responsible for the growing friction between them and the mayor. 																								Subrata, in turn, is said to have told Mamata of the problems he is facing in running the corporation on account of the intransigence of several councillors.

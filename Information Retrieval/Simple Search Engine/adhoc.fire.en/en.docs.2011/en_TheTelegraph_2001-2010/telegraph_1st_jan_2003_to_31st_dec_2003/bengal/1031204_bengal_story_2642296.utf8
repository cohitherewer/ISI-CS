				 																																	Durgapur, Dec. 3: A youth was killed and his lover lost a leg when they jumped in front of a train coming into Burnpur station yesterday. GRP officials said Shyam, 25, and Noorie, 18, took the extreme step as their families did not agree to unite them. Noories parents had fixed her marriage elsewhere. 				 																																	Shyam was crushed under the wheels of the ChhapraTatanagar Express and Noories left leg was almost severed when they jumped from the platform. Her leg had to be amputated from below the knee. 				 																																	Bolpur: Birbhum police have submitted a chargesheet against Tiger Singh alias Afroz Khan, who had stormed into the Suri Sadar Hospital on the night of September 4, held several patients hostage and killed one of them before surrendering at dawn. 				 																																	Calcutta: Residents of the Rajpur-Sonarpur municipality submitted a memorandum to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, urging him to protect the Narendrapur Pakhiraloy (bird sanctuary). They alleged that some people were trying to usurp the 53 bighas to set up residential and market complexes. 				 																																	Calcutta: Ten-year-old Roni Sarkar died in his house at Ramkrishnapur-Dompur in North 24-Parganas when he hanged himself inadvertantly while trying to imitate Shaktiman, a superhero popularised by a TV serial, in front of his brother and friends. Police said Roni choked to death after he tied a rope round his neck and strung it from the ceiling.

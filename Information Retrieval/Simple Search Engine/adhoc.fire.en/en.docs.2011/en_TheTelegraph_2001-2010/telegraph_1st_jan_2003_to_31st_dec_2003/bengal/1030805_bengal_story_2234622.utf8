The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 05, 2003 				 Power plays truant at Writers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Aug. 4: Writers  Buildings was dogged by power cuts throughout the day after  a circuit-breaker in the power line burst around 11.30 am. 																								There was no power, literally, in the corridors of power. Lights were out in the ministers rooms and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had to work with the help of emergency lights before leaving for Rabindra Sadan past noon.																								The chief minister, however, could not take the VIP lift. Ministers like Amar Chowdhury (PWD) and Asok Bhattacharya (urban development), too, had to take the stairs.																								Chowdhury, whose department is responsible for the upkeep of the power lines at Writers, said supply was partly restored at the secretariat around 12.30 pm. Our engineers will carry out a night-long repair work and we expect normal supply to be restored before offices resume tomorrow, the PWD minister said.

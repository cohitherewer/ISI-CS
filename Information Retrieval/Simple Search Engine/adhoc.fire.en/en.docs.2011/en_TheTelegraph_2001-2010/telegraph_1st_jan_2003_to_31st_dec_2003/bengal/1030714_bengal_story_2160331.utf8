 Candlelight operations in hospital
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Burdwan, July 13: Chaos reigns at the medical college and hospital here since power supply collapsed on Friday night. The PWDs electrical wing is yet to identify the fault. The problem was compounded after one of the generators developed a snag last night.All operations were cancelled and the normal routine at the medical college came to a standstill. The institution is now entirely dependant on two generators, one of which developed the snag. The emergency operation theatre and the wards of the departments of paediatrics, gynaecology and medicine were without electricity. Several surgical operations, including Caesarean sections, had to be performed in candlelight. Supply of drinking water in some of the wards stopped as pumps could not be operated. Last night, a mob, which included relatives of patients, protested the state of affairs. But there was none to lend them an ear. Superintendent Sarit Chowdhury and his deputy M. Murshed stay outside the campus. When they arrived, they were gheraoed by the angry relatives. A force from the Burdwan police station reined them in.  Copyright

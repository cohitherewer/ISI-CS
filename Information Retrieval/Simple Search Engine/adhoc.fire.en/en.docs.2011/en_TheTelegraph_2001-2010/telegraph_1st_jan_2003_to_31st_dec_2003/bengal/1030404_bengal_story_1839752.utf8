Jahanara and her father fought to prevent the duo from entering the house even as they were attacked with choppers. Jahanaras mother was already slashed on her arm. Faced with such stiff resistance from the woman, the criminals shouted that even if they did not take anything else, they would definitely snatch Jahanara, Mondal said. 																								At this, Jahanara shouted that she recognised one of them. Panicky, one of the criminals is reported to have shouted use the bombs, it is our only way out of here.

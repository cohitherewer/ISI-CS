 Monday, November 24, 2003 				 Hospital touts in net after pay tiff 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Nov. 23: Two touts were arrested last evening from the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital premises. 																								 Hospital sources said Sheikh Ramjan and Abdul Gaffar were caught accepting money from a patients relative in exchange of donor cards for blood. A brief altercation between the touts and the patients relatives over payment against the two cards brought the deal under the glare of the hospital authorities. Hospital employees rounded up the touts and informed police. 																								Kalipada Kunui was admitted last month for the treatment of a wound on his left leg. Ten days ago, doctors attending to Kunui told his family to arrange two bottles of blood. The family approached the hospitals blood bank but they were told the stock was exhausted. Then the two men offered help. They asked for Rs 900 for the two cards. Gaffar said we could get the blood from the same blood bank on producing them. But when Ramjan and Gaffar came back, they asked for more money and the quarrel broke out, said Kunuis wife Sukhi.

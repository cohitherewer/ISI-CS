 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 2: It took the intervention of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to reopen the dispensary in West Midnapores Jhargram, which was forced to a shutdown in November by Citu members after the doctor refused to take back an employee whom he had sacked for tampering with an injection.																								Senior CPM leaders today hauled up the local committee members of Jhargram and ordered them to let the chamber open immediately. 																								The cadre then called on Dr A.K. Sengupta and the IMA faction in Jhargram to apologise. 																								They assured us that Sengupta need not fear anyone and he was free to attend chamber, said the IMAs state secretary, Moloy Patra.																								The Citu red-flagged Senguptas chamber at Ghoradhora village after the doctor dismissed the employee on receiving complaints that she had tried to administer an expired injection on a patient after bagging a fresh one.

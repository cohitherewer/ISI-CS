 Sunday, August 24, 2003 				 Cloud on Cong in CPM murder
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Behrampore, Aug. 23: A  CPM worker was shot dead and three, including a woman, injured  when miscreants attacked them last evening with guns and  bombs in Murshidabad district.																								The assailants rained bullets around 7 pm on Abul Sheikh, 30, who was sitting outside his house in the Domkal police station area, about 250 km from Calcutta.																								They also fired at his neighbour, Kohinoor Bibi, and two other men when they rushed out on hearing the sounds of the bursting bombs. All three were badly injured and have been admitted to the Behrampore general hospital.																								Police sources said the CPM worker had been attacked with sharp-edged weapons two days ago while he was on his way to a weekly market.																								He managed to escape with minor gashes and had lodged a complaint with us. The complaint mentioned the name of Anarul Sheikh and Laltu Sheikh, along with two others, as the ones who had allegedly attacked him, said an officer of Domkal police station.																								The police have good reason to believe that the same men are behind yesterdays attack in Mominpur village. Investigators are trying to get clues about the attack from the three injured persons.																								I heard a loud explosion and when I rushed out to see what the matter was, I saw a man turn and fire at me, said Kohinoor Bibi from her hospital bed.																								If Abul Sheikh had not complained about the earlier attack to the police he would not have been killed. They had threatened to kill Abul as he had named them in the FIR, she said.																								Murshidabad police superintendent Gyanwant Singh, who went to Mominpur village, had little to offer. A man was murdered in a Domkal village. Three people were injured, said the police official.																								CPM Domkal zonal committee secretary Kausar Ali alleged that the attack was carried out by Congress-backed goons.																								Abul and the injured persons were very active workers of the party in the area. Those who attacked them are known criminals who enjoy Congress patronage, alleged the CPM secretary.																								District Congress leader Mannan Hossain said the criminals had no link with his party. He countered that they were people who had fallen out with the CPM.																								The murder is a result of the tremendous infighting among the CPM. No Congress worker is connected with this incident, asserted the Congress leader.																								Mominpur has seen a number of murders take place since the May panchayat elections. Three men  one belonging to the Congress and two CPM workers  have been killed. Police said the area is tense and they are keeping a special watch.

 Saturday, June 28, 2003 				 Court boost to jute bags
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, June 27: A division bench of the high court today set aside the Centres decision to reduce the use of jute bags in packaging of food grain and sugar. 																								Describing Delhis decision as ultra vires to the Constitution, the court held that the Centre will have to take a fresh decision within a month in the light of todays judgment. 																								Till then, status quo would have to be maintained as it was till July 12, 2002. That day, the Centre had issued a notification reducing the use of jute bags in the packaging of sugar to 75 per cent and to 80 per cent in case of food grain. 																								The state and the Indian Jute Mill Association had challenged the decision in court. Truck rams into train																								A bogie of the Katwa-Burdwan local jumped rails today after a truck rammed into it as it was about to enter Burdwan station. The truck then hit a shanty, seriously injuring a woman inside.

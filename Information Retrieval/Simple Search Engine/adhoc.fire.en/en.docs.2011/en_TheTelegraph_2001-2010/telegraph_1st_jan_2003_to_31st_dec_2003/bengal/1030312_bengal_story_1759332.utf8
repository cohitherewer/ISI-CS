 Wednesday, March 12, 2003 				 Boy commits suicide after counselling family
 ABHIJIT CHAKRABORTY																								Balurghat, March 11: Was it the untimely demise of his friend Asit Ghosh, who died of leukaemia about six months ago or something else? 																								The answer, for the time being, remains elusive as 13-year-old Subho Samaddar, a Class VII student of local Naresh Chandra Higher Secondary School, will never be around to explain. 																								The teenager committed suicide this morning within the school premises while the morning prayer was on. He hanged himself from the ceiling fan of an empty classroom. 																								A suicide note addressed to his parents and younger sister was recovered from Subhos pocket. But it did not give any clear indication of the motive. 																								The note, however, had messages for everybody, including his parents, sister and schoolteacher. 																								Subho requested his sister Priyanka, a student of Class III, to tend to the rose plants daily. You must offer the roses to Lord Shiv, the note pleaded. 																								He urged his mother to take care of her health and not to pine for him. There was an advice for his businessman father  do not sell off the land and the pond. 																								He also asked him to cultivate their small land holdings sincerely. 																								Without naming any particular teacher in school, he wrote: Sir, aami mara jachhi. Aamar mrityur por ek din school chhuti deben. (I am dying. Please declare a holiday for my death). 																								Subhos father, Samir Samaddar, who earns his livelihood selling clothes in village markets, was too distraught to react. Aami kichhu bujhte parlamna (I could not make out anything), he mumbled. 																								Inspector in-charge of Balurghat police station Pradeep Pal said: It is a case of suicide but we have to wait for the post-mortem report.																								Subhos school did declare a days holiday.

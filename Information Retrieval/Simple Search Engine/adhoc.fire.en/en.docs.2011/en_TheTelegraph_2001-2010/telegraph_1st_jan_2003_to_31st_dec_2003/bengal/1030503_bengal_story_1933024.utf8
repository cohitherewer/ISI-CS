 Saturday, May 03, 2003 				 Biman regrets front fissures
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, May 2: Left Front chairman and CPM leader Biman Bose today regretted growing squabbles among front partners following the lack of understanding over distribution of seats for the panchayat election.																								We (the CPM) tried our best to reach a consensus on seat-sharing among the partners but miserably failed to iron out differences despite sincere efforts, Bose said this afternoon while addressing a rally at Bhatar, about 35 km from Burdwan town.																								CPM, RSP and Forward Bloc nominees are contesting each other for about 7,000 seats in the election to the three-tier rural bodies. The front partners have accused the CPM of unleashing terror on them in the run up to the May 11 election.

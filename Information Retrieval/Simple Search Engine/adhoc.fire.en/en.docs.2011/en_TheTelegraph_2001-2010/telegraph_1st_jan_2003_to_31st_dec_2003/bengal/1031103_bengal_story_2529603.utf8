 DEEPANKAR GANGULY Calcutta, Nov. 2: Pictures  of cats roaming the Bongaon Subdivisional Hospital in North  24-Parganas made it to print after one of the animals tried  to tug a baby away from an incubator. An NGO trapped 20  cats from the hospital yesterday. 																								We spotted 23 cats but three of them managed to flee, said Sushmita Roy of Love--Care for Animals.																								Cats, Roy said, were found everywhere in the hospital  the medicine wards, the leprosy ward, the labour room, the childrens ward, the surgical wards and the isolation room. Superintendent of the hospital Hirendra Nath Datta was with the NGO team when the cats were being caught. The animals have been brought to the city and would be sterilised, said an official of the NGO.																								According to a tentative estimate, cats and dogs in government hospitals across the state number around 10,000.																								The government today said NGOs would be roped in to rid the clinics of the animals.																								Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee will monitor the clean-up operation in 360 hospitals and medical colleges. Love--Care has already written to the government expressing willingness to clean up the hospitals in the districts.

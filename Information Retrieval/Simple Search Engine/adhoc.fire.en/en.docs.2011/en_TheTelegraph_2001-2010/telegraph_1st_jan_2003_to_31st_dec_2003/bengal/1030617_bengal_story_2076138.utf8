The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 17, 2003 				 Stuck in court and Class X
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 16: Its been a day since the Madhyamik results for 2003 were announced but at least a hundred candidates from last year are yet to know how they fared in the tests. 																								After the publication of results for last years Madhyamik, these candidates had moved Calcutta High Court praying for an order directing the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education to produce the answer scripts of some of the papers. The court passed several orders but there was no response from the board.																								Amrita Mukherjee, Sidhartha Haldar, Chinmoy Rahaman, Alapan Chakraborty, Subhasis Das, Sanjoy Midhya, Raja Chatterjee and many others like them filed petitions before the court pleading it to look into their grievances. In most cases, the court asked the board to make a proper scrutiny of the papers and file a report. But till date, the results of the scrutiny have not been produced.																								In these cases, the board prayed for time at least for seven accessions and on all the occasions, the court granted the prayers. The board did not care the least about the future of these candidates, alleged Gulam Mustafa, the counsel for one of the candidates. My client was so confident about his appeal that he did not appear in the 2003 examination. Now, he is coming to court everyday so that his case is heard immediately, said Subroto Mukherjee, another counsel. 																								The counsels representing the board, however, said it was impossible to preserve answer scripts for more than six months. Most of the candidates came to court after the result of their application (to the board) for scrutiny of their answer scripts reached them. Some of them came to court in October. How do they expect their case to end so soon? one of them asked.

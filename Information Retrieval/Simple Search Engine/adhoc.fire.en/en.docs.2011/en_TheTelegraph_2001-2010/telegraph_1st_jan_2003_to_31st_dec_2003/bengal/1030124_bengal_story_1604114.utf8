 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 Exam clause for teacher promotion
 TAMAL SENGUPTA 																								Calcutta, Jan. 23: College and university teachers will have to do more than take classes and complete doctoral dissertations for promotions. They will have to take tests after attending orientation courses conducted under the supervision of the University Grants Commission (UGC). 																								The academic staff college of Jadavpur University (JU) is going to hold the first examination for teachers who attend the orientation programme beginning on its campus on January 28. Altogether 47 teachers, mostly from universities and colleges in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Delhi, will take the tests. 																								We will offer grades to all the 47 candidates attending the programme on their performance. This will help them get promotions and enrich themselves for imparting training to the students, said Samir Kumar Saha, director of the academic staff college. Saha, who was professor of mechanical engineering at the university, is now in full charge of the staff college, an autonomous body with representatives from the UGC. 																								Overall response towards the orientation programme will be considered a major criteria for getting better grades. We will also consider the attendance and other performance of the teachers for gradations, Saha said. 																								Earlier, it was mandatory for college and university teachers to undergo orientation programmes for promotions. Now, they will have to sit for the examinations and obtain grades for a higher position in their institutions. 																								The participants will have to attend 96 lectures to be delivered by experts in different fields during their stay at the university, Saha said.

 Tuesday, July 15, 2003 				 Power returns to hospital
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, July 14: The medical college and hospital here limped back to normality today after grappling with a crippling power crisis since Friday evening.																								Supply was restored this afternoon and after three days, lights were again glowing on the premises this evening.																								Hospital authorities yesterday faced violent demonstrations by relatives of those admitted even as doctors performed emergency operations in candlelight. 																								Water supply to several wards stopped as pumps could not be operated and one of the two generators, which kept parts of the hospital in operation, developed a snag on Saturday night.																								Industry minister Nirupam Sen arrived this morning and sat down with the authorities to discuss the situation. The public works department (PWD), which is in charge of electrical maintenance at the hospital, and the state electricity board traded charges over the power breakdown.																								Preliminary investigations revealed that the PWD personnel in charge of the electrical infrastructure at the hospital were at fault. We have taken certain decisions to take care of the immediate crisis, said Uday Sarkar, the chairman of the zilla parishad. 																								Sarkar held a meeting with the hospital superintendent, the chief medical officer of health, and representatives of the PWD and the power board.																								The PWD officials insisted that the board was responsible for the fault in the 11,000-KW line that snapped power supply to the hospital. The PWD had no maintenance records, said the board.																								It took close to 36 hours to detect where the fault lay and the hospital authorities alleged that both the PWD and the power board personnel were not seen on the premises for a long time. We have provided the PWD office space within the hospital but we never get them during an emergency. Sen, too, could not meet any of them today, said the hospitals deputy superintendent.

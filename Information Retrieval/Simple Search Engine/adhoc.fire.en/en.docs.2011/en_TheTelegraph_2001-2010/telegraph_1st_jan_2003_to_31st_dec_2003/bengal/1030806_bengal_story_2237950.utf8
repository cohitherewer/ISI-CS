 Wednesday, August 06, 2003 				 City health of mind to be mapped
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Aug. 5: The government  today decided to conduct a survey to find out the profile  of mental health in the city and adjoining urban areas.																								This is the first time we are trying to map the pattern of mental illnesses in the urban areas. We had conducted a survey in the districts and we now feel that we should have such a study for Calcutta and its neighbourhood. We need to know, for example, how many people suffer from schizophrenia or how many people suffer from depression resulting from stress, said Prabhakar Chatterjee, the director of health services.																								The government is upgrading the standard of treatment of mental patients with the help of NGOs under the National Mental Health Programme. The Centre is providing Rs 3 crore to mental hospitals with 500 beds. A sum of Rs 1.5 crore is being provided to hospitals with less than 500 beds. 																								Marriage bill: The cabinet today held in abeyance the compulsory recording of marriage bill after a section of ministers said it needs to be discussed further. The bill would make recording of marriages compulsory among all communities in the state.

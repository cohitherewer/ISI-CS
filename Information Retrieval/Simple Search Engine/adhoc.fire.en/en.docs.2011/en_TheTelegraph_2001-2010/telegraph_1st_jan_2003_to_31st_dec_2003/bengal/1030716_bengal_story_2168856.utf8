 Wednesday, July 16, 2003 				 Farm plan with funds pinch
 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, July 15: Agriculture minister Kamal Guha today said his department would implement the new farm policy only after it was assured about finance.																								After the Rs 272.49-crore agriculture budget was passed in the Assembly, Guha said he will meet finance minister Asim Dasgupta on July 31 to talk about the funds. We know from experience that we dont get the funds promised. So, we first want to make sure the kind of money we will get. Then we will decide what schemes to go ahead with, said Guha, a Forward Bloc leader.																								Replying to the debate on the budget, he said: We will not go to multinationals or McKinsey for technology. We will not give in to the pressures of globalisation. The government had earlier roped in consultants McKinsey to draw up a farm policy.																								Computers from Class VI: Computer education would be introduced from Class VI, school education minister Kanti Biswas said. It is now taught from Class VII. The course will also be introduced in 200 more schools.

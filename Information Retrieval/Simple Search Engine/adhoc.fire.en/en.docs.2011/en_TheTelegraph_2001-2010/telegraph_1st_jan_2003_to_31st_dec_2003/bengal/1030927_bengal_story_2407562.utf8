 Saturday, September 27, 2003 				 Guha raises voice, yet again
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept. 26: Defying Left Front chairman Biman Boses whip, agriculture minister Kamal Guha today said he would speak out in public, if necessary.																								Bose had asked partners at a front meeting yesterday not to voice grievances against the government in public. Differences should be resolved through discussion within the front, said Bose, a CPM leader.																								Forward Bloc chairman Guhas alleged comments against the chief minister had stirred up a storm at yesterdays meeting. Fire services minister and Forward Bloc (Marxist) leader Pratim Chatterjee raised the issue and even accused Guha of getting his son a government job. 																								My son used to supply seeds to the Seed Corporation. He stopped that after I became agriculture minister, Guha said today. 																								He blamed the CPM for the allegations against him. I did not want to become the agriculture minister. I wanted forest and tourism together, Guha said.

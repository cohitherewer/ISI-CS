 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, July 4: The Left Front today said the Panchayat Act will be amended to decentralise development at the gram panchayat level.																								After a meeting of the front today, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said a nominated body, including representatives from the Opposition, will be set up. It will work in tandem with elected panchayat bodies.																								We took this decision because we wanted decentralisation at the lowest level. The nominated body will advise the elected body on the priority areas of development. We are taking in representatives from Opposition parties because we want them to play a positive role in rural development, the CPM leader said.																								He added that the front partners can submit other points that they want to see in the amendment Bill  it will be placed in the current session of the Assembly  to panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra by July 7.

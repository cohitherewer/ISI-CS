 Sunday, June 29, 2003 				 Arms haul in Midnapore
																								Midnapore, June 28: A large cache of arms and ammunition was seized after police raided a house said to belong to a Trinamul Congress supporter at Moyna in east Midnapore, reports our correspondent.																								Police said raids were being conducted to nab Bablu Jana, allegedly involved in murder cases in west Midnapores Pingla area. 																								The house of one Biswanath Bagh was raided last night following information that Jana had taken shelter there. Though neither of the two could be found, Baghs brother, Shamu, was detained, west Midnapore police superintendent K.C. Meena said.																								After interrogating Shamu, police recovered three country-made rifles, five crude pistols and 80 rounds of live ammunition from the house.																								The raids are continuing in the area where a large number of criminals had taken shelter following police action in the Keshpur, Pingla and Garbeta areas, where there were several murders of CPM as well as Trinamul Congress members during the past three years, Meena said.																								Police sources said many criminals used in the political clashes to capture villages before the last Assembly elections in 2001 had fanned out to different parts of the district after raids intensified.

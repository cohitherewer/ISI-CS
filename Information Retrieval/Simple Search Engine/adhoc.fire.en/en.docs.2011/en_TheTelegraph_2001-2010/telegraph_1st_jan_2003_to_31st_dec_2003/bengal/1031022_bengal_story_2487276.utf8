 Wednesday, October 22, 2003 				 Arson chief arrested
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chakdah (Nadia), Oct. 21: A Trinamul Congress block president has been arrested for leading arsonists in the wake of the murder of former Dubra panchayat pradhan and party leader Samir Nag early last month. 																								Netai Dey Sarkar was picked up from his home in Dubra, 85 km from Calcutta. Trinamul supporters went on the rampage and set ablaze houses, two CPM offices and a library after Nags murder. 																								The police, led by superintendent Pallab Kanti Ghosh, were probing the murder as well as the violence that followed. Nags murder and the violence and arson were related. We have proof that Dey Sarkar had engineered the violence, said Ghosh.																								Trinamul accused the police of harassing innocent party workers at the CPMs behest. People held local CPM leaders responsible for Nags murder and spontaneously attacked their houses, said district Trinamul president Naresh Chaki.																								Rajat Kanti Das, a member of the CPMs youth wing, DYFI, was arrested earlier for the murder. Chaki alleged that the police were diluting the murder case. The names of a CPM local committee secretary and a member of the partys local committee figure in the FIR filed by Nags widow, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, November 29, 2003 				 CAT leak link to city arrest
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Nov. 28: Sandip  Ghosh, in his mid-thirties, was arrested from Bhowanipore  tonight for alleged links with Ranjit Singh, who was rounded  up by the CBI in connection with the leak of question papers  of the common admission test (CAT) for the Indian institutes  of management.																								Ghosh ran a students consultancy in a manner that police said matched Singhs mode of operation. Like Singh, he would guarantee admissions to students in return for amounts ranging from Rs 5 lakh to 10 lakh.																								We have found a diary from his consultancy firm where Singhs name is mentioned. The style of operation of both Ghosh and Singh is same and it seems there is a link between the two, said an official of Bhowanipore police station.																								Singh was held on Sunday, the day of CAT, along with several others across the country for allegedly leaking question papers. The CBI named him as the mastermind of the racket. 																								Ghosh was held following a students complaint. Sambit Sinha Roy of Baguiati had allegedly given him Rs 5 lakh as advance to secure admission to a medical college in Nepal. Ghosh had charged Rs 10 lakh for the deal. Sambits father Shyamalendu Sinha Roy paid 50 per cent of the amount. After the scheduled date of admission lapsed without Sambit getting a berth, he lodged a complaint, said the official.																								We carried out an extensive search at the firm on the ground floor of his residence on Bihari Doctor Lane, said an officer. He guaranteed admission to both medical and engineering courses, he added.																								The police are now focused on the diary. We have enough reason to believe that Ghosh had links with the man now in CBI custody. Some leads have started emerging, the officer said.

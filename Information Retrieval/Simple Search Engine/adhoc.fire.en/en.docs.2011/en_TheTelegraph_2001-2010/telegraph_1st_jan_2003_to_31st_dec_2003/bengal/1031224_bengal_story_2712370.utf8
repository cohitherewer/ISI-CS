The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Basu blame
																								Calcutta, Dec. 23: Jyoti Basu today held a laidback government responsible for the failure to improve the states literacy rate in two-and-a-half decades.																								Bengal has achieved 70 per cent literacy but it could be at least 4 per cent more had there not been a laidback attitude, said Basu, who was the chief minister for most of the period. He was speaking at the opening of the Vidyasagar Mela on the Maidan.

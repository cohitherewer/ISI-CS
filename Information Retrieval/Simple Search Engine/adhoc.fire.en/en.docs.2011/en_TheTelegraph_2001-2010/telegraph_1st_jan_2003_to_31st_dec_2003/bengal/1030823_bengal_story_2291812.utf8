The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, August 23, 2003 				 Boy killed, killer lynched
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purulia, Aug. 22: Five-year-old Shahadev Kumar of Bororola village in Jhalda, about 350 km from Calcutta, had no clue that the offer of snacks could be a deadly bait.																								Lured by the new silver chain Shahadevs father had bought him recently, Boka Rajak, 27, a fellow villager known to be a small-time thief, tempted the five-year-old and his brother to chops and samosas yesterday. 																								After the boys had finished the snack, he asked the brother to go home. Rajak allegedly took Shahadev to a desolate spot outside the village and strangled him, took off the chain and buried the body near a pond. 																								The parents realised he was missing yesterday evening. His body was found early this morning. When the villagers realised that Rajak was the last person seen with Shahadev, they made their own judgment. Rajak was hunted down, made to confess that he had killed the boy and lynched. No arrests have been made yet but the police superintendent said a case has been started.

 Saturday, August 02, 2003 				 Marriage record bill resurrected
 STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 1: Recording of marriages will be made compulsory in the state, if the Cabinet approves of it. 																								The government would place the West Bengal Compulsory Recording of Marriage Bill, 2003, before the Cabinet at a meeting on Tuesday. In 1999, the government had failed to get the ministers nod. 																								Registration of marriages is optional under the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act. Moreover, registration being rather expensive, many couples give it a skip. Hundreds of marriages in the state go unrecorded. Such marriages have a bearing on maintenance and legitimacy of children, inheritance and similar matters and so the bill has been resurrected.																								Once the Cabinet clears it, getting the bill passed in the House will be a formality for the government because of its majority.

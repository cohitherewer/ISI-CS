The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, November 30, 2003 				 CM pitches for job training 
 OUR BUREAU 																								Mathurapur/Pailan (South 24-Parganas), Nov. 29: Recounting a graduates aversion to running a poultry farm, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today made it clear that jobs could not be guaranteed for the educated youth if they do not acquire vocational expertise. 																								It is not enough to have a bachelors degree or masters degree to get a job. If one wants to get a job, one must have vocational training, Bhattacharjee said while inaugurating the Mass Education Technical Training Institute at Mirzapur More in Mathurapur, nearly 120 kilometres from Calcutta. 																								A few days ago, a graduate had approached him for a job in a primary school. When I told him that I could help him if he was interested in putting up a poultry farm, he left my office in a hurry. People in Bengal should bring about a change in their attitude and start thinking about self-employment and take up vocations like fish cultivation, hatcheries or floriculture, Bhattacharjee said. 																								Elaborating on his plans to boost entrepreneurship in the state, the chief minister said private institutes, like the one he inaugurated, in collaboration with the state government could create job opportunities in the state. 																								We are late, we should have realised earlier the importance of vocational training. We must open up many more institutes where people can be trained in various vocations and must help the nearly 24 lakh Class VIII dropouts to build a career on their own, he said. 																								Later, unveiling the Pailan School of International Management, another private institute off Diamond Harbour Road, which will offer low-cost vocational courses, Bhattacharjee struck a positive note, saying industrial growth was gradually picking up in Bengal. 																								I must admit a number of big industries like MAMC (Mining and Allied Machinery Corporation in Durgapur) has shut down during the past few years. But I can guarantee the industrial scene in the state is now improving. Investments are being made for development of agro-based, plastic and petrochemicals and even iron and steel industries. We will need thousands of engineers and technologists in the coming years, the chief minister said, claiming that investments in the industrial sector is expected to cross Rs 2,500 crore this year.

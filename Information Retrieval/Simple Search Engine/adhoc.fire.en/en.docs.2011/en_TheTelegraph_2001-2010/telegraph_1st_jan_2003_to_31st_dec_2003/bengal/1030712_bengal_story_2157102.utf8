 Saturday, July 12, 2003 				 Intuc leader arrested for murder
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, July 11: An Intuc leader at the Hindustan Motors unit in Hooghly was arrested today along with a promoter and a known anti-social in connection with the murder of a Congress municipal councillor.																								Gopesh Chakraborty was picked up from his house here early this morning. Police claimed to have gathered evidence of intra-party squabbles between him and the Konnagar civic body councillor, Manas Roy Chowdhury. Intuc is the Congress trade union arm.																								Roy Chowdhury was gunned down near Konnagar station on May 8 last year.																								The police said Chakraborty and the promoter, Shiv Shankar Singh, had paid the anti-social, Bachchu, Rs 50,000 each to get Roy Chowdhury killed. 																								Hooghly superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said Roy Chowdhury was murdered as a fallout of a power struggle between rival Congress leaders. He was preventing Chakraborty and his faction from capturing the post of the municipal chairman, said Kumar.

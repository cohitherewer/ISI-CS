 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Raids after power clash
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Basirhat (North 24-Parganas): Police today raided shops in Swarupnagar market here and snapped illegal power connections amid shop owners protests. 																								Fifty people have been rounded up since yesterday, when clashes broke out in protest against the arrest of a shop owner accused of hooking.																								The police fought those obstructing roads demanding the release of the trader and fired in the air to disperse the mob, which damaged three jeeps and injured at least 30 policemen. State Electricity Board officials had suspected that Mahammed Mustafa had hooked into the overhead line. It was found later that the hooking was the handiwork of a group owing allegiance to the CPM.																								The officer-in-charge of Basirhat and a constable, who were injured yesterday, were said to be in critical condition.

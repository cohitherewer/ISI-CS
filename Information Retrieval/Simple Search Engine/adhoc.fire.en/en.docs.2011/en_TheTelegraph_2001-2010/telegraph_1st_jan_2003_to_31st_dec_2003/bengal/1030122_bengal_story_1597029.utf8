 Wednesday, January 22, 2003 				 Another polio victim in Murshidabad
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN																								Behrampore, Jan. 21: Polio has spread further in Murshidabad. With the recent detection of a case in Kandi, the number of patients suffering from the disease in the district has gone up to 30.																								Sources in the district health department said two-year-old Moyna Khatun of Surkhali village had not been administered the oral polio vaccine. She is the first diagnosed polio patient in the Kandi sub-division.																								Earlier, 27 cases were recorded in the Jangipur sub-division alone. According to a survey, 8,68,218 children were registered for the pulse polio programme from the district but 8,30,225 received it. Though 96 per cent of the children were covered, about 38,000 remained beyond the purview of the eradication drive. With the find in Kandi, the district health administration has stepped up efforts to make the anti-polio drive on February 9 a success.																								Bijan Kumar Mondal, the chief medical officer of health, said: As more and more cases are surfacing, we are feeling the need for a stronger campaign to spread the concept of bringing in children during the vaccination drive. We are adopting new techniques to make people aware of the seriousness of the situation.																								People between 15 and 20 years, who have been crippled by the disease, will now be engaged in canvassing for the programme. They will be taken to the villages and asked to speak on the harm the disease can do, said Mondal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, April 04, 2003 				 Mamata, Pranab bare fangs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, April 3: Mamata Banerjee today threatened to expel Trinamul Congress workers found trying to forge an understanding with the Congress in the panchayat polls, burying her mahajot (grand alliance) formula against the ruling Marxists. 																								Mamata, who returned from Delhi last night, said: The BJP-Trinamul Congress combine will fight against the Congress-CPM alliance in the panchayat elections. There is no question of any kind of electoral understanding with the Congress, which betrayed us in the last Assembly polls. If any Trinamul candidate or worker tries to join hands with the Congress, the party will take stern disciplinary action against him. 																								Speaking at a rally in Sainthia, state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee returned the compliment, telling supporters that the party would disapprove of any cosying up to the BJP-Trinamul combine during the polls.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kalyani, Jan. 7: Sergeant Bapi Sen is not the only one in the state to have given his life resisting eve-teasers. Sanjit Das, 35, was shot inside a bus full of mute spectators when he stood up against drunk youths harassing a woman. 																								Eight months after Das was killed and on the day Sen was taken off life support, Das assassin was picked up by police.																								Raju Das, 28, a notorious inter-state criminal and a famed history shelter was arrested from a house at Halisahar in the Jagaddal police station area. 																								The North 24-Parganas police, however, does not know about the arrest yet. We had detained him once but he managed to give us the slip, said the officer in-charge of the Jagaddal police station.																								Raju, a resident of the Bidhannagar locality here, was picked up from a brickfield in Halishar and brought here yesterday. The police convened a news conference today to announce the arrest. Sub-divisional police officer Prasun Banerjee said the district police felt it was a major achievement. Not only the murder of Sanjit, Raju was wanted in several serious crimes, including a murder he committed last June at Mogra in Hooghly district, Banerjee said.																								Sanjit, a resident of Kalyangram in North 24-Parganas, was shot in the bus plying between Naihati and Barasat on April 14. He could not bear to see four drunk men go after a young woman, hurling obscenities and making lewd gestures.																								He raised his voice and as the bus pulled past Jagaddal, one of them whipped out a revolver and shot him. The four asked the passengers to remain seated, stopped the bus and disembarked. 																								Sanjit was pronounced dead when taken to a hospital in Titagarh, North 24-Parganas. 																								The incident had created a stir and North 24-Parganas magistrate H.K. Dwivedi was sent by the government to Sanjits residence to hand over a compensation.																								But did it take a Bapi Sen for the police to nab the culprit?																								Banerjee said the interrogation of several members of his gang led to Rajus arrest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, June 19, 2003 				 Three of a family hacked by father 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Canning, June 18: A man  hacked his wife, son and daughter-in-law last night in their  sleep before committing suicide. 																								Sahara Banu, Saukat and Zohara were rushed to the Canning Subdivisional Hospital from their house at Ghutiari Sharif. They were later shifted to the M.R. Bangur Hospital in Calcutta, where their condition was said to be critical.																								Neighbours of Alauddin Lashkars son-in-law Sheikh Samiruddin said a quarrel broke out between them late last evening. This led Lashkar to believe that his family members were conspiring against him, police said. On returning home, Lashkar went straight for the bedroom armed with a sharp weapon. He hit all three of the injured several times on the head.																								Probably from a sense of remorse, he tried to hack himself to death. His attempts failed and Lashkar consumed pesticide. He had been living alone in one of the two houses he owned. A farmer by profession, he had differences over sharing land and quarrels in the family were frequent, the police said. 																								Additional superintendent of police S.S. Panda said: It is difficult to say why he was so ruthless. Samiruddin is absconding.

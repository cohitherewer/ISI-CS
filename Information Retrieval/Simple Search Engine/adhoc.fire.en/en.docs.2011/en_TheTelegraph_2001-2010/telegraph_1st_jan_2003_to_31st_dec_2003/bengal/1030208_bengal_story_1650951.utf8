 Saturday, February 08, 2003 				 Prize dogs deserted in kennel 
 RANJAN LAHIRY																								Burdwan, Feb. 7: The fate of nine pedigreed dogs locked in kennels without food and water since their breeders fled for fear of creditors nine days ago has raised the hackles of animal welfare activists here.																								The dogs  three German shepherds, two labrador retrievers and four spitz  discovered deep in misery on Wednesday, have been provided biscuits and water by members of the Burdwan Society for Animal Welfare. But members of the organisation said the animals could still perish if they were not taken care of immediately.																								We got to know about the state of the dogs on Wednesday and we tried to feed them water and biscuits, but they are getting weaker and weaker as they have not had regular meals for days, said the societys secretary, Tripti Chakraborty.																								The society has lodged an FIR against the kennel-owners, Ashis and Joydeb Ghosh. We want the authorities to rescue the dogs immediately. We want to shift them to our societys shelter in Calcutta, but nothing seems to be moving on the part of the administration, said Chakraborty.																								The society got veterinarian Nirmal Kapoor to have a look at the dogs. The vet wrote in his report: Due to unhygienic and uncared conditions, the health of all the animals is going to deteriorate. Immediate steps are necessary to save them.																								The kennel-owners had begun their business of breeding dogs last year in the Kanchannagar area of the town. Local councillor Madan Karmakar said they had borrowed money from residents and had been running a thrift fund illegally. They had collected more than Rs 10 lakh from the residents. They fled the locality leaving the dogs behind, said Karmakar. 																								Sub-divisional officer Naba Gopal Hira said the administration is trying to rescue the dogs. But the district hardly has any facility where they can be treated. We have no indoor infrastructure to treat the dogs, we are helpless. We will help the society in whatever way we can, said district veterinary officer A.K. Bollar.																								Additional superintendent of police S.N. Dutta said efforts are on to get a handler. We have asked for trained hands, let us see, Dutta said.																								Residents, however, are up in arms against the missing brothers. The victims of the fraud have little hope of getting back their money by complaining to the police as they were part of an illegal racket. We want the dogs so that we can recover some of our money by selling them off, said Amal Roy, a resident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 10, 2003 				 Limited seat fight for CPM
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 9: The CPM will contest a limited number of seats in the elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Delhi and will not field any candidate in Mizoram.																								We dont want a split in anti-BJP votes and, therefore, have decided not to contest too many seats in four states, CPM state secretary and politburo member Anil Biswas said after the three-day meeting of the partys central committee concluded today. 																								The CPM will not field a candidate in Mizoram as it does not have a unit in the state. 																								Though the party is saying it will contest few seats in the four states to ensure the BJPs defeat, the central committee admitted that the CPM had no significant presence there, except in small pockets. 																								The Left parties and other non-Congress secular outfits do not have a major presence in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Delhi. The CPM will, therefore, contest seats where it can effectively intervene in the outcome. It will seek seat adjustments with the CPI and other secular Opposition parties, party general secretary H.K.S. Surjeet said after the meeting.																								After Fridays politburo meeting, the CPM said it will not seek an alliance with the Congress but did not rule out one if the offer came from the other end.																								Surjeet ruled out immediate revival of the third front as an alternative to the BJP and apparently, the CPM is expecting the Congress to play a major role in taking on the saffron brigade.  Midwives protest																								A group of auxiliary nurses-cum-midwives from Purulia allegedly ransacked the office of the deputy director of nursing today during a demonstration demanding transfers.																								The nurses damaged fax machines and furniture. Police said nine nurses and two of their relatives have been arrested. Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said there are no provisions of transfer in the post. 																								Chatterjee said he had asked for the names of those involved in the demonstration and attack, and they might be suspended.demonstration in front of the office of the deputy director of nursing on CIT Building in central Calcutta and allegedly ransacked the office. They were protesting against not being transferred, and having to work at the same place since they were appointed. 																								It is also learnt that the CPM will ask its supporters in these states to vote for the secular and democratic parties in the absence of CPM candidates. 																								This clearly indicates that Congress is organisationally strong in these states and can counter the BJP. The CPM votes are likely to tilt towards the Congress as the party is determined to thwart the BJP.																								The party is apparently critical about the Congress and decided to expose the Congress governments anti-people policies in the states. But the CPM has not categorically rules out the possibility of accepting any invitation from the Congress to fight the elections in these states together without an official electoral patch-up to defeat the BJP. 																								It is learnt that the CPM will not invite the Congresss help in the four states. But the party will not ignore any plea if it comes from the Congresss side to fight the polls on the basis of basic understandings between the two to defeat the BJP, party insiders said. 																								The central committee also congratulated the state leadership of the CPM for the partys splendid victory in the recently concluded panchayat elections in the state. The victory of the party in the Tripura Assembly polls and in the panchayat elections in Bengal will certainly embolden our organisation and help us to fight the elections in four states more actively, said party leaders.

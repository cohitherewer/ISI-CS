The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, March 14, 2003 				 Half-an-hour bandh
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 13: All public transport vehicles  buses, mini buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws  across the state will observe a half-hour chakka bandh from 12 noon on March 21 to protest the frequent hikes in fuel prices.																								The decision was the outcome of transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys meeting with representatives of major public transport organisations and Central trade unions at Writers Buildings today.																								Asked if there were plans to hike bus, mini bus and taxi fares in the near future, the transport minister said with the frequent fluctuation in fuel prices, there was logic behind the demands for a fare hike by the transport operators. 																								We will soon revise the fares, Chakraborty added. 																								He said the wheels of all buses, mini buses, taxis and other modes of transport will grind to a halt on an as-is-where-is basis when the clock strikes 12 noon on March 21. The minister also appealed to private car-owners to participate in this unique protest.

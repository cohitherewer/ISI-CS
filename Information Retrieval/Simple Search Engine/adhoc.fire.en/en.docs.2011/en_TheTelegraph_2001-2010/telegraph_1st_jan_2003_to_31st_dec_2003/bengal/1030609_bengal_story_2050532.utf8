 Monday, June 09, 2003 				 CPM leader held for rape
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kharagpur (West Midnapore) June 8: A CPM leader here has been arrested for allegedly raping a 40-year-old woman. 																								Janardhan Bera, a leader of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (the CPMs youth wing) was picked up from his in-laws house at Shusunia village after the woman lodged a complaint against him with the Sadakpur outpost of the Kharagpur police station.																								CPM zonal committee member Anit Mondol, however, claimed that the arrest was the handiwork of the police. 																								The police wanted to get even with Bera as he had protested against their work on a case of death, he said. They tried to pass off the death as suicide. Bera wanted a thorough probe into the matter and had claimed that it was a murder case. They have definitely framed him, Mondol said.																								According to officials, Bera reportedly asked a local couple to come to his house in West Kharagpur on Thursday afternoon to solve a dispute. Accordingly, Bachchu Maiti and his wife Kali and daughter Uttara arrived at Beras house around 1.30 pm.																								It was alleged that after a brief interaction with Bachchu, Bera asked him to get some pan for him from a nearby shop. Bachchu left with his daughter.																								On returning from the pan shop, Bachchu found Kali in tears. On being asked repeatedly what was wrong, she broke down. Kali alleged that the DYFI leader raped her. 																								A complaint was lodged with the Sadakpur outpost. The police picked up Bera on Friday on the basis of the rape charge. He was produced in court yesterday. 																								A medical examination of the alleged victim could not be conducted to confirm the allegation as the doctors were on holiday, said a senior district police officer.																								CPI local committee leader Jyotilal Banerjee condemned the arrest but not for the reason cited by the CPM leader, Mondol.																								Banerjee said Bera was being framed by his own party (the CPM). He is extremely well-known and someone in the party is trying to get even with him, he said.

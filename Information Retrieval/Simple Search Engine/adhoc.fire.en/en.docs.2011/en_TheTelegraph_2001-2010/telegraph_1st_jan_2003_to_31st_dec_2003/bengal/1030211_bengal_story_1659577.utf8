 Tuesday, February 11, 2003 				 Ten killed in truck crash
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kalyani, Feb. 10: Ten people died when a truck carrying labourers bound for Lalgola in Murshidabad lost control and hit the boundary wall of a temple at Simurali near here on National Highway 34.																								After hitting the wall, the truck overturned near a rickshaw van stand at dawn today. Police said four among the dead were rickshaw van drivers. The rest were travelling on the truck. 																								Milan Dey, one of the lucky passengers, said the truck was carrying labourers who were mostly heading home for Id and worked in a sewerage system in South 24-Parganas.																								Most of us were asleep when there was a loud noise. I do not remember anything after that. When I got back to sense, I found the truck lying on its side near a teastall, Milan recounted at the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital here this afternoon. Most of them were carrying food, new utensils and clothes for their families. 																								Police said the driver lost control at a very high speed, possibly after the brakes failed, and hit the wall of the roadside temple, the tea stall and then crushed the rickshaw van drivers. 																								Two men on the truck died on the spot. Five others died on way to the hospital. Three died after admission. Most of them had severe head injuries, multiple fractures and internal injuries, said chief medical officer of Nadia Prabhas Chowdhury, who visited the hospital. Five of the injured were shifted to R.G. Kar and Calcutta medical college hospitals. Chowdhury said the hospital here did not have any facility to treat head injuries.																								The rickshaw van drivers assembled at the spot every morning to ferry vegetables and other produce to the Simurali market.

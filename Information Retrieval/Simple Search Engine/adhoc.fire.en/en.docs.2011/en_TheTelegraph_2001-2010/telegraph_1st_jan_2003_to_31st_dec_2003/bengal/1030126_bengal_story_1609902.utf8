 Sunday, January 26, 2003 				 Students holiday turns nightmare
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 25: Days after the blood-splattered Road Safety Week ended, three women were killed and 20 schoolchildren injured in accidents in the city.																								Three ragpickers died at the Tiljala dumping ground at 11 am when a lorry carrying garbage overturned on them when a vehicle hit it from behind. Local residents rushed to rescue the women and took them to National College Hospital, but they had died by then. Drivers of both vehicles got away.																								Two have been identified as Kalpana Barui, 34, and Sonu Mandal, 18. The bodies of the three women have been sent for post-mortem.																								Earlier, around 8.30 am, a private bus bringing schoolchildren from Kulpi to an amusement park in Calcutta hit a lorry on Diamond Harbour Road. At least 20 of the children from Gangadhar High School were taken to Diamond Harbour Hospital. Sixteen were released after first-aid. Four are in hospital with serious injuries.																								The lorry driver fled, but his vehicle was impounded.																								Police are blaming fog for the collision, which occurred between Ramkrishnapur and Srinagar. Visibility on Diamond Harbour Road was poor because of the fog, said Diamond Harbour sub-divisional police officer Mehmud Akhtar.																								The bus driver tried to avert the collision but lost control and hit a tree.																								Earlier this week, a 13-year-old on his way to school with his father and a mother riding pillion with her son were crushed to death on Diamond Harbour Road.																								Wall collapse																								Seven workers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation were injured when a wall near the Gobra burial ground on South Topsia Road collapsed. 																								The workers were cleaning the roadside drainage system when the mishap occurred. The injured were taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where the condition of one is critical.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Transfer rollback 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, Dec. 17: Under pressure from the district administration and its own leaders, the CPM-led government has rescinded the transfer order of treasury officer Gobinda Basak, who had launched a campaign against bogus house rent allowance and pension claimants.																								Basak, who took over as the officer-in-charge of one of the two treasuries here a year ago, recovered Rs 2 crore during his drives. But in a surprise move on November 19, the finance department posted him as finance secretary in the Durgapur Municipal Corporation. The order did not cite any reason for the transfer. 																								A dejected Basak had said he would quit the state financial services as he could not accept the transfer order. Besides, he pointed out that his wife, a schoolteacher, suffered from cancer and needed periodic check-ups in Mumbai. My daughter is in Calcutta and my son lives in the US. Who will look after my wife if I am transferred? he asked. 																								The officer got support from district magistrate Ashok Bala, who wrote to the finance department asking it to reconsider the decision. Gobinda Basak is a very good officer. From the time he joined, he has recovered at least Rs 2 crore for the government. He is efficient and of unimpeachable integrity. In the interest of the people, the government should keep Basak posted in Malda for at least three years, Bala wrote. 																								CPM legislator from Englishbazar Samar Roy, too, rallied around Basak and took up the case with the party high command, including the chief minister and the finance minister. I told them that an officer like Basak was needed when the government is issuing instructions to stop wasteful expenditure. Not only has Basak put an end to bogus claims, he has succeeded in recovering the money, Roy said. 																								Bala confirmed that the government has withdrawn its order. After considering all issues, the government has cancelled the transfer notification. Basak will remain posted in the Malda treasury. He is an asset, the district magistrate said.																								WBCS officers greeted the decision, saying had Basak been shifted, it would have had a demoralising effect on government servants at a time when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has asked them to work fearlessly and weed out corruption. If honesty is rewarded with a transfer after 11 months, from where will we get the incentive to be fearless? asked an officer. 																								Basak shot into news when he froze the pay of schoolteachers who had been illegally claiming extra pay and house rent allowance. The teachers, finding the officer too tough to hoodwink, had returned the money they had drawn. The officer then cracked down on employees in other departments who had been similarly collecting money illegally.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, September 12, 2003 				 From sea to snow in 11 days this season
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Sept. 11: Sun-kissed  beaches, heady hills, untamed jungles, heritage houses and  more: all neatly rolled into an 11-day tour across the state.																								Bangla Dekho (explore Bengal) is the new package the government is offering visitors keen on soaking in the splendours of the state. Starting from Calcutta, the tour will include halts at Digha, Bishnupur, Santiniketan, Behrampore, Gour, Pandua, Raigunj and Siliguri.																								Forest freaks will make a stopover at the heritage town of Cooch Behar before heading for Jaldapara, Jayanti and Rajabhatkhawa in search of the elusive leopard and the rhinoceros. Mountain maniacs will head for Darjeeling. The trip on West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation buses will cost Rs 6,950 per head. 																								 The dates of the trip are out as well  October 18, November 22, December 6 and 20 and January 3 next year. 																								We are targeting people from outside the state but we believe the tour will score well with non-resident Indians and foreigners, tourism minister Dinesh Dakua said at Writers Buildings. 																								Two trips to the Dooars were also announced. One of them, which starts from Cooch Behar, will wind its way through Alipurduar, Jayanti and Madarihat. The other will include Jalpaiguri and Gorumara Wildlife Sanctuary. The four-day-three-night trips will cost Rs 2,300 per head. 																								A four-day West Bengal Festival 2003 will be organised at Nalban off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in December.

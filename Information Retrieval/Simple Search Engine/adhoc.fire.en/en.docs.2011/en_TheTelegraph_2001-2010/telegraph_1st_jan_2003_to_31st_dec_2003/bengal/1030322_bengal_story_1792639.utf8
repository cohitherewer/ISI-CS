The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, March 22, 2003 				 Option open on power subsidy 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, March 21: Power minister Mrinal Banerjee today told the Assembly that there was no provision in the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) Act to provide cross-subsidy to power consumers, especially those below the poverty line. 																								Replying to a motion on the SERCs abolition of cross-subsidy moved by the Trinamul Congress, Banerjee said: What we can give is subsidy and that, too, after amending the Bengal Electricity Act. 																								I must not say anything on this because the issue is pending before the court. But I can assure you that the government will consider sympathetically the plight of the poorer sections of electricity consumers and take appropriate steps after the disposal of the case, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, September 11, 2003 				 Do-it-now dose to state employees 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Sept. 10: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today wielded the do-it-now cane on his fief, asking secretaries at Writers Buildings  and sending a message down to the babus  to monitor performance and attendance, cut down on expenses, increase revenue collection and pull up their socks. 																								If all play and no work has become the work culture for state employees, it wont be anymore, he made it clear. 																								Bhattacharjee asked the secretaries and principal secretaries to submit detailed reports on the staff strength of their departments surplus or short  by the year-end. The government plans to form a cell of surplus employees and re-deploy them. A committee set up earlier to do the same had failed. 																								In the letter informing the secretaries of todays meeting, Bhattacharjee had made its purpose clear: improvement of efficiency in the governments functioning through enforcement of punctuality in attendance, improved staff performance, observance of the austerity measures and ensuring accountability. 																								Bhattacharjee emphasised that the austerity measures  like curbs on use of cars and phones, and food and flowers at meetings  should be strictly enforced, as also the rule that those without 75 per cent attendance cannot be promoted. 																								He was particularly unhappy with the revenue generated by the excise department, which has not picked up in Bengal as in other states.

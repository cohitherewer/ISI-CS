The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 03, 2003 				 CII plans to take state places
 A STAFF REPORTER Mumbai, June 2: The Confederation  of Indian Industry (CII) will help the Bengal government  organise promotional roadshows in various parts of the country. 																								Tarun Das, the CII director-general, said after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees first meeting with Mumbai industrialists: This is the business capital of the country and most of the investment originates here. After the successful meeting here, the next stop should be Delhi. We will be happy to organise a similar event for the West Bengal government in Delhi.																								The positive vibrations from the chief ministers talks with Mumbais business community will reach other parts of the country, he said, urging the government to capitalise on the opportunity. 																								Specific plans are also on the drawing board at the CII to help the state build on its strengths. We propose to set up a CII and Bengal working group on agriculture to take it to the next stage of development, said CII president Anand Mahindra.																								To rediscover the states rich manufacturing past, he suggested a three-pronged plan. These would comprise a well-articulated manufacturing policy, training and retraining of personnel, and adoption of measures such as total quality management, environment management and technology upgradation. 																								Bengal has a huge talent pool, which the state can leverage. We will share with the government our findings from a study of the services sector, Mahindra said. For the entertainment industry, he suggested that the state-sponsored film festival be turned into an international forum for cerebral cinema and promised CII assistance in such an endeavour.																								We experienced the scope of foreign exchange earning capabilities of the entertainment industry during the film festival in Cannes. The state can use names like Satyajit Ray to tap the niche market of intelligent films and promote Calcutta as the centre for screening these films, Mahindra said.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Sept. 11: The government will invite private companies to restructure state-run units that are making losses. 																								Industries minister Nirupam Sen today said early retirement schemes (ERS) for surplus workers would be introduced in these units. He added that during his visit to UK between September 12 and 20, he would meet representatives of the Department for International Development (DFID) and plead them to provide funds for the ERS. 																								It would mark the second phase of industrial restructuring of the state-run units. The DFID is already funding the scheme in some of the loss-making units that were part of the first phase. We want to extend the scheme and begin the second phase, said Sen. The government is yet to finalise the units that will be restructured, he added. Acid attack																								Two alleged schoolboys sprayed acid on three girls and their mother at a village near Kharagpur last night.																								Police said the boys were classmates of Madhurima Poddar, the youngest sister, and had been teasing her for some time. Kabita Poddar was in the kitchen with her daughters  Soma, Nilima and Madhurima  when they splashed nitric acid, generally used by jewellers, through the window and fled. Soma and Nilima were released after first-aid. Kabita and Madhurima were admitted to Kharagpur State General Hospital.																								The youths were identified as Arun Rana and Tanmoy De of Telipukur High School. The police said they are absconding.

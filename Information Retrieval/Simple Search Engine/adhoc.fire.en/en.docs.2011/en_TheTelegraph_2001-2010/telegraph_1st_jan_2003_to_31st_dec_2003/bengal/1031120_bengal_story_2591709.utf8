 Thursday, November 20, 2003 				 Haryana summon for Nadia MLA
 PRONAB MONDAL AND RABI BANERJEE 																								Calcutta/Krishnagar, Nov. 19: A Haryana court has summoned a CPM legislator in connection with the trial of an ISI suspect, who, police believe, is a Bangladeshi but was declared a resident of Nadia by the MLA.																								Block land revenue officer Subhash Biswas and the pradhan of a local panchayat in Nadia, too, have been directed to appear before the judge on November 25. 																								Samsul Islam Mollah, MLA from Chapra in Nadia district, was issued the summons after Haryana police recently arrested Jamil Sheikh from Rewari for his alleged involvement in ISI activities. Investigators came across Samsuls name in a residence certificate, issued by the MLA in his letterhead, in which Jamil is described as a resident of Chapra. During interrogation, they came to know he is a resident of Bangladesh.																								Two months ago, the CPM faced a similar embarrassment when land reforms minister and MLA from Canning (East) Abdur Rezzak Mollah was found to have issued a residence certificate to one Habibur Rehman, describing him as a permanent resident of Canning. 																								Later, he was accused in a dacoity and police investigation showed Rehman was a Bangladeshi national and a resident of Khulna district. After a probe, police found Rehman had wangled the certificate signed by Mollah with the help of a section of low-level CPM cadres without the ministers knowledge.																								When contacted, Samsul admitted having issued the residential certificate in favour of Jamil. Jamil came to me with references from BLRO (Subhash) Biswas and the panchayat pradhan. I issued him the certificate only after examining the other reference papers. I have done it to help Jamil get a job in Haryana, he said.																								The MLA is not ready to appear in court in Haryana. It is not possible for me to appear before the court on November 25. I have other preoccupations, he said.																								BLRO Biswas could not be contacted. District land and land reforms officer Bhabani Prasad Pal said he has asked Biswas to submit a report soon. It is not possible for me to comment on how Jamil managed the certificate until I get the report, Pal said.																								Senior district officials are also investigating how Jamil managed the certificate issued by the local panchayat pradhan. We will speak to him as soon as possible. It cant be ruled out that Jamil had links with some people in Chapra block. We are trying our level best to track them down, an official said.

 Monday, August 04, 2003 				 Postmaster admits theft 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Behrampore, Aug. 3: Even  last week, customers would deposit all their savings at  the sub-post office in Lalgola for a safe and secure keep.  But custodians of public money turned out to be thieves. 																								Three postal department employees, including the postmaster, broke open lockers and took away Rs 5.19 lakh on Friday night. 																								Nitish Das, the postmaster, then made it appear that the money had been stolen and called Murshidabads postal superintendent, Ambujakkha Mukherjee, to tell him about the theft. 																								Das lodged a complaint with the Lalgola police station yesterday morning.																								This morning, police lifted the curtains on the alleged post office burglary. The postmaster was arrested along with cashier Ganesh Podder and group-D staff Ratan Das. The police said they confessed to their crime.																								Das informed me over phone yesterday that the money was stolen after locks were broken open. I asked him to lodge a complaint with the police. I had a suspicion and the police probe confirmed it. I promised all the help I could offer to the investigating officials, said Mukherjee. 																								Subdivisional police officer Subrata Mitra said: The statements of the three were conflicting and that led to our suspicion. Nitish Das, Ganesh Podder and Ratan Das have now admitted that they had committed the theft. 																								Mukherjee has lodged an FIR against the three postal employees, who stole the money and made it appear that it had been stolen. It is an unforgivable offence to steal public money. More so if it is stolen by those who had been assigned to be its custodians, the district postal superintendent said. 																								Das and Podder are residents of Bhagabangola and Ratan is from Lalgola. Postal authorities said though the money has not been recovered, customers need not worry.

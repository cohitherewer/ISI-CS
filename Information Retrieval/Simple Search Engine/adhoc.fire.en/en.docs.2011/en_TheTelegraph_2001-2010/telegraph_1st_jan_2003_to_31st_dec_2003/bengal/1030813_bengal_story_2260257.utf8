 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Party probe into land deals of panchayat duo
 DEBASHIS CHATTERJEE																								Bhangor, Aug. 12: The CPMs vigilance wing in South 24-Parganas, called the district control commission, has initiated inquiry against two influential party members here for allegedly grabbing government land by using their official positions in the panchayat. 																								Separate probes are being conducted against Mohammed Muchhahaque Mollah, a former sabhadhipati of Bhangor-II panchayat samiti, and Shyamal Ghosh, the former karmadhyaksha in charge of land in Bhangor gram panchayat.																								District CPM secretary Shantimoy Bhattacharya confirmed that probes were on against Mollah and Ghosh. Land deals made by the two are being looked into, he said and added: I will not say anything more till the investigation is complete.																								It was alleged that Mollah had built his two-storey house on 1,800 square feet owned by the panchayat samiti. He had also been accused of acquiring about 10-cottahs at a very low rate for his sisters Halema Khatun, Madeja Khatun and Salema Khatun and brother Ishaq Mollah. He allegedly sold land belonging to the zilla parishad to two villagers. Mollah is also under scrutiny for allegedly selling land belonging to the Bhangor-Bejoyganj market at premium rates. The partys vigilance wing is now trying to find out how much land he has actually grabbed. 																								Mollah pleaded ignorance about any inquiry but said vested interest groups within the party were plotting against him.																								I was not aware that the land belonged to either the panchayat or the zilla parishad. My brother and all my sisters are either physically or mentally challenged and there is none to look after them. Moreover, I am a cardiac patient myself and it is really difficult for me to bear the strain of accusations. If the control commission asks me, I shall appear before it and explain everything, Mollah said. He said the important functionaries of the zilla parishad knew about his deals. 																								Former sabhadhipati of the zilla parishad Sova Dutta said she was aware of some of Mollahs deals. In all these deals, I had given my consent at the written request of an important party functionary, Dutta said. 																								She refused to identify the important party functionary.																								Ghosh, the man in charge of land in the rural body here, is said to have acquired about 5 bighas of government land for his wife Mira, daughter and sons at a throwaway price. 																								Asked about the allegations against Ghosh, Mollah said he was not aware of them. He (Ghosh) has enough land. He is an important party member.

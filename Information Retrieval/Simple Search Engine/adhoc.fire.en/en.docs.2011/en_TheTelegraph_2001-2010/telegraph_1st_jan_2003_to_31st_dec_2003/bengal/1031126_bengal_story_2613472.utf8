The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
		 Wednesday, November 26, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Calcutta, Nov. 25: The supply of essential commodities to the Northeast is likely to be hit with truck operators here deciding to suspend trips to the region from Friday, fearing more attacks on Hindi-speaking people.				 																																	Most drivers and their helpers are Hindi speaking and they feel insecure following the recurring ethnic violence in Assam. Apart from attacking the drivers and helpers, the miscreants are looting goods, said Satyajit Majumdar, the secretary of the Federation of Truck Operators. He said more than 7,000 trucks are stranded in Assam. The Assam government, however, said all steps are being taken. Government spokesman and minister Pankaj Bora told PTI: The transporters should not listen to rumours and be alarmed. The situation here (in Assam) is normal and under control.				 																																	Calcutta: The government will receive Rs 19 crore from the Centre for better management of civic bodies. Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said the money will be distributed  according to performance. He added that land registration offices are being computerised following a central proposal.				 																																	Calcutta: CBI officers raided the Uttarpara (Hooghly) home of a customs officer posted at Kidderpore dock on Tuesday. They recovered Rs 31 lakh and fixed deposit and share certificates worth Rs 10 lakh.				 																																	Calcutta: Two people were arrested on charges of travelling with false passports from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport. Police said Amarjit Singh and Balbinder Singh were pushed back to India from Vienna where the duo from Jalandhar landed on Saturday with false passports.

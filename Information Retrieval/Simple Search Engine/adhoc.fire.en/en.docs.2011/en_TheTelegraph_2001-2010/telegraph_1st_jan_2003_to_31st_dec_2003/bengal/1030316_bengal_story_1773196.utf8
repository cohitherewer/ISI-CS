 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Suri, March 15: A 36-year-old man was found murdered last night at the Birbhum district hospital, where he had been admitted on Thursday after a clash over blaring music at a local shrine. 																								Police recovered the body of Bipad Taran Das of Kariddah village with multiple injuries on his face on the premises of the hospital morgue. 																								Police said Das was admitted to the hospital after fellow villagers thrashed him for refusing to lower the volume of music. 																								Fed up with the loud noise from the loudspeakers, a group of villagers went to the shrine where some young men were playing film music and requested them to lower the volume, said a Suri police station official. 																								An argument ensued after Bipad Taran insisted they will carry on playing the music loudly, the official said. The quarrel degenerated into a clash and Das was beaten up. 																								Birbhum superintendent of police Akhil Roy said no one has been arrested yet for the murder. We have started an inquiry to find out the motive, he said. 																								Preliminary investigations show Das was murdered outside the hospital and dumped on the premises this morning. Hospital sources said Das went missing from the ward at 10 pm yesterday. The police, they said, were informed about the missing patient. 																								Apparently, the clash was not so serious that it could drive the rival group to kill a person. There could be other motives for the murder, one of Das neighbours said. The police, however, have launched a search for the people involved in Thursdays clash. Police sources said they were looking for the youths, Kalu and Baam.

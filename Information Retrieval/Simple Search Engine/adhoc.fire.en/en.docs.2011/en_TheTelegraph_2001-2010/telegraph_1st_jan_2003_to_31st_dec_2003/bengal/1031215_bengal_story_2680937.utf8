 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 CBI in loan fraud probe 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 14: The high court has ordered a CBI probe into the alleged disbursement of loans worth Rs 3 crore among Eastern Railway employees on the basis of fake documents. 																								Court papers made available today showed that the railway authorities were asked to file an affidavit on Friday to clarify whether they stood guarantor for the loans.																								The railway employees had been accused of taking loans from the Sankrail branches of the Bank of Bikaner and the Bank of Jaipur by furnishing fake letters. The railway told the court that it did not issue any such letter.																								Earlier, state government employees were alleged to have taken loans running into crores by submitting false documents. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta has ordered an inquiry and threatened to take stern action against those involved in the fraud. He has also issued a circular to all departmental heads asking them not to issue guarantor certificates to employees.																								Railway counsel Uttam Majumdar said the alleged fraud came to light when the employees failed to pay the instalments in time. The banks filed suits against the employees in which rail was made a party, he said.																								When the case came up for hearing before Justice Barin Ghosh on Friday, the counsel said the railway did not issue any letter to the accused employees. Justice Ghosh asked the railway authorities to file an affidavit saying as much. Then I will send the matter to (the) CBI for investigation, he said. 																								The railway counsel said a departmental inquiry has been ordered. The existence of a gang working in collusion with government employees has not been ruled out. The gangsters, who apparently have connections in the banks, are said to be approaching both central and state government employees with easy-loan offers.																								A number of regional managers of nationalised banks wrote to the departmental chiefs alleging that the employees were not repaying loans in time. They also said that the loans were disbursed after receiving guarantor certificates from the government, an official of state finance department said.

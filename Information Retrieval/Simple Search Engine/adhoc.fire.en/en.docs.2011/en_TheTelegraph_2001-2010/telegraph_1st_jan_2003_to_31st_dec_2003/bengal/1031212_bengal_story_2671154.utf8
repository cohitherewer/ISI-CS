The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Two hits in national strike
 OUR BUREAU																								Dec. 11: An all-India students strike called by the Students Federation of India (SFI) brought academic activities to a halt in Bengal and Kerala. 																								In the southern state, where a Congress-led coalition is in power, government-run institutions remained closed and most private ones declared holiday.																								In Bengal, classes were not held in most schools and the 300-odd colleges where the students unions are controlled by the SFI. 																								Classes were held in some private and missionary institutions but there were allegations of SFI supporters trying to force them shut. South Point School vice-president .G. Khaitan alleged that both junior and senior sections had to be closed down when strike supporters prevented students from entering the campus.																								The strike was called demanding a central legislation to empower the states to establish control on affairs of private institutions, especially in determining fees and admission procedures.

 Sunday, June 22, 2003 				 Student stabs law college principal
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Midnapore, June 21: The principal of the law college here was stabbed by a first-year student who was debarred from taking a test for not attending classes regularly. 																								Manas Roy, 50, was attacked inside the law department building on the Midnapore College campus around 1 pm. He was coming down the stairs when the youth plunged a knife into his stomach and fled the scene on his bicycle. Sudam Mondal, 24, later surrendered to police.																								We saw Roy slumped at the foot of the stairs, lying in a pool of blood clutching his midriff and crying out that he was attacked by a thief, said a teacher, Badruzzoha Mollah. He said the fourth period of the law classes was in session in the building at that time, while Part I examinations were on in the other buildings of Midnapore College.																								We gave him water while arrangements were being made to take him to hospital, Mollah said. Roy was rushed to the district hospital here, but had to be shifted to a private nursing home as there were no surgeon in the hospital. He was later brought back to the district hospital and operated on. 																								As Roy went under the scalpel, Sudam turned up at the police lines. He went to the office of the reserve force at 2 pm and confessed that he had stabbed the principal. Asked by the policemen there why he did not go to the police station, Sudam said he did not know where it was and came to the nearest police installation he saw. 																								Police sources said Sudam told his interrogators that he wanted to kill Roy for not allowing him to sit for the examinations. He told us that many students who, like him, had attended few classes had been allowed to sit for the examination in lieu of Rs 5,000 that the principal pocketed. Therefore, he wanted to teach him a lesson, said one of the officers who questioned him. 																								He told the police that he had bought a kitchen knife yesterday but did not get an opportunity to attack Roy. We have to find out whether there is any other motive behind the attack, said West Midnapore police superintendent K.C. Meena. 																								Sudam comes from a village in Bankuras Chhatna police station area. 																								Mollah said the boy had been threatening Roy for the past two months for different reasons. The youth was not successful in the three-year law course. So we had advised him to rejoin for the five-year course, Mollah said.																								Dipankar Majhi, superintendent of the district hospital, said Roy was out of danger. His stomach was perforated and we had to thoroughly wash it before putting some stitches. Barring the fear of post-operation infection, he is out of danger, Majhi said. 																								Trains cancelled																								Train services to the Northeast have been disrupted following the derailment of a goods train between Kokrajhar and Fakira Gram in Assam after a blast last night. Railway officials said Kamrup Express and Kanchanjungha Express scheduled to leave Calcutta on Sunday and Monday have been cancelled.

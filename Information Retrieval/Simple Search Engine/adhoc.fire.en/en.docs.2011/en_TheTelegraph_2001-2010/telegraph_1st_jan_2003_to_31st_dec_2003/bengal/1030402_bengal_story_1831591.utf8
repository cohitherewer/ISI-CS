 Wednesday, April 02, 2003 				 Guest casts light on doctor death
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, April 1: The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) probing the murder of Chandan Sen, the general surgeon of Ranaghat sub-divisional hospital, has stumbled upon more guests at the dinner Sen attended before his body was fished out of a pond. 																								CID sleuths said they have substantial evidence to suggest that Namita Ghosh, a common friend of Sen and the other guests, and two others were present at the dinner. The CID has detained Namita and has been grilling her for the past three days. Sources said she admitted that she was present at the dinner and that it went on till late into the evening. 																								Sen was found dead after he attended a dinner on February 26 at Ranaghat to mark the retirement of hospital clerk Sunil Ganguly. A murder case was started as the post-mortem report suggested that Sen was choked to death. 																								A general duty attendant of the sub-divisional hospital Subharanjan Khara, his physician-wife Arundhati Khara, both guests at the dinner, and Gangulys son, Gautam were arrested on March 17. Ganguly and another suspect, Apurba Sanyal, a social welfare officer, are absconding. 																								CID sleuths said Namita broke down in the face of sustained interrogation and narrated what happened at the party, the conversations and the links between the guests. She indicated that Sen had picked up a fight with the Kharas and Ganguly after downing some liquor. 																								Her version of what had happened at the dinner and how they found out Chandans body in the pond matches with the statements of the Kharas and Gautam, a CID officer said. Importantly, she has provided vital clues for sleuths to fix the motive behind the murder.																								The CID ruled out any connection between the murder and the rape-and-loot incident in Dhantola and admitted that the motive behind the doctors death is still not clear. 																								Earlier, the Indian Medical Association and Opposition parties had alleged that Sens murder is a sequel to the Dhantola case as the doctor was involved in initial investigations of the rape victims.

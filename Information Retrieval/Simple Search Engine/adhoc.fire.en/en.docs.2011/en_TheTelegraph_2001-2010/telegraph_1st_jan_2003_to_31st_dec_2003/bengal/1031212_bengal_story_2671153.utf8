 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Haj subsidy revival plea with Centre
 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Calcutta, Dec. 11: Weeks after the government and the state minorities commission demanded that subsidies for Haj pilgrims be restored, the National Commission for Minorities convened an emergency meeting that agreed to forward the petition to the ministry of external affairs.																								The meeting, held earlier this week after some debate on whether the national commission should intervene, co-opted Central Haj Committee members and ended endorsing the states stand.																								In a notification issued midway through the application process for next years Haj pilgrimage, the Centre said it would no longer be subsidised for people who pay income-tax.																								The Left Front government felt the move was anti-Muslim. The notification also drew the censure of state minorities commission chairman K.M. Yusuf.																								Constitutional experts felt the change was bad in law as it came midway through the application process. Any change could only be made for the Haj scheduled in 2005, said one of them.																								How can those honest enough to pay tax be penalised, a minority leader had asked. Minority development and welfare minister Mohammad Salim wrote to the Centre, making it aware of the states reservations against the controversial change.																								The national commission has now written to the Union government asking it to scrap the plans introduced midway into the process for Haj 2004. Any future decision, the national commission added, should be taken in consultation with it and representatives of the community.

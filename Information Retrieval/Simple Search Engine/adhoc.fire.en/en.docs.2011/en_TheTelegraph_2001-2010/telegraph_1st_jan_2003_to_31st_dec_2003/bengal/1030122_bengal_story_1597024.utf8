The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, January 22, 2003 				 Arrested mans efforts to enter UK raise dust
 KOUSIK SEN																								Raiganj, Jan. 21: A suspected ISI agent, picked up from Islampur on Sunday night, made extraordinary efforts to enter the United Kingdom last year, police and intelligence officials interrogating him said today. 																								The Bangladeshi nationals efforts, however, did not pay off as he failed to obtain a visa. 																								Mainul Islam was produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate in Islampur today, along with Golam Mirza, who, police said, had harboured him in his house in the Gunjaria area of Islampur.																								Islam told the interrogators that he had tried hard to get the visa as he was desperate to see his siblings in London. After failing to secure the visa through a travel agent  whom he claimed to have paid Rs 4 lakh  in New Delhi, he said he had flown to Qatar and then to Kenya and Nigeria for the British visa.																								Intelligence sources said they would check with the British authorities why his applications for visa were repeatedly turned down. They were also curious to find out why the suspected agent was desperate to visit London, a prime target of Osama bin Ladens terrorist outfit, al Qaida.																								Police said they did not buy Islams explanation. Why should he try to hide his identity and travel on forged passports if he wanted to see his brother and sister in London? said a senior police officer. Islam was found with two Bangladeshi passports with different photographs. None of them had his name.

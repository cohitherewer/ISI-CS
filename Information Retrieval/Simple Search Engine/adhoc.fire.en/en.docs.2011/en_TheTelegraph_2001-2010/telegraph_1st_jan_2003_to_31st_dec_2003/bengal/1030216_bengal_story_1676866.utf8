 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Krishnagar, Feb. 15: Another attempt by the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) to push in about 300 nationals into India was foiled by the BSF near Sikarpur on the Indo-Bangladesh border in Nadia. Acting on a tip-off, Indian border troops rushed to the spot and thwarted their Bangladeshi counterparts. 																								Two villagers, Prabir Mondal and Akshay Mistry, had alerted a BSF outpost in the afternoon that Bangladeshis were surging in across the border. The BSF reached the spot around 5 pm and beat back the infiltrators. The incident, coming after a series of such attempts, has left Sikarpur tense.

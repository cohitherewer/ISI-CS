 Thursday, August 14, 2003 				 Report raps ragging college 
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, Aug. 13: The district administration has indicted the Jalpaiguri Engineering College authorities for not carrying out their responsibilities to stop ragging in the hostel. 																								Sources in the administration said subdivisional officer Amitava Moitra, who carried out the inquiry after the allegation levelled by first-year student Sayandip Bandopadhyay that he was tortured by seniors in the hostel, has expressed concern and dissatisfaction in his report, which has been submitted to district magistrate Subrata Gupta. 																								During his inquiry, the subdivisional officer found that the authorities had failed to carry out the responsibilities which they had been entrusted with to stop ragging in the hostel and save the freshers from torture and harassment, said an official. 																								Moitra refused to give details about the report. I have found certain discrepancies and have put them down in the report which I have submitted to the district magistrate. As the matter is sub-judice, it is for the court to decide whether the four students who have been arrested are guilty or not, he said.																								The quartet was arrested, and expelled from the college, after Sayandip identified them as his tormentors. In his FIR, Sayandip, a Calcutta boy who had come to study electronics and communications, said the four senior students had stripped him, beaten him with rods, slashed him with blades and knives and forced him to write a suicide note in an ordeal that ended past midnight on August 5. 																								Giving details of the injuries that Sayandip reportedly sustained, Moitra said: The doctors who checked him at the hospital found minor injuries in his hand, V-shaped wounds on the left side of the shoulder measuring about six centimetres, cut mark on the clavicle and some other injury marks. We have sent the medical report to the district magistrate, he said. 																								Moitra pointed out that college principal Shyam Sunder Chatterjee was yet to conduct the test identification parade as suggested by the administration. The administration had proposed a test identification parade to pinpoint the remaining 16 boys who were allegedly involved in the torture of Sayandip. As the students did not come forward and help the administration by identifying those guilty, we thought the parade was the best way to do it. But we have not received any information of any such parade having been conducted by the college authorities, the subdivisional officer said.																								The students are sceptical about such an identity test. The students union feels there is no rationality in holding such a parade after so many days, said Tamojit Chakrobarty, the spokesperson for the students union.

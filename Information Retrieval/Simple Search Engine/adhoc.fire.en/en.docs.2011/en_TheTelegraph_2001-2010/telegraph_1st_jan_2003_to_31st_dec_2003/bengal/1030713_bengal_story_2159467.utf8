The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, July 13, 2003 				 New rules to stop private tuitions 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, July 12: The Bengal government is framing fresh rules to prevent teachers in government-aided schools from taking private classes for a fee. The government had taken an initiative last year to do away with private tuitions but it seems to have had little effect.																								The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education is at present working on a set of rules that we are going to announce soon to put an end to teachers indulging in private tuition and neglecting their regular classes in schools, said minister for school education Kanti Biswas.																								The minister, who inaugurated a computer centre, said private tuition was banned for both school as well as college teachers. To prevent school teachers from indulging in this practice we do not need to table a bill in the Assembly, the rules framed by the board will be enough to achieve this, he said.																								Biswas said a report sent by the Planning Commission deputy chairman K.C. Pant has underscored the fact that West Bengal has a well-developed madarsa education system which is scientifically managed.																								Pant has expressed his desire to showcase us as a model for other states to follow and I feel proud that we have 8 per cent of the total number of madarsa students in India, Biswas said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, April 30, 2003 				 CM shifts to attack mode on terror
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Dankuni (Hooghly), April 29: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today dismissed allegations by the Trinamul Congress and the BJP about the CPMs terror tactic in the run-up to the panchayat polls.																								The combine is making false allegations to malign the CPM. They are unable to find enough candidates to contest the polls. I have information that the Trinamul members are unwilling to contest with the party symbol, that is why they could not field candidates in vast areas of Arambag, Khanakul and Gohat in Hooghly, Bhattacharjee said.																								He was in Hooghly today to address two rallies as part of the campaign for the May 11 polls.																								A host of CPM leaders led by state party secretary Anil Biswas had toed the same line of argument that the chief minister took while trying to refute the terror charges levelled by the Opposition and some of the Left Front partners.																								However, the chief minister today admitted that there were disputes among the front partners over allotment of seats in several districts. But these are our internal problems and we will shortly address them across the table, he added.																								Yesterday, the chief minister had squarely blamed the RSP, a front constituent, for yawning fissures in the ruling coalition. Wrapping up his two-day tour of north Bengal, he told reporters in the Malda circuit house that the RSP had refused to accept the alliances formula on distribution of seats.																								Training his guns on the Trinamul-BJP combine, Bhattachajee said if it tried to incite violence before the polls, the administration will firmly deal with it. We will not tolerate the barbarism of Trinamul and the BJP. I have told the administration to tackle violence with an iron hand, he said today. 																								Dont get provoked. Instead, give a fitting reply to it through ballot only, he told party cadre. 																								The chief minister had earlier issued a statement pleading the cadre to let Opposition candidates file nominations for the tree-tier polls.

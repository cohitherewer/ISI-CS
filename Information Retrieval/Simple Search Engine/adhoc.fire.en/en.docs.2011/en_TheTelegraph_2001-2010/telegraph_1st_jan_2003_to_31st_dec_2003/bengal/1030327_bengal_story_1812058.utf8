 Thursday, March 27, 2003 				 Bribe bite on minister son
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Hooghly, March 26: School education minister Iva Des son, Arnab, and a friend were beaten up by policemen in Serampore last night for refusing to bribe them after the duo was caught riding a motorcycle without valid pollution control papers.																								Five policemen  two sub-inspectors, two constables and the driver of a police vehicle  were suspended today, Hooghly superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said. 																								We have asked the sub-divisional police officer of Chandernagore (Ashesh Biswas) to handle the probe, he added.																								De said she was shocked at the turn of events. They should be given exemplary punishment for beating two young men who tried to protest a wrong-doing, the minister said.																								Our chief minister has asked everyone to protest against such wrong-doers, De added, but refused to comment on whether the incident could be viewed as another black mark on the administration.																								Hooghly CPM district secretariat member Sunil Sarkar, too, demanded punishment for the policemen.																								Trinamul Congress MP from Serampore Akbar Ali Khondkar, however, alleged that the ministers son was also to blame.Policemen are not fools that they will beat up a ministers son without reason, he said, adding that the incident definitely showed the CPM-controlled administration in very poor light.																								Last evening, Arnab and his friend, Malay Mukherjee, were returning to their Bhadreshwar residence from Janai via the Tarakeshwar-Baidyabati Road on the formers motorcycle when they were apprehended by a police vehicle at Dirghangi More in Serampore, reportedly for travelling without pollution-control documents.																								Another youth had been apprehended before and he paid his way through for a similar offence, sources in Des family said. The two friends, too, were warned that they would suffer if they did not cough up a suitable payment.																								When Arnab and Malay  who was pillion-riding  protested, they were pinned to the ground and kicked on their heads, shoulders and backs, according to their complaint to the police.																								After a few seconds, they revealed Arnabs identity  that he was a ministers son  and the beating stopped. The two friends then left for home from where they were taken to a nursing home.																								A written complaint was filed today by Des family. It helped that Arnab and Malay managed to note the names of the two sub-inspectors, which made identification of the culprits easy, officials said. All five who were identified today have been suspended and a probe is on that will also check whether there were any more policemen involved in the incident, one of them said.

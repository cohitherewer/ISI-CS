 Friday, November 28, 2003 				 Blame game after murder
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 27: A CPM leader of Canning in South 24-Parganas was shot and then stabbed to death last night.																								Police said Rahim Ali Sardar, a local committee leader, was killed as a result of family feud but the CPM was quick to blame the Trinamul Congress, whose leaders pointed fingers at faction rivalry within the CPM.																								Sardar, 23, was returning home at Taldi, about 50 km from here, when the miscreants intercepted him. The subdivisional police officer said: Last year, his cousin Sahidul was murdered. Rahim was the prime accused. Yesterday, he was returning after a year in hiding. Shops in the area remained closed today.

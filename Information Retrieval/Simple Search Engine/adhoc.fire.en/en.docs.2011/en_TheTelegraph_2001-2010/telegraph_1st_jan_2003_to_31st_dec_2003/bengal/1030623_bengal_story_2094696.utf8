 Monday, June 23, 2003 				 Priest held on minor molest charge
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Durgapur, June 22: A priest of a Loknath Baba ashram in Bamunnara village under Kanksa police station has been arrested after a woman complained that he had allegedly molested her minor daughter on Friday night. 																								A police official said mother and daughter had been living at the ashram for 10 years. The woman used to help 50-year-old Biplab Ghosh during puja. Her daughter had recently taken over her role. 																								The girl told the police that around 1.30 am on Friday, Ghosh woke her up when she was sleeping on the veranda and asked her to come to his room. She refused the mans advances, but the priest forced himself on her. 																								On hearing her ordeal in the morning, her mother rushed to priests room to find it closed from inside. She repeatedly asked Ghosh to come out, but he refused. 																								She then took up the matter with local youths who raided the ashram and thrashed Ghosh. One of them brought a razor from a nearby barber shop and tonsured him. 																								Some local CPM leaders intervened at this juncture and asked the agitated youths not to take the law in their hands. They called the police and handed over the priest to them. 																								A few days ago, a woman in Madhabmath village under the same police station was molested and severely beaten up by her former husband and his associates. They had accused her of practising black magic and trying to kill her son.

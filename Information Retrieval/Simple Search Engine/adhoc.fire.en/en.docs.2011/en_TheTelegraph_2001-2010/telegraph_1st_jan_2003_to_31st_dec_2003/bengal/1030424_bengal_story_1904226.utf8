The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, April 24, 2003 				 Mamata mob for BJP rally 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, April 23: Not so long ago, the two allies, Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress and the BJP, were known for their unvarnished hostility towards each other than joint endeavour to fight the ruling leftists. 																								However, after the BJP central leadership effected what can be described as a regime change in the state unit by removing Tapan Sikdar from the partys top post, peace, amity and collaboration have become buzzwords for the two allies whose leaders have put away the long knives and begun to strategise together.																								On Wednesday, a measure of the new found camaraderie was available when it became known through the grapevine that Mamata has taken it upon herself to mobilise the crowd for the BJP rally lined up at Shahid Minar tomorrow.																								Didi (Mamata) has asked us to organise a good crowd for tomorrows rally, said an important Trinamul manager who has been asked to bring in party supporters in sizeable numbers from different parts of south Calcutta. We have made satisfactory arrangements on this score. 																								Tomorrows rally, organised by the state BJP to launch the campaign for the May 11 panchayat elections, will be attended, among others,by party president Venkaiah Naidu, one of the major backers of Mamatas bid for a ministerial berth. 																								We did not actually seek her help to make the rally a success, said a BJP leader. But she was gracious enough to ask her party functionaries... to attend the rally with supporters. It was apparent that she and other Trinamul leaders are taking our alliance very seriously.

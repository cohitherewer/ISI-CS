The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Dhantola trial set for kickoff
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar (Nadia), Dec. 14: Ten months after the Dhantola loot-and-rape, trial will start tomorrow at the fast-track court in Ranaghat.																								The incident had sparked a furore when on the night of February 6, two buses returning from wedding receptions were waylaid and the women aboard allegedly molested and raped.																								A gang of armed goons had intercepted the buses from Birnagar and Ranaghat on the state highway at Ainsmali, which is within Dhantola police station limits. The women were forcibly taken to a deserted educational institute nearby.																								Samir Ghosh, the driver of the bus from Birnagar that was on its way to Kuchiamora in North 24-Parganas, was shot dead when he tried to stop the goons.																								A day later, 25 people were arrested. Five people were subsequently acquitted for lack of evidence. The others were charged with dacoity, murder, gangrape, and criminal conspiracy. 																								The court of additional sessions judge Shyamal Sengupta will hear all the 20 charged, including prime accused Subol Bagchi, CPMs former Aranghata zonal committee secretary, Dulal Dutta, Ananta Karmakar and former Ainsmali gram panchayat pradhan Saidul Karigar.																								Police had initially started a murder case. But 17 days later, the state womens commission visited the spot and, with the help of a local rights group, goaded the victims to lodge FIRs. A rape case, too, was started subsequently.																								Bagchi and his alleged henchman, Karigar, were arrested and charged as the prime accused. Bagchi, who is now out on bail, was greeted by an army of mostly CPM supporters on release. 																								Police investigation has revealed that Bagchi had plotted the incident to score a point over his political rival and CPMs Panikhali local committee secretary Sanath Dhali. Soon after the arrest, both Bagchi and Karigar were expelled from the party. Bagchi, a chemistry teacher at the Aranghata high school, was also suspended from the school.

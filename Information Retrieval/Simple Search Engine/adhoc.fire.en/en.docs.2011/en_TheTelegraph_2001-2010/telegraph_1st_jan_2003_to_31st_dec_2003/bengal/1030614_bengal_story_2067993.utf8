 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mograhat, June 13: A three-year-old girl was killed and seven others seriously injured when a bus hit her and slid into a roadside pond about 15 km from Diamond Harbour this morning.																								A passenger on the bus plying between Joynagar and Amtala in South 24-Parganas said the driver was going very fast on a road rendered slippery by an early-morning shower. After hitting Beauty Laskar, who was playing by the road, the bus skidded. We were travelling too fast, I felt a jerk and fell unconscious, said Nurul Hasan, a passenger.																								Residents rushed to the rescue of the passengers, who were pulled out of the bus. They were taken to a local hospital where the condition of seven persons was said to be serious. All the seven were later transferred to the subdivisional hospital. 																								Police said most of the passengers on one of the first buses to leave Joynagar this morning had dozed off and did not see what was coming.

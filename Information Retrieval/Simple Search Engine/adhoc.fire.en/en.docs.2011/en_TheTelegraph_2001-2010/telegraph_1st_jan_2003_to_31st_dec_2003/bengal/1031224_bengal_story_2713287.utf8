 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Militants confess KPP link
 AVIJIT SINHA																								Jalpaiguri, Dec. 23: Senior Kamtapur Peoples Party leaders have often asked for funds to run the organisation from KLO chief Jeevan Singha, police said today.																								Chief of the Jalpaiguri force Siddh Nath Gupta told reporters the confession by five arrested militants had confirmed suspicions about the KPPs links with the militant outfit.																								The arrested KLO militants have admitted that some KPP leaders were in touch with their boss and often asked him for funds. When Ram Singh alias Bharat Das, a trained KLO militant, was gunned down in Kumargram on October 9, 2000, a letter was found on him that indicated a link between the outfits. Addressed to KLOs self-styled commander Jeevan Singha, the letter referred to a veteran KPP leader and appealed for financial aid, Gupta said. 																								The revelation comes at a time when the faction-ridden KPP is struggling to distance itself from the militant outfit. The KPP president, who had recently praised the Bhutan army for launching the offensive against the insurgents, said over phone: I was in touch with KLO leaders like Tom Adhikary, Jeevan Singha and Milton Burma when they were members of the All Kamtapur Liberation Organisation. After they founded the KLO, I never met them.																								In Calcutta, Maj. Gen. Madan Gopal, who is in charge of army operations in the eastern sector, held a news conference at Fort William and denied that the Indian Army is taking part in the crackdown on insurgents in Bhutan.

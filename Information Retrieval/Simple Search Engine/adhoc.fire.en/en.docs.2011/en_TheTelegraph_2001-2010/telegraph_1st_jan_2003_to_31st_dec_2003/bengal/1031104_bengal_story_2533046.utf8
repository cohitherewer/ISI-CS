 Tuesday, November 04, 2003 				 Bloc leader arrested for fraud
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Durgapur, Nov. 3: A Forward Bloc leader was arrested here last night on charges of swindling more than Rs 3 lakh from a former employee of the Mining Allied Machinery Corporation (MAMC). 																								The partys block general secretary, Ram Bilash Banerjee, has been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. 																								Banerjee had asked Indrajit Halder, an MAMC technical adviser who had just taken voluntary retirement, for a loan to organise a soiree. Nani Gopal Ghosh, a relative of the Halders, had introduced Banerjee and an unsuspecting Indrajit gave a blank cheque for Utsav-2002 last February. They promised to return the money in 15 days, Halder said. Ghosh had apparently said they did not know the exact amount required and could fill up the cheque later. Halder believed him.																								In a suit filed with the subdivisional judicial magistrate, Halder said when he went to his bank to draw money the next time, Rs 13,000 was left out of Rs 3.8 lakh. He did not get the money back in the 20 months since.

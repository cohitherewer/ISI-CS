The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, October 21, 2003 				 Satyam scouts for space in city
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT Calcutta, Oct. 20: Indias  fourth-largest infotech firm Satyam Computer Services is  poised to set up a software development centre in the city. 																								A high-level team, led by a senior vice-president, from the New York Stock Exchange-listed firm will be here on Thursday to check out facilities in Sector V, Salt Lake. 																								We met the companys chairman, B. Ramalinga Raju, in Hyderabad last Friday and requested him to consider Calcutta to set up a development centre. He seemed keen on the city, information technology minister Manab Mukherjee told The Telegraph this evening. 																								Raju asked for around 50,000 to 80,000 sq ft of built-up space during the hour-long meeting at Satyam headquarters in Hyderabad. 																								Infotech secretary G.D. Gautama and managing director of Webel S.K. Mitra accompanied Mukherjee at the meeting. 																								However, the minister added: They didnt tell us any time frame about their plans in Bengal. 																								Satyam officials couldnt be contacted for comments. 																								Not just built-up space, the Satyam chairman also sounded out Mukherjee about land in Saltlec (Salt Lake Electronics Complex) to set up its own centre in future. The company has four development centres in the US and one each in UK, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Dubai and Australia, besides five in India  Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Bhubaneswar and Bangalore. 																								Despite the global downturn that hit IT companies following the terrorist strikes on the US on September 11, 2001, Satyam posted a net profit of around Rs 319 crore against a revenue of Rs 2,261.53 crore last financial year. 																								With the company showing interest in the city, government officials have started scouting for quality built-up space in Saltlec. As of now, Infinity building, where 50,000 sq ft is available and another 80,000 sq ft will be added by the end of this year, is high on the list of sites to be shown to the Satyam team. 																								Going by the industry standard of 100 sq ft per person, if they take up 80,000 sq ft, around 800 jobs will be created. And besides giving the job market a boost, the presence of Satyam will add to the Bengal brand, said a Saltlec-based IT-preneur.

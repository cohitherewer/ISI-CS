 Monday, June 09, 2003 				 Heartland rescue for Hooghly girl
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Serampore (Hooghly), June 8: A 15-year-old girl from the district was rescued by the CID from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, where she was allegedly sold and forcibly married off.																								The culprits are still at large. We are looking for the youth who bought the girl from a pimp and married her, special superintendent of the CID Manoj Malaviya said today.																								A team of three officers reached Badaun early this week and rescued Gayatri on Friday with the help of local police, Malaviya said. The girl was produced before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate here yesterday. He ordered that Gayatri be sent home.																								Officials said her father Mitton Soren, an assistant librarian at a local college in Chanditala, had lodged a complaint with the CID alleging that she went missing on December 10, 2001. Gayatri had reportedly gone to a relatives house after being reprimanded by her parents.																								But on her way back, she missed the last train home from Sealdah station and started roaming in the platform aimlessly, Malaviya said.

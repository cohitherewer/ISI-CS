 Monday, October 27, 2003 				 Two more hospital deaths
 OUR BUREAU																								Oct. 26: Within 24 hours of Surjya Kanta Mishras revamp of the healthcare delivery system, two cases of alleged negligence occurred at government hospitals in Purulia and Basirhat.																								Rupa Chakraborty, 24, was brought to the Deben Mahato Sadar Hospital yesterday after developing labour pain. Relatives of Rupa, a resident of Chatanipara in Purulia said she was not given a bed immediately.																								The head of the gynaecology department, Dipak Choudhury, examined her and said she was all right. But as Rupas husband Manoranjan returned home for a while, he decided she had to be operated.																								Rupa delivered a boy but began having convulsions soon after. Choudhury and the doctor on duty were summoned but neither allegedly turned up. Rupas condition worsened and she went into a coma. She died at 11.35 pm.																								Gobinda Das, who was admitted to Bashirhat Subdivisional Hospital with a heart problem, died within minutes of being administered an injection. 																								A panel was formed to probe the incident after Das relatives turned violent.

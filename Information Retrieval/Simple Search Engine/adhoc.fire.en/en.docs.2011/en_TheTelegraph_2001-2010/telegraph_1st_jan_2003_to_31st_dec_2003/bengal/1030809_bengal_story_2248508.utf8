 Saturday, August 09, 2003 				 Panja paves way for CPMs exit
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chinsurah, Aug. 8: A combined Opposition of the Trinamul Congress and the Congress today re-wrested Hooghly-Chinsurah municipality from the Left Front.																								Six months after it dislodged the Opposition alliance from power, the front lost a confidence motion. Changed equations within Trinamul in the wake of rebel leader Ajit Panjas return to Mamata Banerjees fold turned the table.																								The Opposition had captured the municipality after the civic polls in 2000. In the 30-seat civic board, Trinamul had 12 seats and the Congress 4. The Left Front had 14 seats, including the CPMs 11. The RSP had two members and the Forward Bloc one. 																								Sniffing an opportunity in the squabbles dogging Trinamul, the front tabled a no-confidence motion against the Trinamul-Congress board on December 24 last year. The party was divided between those loyal to Mamata and Panja and the combine lost the vote when Trinamul councillors Shibu Das and Sanjit Mandal sided with the Left. Differences of opinion had also cropped up between Trinamul chairman of the municipality Ashis Sen and some of the councillors. 																								But with Panja burying the hatchet and Mamata reinducting him into the party, the scenario changed. Das and Mandal voted against todays confidence motion and the fronts tryst with power here came to a close.																								Earlier, we were misguided by some district leaders. Today, we made amends for our mistake and helped the party wrest the board from the communists, said Das. Mandal nodded. 																								Stung by the humiliation, CPM chairman of the civic body Barun Ganguly admitted that the front had captured the civic body by chance, solely banking on support from the Trinamul rebels. We should have maintained a distance from the rebel councillors, said Ganguly.																								Ajitdas reunion with Mamata has gone down well with the party rank and file. This will definitely help us regain the civic boards we had lost by small margins, said Trinamuls Pankaj Banerjee, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly.  Airport entry bar: The  authorities at Dumdum airport have imposed a 9-day ban from  August 10 on the entry of visitors in view of Independence  Day. The restriction will be applicable in both domestic  and international terminals.

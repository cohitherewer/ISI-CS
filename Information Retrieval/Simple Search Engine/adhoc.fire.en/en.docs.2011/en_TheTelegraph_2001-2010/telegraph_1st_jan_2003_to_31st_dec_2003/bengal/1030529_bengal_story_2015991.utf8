The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, May 29, 2003 				 Rural to civic, terror blot spreads
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, May 28: The state Congress today accused the CPM of intimidating its candidates for elections to 13 municipalities next month and said a party deputation would soon meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to apprise him of the situation. 																								Party general secretary Manas Bhuniya said several Congress candidates were being threatened by the local CPM to withdraw. 																								Some of our women candidates told me that they are scared as local CPM musclemen are threatening them with dire consequences if they contested the polls on June 22, said Bhuniya. 																								Former state Congress president Somen Mitra said he would lead a deputation to the chief minister to protest against the CPMs terror tactic. 																								Bhuniya said his party could not field candidates in 87 of the 265 seats due to organisational weakness. But party nominees and district leaders have been asked not to go in for any electoral alliance with the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine.																								We have been able to field 178 candidates for the municipal polls while the CPM has fielded 201, the Trinamul 140 and the BJP 62 candidates. We are not aware of any grand alliance, but we have asked our party activists not to ally with the Trinamul-BJP combine. 																								However, party insiders said there were strong signs of an electoral understanding with Trinamul in some of the municipalities going to polls.

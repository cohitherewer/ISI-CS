 Sunday, April 06, 2003 				 Purulia industrialist goes missing
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purulia, April 5: A leading industrialist from the district, Naresh Agarwal, has been reported missing since yesterday afternoon and is feared to have been kidnapped.																								Forty-year-old Agarwal was on his way to Durgapur from Jhalda yesterday. The industrialist had spoken to a person in Calcutta on his mobile phone a little before 2 pm, while he was between Bankura and Asansol in his car with his driver, according to reports.																								Late last evening, the car, a Bolero, was found abandoned near a roadside tea stall close to Bolpur. Agarwal and his driver were not found.																								Agarwal is the managing director of Kushal Polypack Industries Ltd, a downstream project of Haldia Petrochemicals.																								District magistrate D.P. Jana confirmed that the industrialist was missing. We are worried over the incident. Our district police force is doing all it can to trace him. I have contacted the home secretary about this. So far, no one has made any ransom demand. So we cannot say he has been abducted, Jana said.																								We are in touch with our counterparts in Bankura and Birbhum, said police superintendent V.K. Goyal.

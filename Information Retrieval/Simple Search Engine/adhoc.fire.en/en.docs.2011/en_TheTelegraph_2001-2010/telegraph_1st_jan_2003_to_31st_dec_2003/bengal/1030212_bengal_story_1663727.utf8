 Wednesday, February 12, 2003 				 SBI manager killed in office
 PEMA LEYDA SHANGDERPA																								Gangtok, Feb. 11: Dhan Bahadur Diyali, branch manager of the State Bank of India at Namthang in south Sikkim, was today found murdered in his office. Diyalis assailants also looted more than Rs 7 lakh from the bank.																								The branch manager had succumbed to multiple head injuries but no weapons were found from the spot. He had also been strangulated with choyas (ropes made from bamboo strips).																								A sweeper found the shutters of the bank open when he came to clean the premises this morning. As he went inside, he saw the managers body lying in a pool of blood on the floor.																								The employees of the bank were immediately informed and the police called in.																								Superintendent of police (south) Mingma Bhutia, the sub-divisional police officer and the officer in-charge of the Namchi police station, Chundi Chophel, went to the scene of the crime. The south district police have sought help from the crime branch at Gangtok. Sniffer dogs and fingerprint experts were brought in for the investigations.																								Bhutia quoted witnesses as saying that the branch manager and some of the bank employees closed shop at 7 last night and left for home.																								The police are clueless as to why Diyali went back to the bank. The safe, in which over Rs 7 lakh was kept, had been broken open and the cash looted.																								Police are speculating that Diyali must have been threatened and forced to open the bank and the safe before being murdered. 																								No arrests had been made till late night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Govt to shift district hub
 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY																								Calcutta, Jan. 13: Acting on a long-standing demand of the residents of North 24-Parganas, the state government has decided to move the district headquarters located in Alipore since Independence.																								The administration has inspected some sites at Baruipur and discussions are on for finalising the move. 																								Baruipur is in the centre of the district and is accessible from all places, officials said, adding that the demand for a headquarters within the district is logical.																								The demand, to which all leading political parties have lent their voice, has grown more vigorous after the creation of three additional subdivisions  Baruipur, Kakdwip and Canning  besides Alipore and Diamond Harbour a couple of years ago.																								The total population of the district is about 70 lakh, covered by around 32 police stations. A major portion of the population lives in rural areas.																								South 24-Parganas CPM secretary Shantimoy Bhattacharya said it was surprising that the headquarters has been functioning from outside the district for so long.																								It is really very difficult for a villager living in a remote area like Gosaba to come to Alipore for administrative work. He has to spend a whole day there even though he knows the work may not be completed, Bhattacharya said.																								Making Baruipur the district headquarters would save a lot of time and trouble, he added.																								Baruipur is accessible from Diamond Harbour, Kakdwip and Canning both by road and rail. People will save at least 15-20 km of travel, Bhattacharya said.																								CPM legislator from Baruipur Sujan Chakraborty said the place has gained importance for several reasons. Recently, a number of industries have come up here and more are likely to follow. Many non-resident Indians have shown eagerness to set up industry here, Chakraborty said.																								Trinamul Congress leader Samir Chakraborty said Baruipur has the advantage of being situated in the middle of the district. Moreover, it boasts of the oldest court in the district where luminaries like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay used to work, Chakraborty said. 																								District magistrate Alapan Bandyopadhyay said some places in Baruipur have been earmarked. After the final selection, I shall write to the government for finalising the shift.

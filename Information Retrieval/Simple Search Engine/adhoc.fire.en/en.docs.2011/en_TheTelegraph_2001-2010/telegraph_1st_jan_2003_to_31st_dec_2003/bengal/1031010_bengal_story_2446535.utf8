 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, Oct. 9: The Burdwan municipality has decided to ban plastic and polythene bags, tentatively from next month, to keep the town free from pollution. It will also impose spot fines on offenders dumping garbage on the streets instead of in the vats. 																								The municipal authorities have launched an awareness campaign to educate people against throwing trash on the streets. As part of the drive, the municipality is distributing handbills urging people to keep the town clean and free from polluting materials, dump garbage in selected vats or the wheel-barrows of the municipal staff and avoid plastic and polythene bags.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, September 27, 2003 				 Jail for convent-schooled con girl
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Sept. 26: Nayantara  Roy, fluent in 11 languages and taught in a premier convent  in the city, was sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment  today by a juvenile court judge for swindling lakhs from  multinational banks. 																								Nayantara was today sent to Alipore Presidency Jail. Since getting caught in the police net on July 23, 2002, she had been at the Liluah Home for Destitute Women and the Alipore jail. 																								Nayantara, now 18, was arrested in Bangalore. We arrested her on the basis of a complaint lodged by Utpal Roy, who adopted her when she was a two-month-old, said detective department deputy commissioner Soumen Mitra. Indian Society for Sponsorship and Adoption, the organisation from where she was adopted, had also lodged a complaint with Lake police station, Mitra added.																								The police said Nayantara had withdrawn Rs 3.5 lakh from the account of the adoption agency by forging the signature of its secretary, Saroj Sood. 																								Her criminal past dates back to 2000, when she forged Soods signature to withdraw Rs 4.5 lakh from the agencys account in a multinational bank. But her businessman father managed to hush up the case and the agency did not file any written complaint, said Mitra.																								Her parents took her to Nimhans in Bangalore suspecting that she was suffering from a mental health problem. 																								On July 24, 2001, she forged her fathers signature and withdrew Rs 60,000 from his account. Roy lodged an FIR. Nayantara was arrested and sent to Antara, an organisation dealing with challenged patients. Experts there found her normal.																								Back home, on December 10 last year, the teenager withdrew Rs 30,000 by forging her fathers signature and went to Chennai. Before taking the plane from Dum Dum, she ripped off some of the pages from her fathers chequebook. From Chennai, Nayantara went to Bangalore and struck up a friendship with an autorickshaw drivers wife. She then moved to Mumbai.																								Posing as a senior executive of the Indian Society for Sponsorship and Adoption, Nayantara told a multinational bank in Mumbai that she wanted to check the agencys accounts. She took four demand drafts by forging Soods signature and withdrew Rs 3.5 lakh. Nayantara returned to Bangalore with the money. 																								A police team from Calcutta, which was trailing her since Roy filed the FIR, caught up with her there.

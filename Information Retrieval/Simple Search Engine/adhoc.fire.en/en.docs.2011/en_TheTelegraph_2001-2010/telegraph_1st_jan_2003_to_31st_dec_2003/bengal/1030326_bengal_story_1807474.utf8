 Wednesday, March 26, 2003 				 CPM sees missing cadre in river-bed remains 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Durgapur, March 25: Police today dug out human remains and a blood-splattered shirt from the dry bed of the Ajoy river, fuelling speculation that it was the corpse of one of the two missing CPM cadres and sending Pandabeswar in a tizzy. 																								The CPM has called a bandh in the area on April 2 to push its demand that the police trace its missing members. Since Naxalite leader Ganesh Pal was found murdered on January 8, the CPI(M-L) has been targeting its cadre, the party has complained. 																								Additional superintendent of police Ajay Ranade said police are trying to identify the remains. 																								In view of the approaching panchayat polls, law-enforcers in the district fear an escalation in tension and possibly violence between the CPM and the Naxalites. Pandabeswar, which stands on the border with Birbhum, is dominated by the Naxalites, with pockets of CPM influence.																								On Friday, more than two months after Pals murder, 35 CPM supporters and their families were escorted back to Kendra village. Alleging that the CPM had killed Pal to make inroads into the Naxalite belt, the CPI(M-L) had reportedly unleashed terror on them. 																								The police are maintaining a picket  three-sub-inspectors and eight armed constables  in the village to pre-empt violence. 																								CPM legislator from Ukhra Madan Bauri had claimed after the return of the party supporters that two men, Krishna and Santa Singh, were still missing. The CPM leaders in the area feel that the remains dug up today could be of one these men. 																								The CPM has been pressuring the Pandabeswar police for not being able to trace the missing workers. We have called a 24-hour bandh on April 2 demanding that the police trace the workers and find out the identity of the body found today, said CPM Ajoy-Damodar zonal committee secretary Binoy Dutta.

 Saturday, March 08, 2003 				 CPM men held for gang-raping housewife
 MAIN UDDIN CHISTI																								Cooch Behar, March 7: Three CPM workers have been arrested on charges of gang-raping a 28-year-old housewife in Cooch Behars Ghoksadanga, police said today. 																								Though the crime took place 10 days ago, the partymen were picked up only yesterday after the Trinamul Congress gheraoed the Ghoksadanga police station and met the additional superintendent of police to complain of polices refusal to accept her complaint. 																								In the complaint lodged with the police on Wednesday, the victim alleged that at least nine people had gangraped her on the night of February 22. 																								The woman, who lives with her two daughters and mother-in-law at Cheramari village under the Ghoksadanga police station, said she was alone at home on that night with her youngest daughter after her mother-in-law and elder daughter had gone away to stay with a relative along with her eldest daughter. 																								Her husband lives away from the family, working in Jaigaon in Jalpaiguri district.																								When she opened the door around 1 am to go to the toilet, she said she saw a group of nine men waiting outside. They were all armed with daggers and knives. They gagged me with a cloth and held a dagger to my throat, she said in her complaint.																								The men then dragged her back into her house and threw her into the bed, taking turns to assault her sexually. I passed out after the third man raped me. But I will be able to identify all of them, the victim said, her eyes moist with tears. 																								The next day, neighbours took her to Ghoksadanga health, from where she was referred to Mathabhanga Hospital. When she went to the local police station to lodge a First Information Report after being released from hospital, she said she was turned down.																								Police refused to take the complaint as all the culprits belong to the CPMs local committee, she said.																								The victim spoke to reporters after she, accompanied by some Trinamul leaders, met additional superintendent of police Anupam Banerjee to demand action against the policemen who had refused to accept her complaint.																								Later, Banerjee told reporters that three people, identified as Ajit Burman, Mrinal Das and Samranjan Mullick, were arrested. He said police were looking for the six others named in the complaint.

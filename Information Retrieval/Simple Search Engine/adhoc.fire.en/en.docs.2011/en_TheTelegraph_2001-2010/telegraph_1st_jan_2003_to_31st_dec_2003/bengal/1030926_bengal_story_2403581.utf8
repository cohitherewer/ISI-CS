 Friday, September 26, 2003 				 Bypoll alert in Uttarpara
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Hooghly, Sept. 25: Two days before the byelection to the Uttarpara Assembly constituency, the district administration declared all 261 booths sensitive. 																								The Trinamul Congress and the CPM candidates are the main contenders in Saturdays poll, though the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) nominees are also in the fray.																								In all, 10,000 armed policemen will be deployed at the booths on the polling day. We are not taking chances and have divided the booths into two categories. There will be two armed policemen in all A category booths and an armed policeman and a National Volunteer Force guard each at the other booths. 																								We will maintain strict vigil to prevent entry of outsiders in the area, said district magistrate Roshni Sen.																								The seat, comprising two municipalities  Uttarpara-Kotarang and Konnagar  and four panchayats fell vacant following the death of Trinamul legislator Swaraj Mukherjee in May.

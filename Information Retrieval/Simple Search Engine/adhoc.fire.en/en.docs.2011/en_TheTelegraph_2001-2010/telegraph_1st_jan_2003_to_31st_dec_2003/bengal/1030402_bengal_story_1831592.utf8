 Wednesday, April 02, 2003 				 Finger at CPM radio station
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Calcutta, April 1: The Congress today complained to the government about a temporary radio station set up in Buralchak in Sabang in West Midnapore by a local CPM leader to issue party instructions before the panchayat elections slated for May. 																								Two senior Congress leaders, Pradip Bhattacharya and Manas Bhuniya, met home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and inspector-general of police, law and order, Chayan Mukherjee at Writers Buildings and submitted a memorandum, demanding immediate action against the CPM leader. They urged the officials to raid the radio centre, seize the transmitter and arrest the operator. 																								On the basis of complaints from the Congress leaders, I spoke to the IG, western range, asking him to probe the matter and submit a report to the government by end of this week, Mukherjee said. 																								Running such radio stations is illegal and there is a special cell of the Centre to monitor such activities. 																								Bhuniya, former MLA from Sabang, said the CPM leader had set up the temporary radio station at a local video parlour and he was issuing day-to-day instructions on how to take on the Opposition parties in the run-up to the panchayat polls to CPM workers. 																								We have already lodged a complaint with the Sabang police station and the district police administration is aware of it, but no action has so far been taken on this score, he added.

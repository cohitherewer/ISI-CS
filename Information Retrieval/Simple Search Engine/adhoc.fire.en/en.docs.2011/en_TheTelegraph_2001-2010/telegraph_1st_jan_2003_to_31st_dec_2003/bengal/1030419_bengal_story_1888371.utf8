 Saturday, April 19, 2003 				 SFI-CPM clash on the cards
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Hiradihi (West Midnapore), April 18: Its CPM versus CPM. 																								A local member of the Students Federation of India (SFI), the CPMs students wing, has filed his nomination against the partys official candidate at the Hiradihi-II seat of Gopali gram panchayat in Kharagpur Block-I.																								Student leader Khudu Sorens decision to oppose official party nominee Joyprakash Das has come as a major embarrassment for the party leadership, in a district where it is likely to win about 1,000 gram panchayat seats without contest. Local party managers admitted that Sorens nomination was a fallout of rivalry within the local committee. 																								Asked about the development, in Calcutta, Left Front chairman and CPM politburo member Biman Bose said he was not aware of it. I shall get the matter looked into, he added.																								An unfazed Nilesh Singh, secretary of the SFIs local unit, said the purpose of fielding a member of the students wing was to lodge a protest against the local leadership. If our candidate wins, he will extend whole-hearted support towards the CPM, said the second-year student of Arts at Hijli College. 																								Leader killed																								A former CPM local committee member of Panihati (West) in North 24-Parganas, Bibek Chatterjee, was murdered in his sweetmeat shop on Gopal Chatterjee Street in Khardah this evening. 																								Three persons came in a car and pumped two bullets into him. He died on the spot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, September 21, 2003 				 Tiljala Margi expelled
 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta/Purulia/Ranchi, Sept. 20: Two days after a monk was killed in clashes between rival groups of Ananda Margis in their Purulia headquarters, an expulsion order was served on a senior Margi at the orders eastern zonal hub at Tiljala. 																								The expulsion letter, sent by Ananda Marg global general secretary Acharya Dhruvanand Avdhoot, ripped the veil on the bitter rivalry between the Purulia headquarters, dominated by Hindi-speaking Margis, and the Tiljala office, controlled by Bengali-speaking monks. 																								On Thursday night, the Pundag hub of the Margis turned into a battlefield with a section of the Bengali monks clashing with their Hindi-speaking colleagues for control of the Ananda Marg Institute of Technology, located inside the headquarters. 																								Monks at the Tiljala office today publicly condemned the expulsion of former Marg general secretary Manteswarananda Avadhuut.																								We just received the expulsion order from the Purulia headquarters. We are not going to accept it as it is one-sided and motivated. Manteswaranandaji is a senior monk and has been associated with the order for quite a long time, said Sarveswarananda Avadhuut. 																								Monks of the Tiljala office would move court against the expulsion, he made clear.																								Those at the helm of affairs in Purulia are out to either expel us or drive us out of the sangha to take control. A coterie dominated by some Margis from Bihar is trying to engineer a split. This is a sad development and goes against the basic ideals of sangha founder, late Pravat Ranjan Sarkar, he added. 																								The situation is still tense at Pundag, with women Margis and sanyasins demanding protection.																								They fear more attacks in future by a particular group, which, they alleged, was out to seize control of administration of the global headquarters and the property, estimated to be valued in billions. The organisation has branches in 160 countries. 																								The Margis are blaming the CPM government of continued harassment and oppression. When the CPM failed to destroy Ananda Marg by attacking from outside, it infiltrated its cadre in the organisation and has succeeded in forming a parallel governing body, one monk said.

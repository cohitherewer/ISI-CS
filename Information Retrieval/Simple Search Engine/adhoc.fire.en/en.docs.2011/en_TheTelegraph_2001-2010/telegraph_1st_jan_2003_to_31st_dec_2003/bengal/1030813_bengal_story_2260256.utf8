 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Subhas amp; Citu strike at strike
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug 12: A day after owners of private buses, mini buses and taxis announced a three-day strike from August 26, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty warned them against resorting to a prolonged agitation at the cost of commuters.																								Citu, the CPMs labour arm, opposed the strike as well. 																								The government will take all legal steps necessary if the transport bodies do not withdraw the strike. A three-day strike means they intend to cause severe inconvenience to people, Chakraborty said at Writers Buildings while reacting to the strike call. Owners of all modes of private transport came together yesterday to call the strike in protest against enhanced taxes. 																								A days strike is still acceptable. Everyone has a right to strike, Chakraborty said. The hike appears too high because the taxes have been raised after 24 years, he added.																								Last year, Chakraborty had reacted sharply when owners of chartered buses decided to go on an indefinite strike to protest enhanced fees imposed on them. The agitation was shelved after the minister looked into the grievances. 																								Chakraborty met transporters associations yesterday and understood that they want to discuss the issue of tax hike with him individually. I will meet these associations separately, starting with the buses and mini buses associations, after August 15, he had said. The minister also said that he will look into their grievances on harassment by police. 																								Mentioning two instances where driving licences had been punched illegally and a driver had to pay a fine almost a month after he accidentally entered a no-entry zone, the transport minister said he would meet the top police officers in the state to thrash out the issue. 																								Siding with drivers on rash driving, Chakraborty said: There is another side to it. They, too, need fixed working hours and we need the support of transport associations to help drivers work on salary rather than commission. The government, he said, intends to open health camps for drivers soon. 																								After holding rallies last week in protest against a Supreme Court order that said government employees did not have a right to strike work, the Citu today came down heavily on the transport operators for their decision to go on strike. General secretary of the union Chittabrata Majumder said: When workers resort to strike to realise legitimate demands, they are criticised but who will pull up the transport operators who are going on strike at the cost of common people. 																								The transporters decried the ministers remarks. The other day, the CPM and Citu leaders were protesting the Supreme Courts order against government employees right to strike. Today, they are criticising us, said Sadhan Das, a leader of a bus syndicate.

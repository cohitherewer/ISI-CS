The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 24, 2003 				 Green project takes off in Tagore town
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Somnath Chatterjee plants a sapling with schoolchildren to inaugurate Arani. Telegraph picture																								Bolpur, June 23: On July 14, 1928, Rabindranath Tagore started the Vriksha Ropan Utsav by planting a bokul sapling in Santiniketan. Exactly 75 years later, his dream appears to have found expression in a social forestry project not far from Visva Bharati.																								Work on the Rs 35-crore project, Arani, began yesterday at Prantik under the aegis of the Sriniketan-Santiniketan Development Authority. 																								Executed by the Bengal Peerless Housing Development Company, a joint venture of the government and the Peerless group, Arani has been designed to counter the adverse impact of real estate.																								Arani plans to develop Prantik as the main entry point in place of Bolpur, which is stagnating for want of good roads and other infrastructure. 																								Santiniketan and (areas under) its vicinity were loosing their charm following rapid construction of concrete structures. This social forestry project has given us an idea as to how we should handle urbanisation. We believe we can now ask district authorities to look at organised social forestry as a durable way to handle the pressures of urbanisation, said Somnath Chatterjee, the veteran CPM parliamentarian who heads the development authority.																								Arani is spread over seven acres and is divided into three sections  Puja, Prem, and Prakriti  where more than 2,000 trees, including kadam, shimul, devdaru and mango, will be planted.

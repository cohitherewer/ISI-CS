 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, March 27: The district judge has ordered that the administration put up the century-old district magistrates bungalow for auction to provide compensation to a person whose land was acquired in 1990 to build an industrial training institute for women. 																								Dilip Sen had received Rs 1.51 lakh as compensation in 1994 for giving up 2.63 acres in Alisha in Burdwan town. Dissatisfied, he went to court in 1996 for more money. 																								In 2000, the district judge ruled that he should be paid Rs 12.29 lakh as compensation and interest for the period from June 1994 to August 2000. The administration remained silent, forcing Sen to go to court again. On January 27, district judge R.N. Banerjee ordered that the district magistrates bungalow be auctioned to pay him. 																								When public prosecutor Kashinath Banerjee pleaded that the states coffers were empty and sought two months time, the judge kept his order in abeyance. The grace period expired today and the judge upheld his order. 																								Burdwan district magistrate Manoj Agarwal said the matter should be handled by the technical education department. We have informed the technical education department as the land was acquired for one of their institutions. Let us see what happens, he said.

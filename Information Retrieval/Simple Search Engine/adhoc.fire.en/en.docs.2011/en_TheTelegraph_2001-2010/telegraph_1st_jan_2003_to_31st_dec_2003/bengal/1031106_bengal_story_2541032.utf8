The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, November 06, 2003 				 A rap a day at Muraroi
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Suri, Nov. 5: The Birbhum chief medical officer of health today again slapped a showcause notice on the block medical officer of health of Muraroi Block I for not being able to explain the lack of gel required for carrying out ECG despite being sanctioned Rs 12,000 to procure it. 																								Yesterday, he had showcaused BMOH Kuntal Mukherjee, who is also superintendent of the Muraroi Rural Hospital, and five other doctors for being absent from work. 																								Chief medical officer Shyamapada Basak said he had sanctioned the amount from the World Bank funds received for healthcare reforms to purchase gel required to carry out ECG and other equipment. 																								The gel necessary for ECG was not available at the Muraroi Rural Hospital during my inspection yesterday. I want an explanation within three days. The BMOH has to explain how he utilised the money given to him, said Basak. 																								Asked for his reaction, Mukherjee said he had purchased the gel, but the bill was yet to be sent to the treasury. Hospital sources said the gel was bought only two days ago and it has not yet found its way to the ECG room. 																								Basak paid a surprise visit to the hospital yesterday following complaints by local villagers to the district magistrate. 																								On reaching the hospital, about 260 km from Calcutta, Basak found none of the six doctors supposed to be attending to patients at work. 																								Three of them were caught indulging in private practise and the other three had taken off without prior information. Basak showcaused them immediately. 																								Basak also saw a hand-written notice, saying the ECG facility was closed due to lack of the gel, on the door to the ECG chamber. A nurse said the facility has been closed for the past two months.

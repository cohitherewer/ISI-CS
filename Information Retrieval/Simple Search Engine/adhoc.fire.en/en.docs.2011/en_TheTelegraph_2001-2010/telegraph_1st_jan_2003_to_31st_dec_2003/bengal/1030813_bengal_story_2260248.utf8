The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Crash wife clings to last words
 AVIJIT SINHA RABI BANERJEE				 	 Biswas Jalpaiguri/Bethuadahari, Aug.  12: Hours before he got on the chopper, Shanti Ranjan  Roy, a chemist with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation  from Nadia, called up his wife to say he might be late.																								He asked me not to worry. I did not, because this was not the first time he made such a call, Bithika Roy, the wife, sobbed. It was part of his job.																								Roy was among the ONGC officials missing after the chopper plunged into the choppy Arabian Sea yesterday.																								Though rescuers held out little hope, the 40-year-old woman refuses to give up. He told me he would come back. I am sure he will.																								In Jalpaiguris Samajpara, Ashima Biswas, too, waits for her son Ramaprasanna, an electrical engineer with ONGC, to make a call. He was on the same helicopter. 																								A heart patient, the mother has not yet been told of the crash. We told her that he was injured in a bus accident in Mumbai, Keya Das Biswas, the missing engineers sister, said.																								To prevent the news from reaching her, the family cut off the cable connection. Neighbours and reporters were kept away from the house.																								The families of the missing men have not heard much from ONGC. We have only been told that the search is on, the sister said.																								Roy, a resident of Bethuadahari and an M.Sc. in chemistry from Calcutta University, joined the blue-chip public sector company in 1984. 																								He was a job hopper. He had worked in the state fisheries department and the Alipore meteorological office before joining ONGC, said Tapan Roy, his brother-in-law and a member of the Nakashipara panchayat samity.																								Biswas, an electrical engineer from Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College, too, joined the ONGC in 1984. He was a superintending engineer (drilling) of the organisation based in Mumbai, where he had moved two years ago. 																								We got the terrible news last afternoon, said Tapas Kanti Das, the brother-in-law of the missing engineer. 																								Debprasanna, Biswas younger brother, left for Mumbai last evening. We dont know what news he would bring us, Das said. 																								Halee, Roys ailing daughter, is certain that baba will come back. He promised to take me out when he returned. He told me to take rest till then, the girl, suffering from an abdominal pain since an operation last year, said.																								The missing officials wife said she called up the ONGC office in Mumbai as soon as she heard of the crash on television but failed to get any information. 																								Unfortunately, the man who answered the phone did not have much to tell. He took down my phone number and promised to call back. He hasnt though, Bithika said.																								For Biswas wife Baishali and son Rahul, a Class VI student in Mumbai, its been a tough time. Still, she called us up yesterday and told us to take care of our mother, his sister said. 																								Though the body of the missing engineer has not been found, family and friends fear the worst. Tom, a friend, said Biswas was always jovial and nice to everybody. Its hard to believe that he is no more.

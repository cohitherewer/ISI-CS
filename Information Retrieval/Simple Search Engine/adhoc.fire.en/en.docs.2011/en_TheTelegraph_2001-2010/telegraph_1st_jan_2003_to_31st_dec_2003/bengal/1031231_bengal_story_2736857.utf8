 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 Doctor duo axed for post-operation neglect
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Dec. 30: The state medical council today suspended the registration of two senior doctors who were found guilty of negligence.																								Police have started a case of criminal negligence against M.A. Quader, the head of the department of surgery at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, and A.R. Biswas, who had operated on a patient at a nursing home in Habra. 																								Usha Debnath, 62, a resident of Habra, underwent a gall bladder operation on July 29, 2001, at the nursing home. The morning after the operation, she died. Her son Debabrata lodged a complaint with the medical council and the People for Better Treatment, an NGO that takes up negligence charges against doctors. He said in the complaint that Quader and Biswas, who carried out the surgery, neglected post-operative care, which led to the death.																								As People for Better Treatment took up the case with the government, the West Bengal Medical Council slapped showcause notices on the two doctors. 																								We are very happy with the way the state medical council took a serious view of the case and summoned the two errant doctors for hearing, said Debabrata.																								In its letter to Quader, the council said: After going through the records, the council is of the opinion that proper and reasonable post-operative attendance and care were not taken by you resulting in the death of the patient (Usha Debnath) due to gross negligence.																								In its letter to Biswas, the council said the operation theatre in the nursing home was far below standard. Essential precautionary measures as well as post-operative management of the patient and her subsequent shifting in a moribund condition, resulting in death, call for your utter negligence.																								Both doctors today came for the hearing at the radiotherapy unit of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. Director of medical education C.R. Maiti was among those present when the doctors spoke in their defence. 																								The council verdict kept Quaders registration in suspension for six months and Biswas for three years. Both doctors have submitted their registration certificates to the council.

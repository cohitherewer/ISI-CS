The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, March 20, 2003 				 Dhantola rapists identified
 AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR 																								Calcutta, March 19: Five women allegedly raped by the looters of two buses at Dhantola on February 6 have identified three men as being among the rapists. 																								The women were brought to the Dhantola district CID office on Monday and asked to identify their molesters from among the 22 arrested men at a test identification parade. This is one among several rounds in the identification procedure, CID sources said.																								Deputy inspector-general of police, CID, Raj Kanojia said Putu Sardar, Parimal Sardar and Lodhai Sardar were identified. We believe that not only these three, but there were others involved in raping and molesting the women in the two buses, he added. 																								CID officials said the identification process will take time as the incident took place at night. The women have said that most of the men looked and behaved in the same manner and there were more involved in the outrage. They, however, positively identified only the three, Kanojia said. 																								One of the victims said Lodhai had snatched a wristwatch from her while raping her. CID sources said the watch was recovered from a hideout at Ashoknagar in North 24-Parganas from where Lodhai was picked up on March 11.																								Putu and Parimal were picked up from Burdwans Kalna area on March 4 after they were trapped while looting trucks on the Kalna-Katwa road. Both of them have apparently confessed to their crime to the police as well as the CID. 																								Another victim identified Putu after she heard him speak during the procedure.

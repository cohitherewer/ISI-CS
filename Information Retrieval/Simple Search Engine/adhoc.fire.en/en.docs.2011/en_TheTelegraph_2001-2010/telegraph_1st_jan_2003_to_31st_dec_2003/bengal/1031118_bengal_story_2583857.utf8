The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, November 18, 2003 				 Biman in court for mela
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Nov. 17: Left Front chief Biman Bose, who had defied Justice Amitava Lalas order restricting rallies in the city on weekdays, today said he would seek the high courts permission to hold the Vidyasagar Mela on the Maidan from December 23.																								A division bench had earlier directed the government to stop fairs in the vicinity of the Victoria Memorial. The bench of Justices A. Ganguly and S.P. Talukdar also said the government should arrange a ground, preferably near the EM Bypass, for the fairs.																								Bose, who plays a leading role in organising the Mela, said arrangements for the fair had begun long before the court order and a ground off the Bypass is not ready yet. 																								Ironically, the same judges  Ganguly and Talukdar  are hearing a contempt case against Bose for his remarks on the judiciary after the rally-bar order.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Oct. 30: Police today arrested the owner of a coaching centre on the charge of cheating.																								Ilias Khan, owner of the Daffodil Institute of Career Studies at Gorabazaar in Behrampore, had allegedly amassed a huge sum of money from several local youth after giving them fake job assurances.																								Till date, we have received complaints from at least 14 youth of the locality accusing Ilias of taking Rs 5.7 lakh from them and telling them that he would provide them suitable jobs, said district superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh.																								 On Sunday, Ilias lodged a complaint with a police station in Nadia that Rs 1 lakh had been stolen.																								When police asked him where he had got the money, his answer was not satisfactory, say police sources. We started to investigate and the truth came out, said an official.

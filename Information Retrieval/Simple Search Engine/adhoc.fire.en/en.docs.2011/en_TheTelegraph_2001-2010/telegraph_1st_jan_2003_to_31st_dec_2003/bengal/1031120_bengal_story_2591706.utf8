The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, November 20, 2003 				 Buddha woos Aussies
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Nov. 19: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee discussed possibilities of increased Australian investment in the state with the countrys high commissioner P. Wensley at Writers Buildings today.																								Australia is the eleventh largest investor in India, but very little is invested in Bengal. We believe that there is potential for Australia and Bengal to do more (business) together, and we also believe that both governments and private parties have to work towards that. We hope to make significant gain in this sometime soon, Wensley said.																								The chief minister suggested export of leather and leather goods, marine and seafood, fruits and vegetables to our country. However, Australia already has enough of marine and seafood, fruits and vegetables. But there is still a possibility of supplying fruits and vegetables to each other during the off-seasons, she added. Among specific projects discussed, she mentioned the possibility of using Australian expertise for eco-tourism in Bengal.

 Monday, January 06, 2003 				 Police raid on jawans home draws a blank 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Jan. 5: Police swooped on the house of Habibur Rahman, the army jawan arrested from the Rajouri sector in Jammu and Kashmir for suspected ISI links, at Pathanpara in Malihati village under Salar police station on Friday evening but did not find anything incriminating. 																								A police team will soon leave for Uttar Pradesh in search of Habiburs father, Abdur Rahman, an imam at a mosque in Lucknow. 																								The two-hour raid yielded nothing incriminating, said Kallol Ganai, the sub-divisional police officer of Kandi.																								Habibur, a jawan of the signals regiment posted in Rajouri, was picked up four days ago. Police sources said the raid was conducted following an army communique. The results of the raid have been reported back. 																								The police sources said intelligence agencies have definite information on the ISI links of both Habibur and his father. Habibur used to pass on sensitive information to his father over telephone, said an official. 																								Sources said the Bengal police are likely to request their Uttar Pradesh counterparts for help in arresting Abdur.																								With Habibur, the number of arrested ISI agents hailing from Murshidabad district has gone up to 10 since November. Of them, two were from the army. Aufan Ukil, a data operator with the air force, was arrested from Pune. Two ex-armymen were also among those picked up for being suspected spies.																								ISI activities in Murshidabad came to light with the arrest of Ziauddin Biswas and four others from Durlabher Para in Jalangi on November 17. All of them are now lodged in Behrampore jail. 																								A senior police official said they had information that there was enough documents in the possession of Habibur and his father to crack open a widespread ISI network in Murshidabad and the other border districts.																								Alarmed at the spate in ISI activities, the district administration has stepped up vigil in the border areas and places adjoining army camps. Patrols have been intensified and police teams have spread out across the district looking for leads.																								Besides, plainclothesmen are being deployed at hotels and guest houses in the town to check out visitors with suspicious movements. Hotel-owners have been asked to inform the police whenever they come across an unusual guest.

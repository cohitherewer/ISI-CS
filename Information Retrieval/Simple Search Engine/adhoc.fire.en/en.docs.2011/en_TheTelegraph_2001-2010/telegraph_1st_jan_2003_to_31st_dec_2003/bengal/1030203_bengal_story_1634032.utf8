 Monday, February 03, 2003 				 RSP bandh
																								Siliguri, Feb. 2: The RSP will back a 12-hour bandh here tomorrow to protest the governments move to close down the ailing Chandmoni tea garden and set up a satellite township in its place, reports our correspondent.																								We support the bandh  called by the Chandmoni Anti-eviction Joint Action Committee and some Naxalite outfits  because we believe the CPM has gone overboard with the township plan, said RSP Darjeeling district secretary Benoy Chakrabarty.

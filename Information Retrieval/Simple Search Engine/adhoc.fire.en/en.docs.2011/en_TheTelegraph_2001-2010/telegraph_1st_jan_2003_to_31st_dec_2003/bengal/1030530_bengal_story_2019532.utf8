The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, May 30, 2003 				 Enter Apollo, with chain of clinics
 RAJA GHOSHAL  New Delhi, May 29: Hospital  major Apollo has drawn up plans to open about a dozen health  clinics in Bengal as part of its national rollout of friendly  neighbourhood clinics.																								Ratan Jalan, CEO of Apollo Health and Lifestyle, said from Hyderabad: We plan to open about 12 Apollo health clinics in Bengal within a year. Apollo Health and Lifestyle is a 100 per cent subsidiary of the Rs 100-crore-plus Apollo Hospitals group. 																								Jalan said some of the locations and franchisees have already been identified. The cost of building the clinics will have to be borne by the franchisees, who will also have to pay a licence fee of Rs 20 lakh to Apollo Health. 																								A clinic on Theatre Road in Calcutta will be set up within a month. A couple of other clinics will be opened in north and central Calcutta. Some more clinics will also be opened in the city for which location scouting is on, said Jalan.																								A couple of clinics are likely to come up in Howrah and one each in Siliguri and Kharagpur. In Assam, Apollo will open clinics in Tinsukia and Guwahati.																								Selection of employees, standardisation and design of the health centres will be overseen by Apollo. Each clinic will have two doctors, pathologists and other specialists. 																								The branded concept in neighbourhood clinics was introduced by Max India in Delhi but Jalan claimed Apollo was the first to have gone national. 																								Interestingly, Apollo is going across the border as well. We plan to set up at least 10 clinics in Bangladesh, of which four will be in Dhaka, said Jalan. 																								There are seven Apollo clinics  five in New Delhi and one each in Jamshedpur and Ahmedabad  now. In the next five years, the company plans to establish a chain of more than 250 Apollo clinics across India.																								The chain of branded clinics will focus on preventive healthcare and provide a range of services  from consultant specialists to diagnostic facilities and 24-hour pharmacies  under one roof. It will also provide tele-medicine facilities.																								Apart from the clinics, Apollo has about 20 tertiary or super specialty hospitals and 10 secondary-level hospitals. The three-tier model of branded healthcare is also being tried out by other hospital groups like Max.

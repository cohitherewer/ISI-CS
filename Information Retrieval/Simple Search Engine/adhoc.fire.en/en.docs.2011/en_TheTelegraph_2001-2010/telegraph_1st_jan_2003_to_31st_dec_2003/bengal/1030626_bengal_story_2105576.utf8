 Thursday, June 26, 2003 				 Eve-teasing cops thrash protester
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Serampore, June 25: Rogue constables from the police barracks here severely beat up the owner of a tea stall near Walsh hospital here last night when he protested against the teasing of several passing women. 																								Police said Ajoy Das, 35, who began running the stall after his company, the India Jute Mills, closed down, had to be admitted to Walsh hospital. 																								Serampore sub-divisional police officer Shankha Subhro Chakraborty said an inquiry was ordered after Ajoys brother, Sanjoy, filed a complaint in the police station here. 																								Sanjoy has complained that his brother protested when the constables, in plain clothes, sipping tea at his stall began passing crude remarks at women passing by. The policemen left, but returned around 10 pm, armed with lathis, to rain blows on Ajoy. 																								Hooghly superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said he hadnt yet heard of the complaint. But he added a new angle after hearing of the incident. The sub-divisional police officer has been very strict in the area, destroying gambling dens and illegal liquor shops. We have to see whether the policemen have been framed to discredit the police officer, Kumar said. 																								Residents said a womens college was close to the spot and students passed by the stall regularly. Some of the girls return home after 8 pm, when the teasing reportedly took place, after attending private coaching classes, Sumitra Mitra, who lives nearby, said. 																								Police said they were looking for witnesses other than Ajoy to help with identification and a departmental inquiry.

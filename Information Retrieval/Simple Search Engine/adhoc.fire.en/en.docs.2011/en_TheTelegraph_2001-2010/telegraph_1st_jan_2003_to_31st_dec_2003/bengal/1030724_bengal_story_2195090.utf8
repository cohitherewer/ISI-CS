 Thursday, July 24, 2003 				 Cong MLA quits in mahajot protest
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Malda, July 23: Congress MLA from Kharba in Malda Mehbul Haque today resigned from the party in protest against the formation of the Malda zilla parishad by his party with support from the BJP. 																								Talking to reporters at Malda circuit house this afternoon, Haque said he had sent his resignation letter to district Congress president Rubi Noor. A copy of the letter has also been sent to state party president Pranab Mukherjee. 																								Noor was not available for comment. 																								Haques resignation before elections to the posts of karmadhaksha has put the Congress in a sticky situation. The loss of one vote could cost the Congress since the CPM has stepped up campaign to capture the crucial posts after losing the zilla parishad. 																								The Congress formed the board with help from the BJP and the Trinamul Congress, winning 17 of the 33 votes. The Left Front had won 16 votes. 																								In polls to the 10 karmadhaksha posts, the Left Front and the Congress-led Opposition have an equal number of voters. In this case, Haques vote is crucial to the party. 																								General secretary of the partys district committee Hasan Ali Shah, however, denied receiving any such information. 																								To my knowledge, Haque is in Calcutta. Besides, the Congress is a big organisation. If some differences have cropped up, they will be resolved, he added. 																								Haque has said he will step down as MLA if party leaders accepted his resignation papers. I shall keep away from the karmadhaksha elections of the zilla parishad on July 27, he said. 																								Haque claimed he also had the support of some zilla parishad members but refused to give details.																								Pranab Kumar Das, newly-elected Congress zilla parishad member from Chanchol, was present beside Haque. Mehbulda has protested against the unjust act and I am with him, he said.

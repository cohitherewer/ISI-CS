 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Doctors demand protection
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Nov. 11: Doctors and nurses at the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital today laid siege to the superintendents office demanding protection from relatives of patients. 																								Trouble broke out after a 14-year-old girl admitted with malaria early this morning died in the afternoon. Aditi Pal, a resident of Kalna Bhadropally, was admitted within an hour of her arrival at the hospital.																								Around 1.20 pm, Aditi died. Minutes later, her relatives alleged that doctors did not attend to her since morning. Some of the house-staffs were assaulted. Hospital superintendent Sarit Choudhury and his deputy rushed to the spot and calmed frayed nerves. The relatives left with the body, hurling abuses at the doctors and nurses.																								Stung by the humiliation, they struck work. After an emergency meeting, the doctors said they were assaulted for no fault of theirs and were afraid to resume work. About 60 doctors and nurses put up a demonstration in front of the superintendents office demanding action against the patients relatives. Choudhury was not allowed to leave his room throughout the day. 																								There is no security. Anybody can enter any ward, any time, the doctors said. The superintendent was released in the evening after an assurance from the district administration that healthcare professionals would be provided adequate protection. The hospital authorities also said they would pursue cases against those involved in attacks on doctors and nurses.

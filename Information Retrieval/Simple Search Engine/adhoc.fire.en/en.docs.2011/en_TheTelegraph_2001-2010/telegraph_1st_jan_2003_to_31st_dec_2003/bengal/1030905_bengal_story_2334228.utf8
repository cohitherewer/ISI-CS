 Friday, September 05, 2003 				 Teacher shot in classroom
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Sept. 4: Six miscreants stormed a classroom of Bamungachhi High School, about 70 km from here, and gunned down a teacher on Thursday.																								Subal Naskar, 48, was a zonal committee member of the CPM in Joynagar of South 24-Parganas and a former panchayat pradhan of Bamungachhi.																								The assailants were said to be SUCI supporters and the murder the result of an old feud. The SUCI refuted the charge. Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel were deployed to keep calm in the area after the murder. Shops downed shutters.																								A local CPM leader said Naskar had tried to escape after the first shot but the goons dragged him out of the class and fired at him at least half-a-dozen times.

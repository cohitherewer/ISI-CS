The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Biryani and transfers on doctors plate
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Calcutta, July 14: A get-together over mutton biryani and chicken kosha and the promise of a transfer to a college of choice in two years  that was the menu to ensure teachers cooperate when an inspection team visits the Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital.The Medical Council of Indias inspection to check whether infrastructure at the college is adequate to teach 100 students every batch, which it does now, will come off this week. Not wanting to take the risk of facing the team without an interface, lest the visit came off on Monday itself, the college authorities convened an informal meeting with teachers last evening that stretched late into the night.We wanted to get our point across to the teachers before the inspection, principal Indrajit Ray told The Telegraph, explaining the decision to convene the unofficial meeting. An overwhelming majority attended it and decided on some dos and donts. It was held in a very cordial atmosphere, he added.I am doing my best to remove the drawbacks that are still there but I came here a few weeks ago, said Ray. Some lacunae remain  like the attitude of the PWD unit here  but I am happy to say that I have received the cooperation of every teacher in my endeavour to ensure that the inspection team goes back with a positive impression. Most teachers have given up their weekend offs to back his efforts, Ray added.Teachers who attended the meeting agreed with their principal; the atmosphere could not be anything but cordial given the sumptuous spread, they said, but many were surprised by the dos and donts read out to them.The teachers were specifically asked not to say a word to any member of the council. Even if you know anyone in the visiting team personally (you could be batchmates or classmates), dont utter a word beyond your name and department, was the instruction.Officials admitted at the meeting that not everything was fine at the college. Most of the grants that had come in the past two years were sent back unused, they said. Efforts would be made to ensure that the council team does not make a department-by-department inspection, the officials added.But it was not all dry facts and sermon. Squeezed in was a dinner comprising mutton biryani, chicken kosha, navratan korma and ice-cream and sweets for dessert, which could have made many forget the pain of missing home over the weekend.But the incentive that took everyone by surprise was that the teachers who will cooperate during the inspection will get a transfer to their college of choice in two years. With most teachers having families in Calcutta, the offer translated into transfers to the citys colleges.Ray said: I admit I have not been left in a very happy situation but I would like to look forward.Theres no point going over what I said during the meeting and what I would have liked to inherit when I came here.

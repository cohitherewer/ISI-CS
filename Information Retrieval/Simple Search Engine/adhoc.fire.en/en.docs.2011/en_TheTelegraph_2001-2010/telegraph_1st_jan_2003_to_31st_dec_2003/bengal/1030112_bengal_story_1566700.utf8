 Sunday, January 12, 2003 				 Cheating shackles on Forward Bloc leader 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Balurghat, Jan. 11: The Forward Blocs South Dinajpur district committee secretary, Swapan Tarafdar, was arrested late last night in a swoop on his residence at Gangarampur. The leader, who was absconding for the past two months, is accused of taking money from several persons after promising them jobs that never materialised. 																								Tarafdar was produced in Buniadpur court this afternoon and remanded in judicial custody.																								Police said the Bloc leader had collected Rs 20 lakh from about 40 unemployed youths between 1995 and 2001, but none of them received employment. Angered, some of them filed a case of cheating against Tarafdar at the court of the Buniadpur sub-divisional judicial magistrate, who issued an arrest warrant on November 10 last year. 																								Tarafdar, who is also the vice-chairman of the district market regulating committee, could not be traced since, till the police raid on his residence last night. 																								Tarafdar denied the charges, saying he has been implicated in a false case. State Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh, when contacted in Calcutta, said: We are looking into the matter and have sought a detailed report from the district committee. 																								Asked if the party would take disciplinary action against Tarafdar, Ghosh ruled out the possibility pending a thorough probe by the state committee.

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Calcutta, Feb. 21: Tata Consultancy Services will kick off a computer-aided adult literacy programme next month. 																								The 12-week delivery model designed by the software firm will aim at empowering an illiterate adult person to read newspapers after the completion of the intensive training. 																								The project is part of the companys commitment to the needs of the society. We have developed a computer-aided object-oriented training model. Our software focuses on facilitating learning by flashing symbols and icons along with sound. The stress here is not on alphabets, but syllables, explained Debasish Bandyopadhyay, principal consultant, TCS, and the man in charge of the project in the state. 																								TCS is ready with the software after a series of test runs in a number of villages in South 24-Parganas, said Bandyopadhyay. 																								The prototype runs conducted in association with Rama Krishna Mission Boys Home, Narendrapur, and Bengal Social Services, a local NGO, helped us get a first-hand feed-back and incorporate necessary changes, he added. 																								The project plan drawn up by TCS for the state includes opening 15 adult learning centres in three districts  north and South 24-Parganas and Howrah  in the first phase. More districts will be brought under the programme in phases.

				 																																	Calcutta, Oct. 12: The state BJP received a shot in the arm today with former CPM parliamentarian Bratin Sengupta joining the party. We are happy that a disillusioned CPM functionary has joined us, said BJP state president Tathagata Roy. 				 																																	Sengupta, who was elected to the Rajya Sabha on a CPM ticket in 1994, said he did not renew his membership after completing his tenure. He said he was switching as the CPM has become a party of money-makers. 				 																																	Rampurhat: Four robbers boarded a private bus plying between Nalhati and Rampurhat in the guise of passengers on Saturday night and snatched gold ornaments and cash from the travellers. 				 																																	Calcutta: Police clashed with SUCI supporters and arrested 23 of them at Mouritat in South 24-Parganas, about 40 km from here, when they tried to snatch a colleague, Aniruddha Halder, who was arrested for demonstrating in front of a police station.				 																																	Calcutta: A large number of kar sevaks who came from Canning and Taldi to board the Sealdah-Jammu Tawi Express without tickets were arrested at the station. Railway police said they were on their way to Ayodhya. The kar sevaks were also charged with illegal assembly at the station.

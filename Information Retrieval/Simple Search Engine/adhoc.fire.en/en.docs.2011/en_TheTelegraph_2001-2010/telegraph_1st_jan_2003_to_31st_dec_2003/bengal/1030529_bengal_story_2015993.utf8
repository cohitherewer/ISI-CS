The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, May 29, 2003 				 No takers for court house
 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 																								Durgapur, May 28: Lawyers at the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court here have refused to move to a new building constructed three years ago by the public works department at the cost of Rs 28 lakh. 																								The new building has less space and there is no water connection. It cannot accommodate law clerks and visitors and, so, we have refused to move there. Calcutta High Court as well as the lawyers here have agreed that we should have another, better designed place, said Anupam Mukherjee, assistant secretary of the Durgapur Bar Association. 																								But the PWD is crying foul. We had followed the plans given to us, but now we understand that the lawyers are demanding more accommodation, said a PWD engineer.																								Faced with the opposition of the legal fraternity, the Burdwan district judge is looking for fresh accommodation. He now plans to use the building that has found no takers to house the Centres proposed fast-track court, a series of which will be established across the country to dispose of long-pending cases. 																								We sent a proposal to the high court a couple of months ago to locate the fast-track court in the new building. We have also sent a request for Rs 60 lakh to build a new court building for the Durgapur sub-divisional court, said Rudrendranath Banerjee, the district judge. 																								But the fast-track court proposal too has not gone down well with the lawyers. 																								The lawyers, litigants and clerks will have to walk over half-a-kilometre to get to the fast-track court if it is located in the new building. The proliferation of shopping complexes around the administration area has given rise to congestion that makes it difficult for both pedestrians and vehicles to move around, Mukherjee said.

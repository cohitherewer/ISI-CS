 Monday, August 25, 2003 				 Lover Pintu in custody for rape 
 DEBASHISH CHATTERJEE  Calcutta, Aug. 24: Another  girl knocked the police door to complain against her lover  who jilted her after false assurances of marriage. 																								The 16-year-old girl of a village at Falta in South 24-Parganas, about 55 km from here, had to abort a child after Pintu Haldar, 28, refused to accept responsibility. Pintu and his parents are now in custody.																								At least 15 such cases are pending before Calcutta High Court. In all the cases, the men refused to wed the women with whom they cohabited with false assurances of marriage. In two recent judgments, a court in Hooghly sentenced two men to seven years in jail. 																								The girl of Class IX had weaved her dreams around Pintu. After she had to abort, truth dawned on her.																								The high court had recently observed that refusal to marry after cohabiting with a woman was tantamount to rape.																								Pintu, a fellow villager at Bashbadi, had been going around with her for two years. But his parents allegedly threatened her family with dire consequences if she coaxed him to marry. She was offered money for the abortion. 																								The girls parents went to Falta police station on August 10. Pintu was arrested on the charge of rape. His father Sailen and mother Dipti were picked up in the next three days for forcing her to go for abortion. 																								Her parents had no choice but to keep quiet for so long as they were hoping against hope that he might finally change his mind and marry her. But Pintu and his parents stood their ground, said Mehmood Akhtar, the subdivisional police officer of Diamond Harbour. 																								A criminal case has been started and the boy and girl will undergo medical tests in a day or two, said an officer of Falta. Officials of the nursing home where the girl underwent abortion are being questioned. Speciality baby care																								A neonatal care unit was inaugurated today at the Deben Mahato Sadar Hospital in Purulia, reports our correspondent. 																								Once in full swing, critically ill new-borns would be referred to the unit even from Bankura Medical College Hospital. It is the only such government facility in the state outside SSKM Hospital in Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, March 23, 2003 				 Kidnap conspiracy charge on Ansari 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 22: A city court today framed charges of sedition under the Prevention of Terrorism Act against Aftab Ansari, the prime accused in the attack outside the American Center in Calcutta, for allegedly conspiring to assassinate President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and abduct cricketers Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar. 																								Ansari was brought from Calcutta four days ago on a production warrant to face trial in the case and was taken back immediately after todays proceedings. Special Judge S.N. Dhingra framed charges against nine of Ansaris accomplices on March 5. 																								Pronouncing the order, Dhingra said that prima facie a case existed against Ansari. Two of his associates  Arshad Khan and Anita Das  will face the charge of waging war against the state for allegedly providing logistical support to Pakistan-trained militants in another case. 																								Though Ansaris name figures as an accused in both cases, the court did not frame separate charges against him for providing support to militants. Dhingra said the cases against him would be clubbed and would proceed concurrently. 																								The Delhi police chargesheet alleged that Arshad Khan had backed Afghanistans Taliban militia in its fight against the Northern Alliance. He was also involved in the abduction of Khadims owner Parthapratim Roy Burman. 																								Ansari was also charged with planning to kidnap for ransom Sachin and Sourav with the help of other terrorist outfits to raise funds and compel the Centre to release their associates lodged in various Indian jails. 																								Ansari had also allegedly arranged the delivery of a consignment of AK-47 rifles and pistols from Pakistan in July 2001.

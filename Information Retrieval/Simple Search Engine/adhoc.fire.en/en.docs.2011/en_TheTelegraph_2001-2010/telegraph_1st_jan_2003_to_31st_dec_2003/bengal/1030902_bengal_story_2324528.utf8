 Tuesday, September 02, 2003 				 Politics in fishery war
																								Calcutta, Sept. 1: Efforts to strengthen unity among the Left Front partners again suffered a jolt today when two CPM members were murdered allegedly by RSP men at Canning in South 24-Parganas.																								No one has been arrested in connection with the murders, allegedly following a dispute over a fishery. 																								The area wore the look of a bandh today as shops remained shut. Police said trouble started around seven this morning when CPM supporters Mannan Laskar, 32, and Alauddin Laskar, 28, were going to their fishery on bicycles. Four armed men overpowered them on the way and stabbed them to death. To make sure they were dead, the miscreants also shot at them. 																								The CPM blamed the RSP for the attack and party cadre launched an immediate attack on the houses of RSP supporters in the area. RSP leaders said the duo fell victim to rivalry within the CPM.

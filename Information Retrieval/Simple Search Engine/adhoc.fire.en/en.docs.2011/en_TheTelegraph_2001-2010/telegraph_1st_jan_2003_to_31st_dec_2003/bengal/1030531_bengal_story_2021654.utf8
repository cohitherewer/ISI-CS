The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, May 31, 2003 				 Congress couple killed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Domkal (Murshidabad), May 30: When armed miscreants attacked Fazal Sheikh of Sambhunagar last night, his wife Azima Bibi rushed out. Before she could cry help, Sheikh was stabbed. He fell in a heap even as the fleeing goons hurled bombs at the wife.																								Sheikh, 35, died immediately. Azima, 32, died at the district hospital in Behrampore, about 40 km from here, this morning. They were both said to be Congress supporters.																								No one was arrested till late tonight and police said the murders were not political. It is a fact that they were supporters of the Congress but there was no politics involved, the killings were a result of some family dispute. We are looking for the killers, said Chittaranjan Nag, the subdivisional police officer.																								The couples eldest son, Pintu, 15, said the attackers were close relatives. He had no clue why they targeted his parents. They had campaigned for the Congress before the panchayat election. The Congress candidate for the gram panchayat, Murselim Sheikh, won the poll because of my father. He was a CPM supporter earlier, said Pintu.																								Witnesses said Sheikh was returning home from the market on his bicycle around 8 pm when he was attacked. He was about to enter his house. I could not see the exact number of attackers in the dark but they were hacking at Fazal with sharp weapons. When his wife rushed out, they hurled a bomb, she fell down, said Khajanuddin Sheikh, a villager. Storm deaths																								Two men were killed when a Norwester lashed the district this evening. Oli Seikh and Jeher Seikh were buried under an uprooted banyan tree. Several huts were damaged in Nabagram.

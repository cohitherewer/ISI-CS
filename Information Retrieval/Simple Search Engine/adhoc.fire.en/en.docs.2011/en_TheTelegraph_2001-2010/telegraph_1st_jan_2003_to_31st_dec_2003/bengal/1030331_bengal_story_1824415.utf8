The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Monday, March 31, 2003 				 Varsity poll quashed with malpractice slur
 SUNANDO SARKAR																								Calcutta, March 30: This is one case of electoral malpractice that has failed to avoid a courts gaze. 																								Kalyani University has lost a legal battle  over an election to the science faculty deans post  to senior teacher Siddhartha Roy, who was convinced that the authorities conspired to defeat him. 																								The post, say officials, is strategically important because of the vital role it plays in, among other things, distributing largesse: recruitment and promotion of teachers. A facultys dean is also an important member of the universitys court and executive council (the two highest decision-making bodies of the varsity) and has a large say in the conduction of examinations, determination of the syllabi and awarding of doctorates, say officials, explaining why the authorities usually want individuals perceived to be close to them to adorn the post.																								In the election held to the science faculty deans post (in June 2002), Asit Guha edged out Roy after university vice-chancellor Nityananda Saha cast a vote to resolve a tie. But the university tribunal, of former Calcutta High Court judge and Sikkim High Court chief justice Malay Sengupta, has termed improper the procedure adopted by the vice-chancellor in conducting the poll and ruled Guhas election invalid and void. 																								Taking a dim view of what happened during the election and making particularly caustic comments on the procedure adopted by the authorities, the ruling  passed earlier this month  says: It is true that, from the very start of the election process, some novelty was introduced.																								Roy and Guha were the two contestants for the post and the electoral college comprised 32 members of the science faculty. At the end of the election  of which Saha, as the vice-chancellor, was the chairman and returning officer  Roy and Guha were found to have netted 16 votes each.																								University statutes keep an option for such situations, saying the tie must be broken by a draw of lots. All such cases are usually decided by the toss of a coin  there were ties in two other intra-varsity polls in 2002 itself  but Saha surprised everyone by saying he would decide the issue by his casting vote.																								Amid protests  both verbal and written  Saha voted for Guha, prompting Roy to go to the tribunal. His appeal, however, reached the court much later than usual, prompting the court to note that unfortunately, too much time was taken by the university to transfer Roys plea to it.																								Roy fought his own case even as the university employed a legal team that cost it some money. The tribunal, however, was categorical in upholding Roys plea and directed the university to strip Guha of the deans post and arrange for the draw of lots within 10 days.

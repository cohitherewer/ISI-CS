 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 4: Delhi High Court today issued a notice to the CBI to file a reply on the action it has taken to arrest fugitives Kim Davy, alias Neils Christian Neilsen, and his two associates accused in the Purulia arms dropping case.																								Justices Dalveer Bhandari and S.K. Agarwal asked the CBI to file a reply by February 24 on a writ petition by Calcutta-based legal activist Deepak Prahladka, seeking a CBI report on the steps being taken to arrest and extradite Danish nationals Kim Davy, Peter Haestrup and Brian Thune.																								Prahladka alleged that though he had informed the CBI about Davy and his associates through a letter dated October 5 last year, the agency failed to take any action.																								...Neither has the CBI filed any report before the sessions court on their arrest and extradition nor has it informed the petitioner of the action taken on the information given by him about Davy and his associates, Prahladka said in the court.																								A huge quantity of arms and ammunition, including 350 AK-47s, anti-tank grenades, pistols and rocket launchers, were dropped in Purulia district on December 17, 1995. 																								Davy managed to escape from Mumbai airport four days later while Peter Bleach of Britain and five Latvians  Alexander Klichine, Igor Timmerman, Igor Moskvitine, Olag Gaidash and Evguenu Antimenko  were arrested. 																								The six were sentenced to life imprisonment by a Calcutta court in 2000 for waging war against the nation. Bleach continues to be behind bars, but the five Latvians were granted pardon by the President a couple of years ago and Davy was declared proclaimed offender.																								Interpol also issued a red corner notice, saying if you have any information about Kim Davy, contact your national or local police or Interpol.																								In his petition, Prahladka said that in August 1996, the CBI had approached the Danish ministry of justice for establishing the identity of Davys associates. The Danish authorities replied on May 1, 1997, saying they had been located in Denmark, their names were Peter Haestrup and Brian Thune and they were Danish citizens. 																								However, before conducting any inquiry, the Danish government wanted the CBI to send necessary evidence on the role of the accused in the case. It had sent reminders on July 31, 1997 and in February 1998. However, the CBI did not bother to reply, Prahladka alleged. 																								On 18 March, 2002, the Danish TV2 aired a documentary, made with the help of Prahladka, showing that Davy was living freely in Denmark. It also justified his act of buying and dropping arms in Purulia, the petition said.																								CBI officials said that when a Danish minister had come last year, he had taken up the issue and promised to take necessary action, but nothing has been done yet.

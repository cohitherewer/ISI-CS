The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Once-a-week medic forced out of clinic 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Krishnagar, Dec. 25: In  the same district where a paediatrician donated blood to  infuse life into a sinking girl, a doctor was asked to leave  by villagers when he attended a primary health centre after  seven days.																								When Supriyo Mitra turned up on Tuesday at the health centre at Asannagar, 110 km from Calcutta, he was faced with questions from angry residents. 																								Panchayat pradhan Bidyut Biswas alleged that Mitra had been irregular all through the two years of his posting. We repeatedly requested him to attend the health centre regularly but he pleaded that it was difficult for him to come from Calcutta, said Biswas. 																								When the villagers again asked him on Tuesday why he was so irregular, he did not reply, said Biswas. When daktarbabu was surrounded by a mob who demanded to know why he did not attend to patients at the health centre, he decided to leave the hospital at once. When we pointed out that there were patients to attend to, he told us that the other employees should do so, said Namita Majumdar, a nurse at the health centre.																								Biswas immediately went to the districts chief medical officer of health, Prabas Chowdhury, and lodged a complaint.

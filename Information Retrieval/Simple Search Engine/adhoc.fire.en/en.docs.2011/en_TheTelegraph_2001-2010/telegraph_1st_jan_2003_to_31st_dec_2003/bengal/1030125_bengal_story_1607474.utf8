The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 Shourie banks on states for selloff
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, Jan. 24: Union minister Arun Shourie is pinning hopes on unlikely allies to push his disinvestment programme past the friendly fire from within the Centre.																								Shourie said in Bangalore today it would be the state governments, including the one in Bengal, which would push his cause. Indias 28 states will now carry forward the next big wave of privatisation and you will see the effect of that in the next few years, he said.																								Shourie added that the governments of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Bengal were in touch with the Union government seeking guidelines to go ahead with the privatisation process. They are in touch with us to find out our procedures and improve on them. And they are moving quickly, Shourie said.																								However, he refused to elaborate on the queries and proposals that have been put forward by the states.

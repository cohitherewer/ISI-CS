 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, March 11: Squabbles in the state BJP came to the fore today when a panchayat leader was shot dead by a party colleague at Raipur village under Kalna police station this evening.

Ghosal came on a motorcycle with two of his associates around 6.30 pm. He called Mandal outside to discuss an important party matter and shot him the moment he stepped out.																								With barely two months for the panchayat elections, the incident has embarrassed the state BJP leadership, which is yet to decide on a poll strategy.

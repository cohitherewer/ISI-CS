 Tuesday, July 01, 2003 				 CPM befriends enemys friend
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, June 30: Six  years after expelling him for keeping in touch with enemies,  the CPM today re-embraced leader Nepaldeb Bhattacharjee  as a friend who has only the welfare of the party in his  heart.																								Anil Biswas, the CPMs state secretary, announced the re-induction of Bhattacharjee into the party structure. He added that the move had the approval of the party politburo and central committee. 																								Bhattacharjee was expelled in 1997 when he was a member of the state committee. He had been accused of supplying important and secret information about the party (the CPM) to the partys enemies.																								Asked whether Bhattacharjee will be re-inducted in the state committee, Biswas said: It will be decided later. The party has decided to allow him to become the member of the organisation again.																								Though coming back to the party fold after expulsion is not rare in the CPM, sources said the leadership was happy that Bhattacharjee had not spoken ill of the party since his expulsion.

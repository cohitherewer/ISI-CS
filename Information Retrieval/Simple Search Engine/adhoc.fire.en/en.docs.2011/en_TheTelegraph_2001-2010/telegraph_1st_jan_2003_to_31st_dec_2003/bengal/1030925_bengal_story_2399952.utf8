 Thursday, September 25, 2003 				 Gherao after baby death
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Nabadwip (Nadia), Sept. 24: A mob led by the sabhapati of the Trinamul Congress-controlled Nabadwip panchayat samiti and relatives of a woman today besieged the doctor and other employees of a primary health centre here in protest against the delivery of a stillborn baby. They alleged that Phelu Das, 26, lost her baby due to negligence of the health staff. 																								The gherao that began around 10 am was lifted late in the evening. Police rescued the doctor around 6 pm after being informed by the district authorities. District assistant chief medical officer of health K.P. Das visited the health centre and persuaded the 300-strong mob to disperse after promising to look into the incident. 																								The trouble started after Phelu was admitted around 2 am with severe labour pain. Her family alleged that the nurse did not pay enough attention to her. The doctor came only after Phelus husband, Gobinda, requested the nurse to summon her. 																								Later when Phelus condition worsened, the doctor wasnt to be found. When Phelu was complaining of severe labour pain, my sister informed the nurse about it. The nurse told my sister that the doctor had already seen the patient and there was no need to call her again, said Gobinda. Around 7, Phelu delivered a stillborn baby. 																								The protesting mob alleged that Phelus baby could have been saved had the nurse and the doctor acted in time. 																								We have received allegations of negligence on the part of the doctor and other employees of the health centre. We are investigating into it, said Das, who will conduct an inquiry.  Blow to medical seat hope																								The states hope of receiving the nod for 200 more undergraduate medical seats received another jolt after the Medical Council of India (MCI) expressed dissatisfaction about facilities at the two medical colleges for which the seats have been sought. 																								They (the MCI) have observed in the letter of intent that the hostel at SSKM is not satisfactory. Flaws were also found in the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital by the MCI, said health secretary Asim Barman.

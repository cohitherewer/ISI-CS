 Wednesday, July 30, 2003 				 BSF and BDR in talks to trace missing girl
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Tehatta (Nadia), July 29:  Border Security Force officers have begun talks with their  Bangladeshi counterparts to trace a 13-year-old girl who  went missing more than three weeks ago.																								Pallavi Roy was kidnapped from her ancestral home in Sahapur village on the India-Bangladesh border. The police and the border force presume that the girl was smuggled into the neighbouring country.																								The BSFs move to open talks with Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) follows reports that Bangladeshi criminals had abducted Pallavi.																								Acting on a complaint from her father, Prafullya Roy, sub-divisional police officer of Tehatta Swapan Sarkar visited the frontier village. He spoke to the villagers and on his return to the BSF.																								We, from our side, are doing our bit to assist the BSF in mounting pressure on the BDR by providing latest information about Pallavis probable whereabouts in Bangladesh, said additional superintendent of police Pallab Kanti Ghosh. 																								We may have to approach the Bangladesh high commission if the BDR does not take any fruitful action, he added.																								The police said two rowdies, identified as Tutul Sheikh and Jabbar Ali, from Buripota village in Meherpur district of Bangladesh kidnapped Pallavi when she was managing cattle in a paddy field close to her house. 																								Her father and some of the villagers informed the sub-divisional officer of Tehatta, Asim Bhattacharjee. The SDO told the district magistrate about the incident. A complaint was lodged with the Tehatta police station on July 5 and a kidnapping case was filed. 																								The police have been asked to communicate with the BSF personnel manning the Sahapur outpost.																								The BSF said it was doing its best. We have already informed the BDR. Two flag meetings were held on July 7 and 15. At the meetings, the BDR detailed the efforts that were on to trace the girl. They had informed the Bangladesh police and a massive hunt was on across Meherpur to nab the culprits, said A.K. Sharma, the commandant of the BSF sector headquarters. 																								We have told the BDR that it will be a violation of international law if the girl is not traced out and the culprits are not arrested, he added. 																								The commandant said if the BDR failed to rescue the girl in the next few days, the BSF would mull initiating dialogue with higher officers in the BDR. 																								The flag meetings are now being held at the company commander level. If our efforts prove futile, we will inform the state administration about taking the diplomatic route to rescue the girl, said Sharma.

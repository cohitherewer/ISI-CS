 Sunday, June 22, 2003 				 Political rivalry stench in murder
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 21: The murder of a CPM worker at Joynagar in South 24-Parganas has set police on the hunt for her SUCI-activist husband and his party colleague, who was snatched from custody by a gang of party supporters. 																								The political temperature shot up in the SUCI-dominated area after residents found the body of 32-year-old Meena Laskar lying in a pool of blood with her throat slit this morning at the house of her husband, Sheikh Saidullah. 																								The police suspect that the SUCI worker had hired miscreants to get his wife raped and murdered late on Friday night after he failed to bring his pro-CPM wife in the party fold. Meena, who had been a CPM activist before her marriage, refused to shift allegiance, causing much tension between the couple. Saidullah is missing, the police said. 																								Hours after Meenas body was found, a clash broke out between CPM and SUCI activists. The CPM workers lodged a complaint against an SUCI gram panchayat member, alleging his involvement in the killing. 																								On the basis of the complaint, Joynagar police arrested Asgar Gaji. As they were returning with him to the police station, a group of SUCI activists attacked the policemen and spirited him away. 																								Niladri Chakroborty, Joynagar sub-divisional police officer, said a massive hunt is on to track down Saidullah and Gaji. 																								Meena played an active role during last months panchayat polls and this infuriated Saidullah, who threatened her to quit the CPM, said an official of Joynagar police station.																								Once his threats proved futile, Saidullah chalked out a plan to kill his wife in connivance with professional killers.

 Friday, July 18, 2003 				 Fear on back seat, Anjali knocks rights panel door
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 18: Anjali Haldar, the woman who was tortured and tonsured for her alleged involvement with her childrens tutor and threatened not to take the legal route, approached the state human rights commission today seeking action against the offenders.																								The woman, a mother of two, from Sonarpur in South 24-Parganas met the MP from her area, Mamata Banerjee, at her Harish Chatterjee Street residence. 																								Anjali and her children were assaulted by a mob allegedly comprising CPM cadre and members of a local club on July 3. They blamed her for ruining the tutors marriage. Her parents were not spared either by the gang led by the wife of the tutor, Prabin Mallick.																								The mother was thrown into a pond along with her children, pulled out, stripped, tonsured and paraded.																								Anjalis father Kalipada Mondol lodged an FIR with the Sonarpur police station mentioning the names of 14 people. The police claimed to have detained 10 people but Mondol said he had named none of them in his complaint. The police refused to disclose the names of those arrested.																								Tired of the endless wait for justice and police inaction, the father and daughter decided to move the rights panel.																								Some local CPM leaders, however, went to their house yesterday and, among other things, threatened them against approaching the commission.																								 Accompanied by some Trinamul Congress leaders of Sonarpur, Kalipada and Anjali went to the commissions office at Bhabani Bhavan this afternoon. 																								The commission chairman was not present and we handed over the complaint to an employee at the office, who assured me that they were aware of the incident and they would contact us soon, Mondol said.																								Mamata Banerjee told us that her party would launch a movement against the goons who tortured my daughter. She said she was shocked at what at happened, Mondol said after his meeting with the Trinamul chief. 																								Mamata heard from Anjali about her ordeal but got busy in a party meeting later and her reaction to the horror tale and the alleged involvement of a section of the CPM was not known.

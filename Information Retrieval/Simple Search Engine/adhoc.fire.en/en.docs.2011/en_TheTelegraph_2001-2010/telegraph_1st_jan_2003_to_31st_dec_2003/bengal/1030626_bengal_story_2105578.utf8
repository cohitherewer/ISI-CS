The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Thursday, June 26, 2003 				 Insect boy on way to SSKM 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Burdwan, June 25: Parents of Chandan Goswami, the boy suffering from myiasis, today got him discharged from the medical college hospital here and set off for Calcutta to admit him to the urology department of SSKM hospital. 																								Faced with pressure from Chandans family, who alleged that the doctors could not do anything even after keeping the 13-year-old under observation and treatment for 18 days, the seven-member medical board met this morning and released him. 																								Since Chandans admission on June 7, 13 insects, resembling flies but still unidentified, have flown out of the perforation in the boys crotch on four occasions. The doctors performed several clinical examinations, including a cystoscopy, which yielded no result.																								Tamal Ghosh, Chandans uncle accompanying the family to Calcutta, said the hospital had handed over only the discharge certificate. They have not got the papers relating to the treatment he received and the tests done on him. 																								It seems Chandan left the hospital with bitter memories. Last night one of the doctors told me my son had gone mad. He asked us to take him away and chastised me for wasting their time, said Alpana, Chandans mother. Ghosh said the doctors were not taking proper care of the boy, who lay writhing in pain last night. 																								Chandan suffered an internal injury during the cystoscopy and has been passing blood with his urine. But doctors said such injuries were not uncommon during the procedure.

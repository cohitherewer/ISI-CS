 Thursday, December 04, 2003 				 Ration officer in bribe trap 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Barasat, Dec. 3: A food inspector was suspended after police caught him taking a bribe from a ration shop owner in his office at Basirhat in North 24-Parganas this afternoon. The state vigilance wing has taken up the case. 																								Gurupada Guin was working as food inspector in the Swarupnagar area of Bashirhat for the last two years and used to take money regularly from ration shop owners and kerosene dealers, said deputy superintendent of the district enforcement branch Amiya Chakraborty. 																								He used to tell them that he would arrange for extra stock of kerosene and foodgrains if they gave him cash. Later he asked the suppliers to provide additional quantities of foodgrains to the dealers who satisfied him, said Chakrabarty. 																								Officials said Guin used to threaten suppliers with cancellation of their licence if the additional foodgrains did not reach the chosen dealers. 																								Yesterday, Guin asked Manju Roy, a ration shop owner, to pay him Rs 5,000 to get extra supply of foodgrains. He again called her in the afternoon and demanded the money. Scared, Manju contacted her husband, who lodged a complaint with the district magistrate. 																								I asked the vigilance wing and the enforcement branch to look into the matter. The block development officer of the area was also asked to accompany the team, said H.K. Dwibedi, the district magistrate. 																								The team laid a trap for Guin using Manju and he was caught red-handed  literally, as a chemical applied to the notes Manju gave him had left a red mark on his fingers. 																								Realising he was trapped, Guin broke down and confessed to the crime. He was further interrogated for possible involvement in other rackets, said the district magistrate.

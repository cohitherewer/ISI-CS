 Monday, November 10, 2003 				 Residents lock up excise boss 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, Nov. 9: Two excise officers were kept confined for several hours in the district town while apparently conducting raids on illegal liquor outlets.																								A large police contingent rescued the officers from the residents of Nirmal Jheel and Parshikhana who alleged that they worked in collusion with the illegal liquor outlets.																								About seven months ago, residents of the same localities tied three constables to a tree when they allegedly came to collect bribe from the liquor shop owners. The policemen were later suspended.																								The raids were an eye-wash. The shops had become their source of income, a resident said about the excise officers.																								Agitated residents surrounded the team of 14 officers as soon as it arrived. Sensing trouble, 12 officers sped away. But Swapan Mukherjee, the officer-in-charge of the district unit of the excise department and Gour Mohan Pathak, a sub-inspector, were caught. The duo was put under lock and key in a shop.

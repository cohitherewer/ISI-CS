 OUR BUREAU 																								Calcutta, July 9: The Trinamul Congress today pardoned one legislator who had spoken out against the partys decision to boycott the Assembly as a mark of protest against the CPMs terror and suspended another for defying the directive. 																								Suspended Tamluk MLA Dipak Ghosh today called up Mamata Banerjee and regretted his letter criticising the boycott decision. 																								On the other hand, Sibdas Mukherjee, MLA from Krishnagar East, was suspended after he not only attended the Assembly, but even demanded a probe into the unnatural death of a police officer at Krishnagar yesterday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Fake marks for govt jobs under probe 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Dec. 29: More than a thousand people have allegedly obtained government jobs in Murshidabad using fake SC/ST and other backward classes certificates.																								The papers of a dozen employees have been cancelled, a government spokesman said today. Alarmed at reports of irregularities, Pankaj Narayan Samaddar, the assistant secretary of the backward class development department, arrived here this morning to conduct an inquiry.																								Samaddar said: We have received a complaint from the district administration saying some people are applying for jobs with forged certificates for the past few years. Though we have already cancelled 12 such certificates on the basis of an inquiry, no legal action has been taken against any of the employees. 																								The officer from Calcutta said he has asked additional district magistrate Nishith Kumar Das to lodge an FIR against all 12 employees within a week. I have also asked the administration to complete the probe against 248 other employees by January 31. It seems that a section of government officials is backing the errant employees, Samaddar said.																								Tapan Mondal, a North Bengal State Transport Corporation employee, charged with submitting fake certificates, refused comment saying a probe is on.

 Sunday, October 26, 2003 				 Question sale sack for lecturer
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 																								Calcutta, Oct. 25: A lecturer of Vidyasagar University in East Midnapore and his accomplice, a Group-D employee, have been arrested and sacked for selling question papers to undergraduate students. 																								Two other teachers in colleges at Contai and Bajkul, affiliated to the same university, are being investigated for the same offence. 																								Reflecting the shock of the Left Front government, higher education secretary Jawhar Sircar said the administration was determined to put an end to the organised racket which has been trying to tarnish the image of our educational institutions. 																								Pritviraj Roy, a political science teacher of Vidyasagar University, was caught red-handed taking Rs 500 from a student in lieu of question papers. A joint team of CID and university officials had laid the trap using a student after learning that the teacher was in the habit of selling question papers. 																								Sircar said Roy was dismissed from service after the administration was convinced of his direct involvement in the sale of question papers. We will take similar drastic action against the two lecturers of Contai and Bajkul colleges on the charge of selling physics question papers soon after the CID submits the chargesheet, he said. 																								A senior official of the higher education department said: We got a specific complaint from a student of Vidyasagar University in the first week of September that the concerned teacher was selling political science question papers for prices ranging from Rs 500 to 1,000. After a few days, we received similar allegations from two other students studying in the Contai and Bajkul colleges about leakage of physics papers. We persuaded the students to lodge complaints with the university as well as the local police after assuring them that their identity would not be revealed. 																								The local police and university authorities started separate inquiries, but after a week, the case was handed over to the CID. The trap was then laid. 																								A student, engaged by the investigating team, approached Roy with five Rs 100 notes, specifically marked and smeared with chemicals to get the recipients fingerprints. 																								When the student contacted Roy, the latter asked him to meet him in a nearby eatery. When he was handing over the question papers after taking the money, CID officials in mufti arrested him. 																								As the professor was caught in the act of selling question papers and arrested, we had no option but to sack him. It is a criminal offence, Sircar said, promising similar steps against the other two teachers.

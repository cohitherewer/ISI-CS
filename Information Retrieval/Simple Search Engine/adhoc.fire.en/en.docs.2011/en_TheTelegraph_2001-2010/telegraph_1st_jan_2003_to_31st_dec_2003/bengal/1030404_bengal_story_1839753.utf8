 Friday, April 04, 2003 				 CPM cadre held for stripping woman 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Midnapore, April 3: A CPM member from Sucharbar village in East Midnapore district was arrested for stripping a woman and assaulting her. A hunt is on for 12 others, including eight women, involved in the incident. 																								Subal Pandit was held after the woman  recovering in the block primary health centre at Bhagabanpur after the outrage on Tuesday  filed an FIR. 																								The local CPM leadership denied any political angle to the incident. The woman had encroached upon a piece of land and was holding up the construction of a village road. The sub-divisional officer had set several dates for a meeting to sort out the problem, but she was resisting all efforts to solve the problem. She had a confrontation with the village women and there were no males involved in the incident, said Gourhari Bal, the CPM zonal committee secretary of Bhagabanpur. 																								The Congress and the Trinamul Congress, however, termed the incident as the CPMs routine tyranny in the villages in which women are also not spared. 																								Panchayat polls 																								The government, in consultation with the state election commission, today announced that the three-tier panchayat polls would be held in the state on May 11. A gazette notification issued during the day said polling will be held between 7 am and 5 pm.

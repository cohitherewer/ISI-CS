 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Malda, June 2: Two RSP workers were killed and three injured in separate incidents at Manikchak and Kaliachak in Malda in the past 24 hours, police and party officials said.																								The RSP blamed the CPM for the deaths. It was a planned attack on our workers by the CPM, district party secretary Gautam Gupta said. Supporters marched with the body of Sirajul Haque, 32, at Manikchak, demanding the arrest of the CPM cadre it blamed for the killing.																								Ramul Sheikh, 27, was hacked to death by alleged CPM supporters at Mianpara village in Kaliachak. The RSP said Sheikh was a party worker.																								Gupta said Haque and three other RSP supporters were returning from a party meeting at Balutolla village last night when CPM supporters attacked them. Before our men could do anything, the goons carrying guns and bombs shot Sirajul. Some of our men were injured in the bombs hurled at them.																								District superintendent of police Pankaj Dutta said Haque was killed in a clash between two groups at Balutolla over plucking corns. He said five persons were arrested in this connection. 																								Dutta said a police picket was posted in the village following tension after the killing. The situation is under control.																								The police blamed the killing of Sheikh on a land dispute. It has nothing to do with politics,a senior officer said.																								Gupta said: The police arrived three hours after the incident and arrested five of our (RSP) supporters.																								Sushil Sinha, the CPMs Manikchak zonal committee leader, accused the RSP of stirring up trouble in the area.

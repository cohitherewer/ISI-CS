 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 Amin shares brew burden
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Dec. 19: Labour  minister Mohammed Amin today alleged that tea at cheap rates  was being brought from Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Kenya and  exported as Darjeeling tea. 																								This, Amin said at Writers Buildings, is one of the main reasons for the crisis that the tea industry in our state is now facing. I will take up the matter with the chief minister. 																								Amin maintained that none of the tea estates had been closed down due to labour unrest. An expert committee headed by commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen is examining the various aspects of the crisis, and will place its report shortly to the government. 																								We are waiting for the report after which the government will discuss the measures to be taken, he said. 																								Fifteen estates in north Bengal have closed down and nine are lying abandoned. About 15,000 workers are involved in the affected tea gardens. The government has taken up as many as 56 rural development schemes for the benefit of the affected people.																								The government has offered Rs 1.81 lakh for workers of gardens in Jalpaiguri, Amin said. In addition, 48 health camps have been opened in Jalpaiguri and 25 tube-wells have been dug by the public health engineering department in the gardens that have been closed. 																								Special medical teams from the health department are also visiting the beleaguered gardens in Darjeeling. 																								The state labour department is giving Rs 500 per head per month to workers of three abandoned gardens  one in Jalpaiguri and two in Darjeeling  under the Scheme for Financial Assistance to the Workers in Locked-out Industrial Units. Five more closed gardens will be covered under the scheme soon, the minister said. 																								Due to the ongoing crisis, the government has also reduced the rate of agriculture income tax from 45 per cent to 30 per cent from 2003-04 in order to grant concessions to the tea industries. 																								The salami payable at Rs 15,000 per hectare for transfer of tea gardens has been reduced to Rs 9,000 per hectare for the period ending March 31, 2004.

 Sunday, December 14, 2003 				 Quack held for death of pregnant teenager
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Islampur, Dec. 13: Police  have arrested a man for killing the teenage sister of his  daughter-in-law and detained his son who had allegedly got  the girl pregnant.																								Halima Khatun, 13, died yesterday when her sisters father-in-law, Fazirath Haq, operated upon her to terminate her pregnancy.																								Khatun was staying in her sisters residence in Goalpukur police station area for the last seven months and allegedly had an affair with her brother-in-law, Sajjad Khan. When she became pregnant, Haq was eager to suppress the news and operated upon her a fortnight ago to remove the five-month-old foetus.																								The girls condition deteriorated after the abortion and she was rushed to hospital on November 28, where she died yesterday.																								Yesterday, Khatuns father, Hakimuddin, lodged an FIR with the Goalpukur police station. He has named Haq and his son in the FIR on the basis of which we arrested the two, said subdivisional police officer Utpal Naskar said.																								When I learnt of my daughters condition, I told Haq that I would consult trained medical professionals of the health department for safe abortion and had warned him not to take any drastic step. But he refused and, as a result, my minor daughter had to pay with her life, alleged Hakimuddin.																								Haq and his son were produced before the Islampur subdivisional judicial magistrate today and have been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.																								Khatuns body has been sent for post mortem.

 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Tea funds fuelled KLO machinery, say militants
 ANUPAM DASGUPTA Siliguri, Dec. 22: The  interrogation of Pabitra Singha, Tom Adhikary and Milton  Burma has revealed that the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation  (KLO) thrived on regular contributions, which reached  the outfits Bhutan camps, from a section of tea merchants  here. 																								Siliguri police interrogated the militants, arrested by the Royal Bhutan Army and handed over to the Jalpaiguri police on Saturday, for nearly three hours at the Jalpaiguri kotwali police station. The police have information that at least six tea garden owners regularly contributed to the KLO coffers. 																								Sources said the KLOs targets included a businessmen who owns a tea garden at Rajgunj on the outskirts of Siliguri. He used to pay Rs 1 lakh to the KLO annually. The owner of a foreign goods shop at Bidhan Market, who also owns a small estate at Rajgunj, had to fork out Rs 10,000 every month. 																								The KLO also set varying rates for two other traders operating in Jhankar More and Mahanandapara of Siliguri. These businessmen reportedly paid Rs 15,000 each annually to the militants. Another tea merchant, who owned a garden at Dhopahaat, had to fork out Rs 10,000 every year. 																								The names of the businessmen are kept secret for the sake of investigation. 																								We are trying to get details of how the money reached the KLO camps located on the Bhutan hills. Initial information suggests that the money was routed through couriers who visited the targets from time to time. We are also trying to ferret out information on the whereabouts of five militants still at large, who had fled their Kharibari homes to join the KLO. Suderlal Singha, Goutam Singha, Manchalal Singha, Animesh Rabha and two others became trained KLO cadre after they fled to the camps in Bhutan, Darjeeling superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said. 																								Sources said the money from the businessmen was mostly collected by Chiranjeet Roy and Bablu Adhikary  two trained militants still at large  who acted as couriers. 																								In most cases, Roy and Adhikary acted at the behest of Pabitra, Tom, and Pulastha Das, said a senior north Bengal police officer. 																								We are also trying to find out whether the trio has made any new recruitment for the KLO from this region. They would also be interrogated about two kidnappings that they had plotted in and around Siliguri, Mishra added. 																								The KLO top three was wanted here in three cases. The charges vary from murder and looting to conspiring against the state.

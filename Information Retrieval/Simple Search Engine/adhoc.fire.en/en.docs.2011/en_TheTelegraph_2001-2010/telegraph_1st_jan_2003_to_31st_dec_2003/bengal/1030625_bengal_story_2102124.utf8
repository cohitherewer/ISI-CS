The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, June 25, 2003 				 Finally, city shift for insect boy
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Burdwan, June 24: The boy  whose body has been the breeding ground of insects can hope  for some relief from inquisitive outsiders, students and  doctors, flocking his bedside at the Burdwan Medical College  Hospital for a glimpse of a rare case .																								After 17 days of fruitless efforts to rid him of the bizarre ailment, the medical college authorities have decided on shifting 13-year-old Chandan Goswami to Calcutta.																								Insects had been popping out of a perforation in Chandans crotch and pupating. The condition, known as myiasis, is common in animals in south and central America.																								We are thinking on the lines of referring Chandan to a suitable hospital in Calcutta. The medical board formed to monitor his treatment will meet tomorrow and decide when we can release him, said Sarit Chowdhury, the superintendent of the hospital.																								Where exactly Chandan will be shifted will be known tomorrow. We can no longer keep him here to give him the kind of medical attention he needs. He will be sent to a hospital in Calcutta that has good urology and surgery departments, Chowdhury said.																								About three weeks ago, the boy from Birbhum had discovered that insects were emerging from his crotch and taking wings. 																								Several insects have emerged from Chandans body since then. Medical circles have differed on the identity of the insect. Calcuttas School of Tropical Medicine has labelled it as a species of the rove beetle and entomologists at Burdwan University have called it a type of fly.																								Subjected to a series of tests and without any relief from the pain in his lower abdomen, Chandan has turned weak and emotionally unstable. Doctors and students from the medical college and the university here have quizzed Chandan far too often for his liking. 																								The doctors have said my son will be discharged tomorrow and after that he will be admitted to Calcutta Medical College Hospital, said Chandans mother Alpana Goswami.																								The hospital had issued a discharge certificate but medical college principal Bijoy Mukherjee stalled the move.																								A medical board has been formed officially and its members will take the decision to discharge the patient or to refer him elsewhere. If he is shifted, details of his treatment and tests will have to be handed over, Mukherjee said.

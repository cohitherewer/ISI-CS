 Friday, February 14, 2003 				 Police draw up spy case charges
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Behrampore, Feb. 13: Three days before the deadline was to expire, Murshidabad police filed charges against eight persons arrested in November, accusing them of working as agents for the Pakistani Inter Services Intelligence.																								Chargesheets have been filed before the sub-divisional judicial magistrate against nine persons, including one who is still eluding the police net. Our investigation into the case has produced hard evidence that all of them were closely linked with the ISI and worked for the agency against the interests of India, said additional superintendent of police Shankar Singh. 																								The charges framed against the nine are mostly to do with waging war against the country.																								On November 17, the police had picked up Ziauddin Biswas, his wife Ismatara and brother-in-law Hasan Habib from Durlabherpara village in the Jalangi police station area. The same night, Ghulam Murtaza was arrested from Kuchiamora village in the Domkal police station area.																								After prolonged interrogation of the quartet, a series of arrests followed. 																								The air force police detained data operator Aufan Ukil from its base in Pune. He was brought here for questioning. An army jawan, Nazrul Islam, was summoned here by a joint team of the police and army intelligence and put under arrest. 																								Islam was later taken away to his regimental headquarters for court-martial.																								Soon after, two ex-armymen were picked up from Jalangi and Imdadul Mondol was rounded up from his village in Nadia districts Hogolbari police station area. Pintu Ahmed was picked up from Ziauddins village. 																								Ismataras brother, Samsuzzaman Biswas alias Happy, however, remained out of the polices reach. The police seized all of Happys movable property from his house in Durlabherpara village last month.																								The officers investigating the case said Happy has fled to Dhaka, where he has been provided shelter by alleged ISI operations chief Aamir Bhai.																								The eight already arrested are in the Behrampore Central Jail. We have succeeded in submitting the chargesheets before the court within the mandatory 90 days and the trial will now begin. We believe the charges are such that none of them will be able to secure bail, said a senior district intelligence officer.																								Ismataras mother Hosniara Begum had sought custody of her two-year-old grandson Arian from the court. Arians grandparents had petitioned the court that Ismatara had lost her mental balance and was incapable of caring for her child. 																								She had turned violent once and tried to force floor-cleaning chemicals down Arians throat. The court has asked the jail authorities to submit a medical report with details of Ismataras health by February 19.

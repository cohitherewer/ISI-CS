The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, June 03, 2003 				 New HS amp; Madhyamik syllabi from next year
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 2: The higher secondary council has finalised plans to implement its new syllabi from the 2004 academic session.																								The decision was taken at a meeting of the council members today. The council had begun an extensive exercise last year to update the entire higher secondary syllabi. It set up a committee for the purpose. 																								The council had announced last month that the new syllabi would be implemented from next year but the recommendations of the committee were formally accepted at todays meeting.																								The recasting of the syllabi was aimed at establishing uniformity in the contents of the course taught by the council and those offered by others like the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ISC). 																								President of the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education Jyotirmoy Mukherjee said the revised syllabus for each subject will be distributed to authorised publishers this month. The printing will be complete before the start of the next academic session.																								The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, which had undertaken an exercise to upgrade the Madhyamik syllabi, made a similar announcement today. The new Madhyamik syllabi would be implemented from next year. Officials in the board said the process of revising the course contents was complete. 																								Sources in the council said the members also decided to make a fresh appeal to the government to speed up the process of amending the council Act so that it can play a bigger role in punishing negligent and corrupt examiners. The Council will urge the government to take stern action against the two teachers in North 24-Parganas who were arrested last week on charges of increasing marks of two HS examinees in exchange of money.

 Tuesday, February 25, 2003 				 Front bags one more civic board
 UTTAM DUTTA																								Champdani (Hooghly), Feb. 24: Another municipal board held by the Congress-Trinamul Congress combine tumbled today when a CPM-led front won a no-confidence motion against chairman Bhagawan Dutta Tewari. 																								The CPM won 13 votes, including two Independents, in the 22-member board. A Trinamul member was absent during voting as he is in custody for allegedly torturing his wife. Tewari, a close associate of local Congress MLA Abdul Mannan, was at the helm of Champdani municipality and Trinamuls Pradyut Chakraborty his deputy. 																								The alliance had earlier lost the Hooghly-Chinsurah, Bansberia and Konnagar municipalities in the district to the Left Front. 																								Observers saw the Congress-Trinamul combines loss of the civic body here as a major setback at a time when preparations had just begun for the panchayat polls in May.																								The front tabled the motion after Tewari was accused of signing a forged document to help a party commissioner get a ration shop last month. The original owner of the ration shop had lodged an FIR against Tewari with the Bhadreswar police station.																								Still smarting under the humiliation, Tewari alleged that the CPM had bribed the two Independents to dislodge us from power. We feel ashamed at the way the CPM misused them to grab power.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Baisnabnagar (Malda), Jan. 4: A mystery fever has claimed at least 10 lives at Pardeonapur village in the Baisnabnagar police station area over the past fortnight. The patients complained of sudden high temperature and acute headache and, in most cases, died within 48 hours of the attack. 																								Clueless and panic-struck as more similar complaints are pouring in, doctors in the village are referring the patients and fresh cases to the Malda district hospital for in-depth diagnosis and specialised treatment. The afflicted people have also been admitted to hospitals in Jangipur and Dhulian.																								Gram panchayat pradhan Radheshyam Sarkar said that among the dead was a boy studying in Class VIII in the Pardeonapur High Madarsa. Four areas in the village are the worst affected. Most of the patients are coming from Char Sumapur, Shahipara, Sukpara and from the area around the local post office. The fever has struck people mostly in the age group of 20 to 50 years, Sarkar added. 																								The district health set-up has reacted only recently, but 20 more persons with the mystery fever are reported to have taken admission in various health centres. We are sending a panel of doctors to the area to assess the situation, said Ashok Banerjee, the districts chief medical officer.

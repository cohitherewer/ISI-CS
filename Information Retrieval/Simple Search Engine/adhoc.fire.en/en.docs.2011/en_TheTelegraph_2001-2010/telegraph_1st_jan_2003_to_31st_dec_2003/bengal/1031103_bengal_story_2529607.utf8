 Monday, November 03, 2003 				 Trinamul helping hand for Congress
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, Nov. 2: Trinamul Congress legislator from Krishnagar (East) Sibdas Mukherjee first helped the Congress select a candidate for the municipal elections. Now, he is planning to campaign for the party. 																								It is apparent that Mukherjee wants the Congress to win the November 30 municipal polls, said a Trinamul leader of Nadia. A note on his anti-party activities has been sent to party chief Mamata Banerjee, he added. 																								Its a sad development when elections are round the corner. We shall discuss it in the partys state council meeting on Wednesday, Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said in Calcutta. Mukherjee was suspended from Trinamul for defying Mamatas whip to boycott the Assemblys budget session. But he continues to be a party MLA. 																								We had asked the Speaker to take necessary action against him, said leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee. Mamata had asked party MLAs to boycott the session to protest against the CPMs reign of terror. 																								Nadia Congress president Sankar Singh said: Mukherjee is in a position to help our party. He knows the people of his constituency. The MLA saw nothing unusual in what he was doing. I was a Congress MLA earlier. I cannot sit idle when I see Trinamul has no role to play. Every party, barring Trinamul, has finalised candidates. Two Trinamul councillors are already in the fray as Congress nominees, he said.

 Monday, July 21, 2003 				 Tar on suicide family 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Ranaghat (Nadia), July 20:  A mother of two, Pampa Sarkar, burnt her children to death  this morning before setting herself ablaze. 																								Residents of the neighbourhood here then barged into her house, dragged out the in-laws and beat them up. 																								Pampa doused daughter Bubai, 2, and her year-old son Bachan in kerosene and torched them. On noticing the smoke, the neighbours rushed. By the time they broke open the door and entered the room, it was too late, said a local police officer. 																								This is the second time in two years that a girl has committed suicide in this household. They bully and torture their daughters-in-law, alleged Ganesh Paul, a neighbour. Pampas husband, Kuntal, was out of town on business today. His brothers wife had consumed acid two years ago. 																								The police rescued Kamal Sarkar and his family members today but one of his sons, Rana, had to be hospitalised. When our men arrived after receiving a call from Soma Sil, one of Pampas sisters-in-law, they saw the family members being assaulted. Her mother-in-law, Nilima, was tied to a post, said subdivisional police officer Arnab Ghosh. Pampa has left a suicide note saying no one is responsible for her death. We cannot start a case unless her parents lodge a complaint, he added.

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY																								Calcutta, April 7: Sahara India Pariwar has roped in former West Bengal chief secretary Manish Gupta to head its operations in the state.																								Gupta, who retired in November 2001, is awaiting the Union governments clearance to join Sahara Commercial Corporation as president. The company has plans to turn five islands in the Sundarbans into international tourist destinations.

The former chief secretary confirmed the development and told The Telegraph that he was awaiting the Centres clearance, which is mandatory for an Indian Administrative Services officer taking up a private-sector job within two years of retirement. The state government has forwarded his proposal for joining Sahara Pariwar and the company would make a public announcement as soon as the Centres clearance is obtained, Gupta said.																								The Sahara group, with an asset base of Rs 50,000 crore, plans to invest nearly Rs 1,000 crore in an integrated tourism circuit starting with the Sundarban islands.

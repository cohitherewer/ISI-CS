 Sunday, June 01, 2003 				 Sarfaraz family hits the streets in cry for justice
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Siliguri, May 31: The administrations attitude regarding the probe into Sarfaraz Hussains death has forced his family to hit the streets.																								The family, backed by the Siliguri unit of the Association for the Protection of Democratic Rights, the Siliguri Welfare Organisation and a host of other social organisations, took out a procession today to voice their demand for justice.																								The body of the six-and-a-half-year-old boy was exhumed last Saturday and a post-mortem conducted after the boys family lodged an FIR on May 17, accusing six staff, including four doctors of the Siliguri sub-divisional hospital, of negligence.																								The boy died of septicaemia on May 10, as mentioned in the death certificate. Based on the FIR, police registered a case under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code.																								The boys family slammed the hospitals deplorable conditions. Deplorable conditions at the Siliguri sub-divisional hospital and negligence of the doctors there led to the death of Sarfaraz. The guilty doctors and nursing staff have to be brought to book immediately, screamed a placard.																								Arrest the murderers who masquerade as doctors, said another.																								Shouting slogans and carrying placards with Sarfarazs picture, a 400-strong procession of men, women and children walked the main thoroughfare of the town this afternoon taking commuters and residents by surprise.																								The procession had the right impact. The rally was our way to reach our quest for justice to the people. And also to let people know how shabbily patients like Sarfaraz are being treated in the Siliguri sub-divisional hospital, said a 17-year-old girl who participated in the rally.																								Sarfarazs father, Nurul Islam, who led the rally, urged people of this north Bengal trade hub to join his familys fight for justice.																								We want the people of Siliguri to join us. Let no other family suffer the same fate as that of Sarfaraz. We have given enough time to the local police and health officials to come out with the findings of their probes, Islam said.																								Our agitation will continue till our demands are fulfilled. The doctors and the nurses who are responsible for the death of my son should be given exemplary punishment.																								We have taken so much trouble  we even had to convince our community to exhume the body of our son 14 days after his death  just in the hope that this would lead the investigation in the right direction. But we have been disillusioned by the administration. We had to run from pillar to post for three days just to get a copy of the post-mortem report, he added.																								The organisations backing Islam have started a poster campaign. We have started putting up posters all over the town voicing our demands and seeking justice, Islam said.																								. If the local administration wants peace to prevail in the town, then they have to put their act together and bring the culprits to book. Till, then we will continue with our agitational programmes which besides, poster campaign, public rallies will include regular blockade of the main roads of the town, Islam said																								Todays rally was jointly organised by the Ranabustee Samaj Seva Samity, APDR, SWO and others. The aim is to make Siliguri residents aware of the laxity and apathetic attitude of the local administration in dealing with the probe. Neither the police nor the health department are taking the issue seriously. They are just buying time so that the case dies a natural death; something we will not let happen, Islam said.																								The organisations backing Islam have already started a poster campaign. We have started putting up posters all over the town voicing our demands and seeking justice. If the local administration wants peace to prevail in the town, then they have to put their act together and bring the culprits to book. Till, then we will continue with our agitational programmes which besides, poster campaign, public rallies will include regular blockade of the main roads of the town, Islam said.																								ends

 Monday, August 25, 2003 				 Texmaco opens after truce meet
 Calcutta, Aug. 24 (PTI):  Texmaco Limited today reopened the wagon division of its  Agarapara factory, about 20 km from here, lifting the suspension  of work order issued on Friday.																								The decision to reopen the unit in North 24-Parganas was arrived at yesterday following successful negotiations and an agreement between the management and three workers unions, a company spokesman said.																								The management had issued the suspension of work order at the unit because of labour indiscipline and excessive production cost rendering about 956 workers jobless.																								Citu-affiliated Texmaco workers union general secretary T.K. Tewari said today: The matter has been resolved through successful negotiations with due consideration of demands from both the management and the workers. 																								According to the agreement, the labour requirement in the two units of the wagon division would be reduced from 40 to 37 and from 30 to 27.																								The incentives for the workers would be increased from Rs 185 to Rs 560 every month, said Tewari.

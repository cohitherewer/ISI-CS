 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bandel, April 13: Passengers were robbed of most of their valuables when armed miscreants disguised as policemen stormed a reserved compartment of a Howrah-bound long distance train near Burdwan station and went on a looting spree early this morning.																								According to police, four assailants, wielding knives and revolvers, entered the Gaya Express between Burdwan and Memari and asked passengers to show their tickets and bags. We are policemen, they told a businessman and his son, and we have information that you are carrying contraband substances.																								Seventy-year-old Bhushan Modi and his son Sarwan, 27, tried to reason with them but the miscreants dragged the elder of the two out of the compartment and attacked him with a knife. Having trussed and locked Bhushan in the toilet, the four fell on Sarwan and took away Rs 50,000 from his bag. As the train slowed down near Memari station, the robbers fled with the loot.

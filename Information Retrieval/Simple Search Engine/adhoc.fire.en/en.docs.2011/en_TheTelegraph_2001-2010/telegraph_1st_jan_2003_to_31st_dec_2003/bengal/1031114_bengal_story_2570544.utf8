 Friday, November 14, 2003 				 Boy wakes up to lifeless mother
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Krishnagar, Nov. 13: He was surprised to see his mothers throat wound in her sari this morning. He was even more surprised when she did not respond to his calls. He was scared when an army of ants marched out of her ears and nostrils when he tried to shove her out of sleep.																								Five-year-old Aloke Mondal ran to the only other person he knew in the locality they had shifted to two months ago. Tears rolling down, he knocked at their landlords door in Shantipur, 75 km from Calcutta, 																								The landlord informed local councillor China Das, who called up the chairman of the Shantipur municipality, Ajoy De. It was De who called police. 																								Purnima Mondal was apparently strangulated. The police said a local goon who allegedly had an affair with her and frequently visited the house was the likely culprit. Neighbours said Uttam Malakar visited the house, held drinking sessions and abused Purnima. We questioned the boy. Aloke said last night Uttam was there watching cricket on TV, said an official of Shantipur police station. Uttam is absconding.																								Additional superintendent of police Pallab Kanti Ghosh said Purnimas husband Asim, a bus driver, rarely stayed in Shantipur. Taking advantage of his absence, the local antisocial used to visit Purnima. 																								Initially, Ghosh said, the woman was too scared to raise her voice. Of late, she had started protesting.

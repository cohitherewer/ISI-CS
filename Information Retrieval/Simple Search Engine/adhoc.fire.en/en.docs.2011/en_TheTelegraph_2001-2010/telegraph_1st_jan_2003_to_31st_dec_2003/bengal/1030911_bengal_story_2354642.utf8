 Thursday, September 11, 2003 				 Teachers fined for exam form slip-up
 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN 																								Trimohini (Murshidabad), Sept. 10: A school managing committee and local political leaders have slapped heavy fines on teachers after revelation that five students failed in this years Madhyamik examinations because they made mistakes in filling the examination forms. 																								Three assistant teachers of Trimohini High Madarsa School, deemed to be the main accused, were called to a meeting on Sunday and fined Rs 50,000 each, while their colleagues were fined Rs 5,000 each. The non-teaching staff too has been penalised  they have to pay Rs 2,000 each. 																								The meeting, convened by managing committee president and Forward Bloc leader Tofazzul Mollah, was attended by Congress panchayat pradhan Abdur Rashid and CPM panchayat member Mozammal Mondal. 																								When the teachers protested against the ruling, shoes and chappals were hurled at them and they were forced to sign an undertaking that they would pay the fine. 																								The students of the madarsa had opted for Arabic as the compulsory subject and advanced Arabic as the additional one. While helping about 50 students fill in their madarsa Madhyamik exam forms, the teachers, by mistake, put down the more difficult advanced Arabic as the compulsory subject. Five students could not cope and failed in the exam. An inquiry revealed that the mistakes were made in the forms by the teachers, said a managing committee member. 																								District inspector of schools (Madhyamik) Subhendu Ghosh admitted that there was a furore over the failure of the five students. 																								The headmaster of the school met me yesterday evening and told me about the fines imposed on teachers at Trimohini. I will inform my superiors in the education department. We know about the outcry over the failure of five students and the mistakes in the exam forms. However, only the madarsa board can help rectify the mistakes, said Ghosh. 																								Headmaster Nazrul Islam said the five students have claimed that they could have cleared the Madhyamik examination if there was no mistake in filling the forms. 																								When the results came out in May this year, I wrote three letters to the madarsa board requesting them to rectify the mistakes in the forms and help the five students pass. We also contacted the president and the secretary of the board and requested them verbally. But the board refused to do anything about it, he added.

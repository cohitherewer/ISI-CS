 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Purulia, Feb. 19: Thundershowers accompanied by hailstorm in the afternoon led to extended power cuts in most parts of Purulia today. Though the situation is not uncommon here, residents in many areas voiced protest as they could not watch the live telecast of the India-Zimbabwe World Cup match.																								Overcast skies opened up around 4.30 pm after Indias innings. Heavy rain and hail affected power supply not only in Purulia town, but also in Adra, Kashipur, Manbazar, Puncha and Barabazar.

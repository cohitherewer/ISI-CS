 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Burdwan, June 17: The fly that invaded Chandan Goswamis body has been identified as a species of the rove beetle but doctors attending to him at the medical college hospital here have not been able to make headway beyond that.																								Today, Chandan was subjected to another round of tests and wheeled to the operation theatre for a cystoscopy of the urinary tract. The test did not reveal any abnormality. The tract was washed to flush out the flies that could still be there.

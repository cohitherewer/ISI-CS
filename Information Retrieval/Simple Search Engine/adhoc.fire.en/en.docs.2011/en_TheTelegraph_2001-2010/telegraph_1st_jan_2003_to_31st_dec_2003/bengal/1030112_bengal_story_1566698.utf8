The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Sunday, January 12, 2003 				 Revenge, cry Naxalites 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Durgapur, Jan. 11: Twelve Naxalite factions organised a protest meeting at Kendra village in the Pandabeswar police station area here today against police failure to arrest the culprits behind the killing of CPI(M-L) leader Ganesh Pal. 																								Pal was gunned down on Wednesday evening by assailants allegedly linked to the CPM. Though the CPM has denied its involvement, the Naxalite factions insisted on the partys role in the murder, especially as the police have remained inactive. 																								Police sources said about five thousand people attended the meeting with cries for revenge. We are giving the police a weeks time to take proper steps in nabbing the culprits. If they fail to do so by January 17, we will start a continuous agitation to compel the police to nab the culprits. Besides, we will try to find out the murderers by ourselves, said Sunil Pal, CPI(M-L) district secretary. 																								The Naxalites also gave a deputation to the divisional intelligence officer and the officer-in-charge of the Pandabeswar police station to expedite the investigation and arrest the murderers immediately. 																								On the other hand, the CPM has lodged an FIR with the local police, stating that two of its supporters, Krishna Singh and Shanta Singh, were missing. They hinted that their supporters might have been killed in a retaliatory attack by the Naxalites.																								Pre-paid taxi booth																								The West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation will open the long-awaited pre-paid taxi booth at the New Jalpaiguri railway station on January 17, making life a lot less miserable for tourists to the hills.

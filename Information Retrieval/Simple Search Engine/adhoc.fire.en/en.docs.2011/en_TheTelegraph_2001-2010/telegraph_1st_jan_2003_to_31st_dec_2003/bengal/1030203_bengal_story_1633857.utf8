 Monday, February 03, 2003 				 Pull-down drive in Howrah park
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Howrah, Feb. 2: The civic authorities in the city today evicted nearly 5,000 illegal settlers living at the 93-bigha Belilious Park.																								Many of those who lived in the park  adjacent to the Tikiapara station  worked as sweepers at the Howrah Municipal Corporation. Some of them had been living there for about two-and-a-half decades.																								Though a section of the encroachers had snatched loudspeakers and microphones from policemen announcing Sundays eviction two days ago, there was no resistance today. 																								Around 9 am, a large police force led by additional superintendent (town) Rahul Srivastava descended on the area with corporation officials armed with pay-loaders and bulldozers led by sub-assistant engineer Tarak Dutta. A fleet of 50 trucks was ready to carry the debris. 																								Seeing the police, the encroachers gradually moved out.																								Officials said they were planning to build three shopping complexes on a portion of the park. The civic body could earn Rs 12 lakh every year as rent from the markets. The rest of the park would be beautified.

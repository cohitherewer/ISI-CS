 AVIJIT NANDI MAJUMDAR																								Calcutta, March 3: A member of Nepals Young Communists League  a frontal organisation of the Maoists in the Himalayan Kingdom  Ram Charan Shresta is co-ordinating the outfits city operations, said officers in the state intelligence branch.																								The YCL is waging an armed campaign against the monarchy in Nepal and wants to replace the democratic government there, they said.																								Sleuths swooped down on a house in South 24-Parganas today and detained two Maoist suspects. They were active members and office-bearers of the YCL, the officers said.																								The intelligence branch said it has evidence to prove that the YCL activists had collected a huge amount of money from Nepali businessmen in the city. We have seized three diaries from key suspects with names of the businessmen they had been extorting. The documents show the YCL had collected Rs 28 lakh in the past two years, a senior intelligence officer said.																								The organisation had recruited 15 Nepali youths, mostly working in restaurants and private firms here, and sent them to Nepal through the Muzaffarnagar border in Bihar on February 23, the officers added.																								Intelligence officials arrested two alleged Maoist activists from Tiljala and Hooghly yesterday and recovered several incriminating documents from the houses where they were staying. 																								The sleuths had trapped the city secretary of the YCL, Harish Giri, in Howrah on Wednesday night. Three of his associates, Nayan Singh, Balbahadur Beka and Bhimbahadur Beka, were picked up later. With help from the Howrah, Hooghly and South 24-Parganas police, the intelligence branch detained 10 youths suspected to have connections with the YCL.																								The police said about 12 YCL activists are now in the custody of the intelligence branch. A senior officer said the YCL activists have been arrested on charges of working against the monarchy in Nepal and carrying out efforts in the city and suburbs to destabilise the kingdom.																								Quoting investigation reports and documents seized from the raids, the intelligence officer said Shresta and his men would target young Nepalis in the city and its suburbs to rope them into the organisation. 																								The recruits were put through three weeks of motivation and inspiration classes.																								Giri and his associates had to ensure the commitment of the recruits. A select few were then inducted into the Sangharsh Samity, the militant arm of the YCL, the officer said. 																								Outside the city, the YCL has a branch in Midnapore.																								Nepalese consul-general Yuba Raj Bhusal was out of the city today but a consulate official answering the phone said on condition of anonymity that they are co-ordinating investigations with the intelligence and police personnel in the city.

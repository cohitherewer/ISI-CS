The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Tuesday, August 26, 2003 				 All but father charred in family
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Taherpur (Nadia), Aug. 25:  A mother and her children were burnt to death in a house  here, about 70 km from Calcutta, last night and two others,  including her husband, were injured.																								Police said Renuka Sarkar, her 10-year-old daughter Namita and 16-year-old son Subarno were sleeping in a room at Natunpara stacked with cloth, which caught fire. A lamp burning in the room apparently led to the blaze around 10 pm. 																								The husband, Sunil Sarkar, 45, was sleeping in another room and was said to have burnt himself in trying to rescue his family. Villagers said when they arrived near the room, alerted by Sunil, the mother and the children were badly burnt.																								The bodies were charred and we found another person, Sadhan Mullick, 20, critically injured. A group of neighbours took the bodies and the injured to a Shaktinagar hospital as another group tried to put out the fire, said Prabhat Roy, a resident of Natunpara.																								Police have begun a probe. A neighbour, Madhuri Biswas, told them that Sunil frequently tortured Renuka and had a younger wife, Urmila, who lived in a house close by.																								Nadia superintendent Benoy Chakraborty said the police had found traces of diesel in the rooms. He said the stacked cloth was part of the merchandise that Sunil sold in Fulia. 																								From initial inquiry, it seems Sunil did not make any attempt to rescue his wife and children. He will be arrested if his hand in the deaths is confirmed, Chakraborty said. Rape arrest																								Another man was put behind bars today on charges of rape after he promised to marry a woman but did not. 																								Rabindranath Das, 25, of Purbasthali in Burdwan was married when he proposed to marry Sabita Tudu, 19, and began a physical relationship.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal
 Wednesday, April 16, 2003 				 Buddha mum on VAT in state
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 15: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today dodged a direct reply on whether his government would impose value-added tax in Bengal. 																								We will tell you later, the chief minister told reporters.																								The Bengal Assembly has sent the VAT Bill to the President for his assent though the CPM has neither supported nor opposed the tax. 																								We will discuss the VAT issue at our meeting, said party general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet about the two-day politburo meet that began today. Bhattacharjee is in Delhi for the meeting.																								Earlier, at a news conference, party MP Somnath Chatterjee had given an ambivalent response on the issue. He had said the state should not rush to implement VAT and should consider the interests of traders.																								Surjeet took the opportunity to clarify that the CPM was not going ahead with a blanket boycott of US goods though it may give such a call at select places.

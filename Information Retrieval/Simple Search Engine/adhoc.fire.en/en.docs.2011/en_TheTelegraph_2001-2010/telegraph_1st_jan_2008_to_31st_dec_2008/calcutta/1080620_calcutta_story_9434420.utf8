          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Thailand has emerged as a third source, after Bangladesh and Pakistan, of fake currency notes in India.        
	A youth from Gujarat who was arrested at Dum Dum airport with fake notes worth Rs 9.5 lakh told police that he had got the consignment in Thailand.        
	The notes seized from Javed Gulam Rasul Arab, all in the denomination of Rs 500, were printed in Thailand. We will go through his call list to find out who else are in the racket, said an official of the CIDs special operations group.         
	The sleuths, however, could not get hold of the person whom Arab was scheduled to hand over the consignment.        
	Arabs contact in Thailand was to call him on his cellphone to identify the person whom he would hand over the notes. But the youth had been intercepted and money recovered by then, said a an officer. Instead of asking Arab to receive the call and then lay a trap, customs officials had switched off the cellphone.        
	CID special inspector-general (operations) Rajeev Kumar said this was the first instance of fake notes being brought in from Thailand. In all other cases, the notes entered through the India-Bangladesh border at the behest of Pakistans ISI. The Karachi-Dhaka-Calcutta route of smuggling in counterfeit notes was common, he said.        
	The police said the racket functions through carriers. Some businessmen send youths to countries like Thailand and Singapore to bring back electronic goods. Some of these youths double as counterfeit carriers, said an officer.        
	We suspect that the packets of the electronic items the youths bring in are stashed with fake notes, the officer added.

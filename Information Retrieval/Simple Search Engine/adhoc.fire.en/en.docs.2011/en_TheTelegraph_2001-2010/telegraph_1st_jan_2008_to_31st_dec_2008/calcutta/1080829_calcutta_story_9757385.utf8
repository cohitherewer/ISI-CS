The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Body in Salt Lake complex
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Body in Salt Lake complex
  - Driver suspected of dumping accident victim          A STAFF REPORTER                                                      Ashok Das        
	A man knocked down by a Salt Lake autorickshaw on Wednesday night and thought to have been taken to hospital by the driver was found dead in a nearby government residential complex the next morning.        
	Several people saw Ashok Das, a 40-year-old Group D employee of the Taratala-based Indian Jute Industries Research Association, being injured in the accident in BD Block and the unidentified driver speeding off with him almost immediately.         
	But police still dont know whether he was taken to a hospital or elsewhere and how his body ended up in the P amp;T departments guarded residential complex in CC Block where every visitors name and vehicles number is recorded by the sentries.        
	We are exploring all possible angles. We can confirm how he died only after the post-mortem, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police of North 24-Parganas.         
	There were only two visible injuries on Ashoks body, found lying face upwards in a pool of blood. He was injured in the left eye and ear, one of the investigators said.        
	Ashok, who lives with his brother Naresh and sister-in-law Kanchan, was returning home from office when the autorickshaw hit him. Witnesses said the accident occurred as he was crossing the road near the bus stop in BD Block, close to where his brother lives, around 7.20pm.        
	By the time an acquaintance who had seen the accident contacted Ashoks brother Naresh, a vegetable seller in BD Market, the autorickshaw driver had asked the three passengers to get off and sped away with the injured man. I have been told he was conscious at the time, Naresh said on Thursday.        
	Naresh and some friends did the rounds of local hospitals, including Bidhannagar State General Hospital, throughout the night but did not find Ashok. On Thursday morning, the police informed us about a person lying in the P amp;T quarters. We went there and found Ashok in a pool of blood. I first identified him by his red shirt, he said.         
	Residents of the complex were surprised that a body being brought in escaped the guards attention. After 11pm, all the five gates are shut. There were three private security personnel at the gates on Wednesday night and we checked with them whether any autorickshaw had entered the complex. There was no such entry in the visitors book, said Jyotish Roy, the treasurer of the residents welfare association.        
	Asim Dutta, the secretary of the North 24-Parganas Autorickshaw Union, said an inquiry had begun to find out whether any driver affiliated to the organisation was involved in the incident. The autorickshaw that hit Ashok allegedly plies on the Ultadanga-Karunamoyee route.

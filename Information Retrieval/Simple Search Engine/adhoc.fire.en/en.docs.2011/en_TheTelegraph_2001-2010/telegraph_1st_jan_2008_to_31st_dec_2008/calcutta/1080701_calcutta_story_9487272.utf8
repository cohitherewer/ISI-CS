                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Glam girl of Gorabazar
										      know   Your   Neighbour : Chirasree Singha Roy                                    
	That moment of silence just before the winner of Sananda Tilottama 2008 was announced, and the crescendo of claps that followed are still resounding in Chirasree Singha Roys ears.        
	I could not believe I had won, I thought somebody else would, she smiles. The third-year sociology student of Sarojini Naidu College for Women, standing tall at 5ft-8.5 inches, is basking in a sudden burst of fame. When I step out and people recognise me, I do feel a little shy, she admits.        
	Seated in her Nagerbazar home in a white top and blue capris, she recalls how it all began: I had read about Tilottama in the papers and just wanted to give it a shot. My grandmother and my fiance prodded me to participate.... My family supported me throughout.        
	The crown may have rested on her head on the night of June 21, but her moment of crowning glory had come two weeks before that. Nayanika (Chatterjee) maam, our trainer, was always very critical but two weeks before the finals she said good to me. I was on the top of the world hearing that, gushes Chirasree, sitting cross-legged on a sofa in the modest drawing room of her RN Guha Road home.         
	After an intensive training bout under the eagle eye of Nayanika, she sailed through the Tilottama rounds. The butterflies-in-the-stomach did go a little wild during the swimsuit round, though. Yes, I felt a little shy in that round, but the rest was not a problem, admits Chirasree, who is more comfortable in western wear.         
	However, she has reserved the short skirts and skin-hugging dresses for her shoots. I am more in jeans and tops in the para, she says.         
	Nagerbazar became Chirasrees home when the family shifted there from Kidderpore in 2003. Our neighbours are so good that we never felt out of place. After I won the crown, they came to congratulate me and even gave me gifts! she smiles.                 More about Chirasree       DOB: June 28, 1986
  Pastime: Watching cartoon channels, listening to music
  Likes: Watching movies
  Dislikes: Lies
  Prized possession: Her cellphone
        
	A self-confessed shopaholic, Chirasree loves to pick up things from Esplanade, City Centre and the Gorabazar market, closer home. Gorabazar has a very good collection of saris and western outfits. I love buying my dresses from Gorabazar, especially when I dont have the time to travel far.         
	What she misses most about growing up and becoming famous is the para phuchka. The phuchkawala had strict instructions to call out while passing my house. Now I hardly get to have phuchkas. I am missing the freedom of being a simple para girl.         
	Though Tilottama was the 22-year-olds first stint on the ramp, her interest in modelling dates back to her childhood. Whenever I bought a new pair of shoes, I would walk and pose in front of the mirror.        
	Now, she will hardly find the time to strike a pose in front of her bedroom mirror. For the Sananda Tilottama crown has brought with it a year-long contract for shows and shoots, ads and inaugurations.        
	I also got a call from Balaji Telefilms! I would like to work with Aparna Sen and Rituparno Ghosh, she dreams.        
	And she has every right to dream, what with one big one coming true. But that hasnt changed Chirasree the person who loves to make friends and is never very formal with people.        
	Far from the spotlight and the arclights, this Nagerbazar girl believes in caring for animals and birds. I have treated a few injured dogs of my locality and some day I would like to work with Maneka Gandhi.        
	Ekta Kapoor, Aparna Sen, Rituparno Ghosh and Maneka Gandhi. That is as eclectic a wish list as one can get. Way to go, girl!

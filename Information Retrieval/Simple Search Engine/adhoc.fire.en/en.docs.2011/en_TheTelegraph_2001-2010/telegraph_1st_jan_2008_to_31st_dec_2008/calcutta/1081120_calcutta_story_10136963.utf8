The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Music, fun amp; head banging
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Music, fun amp; head banging

	There was a time when headbanging was reserved for college fests and heavy metal fans in school had to indulge their tastes in private. No longer, if the evidence at Agusto Utsav was anything to go by. The fest of St Augustine School, Ripon Street, saw teenagers strutting their stuff with pride, with prizes reserved for the best headbanger from the audience.        
	Held at Kala Mandir on November 6 and 7, the event saw endless energy, enthusiasm and bonding. Said Ankit Baranwal, a Class XII student of the host school: We returned to the school fest circuit last year, after a gap of nine years, but this year, our event was on a much larger scale.         
	The fest, attended by 12 schools, was inaugurated by actor Sabyasachi Chakravarty, of Feluda fame. The marks in school are not important. If you are a good human being, you know at the end of the day that you have won, were his words of advice to the students.         
	Day I started with the extempore round, called Agusto Spitfire, where students had to speak on names of popular films like Chak de! India and Life in a... Metro. The hosts bagged the first prize.         
	In Agusto Enlighten, the quiz contest, they once again emerged winners after seven rounds of tough quizzing, including rapid fires and audio-visual rounds. Agusto Rhythm, or the western band performance, saw many talents bloom. The band of St Augustines, Barrackpore, came up with original composition One last time.        
	The special attraction of the evening, however, was the eastern music competition. Again the hosts charmed the audience with hits like Rock On!! and Tum ho to, gaata hai dil.         
	Said Karishma Sharma of Calcutta Girls High School (CGHS): This is one fest where every school has been cheering for the others, without any rivalry.        
	The highlight of Day II was Agusto Histrionix or the drama competition. The theme was courage in everyday life and humour in uniform. Class XII student Mohammad Zubaer of the host school was selected Best Actor for his performance as the head of a gang of pickpockets in their play, The Fantastic Four. It showed how no man is born evil but is pushed into crime by society. Sunrise English Medium School sensitively portrayed how members of the older generation often become a burden for their children.         
	The fusion dance competition, Footloose, followed. The CGHS girls performed a fusion of eastern contemporary dance steps, with three groups of dancers performing bharatnatyam, kathak and salsa to the beats of Teri deewani and Mahi ve. Though they won points for innovation, they lost out to St Augustines, Barrackpore, which bagged the winners trophy.         
	The extravaganza came to a close with the performance of local band Supersonics. The hosts bagged the champions trophy but passed it on to first runners-up, St Augustines, Barrackpore.

	Its quiz time, folks                  Students of South Point High School with their trophy. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray      
	The scoreboard showed South Point High School leading with 110 points and Ashok Hall a close second with 105. Ten more points and Ashok Hall would have clinched the trophy. A tense moment for both the teams as quizmaster Charanpreet Singh shot the clincher of the day. In 2004, sports reporter David Walsh and Pierre Ballester jointly published LA Confidentiel. What was it about?        
	Lance Armstrong, pat came the reply from the South Pointers, making them the winners of the Puffin-Starmark Inter School Quiz contest, held at Gyan Manch on November 9 . The event, organised by Starmark and Penguin Books India, saw 35 city schools locking horns. After the preliminary written round, where each team had to answer a set of 30 questions, six finalists (including Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, National Gems School and Don Bosco Park Circus) were selected.         
	From current affairs, Bollywood to technology, the contestants went through eight rounds of grilling, with the direct round proving to be the most interesting.         
	The guest of the evening was commissioner of police Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti. He had words of encouragement for the losers too. The questions were tough, so blame the quizmaster, the top cop said.         
	Ashok Hall finished as first runners-up, followed by Birla High School for Boys. The winners bagged a gift voucher of Rs 6,000 for their school library and book vouchers worth Rs 1,000 each. The first and second runners-up got Rs 3,000 and Rs 2,000, respectively, for their school library and book vouchers worth Rs 750 and Rs 500.

	CHIT CHAT
	To Milton with love        
	A seminar on John Miltons Paradise Lost was organised at Basanti Devi College on November 12. The speakers included academicians from Jadavpur University, Malabika Sarkar and Amlan Dasgupta.         
	Sarkar pointed out how Milton used his knowledge of astronomy in Paradise Lost and how the discoveries of his contemporary, Galileo, inspired him. Dasgupta also gave examples of dissimiles in Paradise Lost.         
	A journal by the students, Endeavour, was released on the occasion. It contains, among others, an interview of author Amitav Ghosh.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A gang of robbers switched off streetlights before breaking into a cellphone shop in Baguiati early on Tuesday. They decamped with 30 handsets worth about Rs 50,000 and Rs 10,000 in cash.         
	The robbers took advantage of the rain yesterday night. They switched off the streetlights to ensure that they were not disturbed, said an officer of Baguiati police station.        
	Raju Das, the owner of the shop, found its shutter partially lifted around 10am. He went inside and the phones were missing. The cash box was broken and Rs 10,000 was missing. Das immediately rushed to the police station and lodged an FIR.Police suspect the robbery was the work of local criminals. The gang may have used a child to enter the shop.        
	The shutter was lifted a few inches to allow a child to slip inside. We have asked fingerprint experts to help us in the probe, said another officer.         
	A team of policemen inspected the shop. The investigators questioned local goons. Probir Mondal, a resident who raised an alarm after noticing three men standing near the shop around 3.30am, was also questioned.         
	I woke up after hearing a thud. I came to the balcony and saw the men standing close to the shop. It was raining heavily and the stretch was dark. When I grew suspicious and raised an alarm, three-four people ran away, Mondal told the investigators.

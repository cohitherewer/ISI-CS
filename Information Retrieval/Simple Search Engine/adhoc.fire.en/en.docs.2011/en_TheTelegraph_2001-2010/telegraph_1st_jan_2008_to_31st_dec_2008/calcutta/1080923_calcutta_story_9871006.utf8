          A STAFF REPORTER                           A parent demonstrates outside Auxilium Convent on Monday. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Students and parents gathered outside Auxilium Convent School in Dum Dum on Monday to protest the authorities decision to scrap the half-yearly examination and hold tests for two subjects per day along with regular classes.         
	The school had taken the decision after question papers were leaked.         
	The parents demonstrating in front of the school had other grievances, too.         
	They alleged that though each student was made to pay Rs 2,000 for the construction of a science block on the premises, the authorities didnt give them a receipt.         
	We repeatedly requested for a receipt for income tax deductions, but the school management didnt oblige, said a parent.         
	We noticed discrepancies in the functioning of the school recently and brought it to the notice of the principal. She hardly paid any heed to our grievances, said C. Chakrabarty, another parent.         
	The parents also said that students are forced to run up and down the four-storeyed building during class hours because only the top and ground floors have toilets.         
	The asbestos roof makes the classrooms on the top floor extremely hot and the children often fall ill. We have brought the matter to the notice of the authorities several times but they have not taken any step to address our complaints, said a parent who did not want to be named.         
	The principal, Sister Lucy, admitted that there were a few problems but said that they could be solved through discussion.         
	Neither the grievances nor the issues are big enough to create problems between us and the guardians. I think there is some misunderstanding. We will resolve it at the earliest.

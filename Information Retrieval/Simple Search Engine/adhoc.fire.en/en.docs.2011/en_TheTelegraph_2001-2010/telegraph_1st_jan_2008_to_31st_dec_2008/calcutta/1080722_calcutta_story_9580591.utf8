          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government is considering a proposal to increase the upper age limit of students taking the state joint entrance examinations (JEE) for studying medicine.        
	Under the existing system, only students below 25 years of age are eligible to sit for the JEE for taking up a medical course. Till 2006, there was no upper age limit.        
	Higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury said in the Assembly on Monday that the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examinations Board would meet in September to review the JEE system.         
	The proposal will be discussed by board members and experts associated with medical education, the minister said.        
	During a discussion on whether the government had plans to bifurcate the JEE and hold separate tests for engineering and medical, Manas Bhuniya of the Congress wanted to know whether the government was considering raising the upper age limit for admission to medical courses.        
	There are 1,105 medical seats and nearly 45,000 medical aspirants who write the JEE every year. Since the number of examinees is much higher than the number of seats, chances of cracking the exam are very slim. So, medical aspirants should be allowed more chances to sit for the entrance test, Bhuniya argued.        
	Regarding bifurcation of the JEE, the higher education minister said the government had no such plans at present.        
	We cannot conduct separate tests for medical and engineering streams as of now. But we have not totally rejected the proposal, the minister said.        
	Nearly one-third of the total JEE examinees write the tests for both streams. Students wanting to appear in the combined examinations will be inconvenienced if separate tests are held. We are trying to find a solution for these students before we consider bifurcating the JEE, Ray Chaudhury added.         
	Bhuniya, however, claimed that bifurcating the JEE would reduce the chances of corruption in the entrance examinations.

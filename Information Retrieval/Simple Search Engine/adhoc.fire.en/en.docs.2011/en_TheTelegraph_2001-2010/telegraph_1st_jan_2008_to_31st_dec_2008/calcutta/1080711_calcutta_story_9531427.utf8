          JAYANTA BASU                                         Sawaswati idols lined up in a Kumartuli lane. A Telegraph picture      
	The chief ministers dream project to rejuvenate Kumartuli has fallen flat, thanks to the reluctance of one of his departments to provide temporary space for the artisans.        
	The sprawling store of the public health engineering department close to Kumartuli was considered for the temporary relocation of the artisans. But some problems have cropped up and it doesnt seem the space will be available, said local CPM parliamentarian Sudhanshu Sil.        
	Despite the best of our efforts, we have been hitting one hurdle after another. The rejuvenation roadmap has been settled following repeated talks with all stakeholders, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, disappointed with the latest hitch.        
	The Kumartuli revamp project was cleared two years ago, one of the earliest to have received the nod under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission. Around Rs 26 crore has been sanctioned, half of which will be borne by the state.        
	The government, however, is trying to identify an alternative site to relocate the artisans. Talks are on with Calcutta Port Trust for a site on Strand Bank Road. We are expecting a positive response, said Bhattacharya.        
	Sil, however, made it clear that the relocation would be possible before the Puja, which starts on October 5. We will need around three months to build the temporary settlement for the artisans, including their work places. Even if the port trust approval finally comes, the relocation cannot start before the Puja, said Barun Roy, the secretary of the CMDA, which is the executing agency of the revamp.        
	It is unusual that after so much deliberation the public health engineering department is saying it cannot part with the store. We now hear there are some legal complications, said an official.        
	Weve been hearing about the relocation for quite some time but nothing has happened. We have no problem shifting to Strand Bank Road site, said an artisan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mercury dip for 48 hours
                                                                                                               Mercury dip for 48 hours
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Met office said on Wednesday that the prevailing chill is expected to continue for 48 hours. The minimum temperature on Wednesday was 14.1 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal.        
	We expect the minimum temperature to hover around 14 degrees on Thursday. However, we dont expect a significant dip in the minimum temperature immediately, as the North Wind is not blowing too strongly, said a Met official.        
	The minimum temperature dipped on Tuesday because of a cold wave in the northern parts of the country, according to Met officials.         
	On Tuesday, the minimum temperature in Calcutta was 13.7 degrees.        
	Cold wave conditions are prevailing in Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and some parts of Gujarat. The cold wave is likely to persist in these areas for the next two days, said a Met official. The lowest minimum temperature in the northern plains on Wednesday was minus 1.4 degrees in Amritsar.         
	Parts of Bihar and Jharkhand are also in the grip of a cold wave. The lowest minimum temperature in the eastern plains was six degrees at Gaya and Daltonganj.        
	A cold wind is blowing from Bihar and Jharkhand to Calcutta, bringing down the minimum temperature, added the Met official. A low-pressure trough has formed over Karnataka and Orissa, but is unlikely to cause rain in the city.

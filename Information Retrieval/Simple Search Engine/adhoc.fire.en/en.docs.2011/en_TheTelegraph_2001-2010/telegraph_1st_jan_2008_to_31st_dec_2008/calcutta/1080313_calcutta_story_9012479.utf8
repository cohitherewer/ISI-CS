The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water tax revived
                                                                                                               Water tax revived
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Bidhannagar Municipality is planning to re-introduce water tax to tide over its financial crisis. The tax was revoked after a month in 2003, following a case in the high court. The case has not been settled.        
	The proposal to bring back the tax was discussed at a board meeting of the municipality on Wednesday. The chairman-in-council members agreed in principle to revive the tax.        
	We expect to earn Rs 50 lakh by way of water tax in the next financial year. The decision to collect the tax has been ratified by the councillors. Once we introduce the water meters, the tax will be calculated on the basis of the volume of water consumed, said Biswajiban Majumdar, the chairman of the municipality.        
	In 2003, the Salt Lake Houseowners Association had filed a petition in the high court, challenging the civic bodys decision to collect the tax.        
	We are waiting for the court nod and have asked our legal cell to request the court to expedite the trial. We hope to start water tax collection by April, said a municipal official.        
	The civic body can revive the tax as there is no interim stay on it, said Debi Pal, the lawyer representing the association. I dont see any legal hurdle. But re-introduction of the tax would require a court order as the matter is sub judice, added Pal.        
	Arunabha Ghosh, a lawyer associated with the legal cell of the municipality, echoed Pal.        
	K.S. Sengupta, the secretary of Salt Lake Houseowners Association, said: We are consulting our lawyers on the matter. The court is yet to pronounce its final verdict.        
	The civic opposition is against the comeback of the tax. Many parts of the township do not get treated water and are dependent on groundwater. We will oppose the tax until a proper water supply infrastructure is in place, said Debasish Jana, the leader of the civic opposition.

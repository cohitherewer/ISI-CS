  - Mob targets duo who took unconscious youth to hospital          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Two police officers who took an unconscious man to hospital but could not save his life were later attacked by a mob that thought they were responsible for the death.         
	Rajesh Mallik, an employee of a Lake Gardens furniture shop, collapsed near his workplace on Tuesday night and would have been lying there had sub-inspectors B.B. Mahato and P. Chatterjee not taken him to M.R. Bangur Hospital. The 22-year-old was dead when doctors examined him, but the ordeal had just begun for the two officers from Lake police station.         
	Rajeshs family members, relatives and friends assaulted the duo who could have been his saviours on the suspicion that they killed the youth and tried to cover it up by taking him to hospital.         
	They dragged Mahato and Chatterjee to a corner of the hospital premises and started hitting and slapping them. They were outnumbered by the mob, which swelled when relatives of other patients joined in, an officer at Jadavpur police station said.         
	The duo were bleeding by the time a team from Jadavpur police station came to their rescue. When we enquired what had happened, some people led us to those who started the assault. We arrested seven persons, the officer said.         
	There were about 50 people in the mob.         
	The superintendent of police of South 24-Parganas, Ajay Ranade, said the officers did the right thing by taking Rajesh to hospital without wasting time trying to ascertain how he collapsed. Before leaving, the duo told other employees of the furniture store to inform the youths family members that he had been found unconscious.         
	We came to know that nobody had come forward to help the youth That is why Mahato and Chatterjee went there. They did not find any external injury marks on Rajeshs body. He may have died of cardiac arrest, one of the sub-inspectors colleagues at Lake police station said.         
	The duo were not the only policemen to be attacked for doing their duty. Sergeant Partha Chatterjee of the Headquarters Traffic Guard was dashed by two youths on a motorcycle on Wednesday morning when he tried to stop them from speeding.         
	Chatterjee noticed the two-wheeler (WB 011059) being driven dangerously. He gestured to the rider to stop but he dashed Chatterjee and sped away. The sergeant has leg and elbow injuries, an officer in the traffic control room said.

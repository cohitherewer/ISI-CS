The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Beware of decibel devil 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Beware of decibel devil

	Kali puja and Diwali in Calcutta used to be no different from the rest of the country with noisy crackers going off through the night. The situation changed for the better in the late-1990s after judicial intervention. From 2003, however, portions of the city have returned to their old ways. Metro prepares a status report on the fight against festive noise pollution.              
	Where do the violations occur?        
	The south  especially Ballygunge Circular Road, Gariahat, Kasba, Rabindra Sarobar, Golf Green, Tollygunge, Watgunge and Kalighat  sees more noise-norm violations than the other parts of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation area. Posta, Chitpur, Burtola, Jorasanko and Maniktala are the problem points in central and north Calcutta.        
	There are more violations in the fringe areas  Baguiati, Sectors II and III of Salt Lake, Bangur, Sodepur and Madhyamgram in the north and Behala, Garia and Jadavpur in the south. There are also violations in several areas in Howrah.        
	Even hospitals and silence zones are not spared, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department. The first noise-norm complaint this Kali puja came from the area around SSKM Hospital on Monday evening, he added.         
	Who are the violators?        
	Residents of housing estates and multi-storeyed buildings now violate the ban more than slum dwellers. In the poorer localities, youngsters burst chocolate bombs and kalipatkas.        
	We have decided to post one police officer for three highrise buildings in the problem areas. We are trying to cut down both the demand and supply of banned firecrackers, said city police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	When do noisy crackers burst?        
	For the past few years, there have been more violations on Diwali than on Kali puja. Most of the violations occur between 9pm and midnight.        
	Why has noise pollution monitoring slackened?        
	Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, who in 1996 passed pioneering orders on noise pollution and appointed special officers to monitor violations, feels the situation has deteriorated in the past few years owing to lack of political will.        
	We, as special officers, used to keep the administration on its toes. This is missing now, said advocate Gitanath Ganguly.        
	What will happen this year?        
	A state-level noise monitoring committee has been formed. The monitoring of banned crackers also started earlier than the past few years.        
	The downturn in the economy may contribute to a quieter Diwali. People will buy fewer firecrackers, which have become expensive, said M.L. Meena, the state environment secretary.

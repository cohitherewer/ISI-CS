  - Airport officials warn of disaster waiting to happen          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	Calcutta airport flirts with danger every day by persisting with a dated communication, navigation and surveillance system, according to officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI).        
	It ranks among the airports where aviation safety is being compromised the most. Equipment hasnt been upgraded and, in some cases, machinery of inferior quality has been procured, said P.S. Tevethia, the general secretary of the Airports Authority Officers Association.        
	The lapses have been listed in a memorandum to the AAI chairman, K. Ramalingam. Copies have been sent to the President, Prime Minister and the civil aviation minister.        
	Two pieces of equipment need to be replaced immediately  the one that measures the exact distance of an aircraft from the airport and a high-frequency Doppler device that guides the pilot. These were installed in 1991 and, going by the AAI manual, should have been replaced by 2001. But the old machinery continues to be in use, causing problems, an airport official said.        
	A new DVOR (Doppler Very High Frequency Omni Range) device had been purchased for Calcutta airport but not installed. It was lying unused for a long time and was later shifted to Khajuraho, the official said.        
	The officers association claims that some of the vital communication equipment purchased over the past few years are not of the best quality.                                 
	A VHF (very high frequency) transmitter and receiver were imported from the UK but the antenna purchased in India was allegedly of dubious quality, leading to synchronisation problems.         
	Such transmitters and receivers are used for voice communication between pilots and Air Traffic Control.         
	A disaster was barely averted on Monday when a Boeing 737-800 landed on a runway closed for repairs and halted just 800 metres from where men and machine were at work.         
	A new Instrument Landing System has been installed on the primary runway but not commissioned yet. We need to calibrate it first. We have delayed the process because of fog, said P.K. Singhal, the regional executive director (east) of the AAI.         
	The Direct Satellite Communication Network project that is meant to ensure faster and better communication between Calcutta and other airports has been delayed, too. We were supposed to commission the project by the end of last year but ran into technical problems in the bidding process, said an AAI official from New Delhi.

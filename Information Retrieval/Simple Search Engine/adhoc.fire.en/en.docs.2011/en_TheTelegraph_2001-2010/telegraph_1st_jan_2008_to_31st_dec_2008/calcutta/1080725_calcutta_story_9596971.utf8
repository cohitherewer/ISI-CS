          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 65-year-old woman was found unconscious on a platform of New Barrackpore railway station on Thursday morning.         
	Dolly Biswas alleged, on gaining consciousness, that her sons and their wives had driven her out of her Meghnad Saha Sarani home, near the station.        
	According to an officer, she complained that her family members tortured her physically and mentally.        
	Her daughters-in-law often quarrelled with her. They would beat her up and even tear off her hair.        
	She was taken back home after first-aid in New Barrackpore Municipal Hospital. Some local residents tried to heckle Biswass family members for torturing her.        
	She was holding a tuft of hair in her left arm when I saw her surrounded by people on my way to office around 9am, said Supratik Saha, a resident.         
	We rescued Biswas after being informed by a resident in the morning. She was lying unconscious on platform 1, said S. Chakrabarty, the officer-in-charge of New Barrackpore police outpost.        
	Though Biswas lodged a complaint against her sons and their wives, she requested the police not to arrest them. She only wanted the officers to give them a warning so that they treated her properly.        
	We interrogated her two sons and their wives, said an officer. Jayanta, Biswass elder son, said though there was some problem between their wives and their mother, they never beat her up.        
	She developed minor psychiatric problems after my fathers death about two years ago. She left the house early in the morning without informing us. We had consulted a psychiatrist earlier. We will take her to the doctor again, he said.        
	It seems she needs sympathy from her family. So we have warned them that if such a thing occurs in future we will have to take action against them, said an officer.

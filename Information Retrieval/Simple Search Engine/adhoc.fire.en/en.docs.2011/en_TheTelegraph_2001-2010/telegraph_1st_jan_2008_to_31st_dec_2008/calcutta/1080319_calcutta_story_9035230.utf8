                                                                                                               Killed in fit of rage
  - Victims Valuables untouched          A STAFF REPORTER                          Usha Chokhani: Prime suspect yet to be traced                                        
	Usha Chokhanis killer had acted in a fit of rage, police said on Tuesday. The murder was not planned. We are not sure about the motive, but the murder was neither for gain nor for revenge, said an investigating officer.        
	The 54-year-old woman was found murdered in her Mandeville Gardens flat on Sunday afternoon. A divorcee, she had been living alone.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that Ushas keys were not misplaced. There was nothing to suggest that domestic help Kishan, the prime suspect, tried to remove anything from the almirahs or drawers, the officer added.        
	Everything is in place. Those who knew about Ushas belongings said nothing is missing, said an officer of Gariahat police station. It doesnt seem that Kishan had murdered her for cash or valuables.        
	The help is absconding since the murder. The police team that had gone to Banka, Kishans home district in Bihar, failed to track him down or any members of the family.        
	Mukesh, a youth from Banka district, was Ushas first help in Calcutta. He left after some time and Bikash, from the same district, took his place. He worked till February 29 and then came Kishan.        
	The police are questioning people who knew Usha and are also acquainted with her in-laws. Even after the separation, Usha had lived with her in-laws in Dibrugarh for some time. She moved to Calcutta a year and a half ago, the officer said.

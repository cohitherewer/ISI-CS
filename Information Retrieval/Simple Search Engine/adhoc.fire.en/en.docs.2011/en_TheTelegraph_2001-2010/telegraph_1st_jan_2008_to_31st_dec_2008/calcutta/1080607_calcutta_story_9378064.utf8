The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | East-West rail link to airport
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       East-West rail link to airport

	The state government is planning a train corridor along VIP Road to the airport in time for the launch of the integrated terminal building.        
	The Salt Lake Central Park-Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport link will be an offshoot of the East-West Metro project, which was cleared by the Centre on Thursday. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the state governments interim consultant for East-West Metro, is also preparing the detailed project report for the other corridor.        
	The detailed project report will be submitted to the state government in about six months, said K. Gangopadhyay, the project director of DMRC. According to the plan now, the major part of the 7.5-km stretch will be elevated.         
	The target is to complete the link by 2010, when the modernisation project will be completed and the new airport terminal building will become operational, said S.P.S. Bakshi, the director of the airport modernisation project.        
	The southern tip of the link will be the Central Park station on the East-West Metro route connecting Howrah with Salt Lake. The tracks will extend over Kestopur canal to VIP Road and cover almost the entire length of the stretch before going underground near its junction with the road heading right towards the airport.         
	The airport station may be integrated with the underground parking lot of the new terminal , said an airport official.        
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, state transport department and the Airports Authority of India are working on projects along the proposed route. We are exploring the possibility of integrating the work, said a DMRC official.        
	The annual passenger handling capacity of the two terminals is six million. Once the integrated building becomes operational, it will jump to 20 million. While 6,000 private cars and taxis now visit the airport daily, the figure will go up to 24,000 after the modernisation. Pressure of passengers will lead to airport approach roads getting clogged. So, the state government is planning train links and flyovers.         
	The state transport department has planned a four-lane flyover from Chitpur to the Lake Town-VIP Road crossing. The existing Circular Railway connection between Dum Dum junction and the airport may be made a part of the Metro route.        
	Metro Rail is studying the project feasibility. The survey will be completed next month, said a Metro official.

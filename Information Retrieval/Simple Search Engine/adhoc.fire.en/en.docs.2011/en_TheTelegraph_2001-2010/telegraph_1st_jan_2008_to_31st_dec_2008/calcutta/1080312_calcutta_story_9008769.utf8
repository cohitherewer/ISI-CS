The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Conman amp; the cop
                                                                                                               Conman amp; the cop
  - TARGETS: TRADERS FROM DISTRICTS          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A conman who duped traders by posing as a cop was arrested in Burrabazar on Tuesday.        
	According to police, Deepu Bhattacharya, in his late 40s, used to stand outside markets in the Burrabazar-Posta belt and target traders from the districts who came there for wholesale purchases. A week ago, the Rajarhat resident had allegedly duped Sair Ali from Murshidabad, when he visited Burrabazar to buy stationery goods in bulk.        
	Bhattacharya introduced himself to Ali as a police officer. The conman claimed that he, too, was from Murshidabad and wanted Ali to do well in business, said Umashanker Ojha, the officer-in-charge of Burrabazar police station.        
	After winning the traders trust over several cups of tea, Bhattacharya advised him to start trading in essential commodities like pulses. The logic was simple: essential commodities fetch higher returns than stationery items. Bhattacharya told Ali that he could buy at a cheap rate a consignment of pulses that the police had recently seized while it was being smuggled, added Ojha.        
	Bhattacharya claimed that the consignment, which was kept in a godown on Amherst Street, would be auctioned off and offered to strike a good deal for Ali. The trader was so impressed that he gave Bhattacharya Rs 20,000 to prove that he was a genuine buyer.        
	On being asked how he would get the pulses, Bhattacharya directed Ali to go to Amherst Street police station and meet an officer  Surajsaheb  with his reference. The trader went straight to the police station, only to realise that he had been duped.         
	Ali lodged a complaint with Burrabazar police station. The officers were on the lookout for the conman. On Tuesday afternoon, they arrested Bhattacharya after the trader identified him. Police are trying to find out how many others he had duped.

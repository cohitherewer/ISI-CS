	Eastern education is better than western education, the motion stood defeated as a majority in the house voted against it. But Akshay Kohli of DPS RK Puram in New Delhi thought otherwise. The student stressed on the high school dropout rate in the US and ascribed it to a lack of proper disciplining and grounding at the primary school level. His arguments won him the Inter-Institutional LN Birla Nation Debate trophy in the school category.         
	The zonal winners from eight schools and seven colleges battled it out for the coveted trophy at the Vidya Mandir auditorium on November 22. Each participants was given five minutes to speak and an extra minute to answer the judges question. It was a packed house.         
	Avilash Pahi of La Martiniere for Boys, Calcutta, was the first runners up from the school category. He also spoke for the motion.         
	In the college category, however, both the winners opposed the motion. Pratyasha Rath of St Xaviers College, Calcutta, clinched the trophy while Vikram Keskar of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce, Pune, was the runner up.         
	It was an evening of proposition and opposition. Avilash pointed out that the eastern system of education was much older than its western counterpart. Thus it got more time to evolve. He corroborated his point with the example of two painters, one who gets a month to imitate a painting and enliven it with his ideas and the other who can barely imitate because of the lack of time.         
	In the college category, Pratyasha Rath claimed: Western education upholds individualism and rationality while in the oriental, the individual is buried under group identity, she argued. Vikram Keskar strengthened the case for western education by referring to the marks-oriented system at home.         
	The zonal rounds began in April in Pune, Delhi, Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Hyderabad. The best talents were pitched for the finals. The winners got a cheque of Rs 10,000 and a laptop while the runner up received Rs 5,000 and an iPod.

	An art exhibition and cultural soiree organised by foreign students and funded by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), brought together students from countries as diverse as Uganda and Uzbekistan.         
	We had wanted to organise an event like this for a long time, but didnt have the infrastructure. Now, with a gallery and auditorium of our own, it will be easier to organise such exchanges, said Anuja Chakravarty, the regional director, ICCR.        
	ICCR provides up to 1,800 scholarships every year in humanities, performing arts, science and engineering, to international students for undergraduate to post-doctoral-level studies in India.The exhibition showcased two works of each of the 14 students in the Nandalal Bose Gallery at their Rabindranath Tagore Centre.         
	The compositions ranged from oil on canvas, acrylic on canvas, etching and lino cut. Indonesian student Ketut Suwidiarta, studying at Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) chose to study in India because of the similarity between Indian and Indonesian art forms. The first year masters student of visual arts depicted Arjuna from The Mahabharata. Titled Warrior, it showed a battle-weary Pandava, with blood oozing out of his arrow-ridden body.         
	The paintings of Romanian student Bianca Traska were imbued with soothing washes of blue. Her Self Discovery was a stylised representation of the earth reading an atlas with the moon gazing at her from far away. Bianca arrived in India two months ago. Sri Lankan student Nishan Dimithra Wimalasurias Hedonism dealt with the pleasure-seeking instinct of people. Drawn from his visits to the red light areas, it depicts the union of two males.         
	At the cultural programme, students dressed in their national costumes made song and dance presentations.

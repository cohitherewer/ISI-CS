           Political hotbed: A student demonstration after an earlier flare up on the Besu campus. A Telegraph picture                             
	Once Subhas Chandra Bose expressed his desire to organise a meeting in Santiniketan to address the students of the ashram. Rabindranath Tagore, with whom Bose shared a pleasant rapport, gave him the permission, but on condition that the lecture would not be political. Tagore was against the politicisation of the seat of learning, even for such a noble cause as Indias struggle for Independence.           
	But the present-day authorities have no qualms in herding school students in a bus like cattle and despatching them to the venue of a political rally, all in the name of political awakening (School boys taken for a ride, September 2).           
	If forcible eviction of poor farmers from their ancestral land is touted as fight for the cause of the poor, then pray what to call this torture on the students of Bengal?           
	It is a shame that while Tagore envisaged an enlightened student community forming the brain of the nation with an independent mind of its own, the mandarins of modern Bengal are going all out to churn out party cadres by brainwashing the future generation.                     
	Kajal Chatterjee,
  Sodepur                       
	 As a former student of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) I am shocked at the happenings on the Besu campus (Campus shut on rating eve, Nov 7). From a premier seat of learning it has turned into a hot bed of politics and unrest. Because of the activities of the students unions, the institution is on the brink of collapse. Political leaders and college administrators have shown utter callousness in handling the situation.             
	Even teachers are indulging in union activities rather than creating an atmosphere of learning on campus. About the vice-chancellor, the less said the better. His total failure should have ended in a dignified resignation.           
	The present circumstances in Besu are beyond the control of the higher education department. The administration of the university should be handed over to an ex-army senior technical education officer, who can deal with the situation firmly while continuing education and enforcing discipline.           
	C.R. Bhattacharjee,
  Address not given                     
	 It is important to prohibit any kind of politics on campus. Being an alumnus of Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur, I can say that during my college days I have not seen any useful work being done by the student wings of political parties and I dont think things have changed now. Worse, unlike in the past, the students unions are resorting to a kind of mindless violence that is tarnishing the image of the institute and causing inconvenience to students.           
	The students should ask themselves one question  do they want to make the best of the opportunities provided by the institute or spoil their career by listening to political godfathers outside the campus, whose careers will grow by damaging the students future?           
	If our political leaders really want to do something for the oldest engineering institute in the state, they should keep away from Besu.

	 Apropos the report Tribute to barefoot Bagan boys (3 September), it is wonderful to know about the fibreglass sculpture of the great Mohun Bagan players who defeated the English football team to win the IFA shield in 1911. The initiative proves that though there is a craze for cricket among Indians, football reigns in the hearts of Bengalis even now.             
	Sourish Misra,
  Salt Lake                     
	 It was great to remember the historic triumph of Mohun Bagan in 1911. The endeavour of Mintu Pal, who is sculpting the brave Mohun Bagan XI, is equally commendable. Given its rich history, the present condition of the Mohun Bagan team, which has to bring in foreign players to boost its prospects, is utterly disappointing.           
	Prahlad Agarwala,

	Apropos the report Fresh bar to fight katatel, September 1, it is good to learn that the environment department has finally issued a notification to implement the directive of the High Court against manufacturers and users of katatel, which is being used illegally for autorickshaws, causing severe air pollution in the city.             
	I have noticed that thousands are involved in this business, mostly unemployed educated youths. But before closing down their business, they should be given an alternative livelihood.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                       
	The civic authorities initiative to pull down banners and festoons from roadside structures on SP Mukherjee Road between Kalighat police station and Harish Mukherjee Road intersection (Green drive, The City Diary, Aug 29), deserves kudos. While the banners make the city look ugly, advertisements on tin plates affixed to trees with nails harm the trees.             
	The wrong-doers should be identified from the addresses in the advertisement and penalised.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala                               
	Apropos Patty peeve at judges party, Sept 4, when staples in a chicken patty pricked the gullet of a consumer court judge, she survived because she vomited them out. Many confectioners use sugared and coloured rubber bands instead of plumes and currants. Many restaurants use entrails instead of meat. Only strict government inspectors and consumer forum can stop such malpractices.             
	Govinda Bakshi,
  Budge Budge                               
	Why were the local police allowed to investigate such a complicated case of public importance as reported in Stock fraud cloud on family, Sept 5. Thana officers hardly got sufficient time to investigate even routine cases viz. theft, robbery, snatching, properly.

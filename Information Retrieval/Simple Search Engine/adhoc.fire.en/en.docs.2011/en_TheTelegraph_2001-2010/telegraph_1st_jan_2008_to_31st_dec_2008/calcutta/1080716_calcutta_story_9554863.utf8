The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water crisis in flooded pockets 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Water crisis in flooded pockets

	The ground floors of several houses in Behala are inundated after rainfall over the past two days. The waterlogging has also led to shortage of water and transportation problems.        
	Residents of Narayan Roy Road switched off their electricity supply after seeing sparks in a number of overhead poles. Consequently, the pumps could not be operated causing water scarcity.        
	Around 8.30pm yesterday, I noticed sparks in the CESC pole in front of our house. It was raining heavily at the time and there was lightning. I immediately switched off the electricity supply, said Souvik Mukherjee, a second-year student of South City College and a resident of Narayan Roy Road.        
	Other households in the locality did the same. We had to drink water from tubewells as the civic taps are under water, said Kuntal Basu, a resident living in the area.        
	Houses in Bhattacharjeepara, Sabarnapara, KK Roy Chowdhury Road, Silpara, Dwijenpalli, Rabindra Nagar and Jadu Colony are flooded.        
	The sewage system has collapsed. Our toilets are flooded, said Chhanda Mukherjee of Bhattacharjeepara. Water has entered her kitchen too.        
	The house of the erstwhile zamindars of the area, the Roy Chowdhurys of Sabarnapara, is also flooded. We have moved to the first floor. We are forced to do that every monsoon, said Subrata Roy Chowdhury. He expressed fear of snakebites.        
	The fear is not unfounded. Aloka Majhi, a 37-year-old resident of KK Roy Chowdhury Road, was bitten by a snake on Tuesday morning. She is admitted to Vidyasagar General Hospital.        
	Residents also said that a host of insects is being carried into their houses by the water. Those being stung by the insects are experiencing irritation for a long time, said homemaker Swapna Mukherjee. There was a foot of water in her bedroom.        
	Transportation problems have confined many to their flooded houses. Autorickshaws stopped plying since last evening. They operated for a few hours today morning, but stopped again after showers in the afternoon, said Sanjay Ganguly, a resident of Silpara who could not go to office for two days.        
	Trinamul Congress councillor of ward 126 said he was helpless. Councillors of adjoining wards are not allowing us to pump out the accumulated water through their wards. As a result, even though water from the other areas is showing signs of receding, our ward is still submerged, said Shyamadas Roy.        
	Local councillors and the borough chairman have been summoned by mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya to discuss the water woes in the area.

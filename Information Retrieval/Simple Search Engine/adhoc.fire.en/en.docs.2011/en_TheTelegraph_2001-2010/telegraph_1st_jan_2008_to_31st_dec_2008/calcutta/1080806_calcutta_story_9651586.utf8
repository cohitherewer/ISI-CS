The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: sniffing canines
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wanted: sniffing canines
  - Demand makes puppies pricier          KINSUK BASU AND SANJAY MANDAL                           Dona at work at BM Birla heart hospital. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Shining black Asha, golden Hashi and off-white Tuli  the prized possessions of Calcutta police  have sent many sniffing around for dogs that can smoke out explosives.        
	After the blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad followed by the terror email on July 29, star hotels, private hospitals and even individuals are prowling around for canines.        
	Dog dealers across the city are scurrying to match demand and supply. Almost 80 per cent of the calls I have received in the past week are from people who want Labradors for security purposes. People just want them off-the-shelf, said K.K. Basu Roy of Corona, a popular pet shop in New Market.        
	Basu Roy added that repeated beaming of pictures of dogs sniffing for explosives on news channels had barked up the demand.        
	Private security agencies are placing orders for sniffer dogs like Labradors to impress their clients, he said, kindling memories of how a phone companys ad had suddenly made Pugs popular.        
	Last week, BM Birla Heart Research Centre hired a Great Dane from a private security agency for Rs 13,000 a month.        
	Following last weeks security advisory from the police, Dona was brought to the hospital on Monday and then made to do the rounds of the wards, waiting lounge and car-parking and garbage-dumping areas. The same dog, authorities said, would be used at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute.        
	Other private hospitals are also planning to get sniffer dogs. We are searching for dogs which are capable of detecting bombs, said Rupali Basu, the chief executive officer of Apollo Gleneagles.        
	Rodney Kaypee, the general manager of Hotel Hindusthan International, revealed that they had progressed beyond just looking. We will meet a dealer tomorrow to seal the deal, he said.         
	Police sources told Metro that some hotels had got in touch with them to enquire about the availability of sniffer dogs.         
	The sudden spurt in demand has pushed up prices. The price of a good Labrador has gone up by nearly Rs 2,000 and one is not available for less than Rs 10,000. Golden Retrievers are in great demand but they are just not available, said Sujoy Ghosh, a dog dealer in south Calcutta.        
	The good ones are fetching even higher prices in Delhi and Mumbai and so there is a dearth of supply here, he added.        
	But getting a sniffer dog is just the job half done. It needs to sweat it out for at least a year to become as effective as an Asha or a Tuli.        
	You have to train a Labrador or a Golden Retriever to detect explosives, said Pradeep Pandey, the officer-in-charge of Calcutta polices dog squad.

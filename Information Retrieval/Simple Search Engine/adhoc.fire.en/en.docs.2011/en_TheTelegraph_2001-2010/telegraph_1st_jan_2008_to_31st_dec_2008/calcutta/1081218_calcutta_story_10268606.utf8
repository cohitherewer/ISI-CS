                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The City Diary
                Traffic snarls choked parts of the city on Wednesday afternoon with SUCI supporters taking out a procession from College Street to Metro channel and the CPM-supported West Bengal Tannery Majdoor Union blocking Park Circus connector. The SUCI procession, which started around 2.20pm, reduced vehicular movement to a crawl in north and central Calcutta. When the protesters reached Metro channel, they broke the police cordon. Over 1,700 people were arrested, produced before a magistrate and released.    Jaya Das, a 25-year-old slum dweller in Beleghata, tried to throw her newborn boy into a canal in the area on Tuesday. The baby got stuck in weeds and started crying, attracting the attention of neighbours, who persuaded Jaya to take back her child. The boy died a few minutes later. Police said Jayas husband had left her and she was having an affair with a local resident. She was arrested.    Kajal Singh, a 30-year-old nurse, was found dead in her Sonarpur home on Wednesday morning, with her throat slit. Police suspect she was killed by her husband Durga Prasad, who is absconding. Prasad, a labourer, suspected that Kajal was having an affair.    An Alipore court on Wednesday adjourned for a day the hearing of a case filed by Chowdhury Mansur Rehman, whose eight-year-old daughter Iftesham died allegedly after being hit by a yoga teacher in Bidya Bharati School. Chowdhury pleaded before the court for the cancellation of teacher Anita Dass bail and requested that she be charged with death due to negligence, a non-bailable offence. The women and child development and social welfare department has directed police to file cases against Das and the school principal at the juvenile court by Thursday.     Economist Alak Ghosh, a former head of the economics department of Calcutta University, died in a private hospital in Salt Lake on Wednesday. He was 80.

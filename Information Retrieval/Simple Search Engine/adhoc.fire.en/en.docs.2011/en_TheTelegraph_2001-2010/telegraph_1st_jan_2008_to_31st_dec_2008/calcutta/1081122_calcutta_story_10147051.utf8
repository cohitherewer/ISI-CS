                The Wedding Album
    Hamlet- The Clown Prince        If theatre be the food for thought ...                    As the mellow autumn breeze gives way to a pleasant nip in the air, theatre lovers in the city have another reason to celebrate. The eighth edition of Odeon, Vodafones annual theatre festival is set to be staged at the onset of winter, a welcome change from its earlier monsoon incarnation. Another important change is about to take place this year onwards, with young English productions sharing the platform with renowned Bengali groups. Five city groups and two from Mumbai will participate in this edition. This evening features The Prime TIme Theatre Companys English productionThe Wedding Album (direction: Lillete Dubey), a contemporary play exploring the traditional Indian wedding within a modern, urban, technology-smart society. It presents a joyful event where family members reunite to celebrate and reaffirm loyalties. Yet, underneath the facade of picture-perfect smiles simmer suspicion, jealousy, frustration and aggression. Tomorrow, artistes of Cinematograph take the stage with Hamlet- The Clown Prince (direction: Rajat Kapoor). In it, a group of clowns, while preparing for a show of the Shakespearean tragedy, misinterpret its text and find strange, new meanings. The fest continues till November 30.            Event: Vodafone Odeon 2008 annual theatre festival When: Today amp; tomorrow; 4 pm amp; 7 pm Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

           Pill Power: The report Capsule capital, July 6, portrays how Bengalis pop pills at the drop of a hat. It reminded me of what I saw in Ranigunj while I was posted there during the early Sixties. Baffled at seeing medicine shops right next to sweet shops, I had asked a senior resident the reason. He calmly replied: Bengalis are fond of sweets and fried savouries and hence suffer from stomach ailments. The medicine shops have sprung up next to eateries to provide immediate relief.     A.S.

	Apropos the report Mentally ill but behind bars, June 30, mental patients are languishing in inhuman conditions in correctional homes. They are neither getting any treatment nor are they allowed to face a trial. The abysmal situation at Dum Dum Central Jail is only the tip of the iceberg. The overall picture is much worse. Schizophrenic inmates are likely to suffer the most  their condition will deteriorate without proper treatment but justice will elude them unless their condition improves. Non-availability of psychiatrists cannot be the administrations excuse. Undertrials should not suffer because of their inefficiency. What is more frightening is that criminal lunatics, despite their records, have not been separated from healthy convicts. Who will be responsible of the consequences when there is every possibility that violence may be triggered by the slightest provocation? The administration must take immediate steps to set things right and restore human rights of the jail inmates.

	The state government tried to turn education into a lucrative commercial venture by inviting private engineering colleges to set up shop in West Bengal (Tech bubble, July 20). It was the right move at a time when thousands of students were leaving the state to study engineering. But as a result private colleges without the minimum infrastructure have mushroomed like nursing homes across the state. Students graduating from these colleges are not getting jobs that match their investment. If the colleges are not monitored closely, standards will continue to drop and the colleges will become a long-term worry for the government.

	The quality of infrastructure of the private engineering colleges is worrying. I have seen five or more engineering streams being taught from small three-storeyed buildings. But nothing compares to the frustration of the students who after four years of studies find it difficult to land jobs.

	Apropos the report Doctor error after death too, July 4, another medical horror story has played itself out at a premier state hospital. Two sons who lost their mother because of alleged medical negligence were arrested on the charge of vandalism and were handed over her body more than 12 hours after her death. Moreover, a doctor put an impossible date and time on the death certificate. While doctor bashing or vandalism in hospital cannot be condoned, one must try to appreciate the physical and psychological pressure that an ordinary man is put under in such a situation. Highhandedness by police is likely to be counter productive.

	The report Spencers strikes a deal, July 8, was distressing. The various restrictions imposed by hawkers on the Spencers outlet are against the freedom of marketing that should be available in any democracy. The hawkers themselves are doing business in an unauthorised manner causing problems to pedestrians and vehicles. The civic body instead of taking action against them is brokering unfair deals for them. Democratic norms and the interests of the ordinary people are thus being trampled upon.

	Apropos the report Civic body loses lease deeds, May 28, I fail to understand why mayor Bikash Bhattacharyya was silent about the lost lease deeds for so long. If he suspects that interest groups active in the civic body are behind the missing deeds, why didnt he start an investigation? His words are unlikely to fool people who know that if employees are corrupt, they are backed by political leaders with vested interests.

	Apropos the report After MP, cop takes on boss, July 8, my heartiest congratulations to traffic sergeant Sudip Maity for not succumbing to pressure and doing his work sincerely. Metro too deserves kudos for extensive coverage of the incident. As a citizen, it pains us to know that the police force is filled with corrupt people. Appropriate action should be taken against the officer-in-charge.

	Apropos the report Airline jobs scam net 2, July 3, rackets that cheat unemployed youths by promising them jobs have become all too common because those responsible are seldom punished stringently.

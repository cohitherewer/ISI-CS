                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mom falls off terrace after teen suicide 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A mother lost in her thoughts after losing her teenaged daughter to suicide on Tuesday evening fell off the terrace the morning after, but a tin sunshade spared the family a second tragedy.        
	Neither the family nor police know yet whether Monica Sarkar, in her early 40s, attempted suicide like her 17-year-old daughter Sonia did.        
	But some neighbours did see the grieving mother, who has been admitted to the Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratisthan with leg injuries, moving towards the edge of the first-floor terrace of her Swiss Park house in a daze.        
	After landing on the sunshade, Monica rolled over and fell on some telephone and television cables before hitting the road in front of her house.        
	Had she fallen directly, it most probably would have been fatal. The impact of the crash was also reduced by the telephone and television cables that came in the way, a neighbour said.        
	Sonia, the eldest child of Monica and her husband Prabir, a businessman, had been found hanging by her dupatta from the ceiling of a room less than 12 hours earlier. She was depressed and had been undergoing psychiatric treatment.         
	Nobody in the Sarkars residence, including relatives and friends who stayed back to take care of the family, slept a wink through the night. But when Monica climbed the stairs to the terrace at dawn, some of them were dozing off and didnt realise that she was missing.        
	Monicas mother-in-law Shanti said she was in the toilet around 6am when she heard hurried footsteps on the stairs.         
	When I came out, I saw that everyone was rushing towards the terrace and I heard that someone had seen Monica going up. Within seconds, I heard a thud.         
	Shanti said Monica had barely spoken since her daughter died. Sonia was studying in Class XI at Patha Bhavan School. She was a very good student. We were very proud of her. But our world came crashing down on Tuesday when she hanged herself.        
	Sonia, who committed suicide around 7pm on Tuesday, had been taken to MR Bangur Hospital but doctors declared her dead.         
	The deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Vineet Goyal, confirmed that Sonia was undergoing treatment for depression. A case of unnatural death was registered with Charu Market police station.        
	The Sarkars also have a five-year-old son.

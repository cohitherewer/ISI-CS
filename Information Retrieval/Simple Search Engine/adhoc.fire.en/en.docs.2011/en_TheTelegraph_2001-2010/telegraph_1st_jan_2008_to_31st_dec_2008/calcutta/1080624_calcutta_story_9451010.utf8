                      Friends forever                    Revolving around the events of a Sunday evening, Mahesh Elkunchwars play Sonata offers an entertaining, yet discerning insight into the lives of three successful women in a modern, cosmopolitan society. Friends since their college days, they are now middle-aged. A banker, a professor and a journalist by profession, the three are well-settled in their respective careers and are single by choice. Through their lively, energetic interactions, the play examines their position in society. It articulates their relationships, aims, ideals, psychology and sexuality. In an apparently peaceful environment, the play sometimes explodes into numbing silences full of betrayals and unshed tears. What transcends all these is the love and bonding that the friends share, despite their differences. Well-knit and full of spontaneous wit and humour, the play is gracefully punctuated with Tagore songs and Beethovens Moonlight Sonata. Direction and performance: Sohag Sen.                  Event: Play in Indian-English, Sonata, produced by Ensemble When: Today at 7 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts

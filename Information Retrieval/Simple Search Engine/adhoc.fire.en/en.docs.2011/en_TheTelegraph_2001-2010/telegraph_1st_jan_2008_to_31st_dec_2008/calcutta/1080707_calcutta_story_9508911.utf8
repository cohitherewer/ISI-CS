The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ceremony houses seek HC reprieve
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ceremony houses seek HC reprieve
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Ceremony houses are moving court over civic body restrictions. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Owners of ceremony houses have moved court for a review of its decision to uphold a law that makes it mandatory for such buildings to be located on wide roads and have large parking spaces.        
	According to house-owners who let out their premises for weddings and other ceremonies, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)s new law could throw more than 2,000 of them out of business.         
	The civic authorities have ruled that a ceremony house should keep one-third of its plot area open for parking and that it must be located on a wide road. Only five per cent of ceremony houses have so much open space. Only 20 per cent of such buildings are located on broad roads, their petition states.         
	This is the second time that owners of ceremony houses have approached the court. Some of them had challenged the validity of the CMCs notification after it was published in the Calcutta Gazette on March 7, but the court dismissed the petition on May 11.        
	Those in the business argue that the CMC rule will not only affect them, but also people residing in apartments that have no extra space for even a small social gathering. Considering our problem and the possibility of citizens suffering after implementation of the new norms, the court should ask the CMC to revise its decision, the review petition states.        
	Under the new legislation, a building located within 500 metres of an educational institution, hospital or a place of worship cannot be converted into a ceremony house. Every ceremony house must be on a wide road and have the specified parking space, proper fire-fighting equipment and regular supply of pure drinking water.        
	 The rule has been framed for security reasons, and on the basis of the recommendations of Calcutta police and the pollution control board. We will inform the court about it when Justice Jayanta Biswas hears the review petition, said CMC counsel Alok Ghosh.         
	In 2003, a suit was filed in the same court against ceremony houses, accusing them of being public hazards. Justice Barin Ghosh directed the CMC not to allow houses in congested areas and narrow lanes to be converted into ceremony houses.

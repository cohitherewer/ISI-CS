          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth, possibly deranged, repeatedly stabbed a GRP driver who tried to help him when he fell down at Sonarpur railway station on Tuesday night.        
	Dipak Roy, 40, was discharged from hospital after treatment.        
	Raju Gupta, the youth, was beaten up by a mob before being rescued by the GRP and arrested.        
	When I gave him water, he said I would soon be punished, took a knife from a fruitseller and stabbed me, said Roy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | New York lessons in heritage upkeep
                                                                                                               New York lessons in heritage upkeep
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Demolition of the Pennsylvania Station triggered a public outcry in New York                                  
	New York City, 1963: Pennsylvania Station, a major commuter rail hub, is razed to the ground to make way for the new-look Madison Square Garden. A huge public outcry leads to the passage of the landmarks law two years on, which now protects nearly 23,000 iconic structures in New York.        
	Calcutta, 2008: Various authorities pay only lip service to protect the 1,300 listed heritage structures. The Strand warehouses continue to decay, and Dunlop House and the New Market square have been demolished.        
	An exhibition of photographs of protected New York landmarks has brought into sharp focus the failure of Calcuttas civic heads to preserve the citys architectural jewels.        
	The Landmarks of New York exhibition, presented by American Center and mounted at Palladian Lounge, presents a definitive history of New Yorks most treasured, significant and unusual structures.        
	Documented by American landmarks activist Barbaralee Diamonstein-Speilvogel, the exhibition is based on the impact of the landmarks law, which has put New York in the forefront of a worldwide preservation movement.        
	Its a pity that while New York, where property prices are at least 10 times higher than in Calcutta, has been able to protect its landmarks from real estate developers, our heritage structures are withering away or giving way to mindless highrises, said Partha Ranjan Das, an architect and urban designer.        
	New Yorkers could make it happen because of their level of awareness and sense of pride in their city, he added.        
	G.M. Kapoor of INTACH said there should be more public pressure and felt the exhibition should be an eye-opener for civic bosses and realtors.        
	We will be glad to share the contents of the landmarks legislation and it would be wonderful if any input could be derived and modified to suit the local context, said Moulik D. Berkana, the assistant public affairs officer of American Center. Berkana underlined that the landmarks law has played a critical role in helping New York retain its treasures, including Central Park.        
	We need more awareness and resources to make restoration viable, observed Anindo Karforma, who is on the CMC heritage panel.

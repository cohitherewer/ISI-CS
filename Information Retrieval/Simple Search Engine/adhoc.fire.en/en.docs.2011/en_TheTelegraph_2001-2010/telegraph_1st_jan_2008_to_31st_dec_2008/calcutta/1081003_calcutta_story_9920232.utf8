The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Spirit of good work shines through
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Spirit of good work shines through
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Dum Dum Park Tarun Sangha pandal in 2006, when it was adjudged Model Puja                                  
	When Ramapada Sarkar and Sasha Mondal walk up to the stage on Friday evening at the inauguration of the Dum Dum Park Tarun Sangha puja, they will be starting a new life, as owners of rickshaws that will be handed to them by the puja committee. And with that will be added another chapter to the clubs commitment to a cause represented by CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja.        
	Dum Dum Park Tarun Sangha was the Model Puja in 2006 but slipped to Three Star status in 2007. But that has only inspired them to step up their social work.         
	We keep at least Rs 1 lakh aside for helping people round the year, says Robin Mondol, the secretary of the Rs 7-lakh puja that is focussing on various forms of folk art this year.         
	Kalighats 66 Palli is another puja that has seen a fluctuation in True Spirit fortunes. Rated Two Star last year, the puja did its bit to popularise solar energy at its pandal.         
	Visitors from afar like Purulia and the Sunderbans took down the contact details for installing solar energy-lit lights from us. We could also reduce our power consumption by 10KW, says organiser Partha Sarathi Pathak. We are updating the services we render to visitors and the society by keeping up with technology.            
	The puja this year is highlighting the misuse of natural resources through its theme.         
	Gearing up for the True Spirit awards are also humble players like Ramgarh Jayashrinagar Adhibashibrinda in Dakshineshwar.         
	The puja picked up Two Stars on its debut last year. We cannot afford high-tech gear like CCTV but we did all that was mentioned in the contest brief, from drinking water to medical help desk to seating facilities for senior citizens. Earlier, we had no idea about such things. Participating in True Spirit Puja opened our eyes, says Rupam Das.         
	In fact, the recognition has started a new chapter in puja organisation in the area. Their Star-studded debut, Rupam says, has inspired other pujas in the area to think of visitor comfort. This year we are offering all of last years facilities and have added a water sprayer to improve our fire-fighting arrangement.         
	Another step in the True Spirit journey to a safer Puja.

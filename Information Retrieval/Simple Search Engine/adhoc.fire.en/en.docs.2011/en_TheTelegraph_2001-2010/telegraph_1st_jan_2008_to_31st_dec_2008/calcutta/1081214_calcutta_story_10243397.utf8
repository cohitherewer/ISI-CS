The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A dozen ways of doing IT
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A dozen ways of doing IT

	The unprecedented security at ITC Sonar on December 8 was not because of its high profile IT guest, recently turned author. It was a measure in the aftermath of the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai that led to the cancellation of some events.         
	One was Infosys chief Nandan Nilekanis Mumbai launch of his first book, scheduled on December 3 at the Oberoi-Trident, one of the places under siege.         
	While Nilekani seems to have an answer or rather an idea for every problem, terror remains out of his radar.         
	Of course, we have to sort out terrorism. We cannot allow a handful people to hold us, our country, to ransom. He is more vocal on other crucial areas of life: literacy, education, alternative energy and environment.         
	His book Imagining India, Ideas for the New Century is another 500 page tome on the India Shining theme. Written when the country was riding the crest of a robust 8 per cent economic growth, Nilekanis book is out at a time when the country is struggling to keep the growth rate at 7 per cent, economic meltdown has already delivered the pink slip to many, retail spending is hitting an all-time low and credit seems to have all but vanished from the market.         
	Yet all this doesnt render Imagining India obsolete. In fact, readers are taking to Nilekanis treatise like nothing before, pressing it past a number of bestsellers this year.         
	The co-architect of the IT boom in India with Narayan Murthy, Nandan has cleverly chronicled his tale of Indian success not chronologically or on the basis of personalities. Rather, he puts forth his 12 ideas about the nation.         
	Narrating Indias progress chronologically would not have worked when I began to tackle the future. Ideas seemed the best way to go about it. It works best in India. Things move here only when ideas get embedded, when the common man starts believing in it, said the Padma Bhushan awardee who was also the Forbes Best Business Man of the Year in Asia in 2007.         
	One big idea is the scope of IT in governance. Pointing at the telecast of the Assembly election results in the six states, Nilekani shrugs. This has been possible only because of IT. If it werent for EVMs it would take days to count the results.         
	IT, Nilekani says, could do a lot for the country.         
	For one, it could bring in a lot of transparency in administration, eliminate corruption, encourage self-service and bring government services to one and all at low cost. The dotcom bubble may have gone bust in private endeavours, but Nilekani remains bullish about that the potential of IT in governance.         
	He is also concerned about energy security and environment, the two debates that India, he says, will have to grapple with seriously.         
	He hails the nuclear deal with America. But adds: Nuclear energy will only account for five per cent of our energy needs. We need to think of alternative sources like wind, solar, bio-mass, geo-thermal. But he thoroughly enjoyed the intense debate that the country went through before the deal was ratified.         
	The debate almost brought down the government, but that is how democracy should function and ideas should be thrown around.         
	But political debate and its consequent fallout, political agitation, can also cripple progress, particularly in this state, as was seen in Singur.         
	There has to be a healthy debate, the rule of law should be allowed to prevail apart from anything else, says Nilekani. Agriculture alone cannot provide sustenance. Jobs need to be created in villages and to do that industrialisation is a must, whether on agricultural land or waste land.         
	Environment is another of his pet ideas that India should be debating. He proposes carbon taxing and carbon credits to encourage environment protection both by individuals and industries.         
	Having flown into the city in the morning for the Calcutta launch of Imagining India, Nilekani has already finished a CII lecture and is prepared to kick off a series of interviews before he rushes to the evenings programme of the launch of his book by governor and bibliophile Gopalkrishna Gandhi.         
	This spirit and energy helps Nilekani crack not just IT deadlocks, but also leads him on to the countrys mass of intricate and multi-layered problems. May he imagine on.                     ANASUYA BASU AND POULOMI BANERJEE

										                                    A students exhibits his pictorial description of the nature walk at Starmark. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray              
	Young nature lovers thronged Starmark bookstore on April 27 to celebrate Earth Day and narrate their nature walk experiences. The members of the in-house Star Trekkers Club had undertaken a walk to the Botanical Gardens on April 20, with environmentalist Kushal Mookherjee.        
	Many of the children had penned down their experiences or sketched their impressions of the walk. Said Angistha Basu, a Class VI student of Sri Aurobindo Institute of Education, Salt Lake: We gathered at 7.30 in the morning and spent the day amidst plants, birds and insects. I was most impressed by the 275-year-old banyan tree.         
	Others joined in describing what they saw  the kingfisher, cormorant, blue tiger butterfly, cuckoo and oriole. Indu Nair, mother of young Advait felt that the walk helped her see nature differently. She even learnt to identify different bird calls, she said.        
	Rishi Jatia, a Class VI student of Don Bosco, Park Circus was all smiles. Most interesting were the funny names of the plants, he said.         
	It is important to observe nature closely and take steps to reduce global warming, said Kushal Mookherjee, who was also present at Starmark. The environmentalist described the threat faced by the mangrove forests in Sunderbans if rising seawaters submerge them.         
	We must economise energy and water consumption. Todays lifestyle is too wasteful, he added.         
	Those who had missed the walk were treated to a slideshow of the photographs taken on the visit. Snapshots of the red dragonfly, the millipede, the langur spoke of the fun-filled experience.         
	The second part of the programme was devoted to Tilak Ranjan Beras presentation on the Andaman and Nicobar islands. The eye surgeon and photographers book Andaman and Nicobar: The Mysterious Bay Islands Of India provides an exhaustive study of the place. Bera said: The anthropological wealth of the Andamans is fascinating. If you go there you can write a book on any subject.         
	He presented a comprehensive study of the region, along with photographs. Post-tsunami images showed that the Jolly Buoy island had tilted and a portion of Car Nicobar lost. Trinket island has been fragmented into three parts and the Indira Point lighthouse has been further exposed to the sea. This was juxtaposed against the pre-tsunami images, evoking a strong response from the audience.         
	It is heartening to note that vegetation has naturally been restored in many places. In other regions, beaches have sprung up, sometimes on the opposite side of the island, said Bera. He also showed photographs of the Cellular Jail and Ross Island (earlier known as the Paris of the East) and of the tribals, in red ornaments, believed to be their favourite colour.

	An eye on health                             The winners with P.C. Sorcar and Surya Shekhar Ganguly        
	Don Bosco, Park Circus emerged winners at an inter-school health quiz organised by Apollo Health and Lifestyle  an Apollo Hospitals enterprise  at the Science City auditorium on May 3. Calcutta Girls High School and La Martiniere for Boys were the runners up. Open to students from classes VIII to XII, the contest drew attention to health issues through quirky questions like the full form of Complan (complete plan for human growth).         
	The quiz was hosted in two levels, with over 450 students from 39 schools in Calcutta and Howrah participating in the written elimination round. The teams, comprising two members each, had to answer a series of 20 questions. Six teams, including WWA Cossipore English School and Mansur Habibullah Memorial School, were shortlisted for the final round. There were four rounds, innovatively designed, where questions ranged from the meaning of thanatophobia (fear of death), to how malaria came to be so called (malaria means bad air).         
	In the Treadmill round, the questions were part of a crossword, with the correct answers completing the puzzle. In Clinical Approach one could choose to answer questions on topics like technology and health care. Medcyclopaedia was about correlating audio/ visual clips with a corresponding disease. So participants connected Bum bum bole from Taare Zameen Par with dyslexia.         
	Some of the audio visual questions stumped the audience who were tested on recent innovations like edible crockery and bio-compatible batteries that can be charged by human waste matter. A balanced lifestyle is crucial for a smooth living, and school students must be made aware of it,said Ratan Jalan, CEO of Apollo Health.         
	The final round saw a neck-to-neck battle among the teams as they were questioned on common human diseases and their causes, medical discoveries and preventive healthcare. Many of the questions required in-depth knowledge. It was a stiff competition, said one of the winners Pushan Banerjee, a Class X student from Don Bosco. Members of the winning team received gift cheques of Rs 5000 each, the first and second runners up receiving cheques of Rs 3500 and Rs 2500 respectively.

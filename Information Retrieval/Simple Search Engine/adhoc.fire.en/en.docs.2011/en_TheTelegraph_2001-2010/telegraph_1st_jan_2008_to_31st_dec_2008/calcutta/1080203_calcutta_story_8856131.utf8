	Bloggers have strong words on the high court ban on the Book Fair at Park Circus Maidan. They are a divided lot. 
    
	Some feel that an exception could be made for the fair, as it is a special event. 
    
	Though aware of the pollution and traffic problems that could be caused by the fair, Greatbong (Arnab Ray), based in Maryland, US, writes: With the advent of the Internet and the new media, small exhibitors and publishers have been the worst hit and at least for me, its they who are at the heart of what makes the Book Fair such a unique experience. Cancelling the Book Fair or having it in some distant location may force these small players out of the game.
    
	One hopes that the concept of Sarbojonin Durga Pujo on the city streets is not the next thing caught in the crosshair, he says.
    
	Rimi B. Chatterjee, who teaches at Jadavpur University and is the author of the novel The City of Love, blogs on http://rimibchatterjee.net /livelikeaflame. This is public shame. Not many people know or care that Calcutta is bidding for the city of literature status from UNESCO this year. If there could be anything calculated to show in graphic detail how unfit we are for this title, the Book Fair farce is it. She is also worried about the fate of small publishers who must be harder hit because of the fiasco. 
    
	On Orkut, Somnath Mitra, a Howrah boy now in Germany, says on his community on the Calcutta Book Fair that he sympathises with the environmentalists, but feels that a fortnights fair could not cause great harm. Theo bursts into poetry: But if the Book Fair held oer me/ You said, it will make me desert. Presumably its Park Circus Maidan speaking. 
    
	There are those agreeing with the court decision. 
    
	As a book lover its my opinion that the Book Fair needs to be held every year. But we should also be concerned about our environment. Its not just that the Book Fair at Maidan should be shifted to a permanent mela ground, but all political meetings and gatherings should also be banned, says Shashi in the book fair community on Orkut.
    
	Shirsanya blames the people as much as the guild for the harm done to the Maidan, where the fair would be held previously. How many of us raise our voice against the dirty stretches on the Maidan, how many of us made proper use of the dustbins installed at the Book Fair, how many of us asked the person beside us not to smoke? he says. 
    
	A few are scathingly sarcastic, like Amlan: My grandfather used to relieve himself on the banks of the Ganges. I feel very nostalgic about it and want to do the same. Please support my cause. Ahem! 
    
	Another Amlan, Amlan Ray, says: I have always been against the idea of having the Book Fair on the Maidan for reasons of pollution. For Park Circus also, I will say a big NO!
    
	Souvik however, feels that the fair should have been held on the Maidan and the guild should have been asked to pay for cleaning up the mess afterwards. In case of default, they could have been asked to shift somewhere else, he says.
    
	Ram Ramaswamy, who teaches physics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, and blogs on Scholars Without Borders (http://swblogs. blogspot.com), says: The entire episode has a tragic air to it... and all for want of some foresight on the part of all parties concerned. Having seen the usual cast of characters  the politicians, book lovers, authors and publishers  express their outrage on national television, one wonders, did nobody see it coming? The things that we truly care about should not be taken so lightly.

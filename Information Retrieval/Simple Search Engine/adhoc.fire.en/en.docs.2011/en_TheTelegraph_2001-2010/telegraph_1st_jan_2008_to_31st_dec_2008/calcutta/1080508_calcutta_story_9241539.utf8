                      Apathy and prejudice                    To mark Rabindra Jayanti, Little Thespian pays homage to Tagore with Katha Collage- 3, a stage presentation of two short-stories by him. The third of a series, katha performances present a collage of two or more stories by well-known authors, with minimum dramatisation of the text. This evenings two-part collage features Shesher Raatri (in Bengali; a scene from it appears right) and Duraasha (in Urdu/Hindi). A story of love and indifference, the former is about Mani, a young, bubbly girl married to Jatin, who is terminally ill. Jatins aunt disapproves of Mani, who has little interest in her husband or her household duties. When Mani leaves for her paternal home to attend a ceremony, Jatins aunt tries to console him by portraying Mani in a favourable light. But the illusion breaks and Jatin learns the bitter truth before long. Mani returns and repents, but it is already too late. Duraasha, a tragic tale of love, shows how true devotion led a Muslim princess to change her entire identity and existence, only to be forsaken due to her Hindu lovers false bigotry. Design and direction: Uma Jhunjhunwala.                  Event: Katha Collage- 3, plays presenting two short-stories of Tagore, produced by Little Thespian When: Today at 7 pm Where: Padatiks Buildwell Theatre, 6/7 AJC Bose Road

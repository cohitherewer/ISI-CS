          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two people were suspected to have died of malaria and one of dengue the day after the health minister warned that vector-borne diseases could spread if winter arrived late.        
	Sandhya Patra, 42, and Sukanta Das, 50, from Behala, died after suffering high fever that, according to doctors, might have been caused by malaria. Their blood test reports are not available.        
	The death certificate of 52-year-old Trinamul leader Ratan Sarkar, a resident of Kasba, stated renal failure as the cause. But his family members and Trinamul supporters claimed he died of dengue.        
	The vector death toll this season has crossed 25.

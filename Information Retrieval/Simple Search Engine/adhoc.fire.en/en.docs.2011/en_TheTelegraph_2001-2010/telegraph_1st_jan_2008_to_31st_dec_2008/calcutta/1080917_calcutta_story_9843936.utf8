          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Six persons were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly trying to construct a building on the Beniapukur Road premises of a church on the basis of a false power of attorney. The accused include the three trustees of the House of Prayer and Good News and the promoter.         
	The detective department stared investigating the case in April following a directive from the high court. Edwin Ashim Kumar Bala, one of the trustees, informed the court that his signature on the vakalatnama had been forged. He also claimed that he had not signed the power of attorney.         
	The probe revealed that Balas signature on the vakalatnama was forged but he had signed the power of attorney, said an investigator. Edwin and the other two trustees were arrested for producing a fake power of attorney in court.        
	Mousumi Dey, who was given the power of attorney, and Dilip Biswas, who signed the document as a witness, were also arrested. Biswas had used another persons photograph instead of his own.        
	Khalid Masood, the promoter of the building, was the other witness.        
	The power of attorney was fake. Those arrested will be produced in court on Wednesday, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.

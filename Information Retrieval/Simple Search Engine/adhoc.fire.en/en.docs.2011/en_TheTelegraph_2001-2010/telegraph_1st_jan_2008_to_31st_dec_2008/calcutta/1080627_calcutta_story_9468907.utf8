	Calcutta and its suburbs suffered widespread power cuts on Thursday following low generation by the Kolaghat and Bakreswar power plants because of dwindling coal stocks.         
	The situation is unlikely to improve in the next few days.        
	West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited could supply only 383 MW to the CESC grid on Thursday, against a requirement of 508 MW.        
	The shortfall in the CESC-served areas was 125 MW in the evening peak hours.         
	The situation in the districts was worse, with a 440 MW shortfall.         
	Large parts of the city and its adjoining areas suffered power cuts from 10am till night. The power cuts ranged between one hour and two hours, said a power department official.         
	There was restriction imposed on the supply to the CESC grid by the state electricity distribution company and so power cuts could not be avoided, said Dilip Sen, the executive director of CESC.

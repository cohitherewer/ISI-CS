          Todays question: What can be done to restore normalcy in Bengal Engineering and Science University? More letters will be published next week                    Cauldron of chaos: Students on a sit-in on campus
                                    
	Indranil Sanyal,

	The intermittent disturbances at BE College not only disrupt the educational system, but also affect students progress. To restore normalcy, the administrators must find out the core issues. The offenders must be brought to book and disciplinary measures taken. Else, the century- old institution will start losing its reputation.                 Shankha Shuvro Chattopadhyay, 
  Dhakuria								       
	Frankly speaking, discipline should be strictly imposed on students. How are they getting the cheek to misbehave? Frequent clashes are happening there. Besu is Bengals pride. The authorities and the students seem to have no regard for that! Otherwise the college founded in 1856 may face a serious problem.           Priyanka Dutta, 
  Nagerbazar								       
	Within the span of a few weeks, an institution of national importance has denuded itself. The vice-chancellor sounds desperate as the recent unrest may hamper campus recruitment. He himself has admitted that two IT companies have expressed the futility of conducting interviews in such a disturbed environment. If recruitment stops, the basic aim of a technological university will be affected. Steps should be taken by the state government to ensure peace on the campus.                Tapan Pal, 
  Batanagar								       
	Among all the stakeholders of Besu, the behaviour of the teachers is most bizarre. They earn their livelihood by teaching but they failed to imbibe the right set of values in their disciples. Maintaining peace on the campus is not the duty of the vice-chancellor alone. They are keen to escape responsibility whereas they are very assertive about their rights. No wonder that with such a band of teachers, Besu is perennially in trouble.

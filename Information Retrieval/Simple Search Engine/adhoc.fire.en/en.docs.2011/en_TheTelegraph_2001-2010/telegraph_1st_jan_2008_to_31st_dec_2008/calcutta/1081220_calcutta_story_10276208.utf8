                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Winter full blast in a few days
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	After keeping Calcutta waiting longer than usual this year, winter is showing signs of being colder than normal.        
	Mornings will get cooler from now on. Expect the full winter blast over the next few days, the weatherman said on Friday, the coldest day of the season so far.        
	The minimum temperature on Friday was 15.1 degrees Celsius, a degree above normal, but the maximum temperature was 24.1 degrees, three points below normal.        
	The maximum temperature on the same day last year  the warmest recorded winter in the world  had been 31.2 degrees Celsius.        
	Unlike in the past two days, there was no cloud layer blocking the suns rays on Friday, which is why the city didnt feel the drop in temperature.        
	Calcuttans could not enjoy what we call daytime because the sky was clear by 8.30am. But the signs are that there will be a significant dip in the minimum temperature from Saturday, said Asish Kumar Sen, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The chill factor will be accentuated by the free movement of the North Wind, which blew across the city on Friday at around 20km per hour, Sen said.        
	The blanket of fog that heralded winter in the city remained active, too. Flight timings went haywire on Thursday night because of poor visibility and the ripple effect was felt on Friday morning.        
	Airport officials said nine Calcutta-bound flights were diverted. The runway was idle from 10.35pm till around 2am with fog preventing aircraft from touching down even with the help of the Category II Instrument Landing System.

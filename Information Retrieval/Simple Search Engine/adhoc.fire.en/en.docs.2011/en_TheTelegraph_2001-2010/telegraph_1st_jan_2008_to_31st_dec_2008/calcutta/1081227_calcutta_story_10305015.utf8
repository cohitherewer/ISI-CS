The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City cops shy of bullseye
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       City cops shy of bullseye
  - Half of 400-odd officers fail test, brass not bothered          KINSUK BASU                                                      
	Candidates: 416        
	Failed: 198        
	The report card is of the field operatives of Calcutta police  inspectors and sub-inspectors. The skill put to test is what each is supposed to be an expert in  shooting.        
	The target test result is alarming if Calcuttans are banking on their cops to tackle a Mumbai siege-like emergency.        
	The 18-day test with 9mm pistols, held earlier this month at the Police Training School, was attended by the officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations, along with their second-in-command and sub-inspectors. There were two categories  single hand (a cop has to fire holding the pistol in one hand) and based on hands (the hand holding the pistol has to rest on the other). Each officer had to fire 20 rounds.        
	Out of 100, a candidate had to score at least 50 in the two categories to make the grade. Hitting the bullseye fetched 5, anywhere near it, 3. Which means the 198 officers who failed did not just miss the target, they were way off the mark.        
	Officers from all divisions and specialised wings like the detective department took part in the test. The result was disappointing. Unlike on other occasions, the ammunition this time was not dated. So, there can be no excuse for failing, said a senior officer of the detective department.        
	What do the candidates have to say about their shooting skills? The daily grind of law-and-order duty leaves us with no time to practise shooting, grumbled a target-shy officer.        
	The top brass, however, is not losing sleep over the poor show. Shooting skill can never be the first priority in civil policing. To tackle terrorists or a hostage situation, specialised forces with sharp shooting skills are brought in. Calcutta police has a combat force that can boast such skills, said additional commissioner Sivaji Ghosh.

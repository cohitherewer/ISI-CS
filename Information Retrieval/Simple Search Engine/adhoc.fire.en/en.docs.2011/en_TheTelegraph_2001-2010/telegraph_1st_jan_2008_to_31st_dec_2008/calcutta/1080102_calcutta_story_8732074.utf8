     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Drunken driving by New Year revellers claimed four lives in the city on Tuesday. On the northern fringes, an illegally operated discotheque was shut down after drunk customers passed lewd comments at local residents.
    
	Deepankar Hazra, 27, was killed after a car crashed into the mini-van he was driving at the intersection of Chetla Central Road and Pyari Mohan Roy Road around 2.30am. Hazra died on the way to SSKM Hospital. 
    
	The four passengers in the car, one of them a woman, were injured. The four were returning from a New Years Eve party at a Park Street hangout. The driver of the car was tested to ascertain whether he was drunk. The report is pending. Witnesses said both vehicles were moving at high speed.
    
	In another mishap around 1.30am, three drunk youths from Kshudiram Pally, in Sodepur, were killed on ML Gupta Road in Thakurpukur.
    
	Police said the youths  identified as Arun Krishna Mazumdar, 24, Pradeep Adhikari, 26, and Soumitra Sarkar, 25, were returning home on two motorcycles after attending a New Years Eve party.
    
	Mazumdars motorcycle skidded off the road and hit a lamp post. He and pillion-rider Sarkar fell into a drain. Adhikari fell down after hitting Mazumdars motorcycle as it skid to a stop on the road.
    
	Residents of the area took the trio, who used to deal in building material, to MR Bangur Hospital. The three were declared brought dead.
    
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said: We are waiting for the post-mortem report to find out the cause of the mishap.
    
	At the other end of town, cops and excise department officials raided Spice Garden, a bar near Teghoria, on VIP Road, and closed it down. The police said an illegal discotheque was being run there. 
    
	Residents of a neighbouring housing complex had complained to the police that drunken revellers had been passing lewd comments at women since the evening.
    
	We checked and found that the discotheque was being run without a licence and closed it down, said North 24-Parganas police superintendent Supratim Sarkar.
    
	He claimed that policemen had been posted outside every bar on VIP Road to prevent drunk revellers from driving cars or riding motorcycles.

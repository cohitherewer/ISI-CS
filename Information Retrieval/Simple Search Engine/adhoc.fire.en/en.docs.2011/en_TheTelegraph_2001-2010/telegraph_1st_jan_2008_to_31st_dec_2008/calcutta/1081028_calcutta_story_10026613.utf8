                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       False claim rap for two officers
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The officers-in-charge of two police stations have got a dressing-down from top cop Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti for making false statements on their achievements        
	Shyamal Sengupta, of Chetla police station, told Chakrabarti that his men had seized more than 100 kg of banned fireworks before Puja. In reality, the cops had bought the items from the market and included them on the seizure list.        
	Debashis Baidya, of Lake police station, made a dubious claim about the recovery of a gold chain, prompting the police commissioner to order a probe against him.        
	The occasion was the monthly crime conference at Lalbazar. The officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations, divisional deputy commissioners and the assistant commissioners were present in the October 24 meeting with reports of their month-long activities.        
	Soon after the meeting started, Sengupta submitted a list of banned crackers, weighing more than 100 kg, which he claimed his men had seized during the pre-Puja drive.        
	But the commissioner knew the claim was false. He pointed out that the crackers were not seized but bought from South 24-Parganas, said an officer who was present at the meeting. Sengupta kept mum. Chakrabarti warned Sengupta not to make such false claims again.        
	Next came Baidyas turn. The commissioner asked him why incidents of snatching was on the rise in his area. Baidya admitted the fact but added that his men were also recovering snatched items.        
	Citing an example, Baidya said a team from Lake police station had recently rounded up a youth and recovered part of a gold chain he had snatched from a pedestrian.        
	But why did your men fail to recover the entire chain? And, did the accused identify the chain? an officer quoted Chakrabarti as asking Baidya. The officer-in-charge could not give a satisfactory answer to the first question. As for the second, he said the accused had not identified the chain.        
	Chakrabarti then ordered a joint commissioner to probe Baidyas claim.

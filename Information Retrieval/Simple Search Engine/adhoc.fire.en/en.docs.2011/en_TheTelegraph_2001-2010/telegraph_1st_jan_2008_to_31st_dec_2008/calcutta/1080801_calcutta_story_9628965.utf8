                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       UGC calls for JU facility upgrade
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Jadavpur University has passed the University Grants Commission (UGC)s test on all counts except in infrastructure.        
	The 11-member team has asked the university to expand its infrastructure to accommodate more students, staff and research projects.        
	The space crunch needs to be addressed so that more students can study. Certain departments have 50 seats each but get over 5,000 applications, said G. D. Sharma, the pro vice-chancellor of Assam University, who was on the UGC team.        
	The team has suggested that the university construct more hostels and staff quarters, increase manpower and boost research.        
	We plan to construct more buildings and add more floors to the existing ones as soon as we get funds, said vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh.        
	The university will try to introduce a bachelors course in education and a masters in geography by the end of the year and a postgraduate course in nuclear engineering later.        
	All three will run by the 2009-2010 academic year, said Ghosh. The team praised the universitys interdisciplinary approach, terming it rare.

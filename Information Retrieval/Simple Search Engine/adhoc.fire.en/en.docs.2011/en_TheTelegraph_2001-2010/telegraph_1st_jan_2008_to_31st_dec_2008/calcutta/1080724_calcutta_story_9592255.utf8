                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Protest at CSTC depot 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Passengers agitate at the CSTC depot. A Telegraph picture    
	Around 100 passengers blocked the gate of the CSTCs Salt Lake depot on Wednesday to protest the decision to withdraw the three special buses from the Garia-Karunamoyee route.        
	The CSTC authorities allegedly decided to withdraw the service following a fight between a section of passengers and the conductor of one of the buses on Monday.        
	The passengers alleged that the conductor had charged more than the stipulated fare. He shouted us down when we asked him to show the fare chart. CSTC is trying to teach us a lesson as we had raised our voice against the malpractice, said Anal Bose, one of the protesting passengers.        
	The withdrawal of the service inconvenienced several south Calcutta residents who work in various government offices in Salt Lake. The three special buses ran from 4.30pm to 6pm.        
	We met depot officials on Tuesday afternoon. They told us that one reason for taking the buses off the road was our alleged misbehaviour with the conductor, said a passenger.        
	The altercation prompted us to withdraw the buses. Besides, the service was not commercially viable, said depot manager P.P. Guhathakurtha.

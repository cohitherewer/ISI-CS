                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Deepika cant stay without Ranbir
  - Bengali dinner for Bolly star couple and Bipasha on promotional          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          As the starstruck crowds continued to hound them, Ranbir Kapoor and Bipasha Basu sought refuge behind a Bachna Ae Haseeno billboard at Fame (South City). Picture by Aranya Sen				                                       
	Saturday night saw an unexpected guest landing in the city. While Ranbir Kapoor and Bipasha Basu were expected to hit town for a Bachna Ae Haseeno promotional bout, their co-passenger was not slated to board the Delhi-Calcutta flight.        
	But Deepika Padukone could not spend a day without her beau, and just as Saif-Kareena had stormed the city together a few months back, so did Bollywoods current hottest couple Ranbir-Deepika. He in a casual green T-shirt, she in a gorgeous red gown.        
	I didnt plan to come here, confessed Deepika when Metro got in touch with her on Sunday afternoon. That wasnt too difficult with the Om Shanti Om beauty holed up in her room at the ITC The Sonar, even as Ranbir and Bipasha went to Fame (South City) to talk about their film, which releases this Friday.        
	Deepika, although a part of the film, was, however, in no mood for work, having already done her promotion bit in Delhi on Saturday evening. I didnt have to do anything here its been a relaxing trip, she smiled. When asked whether it was Ranbirs company that brought her to Calcutta, Deepika chose to play safe. I am really fond of Calcutta and I have been to the city many, many times before. So, its been good eating a lot of local food.         
	The eating started on Saturday night itself when Ranbir, Deepika and Bipasha hit the Sonar coffee shop Eden Pavilion for a true-blue Bengali dinner. Luchi, kasha mangsho, galda chingri, sandesh, mishti doi they had little to complain about.         
	Oh, we called from Delhi to fix the menu, laughed Bipasha. The erstwhile Mandeville Gardens girl, in fact, guided Ranbir and Deepika through the Bengali menu, explaining to them the importance of chholar dal with luchi.                  Deepika Padukone      
	But Deepika didnt share her saawariyas love for mishti doi. While Raj Kapoors grandson confessed I just love rosogolla and mishti doi, Prakash Padukones daughter didnt approve of the taste, almost jumping out of her seat when Ranbir spooned a tiny bit into her mouth.        
	Bipasha, on the other hand, gorged on all the mishti on offer.         
	Sunday lunch was at Peshawari for the Bachna... trio, accompanied by the films director Siddharth Raj Anand. It was a welcome meal for Ranbir and Bipasha after all the scuffles and brawls they were witness to at Fame (South City), where the plex audience and journalists all wanted their share of the stars.         
	Deepika, however, just chilled at the hotel, away from the madding crowd, waiting for her Ranbir to return to her so they could fly back to Mumbai together in the evening.         
	I did the film (Bachna...) for many other reasons but yes its true that it was during the shooting that I met Ranbir and that is the reason it will always stay special to me, smiled the lady in love.

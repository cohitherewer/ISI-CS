The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rally ban at hospitals
                                                                                                            Rally ban at hospitals
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	The executive magistrate of Alipore court on Thursday banned all political activities within 200 metres of BM Birla Heart Research Centre and Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) and imposed Section 144 CrPC on the adjoining compounds. The order was passed on a petition by police.        
	The CMRI-BM Birla Employees Union was to picket the gates of CMRI for an indefinite period from Friday.        
	We have been struggling to stop the unions from holding demonstrations inside the hospitals for the past few months. The order will be of great help, said a senior officer of Alipore police station.        
	While the CMRI Staff Union is dominated by Trinamul Congress supporters, Congress supporters control the CMRI-BM Birla Employees Union, said hospital officials.        
	The authorities of both hospitals had approached the police for help to ensure union meetings and demonstrations did not disrupt work.        
	The unions would compete with each other to seek permission to hold demonstrations. There was no alternative but to approach the court, added the officer.        
	On August 11 last year, members of the two unions fought in the CMRI Hospital compound. Two people were seriously injured, said another police officer.        
	Members of both unions refused comment.

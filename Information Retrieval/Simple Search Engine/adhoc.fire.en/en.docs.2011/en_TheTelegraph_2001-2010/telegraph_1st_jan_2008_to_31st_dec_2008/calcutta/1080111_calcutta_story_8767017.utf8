     OUR LEGAL REPORTER
             Morning-walkers have told Calcutta High Court that the ban on their cars being parked near the monument is only adding to the pollution. A Telegraph picture
                 
	Morning-walkers using the Victoria Memorial lawns have moved Calcutta High Court, seeking modification of an order banning car parking within a km of the monument.
    
	The appeal petition, filed on Thursday, is likely to come up for hearing next week.
    
	The high court, after a hearing that lasted five years, had ordered the ban to protect the monument on the Maidan from air pollution.
    
	Since the order came into force, our drivers park the cars at a distance after dropping us at the Memorial. After a certain time, the cars come again to the gate and pick us up. This journey to and fro is adding to the air pollution around the Memorial, said a petitioner.
    
	The morning-walkers want the earlier system to be restored, so they can park their cars outside the compound. We believe the earlier system was less polluting, they argued.
    
	The petitioners have also prayed for an order asking the authorities to conduct a pollution test on the Maidan in the morning to ascertain whether what we are saying is correct or not.
    
	Environment activist Subhash Dutta said: The morning-walkers have raised a vital point. Let the court decide. 
    
	Memorial sources said around 1,000 people, most of them in cars, visit the compound daily in the morning.

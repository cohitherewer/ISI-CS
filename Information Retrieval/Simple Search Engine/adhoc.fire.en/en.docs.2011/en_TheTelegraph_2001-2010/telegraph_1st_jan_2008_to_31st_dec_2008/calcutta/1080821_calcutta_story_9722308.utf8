                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sector V mirror image of Writers
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had a busy day at Writers Buildings on Wednesday but those employed in his favoured tech hub could not even make it to work.        
	This is by far the worst bandh in Sector V. Companies usually arrange to pick up workers at dawn on bandh days. This time we couldnt even do that, said the CEO of a call centre.         
	At less than 10 per cent, the overall attendance in the IT offices was only a shade better than at Writers Buildings, where the chief minister, his cabinet colleague Nirupam Sen and some departmental secretaries turned up.         
	Bigger companies like Cognizant Technology Solutions and Tata Consultancy Services registered attendance of about 10 per cent but many small and medium IT firms were closed.        
	The usual hangouts of techies  outside the Infinity Building, the snack counters in front of TCS and the tea stalls near IBM  were empty.         
	The Citu leadership linked the low attendance to the success of the strike. The IT employees spontaneously supported the strike. We know how to run trade unions in the IT sector. So more workers there will join us in the future, said Citu state president and CPM MP Shyamal Chakraborty.         
	When reminded the chief minister had exempted Sector V from the bandh, Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh said: We have no difference with the chief minister on this issue. The government can assure help to the IT companies to run their operations smoothly, but it was up to the employees to decide whether they would work.        
	People in the industry blamed the poor attendance on the collapse of the public transport system and fear of violence.        
	If the strike was not backed by the Left, the scene would have been much different. People knew the Left parties were behind the strike and did not dare to venture out, said a senior official of an IT company.        
	S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which administers Sector V, claimed no one was stopped from going to work.

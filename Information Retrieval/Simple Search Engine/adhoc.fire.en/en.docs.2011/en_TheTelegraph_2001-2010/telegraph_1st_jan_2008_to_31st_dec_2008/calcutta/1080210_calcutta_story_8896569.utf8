                      The conflict within                    Capturing the antithetic moods and rhythms that typify the life of modern man, Fragments of Life, the ongoing exhibition, unfolds, within itself, the continuity of expression in the history of Indian art. Featuring paintings by a group of five artists, it brings to focus themes that have dominated their collective creative psyche. Biswajit Saha trains his palette to highlight human abuse. Biswanath Roy expresses the dichotomy of contemporary life through his expression of art. Debasish Ghosh also articulates his concern for the duality ingrained in every human being. The characters in Munindra Rajbongshis (a painting by him appears along) paintings reveal the fluid, mercurial emotions that rule the inner life of man. Rupa Rajbongshi paints men and women with a perfect blend of imagination and realism that adorns them with true grace.                  Event: A group exhibition of paintings When: Till February 15; 1 pm - 8 pm Where: Silpi Art Gallery, 32A Judges Court Road

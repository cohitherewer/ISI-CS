                      Crafted with metal and clay                    Set up with an aim to revive traditional crafts of Bengal and give them a new identity, Mrittika Foundation has been a cradle to Bengals folk arts and crafts since its inception in February 2006. Inside its sprawling campus, potters craft innovative pots at the wheel, while dokra artists give shape to human figures. Weavers on looms translate designs into yardages, while kaantha artists produce intricate embroidery. Once complete, these handicrafts, intrinsic to the soul of rural Bengal, occupy pride of place in the world of fashion and lifestyle. Besides its mission to generate awareness about traditional arts and crafts of West Bengal in their contemporised and stylised form, Mrittika also offers rural artisans a platform to showcase their creativity. Expressions in Dokra and Terracotta, the ongoing exhibition of dokra and terracotta items, is a celebration of the true potential and versatility of these age-old crafts. It also reinstates traditional artisans to their rightful status as artists. According to Malini Mondal of Mrittika Foundation, These works of art can be adapted to newer manifestations at any time and age, and be accepted as part of the world and socio-cultural scenario.

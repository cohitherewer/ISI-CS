                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Drive to curb dog menace at stations
          A STAFF REPORTER                      An NGO has sterilised 35 strays at Sealdah station. A Telegraph picture                          
	The railway authorities have turned to an NGO to tackle the dog menace at Howrah and Sealdah stations after being refused help by the civic bodies.        
	We had repeatedly approached the civic authorities for help but they advised us to get in touch with NGOs, said a railway official in Sealdah.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) told the railway authorities that they had stopped killing strays. They only act against rabid dogs, said the official.        
	Love-N-Care for Animal, which has already started sterilising strays at Sealdah station, will soon start a similar project in Howrah.        
	Over the past month, we have sterilised 35 dogs at Sealdah, said Sushmita Roy, of Love-N-Care for Animal.         
	Apart from the station premises, the drive covers BR Singh Hospital and the compound of the divisional railway managers office.         
	A survey by Love-N-Care for Animal revealed that there were more strays in Howrah than in Sealdah.        
	Around 20 lakh passengers pass through the two stations daily and incidents of dog bites are reported frequently, said an official. The animals also litter the station premises.        
	In a year or two, the dog count in both stations will come down substantially, Roy said. The NGO is providing the service for free.        
	Asked why the civic body refused to come to the help of the railway authorities, chief municipal health official DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay said: The civic body handed over the responsibility of sterilising strays to NGOs in 1998. Even our dog pounds have been handed over to the NGOs.        
	Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said: We dont have the infrastructure to sterilise strays. We ask people to take the help of NGOs.

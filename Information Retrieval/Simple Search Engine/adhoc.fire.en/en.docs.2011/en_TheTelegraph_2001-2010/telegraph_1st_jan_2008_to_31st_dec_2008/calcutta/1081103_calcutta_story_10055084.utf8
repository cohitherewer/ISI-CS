                      Celebration of colours and forms                    Artists, young and old, come together to showcase their works in Creation, the ongoing annual exhibition of paintings and sculptures hosted by Gallery Exposure. The show is an absolute delight for art lovers, presenting an amazing range of colours and forms, each carrying its unique meaning, depth and dimension. Featuring works by renowned artists Shyamal Sen (a painting by him appears here), Jogen Chowdhury, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay and Bimal Kundu, the show also includes art works by young, rising talents. A master of transparent watercolours, Sens painting depicts the barren, rocky terrains of Birbhum with its typical red laterite soil. The hill, popularly known as Mama Bhagney Pahaar, has stood silent witness to the regions history over hundreds of years and is a major tourist attraction. The artist has portrayed the landscape in minute detail, perfectly reproducing the sparse vegetation and arid lands of the area in his distinctive, inimitable style.

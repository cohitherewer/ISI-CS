                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Reunion, Ryan and rare resolve
  - Xaviers old boys usher in 150th year, PM to unveil celebrations in Jan          A STAFF REPORTER                          A sombre moment during Xaviers 149. Picture by Pabitra Das                  Shyamal Chakravarty with son Ryans award				                                       
	Ten years ago, Captain Ryan Chakravartys mother, Wendy, would come to the St Xaviers Collegiate School ground for the annual sports days. She could not believe that her son was being felicitated on the same premises by such an august gathering on Friday.        
	Ryan, a team leader in the counter-hijack task force for the rescue mission of Mumbai, was given the Alsoc Award at Xaviers 149, the reunion organised by the alumni association. Shyamal Chakravarty, a retired Calcutta police officer, collected the award on behalf of his 28-year-old son who was busy at work with the National Security Guard.        
	The spirit of the braveheart who epitomises the school motto of Nihil Ultra (Nothing Beyond) seemed to infuse the evening that marked the beginning of a special year. Some amongst us thought we should scrap the entertainment bit of this years reunion. We dwelt on this but then decided to go ahead full throttle with the programme. If we didnt then it would be a victory for the terrorists, said Noomi Mehta, the secretary of Alsoc (Alumnorum Societas).        
	Xaviers 149 for the old boys signalled the start of the 150th-year celebrations but the big bang will be the Xaviers foundation day function in mid-January. The Prime Minister of India and the chief minister of Bengal have both accepted invitations to attend the function, announced Mehta, amidst cheers.        
	Headmaster Father Jerome Francis dwelt on what the school still means to the old boys, who not only look forward to the reunion but do a lot of work for the institution round the year.                          
	The centrepiece of the decoration bordering the school ground was a hall of fame stall with photographs of ex-students like Rabindranath Tagore, Jagadish Chandra Bose and Raj Kapoor, and the words: And when we leave our portal so dear/Well ner forget our Alma Mater.        
	Aveek Sarkar, the chief guest for the evening, mirrored that mood by recalling instances of meeting Xaverians in various parts of the world, often in the unlikeliest of circumstances. The school has taught us to think for ourselves, form our own opinions and stand for our beliefs, said the Xaverian.        
	Desmond Reden, who taught in the school from 1971 to 2005, was felicitated during the function.        
	The evening that began with the current house captains ringing the school bell and a minutes silence being observed in memory of the dear and departed, ended with the school anthem being sung and the sign of All for 150 flashing to mark a new beginning.

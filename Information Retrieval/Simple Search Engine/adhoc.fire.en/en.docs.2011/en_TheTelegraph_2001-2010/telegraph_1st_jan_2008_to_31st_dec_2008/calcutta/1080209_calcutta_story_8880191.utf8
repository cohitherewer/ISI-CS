                                                                                                            Taxi tiff leads to ransack
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A group of youths went on a rampage in a Sarat Bose Road restaurant on Thursday night over a tiff with the employees. Three of the youths were arrested.        
	The incident took place around 11.15pm after the two groups quarrelled over hiring a taxi  the only one available at that hour.         
	The restaurant workers and the youths tried to board the taxi at the same time. The driver chose to take the workers to their destination. This left the youths fuming.        
	They attacked the employees, before entering the restaurant with wickets in hand. The youths broke glass panes, smashed a music system and some flowerpots, said restaurant owner Manik Lal Banik, who was at the cash counter when the group barged in.         
	He called the police after being informed about the incident on the road by one of his employees.        
	It was difficult to make out whether they were local residents, Banik added.         
	Dipak Banerjee, Sankar Som and Prasanta Khaskel, all residents of Raja Basanta Roy Road, were arrested in this connection.        
	According to the police, it wasnt an isolated incident. After a similar tiff a few nights back, the local youths had warned the workers that they wouldnt be allowed to hire taxis at night by offering extra money.        
	The workers at the restaurant would generally hire taxis at night by paying extra. This often left local residents without a ride. The attack was a fall out of growing discontent. A case of rioting has been started against the arrested, said a senior officer of Lake police station.

	Niranjan Prasad Yadav        
	Age: 32
  Profession: Bhelpuriwallah        
	Will you speak up against bandhs like the CM did?
  Yes.        
	Why?
  My business is hampered. I face a lot of other problems like commuting.        
	Will you defy bandhs from now?
  If possible, yes. Even now, I generally come to see whether they will allow me to set up my shop opposite Vardaan market.        
	Why?
  I depend on daily income. I dont get money for the days I dont work.        
	Will you tell other vendors to defy bandhs?
  Yes.                  
	Kiran Uttam Ghosh        
	Age: 39
  Profession: Fashion designer        
	Will you speak up against bandhs like the CM did?
  Why wouldnt I? Ive chosen to live in Bengal and I believe the opportunities in Bengal today are limitless. The bandh as an instrument of protest is irresponsible, it takes away the daily wage earners right to earn a living. No state can progress if its people arent allowed to work.        
	Will you defy bandhs from now?
  Sadly, its not just about me walking to work; I do that on every bandh. Its about getting those who depend on local transport who cannot make it to work.  
	Will you ask friends and relatives to defy bandhs?
  Everybody I know either flies out of the city for work or walks to work on a bandh day.                  
	Akshay Agarwal        
	Age:18
  Occupation: Student        
	Will you speak up against bandhs like the CM did?
  Yes.        
	Why?
  Bandhs hinder daily life. It messes up my schedules and puts extra pressure the day after.        
	Will you defy bandhs from now?
  If possible, I would love to.         
	How?
  I would be going to college (St Xaviers) and also to my dads office where I work.        
	Will you ask friends and relatives to defy bandhs?
  I wont force them but I will try and persuade them to do so.                  
	Brajeswar Bhattacharya        
	Age: 63
  Profession: Retired police officer        
	Will you speak up against bandhs like the CM did?
  Yes. The chief ministers saying it is a big blessing.        
	Why?
  Ive always been against bandhs. Bandhs cripple daily life. It means loss of livelihood for many, including poor daily wage labourers.        
	Will you defy bandhs from now?
  Yes, as much as I am capable of.         
	How?
  By attending office (a private security firm).        
	Will you ask friends and relatives to defy bandhs?
  Yes, always.                  
	Dipankar Basu        
	Age: 51
  Profession: Schoolteacher        
	Will you speak up against bandhs like the CM did?
  Yes.        
	Why?
  It messes up the school schedule. We are forced to work on holidays, which is an infringement on my democratic right.        
	Will you defy bandhs from now?
  Yes, if possible I will attend work. But institutions must remain open and help employees get to work.        
	Why?
  Bandh is a flimsy excuse for people not to work.        
	Will you ask friends and relatives to defy bandhs?
  Depends on the safety issue.                  
	Darshan Shah        
	Age: 47
  Profession: Entrepreneur        
	Will you speak up against bandhs like the CM did?
  Hes done it today, Ive been doing it forever.        
	Why?
  These bandhs are unnecessary. I have been defying them for years.        
	How?
  By working. Those of us who stay close (to Weavers Studio) walk to work, others work from home. And by common consent we stay open on a Sunday when we lose a weekday to a bandh.        
	Will you ask friends and relatives to defy bandhs?
  If theres a discussion, yes, but I wont go out of my way. To be really effective, the CM must ensure transport and security for those who want to work.

  By attending office (The Park) as usual.

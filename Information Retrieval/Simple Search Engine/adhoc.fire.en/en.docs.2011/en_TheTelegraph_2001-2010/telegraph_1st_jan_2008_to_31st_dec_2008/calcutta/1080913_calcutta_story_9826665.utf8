                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Youth pushes constable on Metro tracks
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	A youth assaulted a cop after an altercation and pushed him off the platform at Sovabazar Sutanuti Metro station just when a train was rolling in on Thursday night.        
	Raghunath Karmakar, a constable at Ultadanga police station, had a close shave as passengers raised an alarm, prompting the driver to slam the brakes just in time.        
	Arun Shaw, the assailant, was arrested and charged with attempt to murder. The constable was admitted to a private clinic.        
	The officer-in-charge of Shyampukur police station, Swapan Mitra, has been show-caused for the delay in informing his superiors and the Lalbazar control room about the incident.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (north) came to know about the incident around 11.30pm on Thursday, two-and-a-half hours after it occurred. The Lalbazar control room had no information till 6pm on Friday, said a senior officer at the police headquarters.        
	The 45-year-old constable, in plainclothes, boarded a train at Jatin Das Park station on his way to work, said Vineet Goyel, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	When the train stopped at Sovabazar Sutanuti station, where Karmakar was to get off, there was a commotion at the door with passengers jostling to enter and exit.        
	Shaw shoved Karmakar aside in order to get into the train, said an officer of Shyampukur police station. Karmakar protested, leading to an altercation. Shaw did not board the train and grabbed Karmakar, demanding an apology from him.        
	The youth suddenly turned violent and started raining blows on Karmakar. In full public view, Shaw hurled the constable on the tracks. A Dum Dum-bound train was entering the station but Karmakar, who had suffered injuries to the head and chest, was too shocked to react, the officer said.        
	Some of the commuters waiting on the platform then jumped on the tracks and raised an alarm, drawing the attention of the driver. The train stopped a few yards from Karmakar and the crowd.        
	Shaw tried to flee but commuters caught hold of him and handed him over to police, said deputy commissioner Goyel.

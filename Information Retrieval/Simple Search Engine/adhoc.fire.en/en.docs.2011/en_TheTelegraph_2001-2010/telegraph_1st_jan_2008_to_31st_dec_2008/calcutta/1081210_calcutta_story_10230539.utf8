           Helping hand: Civic police volunteers in action on city streets                             
	Instead of shirking responsibility and passing the buck, (Immersion takes toll on river, Oct. 15), the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Calcutta Port Trust should seek a permanent solution to the pressing problem.           
	The authorities concerned can adopt the Kalyani model of immersions. Earlier, hundreds of idols used to be immersed in a beautiful lake in Kalyani, which is a tourist attraction. But, for over a decade, the Kalyani municipality has earmarked a centrally located medium-sized pond for immersions. A ramp has been created to carry and immerse idols with ease. A separate enclosure is constructed to throw flowers, leaves and other puja accessories.           
	Men are deployed to pull out immersed frameworks of the idols and place them on the bank on the far side.           
	Hundreds of small eateries have mushroomed near the pond, which do brisk business after festivals. The civic body also earns some money by disposing of the idol frames.           
	These steps have helped us keep the lake clean and the environment unpolluted. The Kalyani municipality has been earning top rank in green contests over the years.           
	Jatindra Nath Bhowmick,

	The deployment of civic police for crowd management during Puja was a brilliant idea of Calcutta police (Duty drowns drumbeats, Oct. 8). This has not only generated temporary employment for a number of youths but stood Calcuttans in good stead. People like me, who frequent north Calcutta, are immensely aided by these people  mostly dynamic and energetic youth. They also help in easing traffic congestion during peak hours. Their presence also deters policemen from neglecting their duties.             
	But I am pained to think that these civic cops are paid poorly, even though they work for 10 hours. Poisonous gases from vehicles also take a toll on their health.           
	They should also be be trained properly to deliver their best.

	This refers Trinamul adds fuel to mob fire, Oct 6). If the police commissioners claims about Partha Chatterjees threat over telephone  Jader dhorechhen tara amader doler lok. Oder chhere na dile Bangla jole jabe  is true, it is a sad development. Since the phone conversation is reported to have been recorded, it should be made public through the electronic media so that the true colours of the Leader of the Opposition is exposed before the electorate. One should also remember that the top cop claims may have been engineered to malign the Opposition.

	The report Cops file leader complaint, Oct. 7, must be taken seriously. Not only the police brass, but the chief minister also should look into the complaint as this could result in cops hiding or running away when a mob violence occurs, especially since such violence has become a daily phenomenon in the state. Considering the seriousness of the complaint, it is essential to appoint a committee to look into the allegations. In case the allegations are true, departmental action should be taken against the guilty officers.           
	A.S.Mehta,
  New Alipore                       
	With reference to the report 8-year-old foils kid sisters kidnap, Oct. 15, I would urge my fellow Calcuttans to take lessons from the case. Congratulations to little Sajida for great presence of mind and setting an example for others. Abductions have become commonplace in the city. The lack of alertness and casual attitude of citizens have compounded the problem. Children have to be taught not to get lured by anyone offering chocolate or ice-cream. They must be told to stay alert. Parents and guardians should also keep their names and phone numbers with the kids.             
	Debojyoti Dhar,

	Apropos the report JU freezer for fresher food (Oct. 13), it is wonderful news for farmers and sellers of fish, vegetable and flowers that Jadavpur Universitys Centre for Rural and Cryogenic Technologies have invented a device with which they would be able to store their products in a fresher state and for a longer time. This would help enhance their profit as the device will surely minimise chances of the products rotting.             
	Sourish Mishra,
  Salt Lake                   
	Apropos the report Mystery of missing Buddha in artists final farewell (Oct. 24), an era has come to an end with the death of Paritosh Sen. But it is shocking to know that the chief minister and one-time close associate of the artist did not go to pay his last respects to the legendary son of Bengal. Were official meetings the sole reason of his absence or were there some political compulsions behind the move?             
	Atif Ayaz,
  Serampore             
	Why did the retrenched employees of Calcutta office of Jet Airways turn up only at the Citu office to seek union help and not at that of any other political party, especially Trinamul Congress with a firebrand leader like Ms Mamata Banerjee (Sack 22 seek Citu succour, Oct. 16)? It will be better if Mamata Banerjee tries to find the answer to this crucial question herself.

	Apropos the caption of a picture carried with the story Self help tips for mom and dad published in Metro on Sunday (Nov. 30) consultant psychiatrist Rima Mukherjee is sitting between author Sampurna Chattarji and clinical psychologist and educationist Palash Baran Pal.

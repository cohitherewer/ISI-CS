                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Royal chef rustles it up
  - Man who cooks for the queen reveals his recipe          SHRADHA AGARWAL                          Anton Mosimann strikes a pose in the kitchen of the Kumars on Monday evening. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	Princess Diana loved his risotto. For the Prince of Wales, he stirs up organic food favourites. Top chef Anton Mosimann knows it all because he has been feeding the British royal family on and off for the last 25 years.        
	Mosimann was in the Buckingham Palace kitchen three weeks ago and the 10 Downing Street kitchen last week. On Monday evening he was cooking up a special meal in the kitchen of the Kumars at Middleton Mansions.        
	I love Calcutta. It has a certain buzz that is different from other Indian cities, and I have been impressed by the warmth of the people, smiled the 61-year-old Swiss on his third visit in six years.        
	This time, he is being hosted by friends Naresh and Sunita Kumar. I am here for his 80th birthday. The family didnt know what to get him as a present, so they asked me to come down. I took the next flight out and am here to cook a meal for 40 people at the house party, said the super chef in the mood for a royal chat.        
	The first time Mosimann cooked for the queen was not in London, but in Montreal. It was at the Canadian Pavilion at Expo 67 where all the heads of states were invited, he recalls. The next time was at Londons Dorchester Hotel where he worked for 13 years. I later cooked for her at Buckingham Palace and some homes where she was invited.                  
	His royal recipe? Be confident. And cater to everybodys taste, personalised with a dash of your own feelings and a pinch of innovation.        
	For Mosimann, the market is as important as the menu. You get to know the city by the look and feel of a local market, he says. New Market is a favourite, with its wonderful fish, vegetable and fruit markets. He likes Bengali cuisine but his first choice is a spicy tandoori dish.        
	The people Mosimann has cooked for makes quite a power list  White House occupants Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush (father and son), Hollywood heavyweights Jack Nicholson, Michael Caine and Omar Sharif, and 007s Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Daniel Craig.        
	Mosimanns mantra for a good chef? Gift of god, creativity, innovation, sense of taste and artistic presentation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Student held for murder
                                                                                                               Student held for murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth claiming to be an engineering student was arrested on Saturday evening for his alleged involvement in the murder of Bapi Das in Kalighat last month. He was carrying a single-shot firearm and two cartridges.        
	Ganesh Shankar Roy, a resident of Haripada Dutta Lane in Jadavpur, was walking towards Gariahat when police detained him on the basis of information provided by their sources.        
	We have not been able to verify his claim of being a B.Tech student in a private college in Garia, said deputy commissioner (south division) Rajesh Subarna.        
	Roy made contradictory statements to police. Initially, he said one of his friends had asked him to keep the weapon for a couple of days. Later, he claimed that a friend who owed him Rs 1,000 gave him the firearm and cartridges to sell and recover the money, said an officer of Lake police station.        
	The police raided the house of Roys friend in the Dhakuria area. But he was not there, so we are not sure whether Roy was lying or not, added the officer.        
	Das was murdered over a dispute regarding the control of an illegal country liquor den in Kalighat. Four persons were arrested. We are yet to ascertain Roys role in the murder, said an officer.        
	Roys family members have not contacted us. We will talk to his parents to verify his background, said Subarna.

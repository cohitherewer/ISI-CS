                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Airlines push for facility upgrade
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Airlines have urged Calcutta airport to upgrade its infrastructure.        
	We have requested the airport authorities to augment certain ground facilities immediately. Since the number of flights is increasing, it will be difficult to maintain on-time performance with the present infrastructure, said Aditya Ghosh, the president of IndiGo airline.        
	More conveyor belts, check-in counters, X-ray machines at check points and space in the terminals are among the priorities of the airline.        
	The issue was discussed at a recent meeting between the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the Airlines Operators Committee (AOC). We have been asking the authorities to upgrade the infrastructure. There is also a problem of space in the existing terminal buildings, said Anup Chowdhury, the chairman (eastern India) of AOC. Even if they want to install more equipment or open more counters, its not possible because of space constraints.        
	Although the number of check-in counters, X-ray machines and conveyor belts was increased last year, it was not enough for the peak-hour passenger load. The existing infrastructure is becoming inadequate. There are long queues in front of counters in the morning and evening. Things will only get worse, warned an airline official.        
	Airport officials said the solution lay in setting up an integrated terminal building, which is part of the Rs 2,100-crore airport modernisation project. In the present set-up, we are almost saturated. The situation will improve once the new terminal building comes up, said a senior official of the AAI.        
	Despite the global economic meltdown, the footfall on low-cost flights is on the rise and airlines are planning to add more flights on the Calcutta sector.        
	IndiGo, which already has 15 flights, is planning to introduce more.        
	There are plans for a fourth flight to Delhi and a non-stop one to Bangalore, said the airline president.        
	Another low-cost carrier, SpiceJet, has recently announced plans to add more flights from Calcutta.        
	The passenger count this year has increased by five per cent, compared with 20 per cent last year, but low-cost carriers have recorded a 10 per cent growth in occupancy.        
	Ghosh said IndiGo was tying up with a number of corporate bodies who are asking their executives to fly low-cost airlines to cut cost.

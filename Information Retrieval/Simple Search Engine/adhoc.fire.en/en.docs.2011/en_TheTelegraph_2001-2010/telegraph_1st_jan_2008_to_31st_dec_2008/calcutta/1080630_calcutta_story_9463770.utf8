The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Gangs fight for real estate spoils 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gangs fight for real estate spoils 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two shooting incidents in two-and-a-half months have alerted police to the possibility of a revival of gang wars in south Calcutta.        
	The first sign came in April, when Jagannath, an associate of criminal Kumar Saha, caused panic in Bhowanipore by drawing out a gun and firing in the air during a confrontation with some rivals. Last week, another local tough, Pintoo, and seven associates shot at and injured gangster-turned-supplier Rakesh Shaw, alias Vicky, and his associate Sanjay Joshi. They assaulted a third rival, Sanjay Yadav, alias Goonda, with iron rods in public view.         
	South Calcutta has witnessed a real estate boom in the past few years, turning local criminals into small-time promoters and suppliers of building materials. Gang rivalry has become even more intense because of competition in business, an IPS officer in Lalbazar said.         
	Karaya police station has identified Gullu, alias Raja, Mona, Aslam, alias Pappu, and Rabiul Naskar as the men behind most criminal activities in Beniapukur, Karaya, Bondel Gate Road and Park Circus. All of them enjoy political patronage and, after committing crimes, flee with the help of their godfathers, an officer said.        
	He recalled how a former officer-in-charge of Karaya police station, Deepak Dutta, was transferred overnight after Gullu attacked Mona in November 2004 and was hounded by the cops for the incident.         
	The slums where these criminals stay are frequently raided, but arrests are rare. The goons take refuge in hideouts at Ghutiari Sharif, in South 24-Parganas, whenever the heat is on them.        
	Gullu, who dabbles in real estate with his brother Prakash, was arrested in 2003, while Mona was picked up in August 2004. Both are out on bail.         
	The easy availability of guns is another source of concern for the police. Acting on a tip-off, our officers seized 7-8 revolvers over the past few months, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south).        
	Officers of the special branch, the city polices intelligence wing, have been asked to gather and share information on the whereabouts of criminals like Pintoo and his gang members who were involved in the recent shooting. A preliminary investigation revealed that both fled to Bihar after the incident. Our officers are keeping a watch on their associates, said an officer of the anti-rowdy section.         
	The police believe Laloo, a notorious criminal of the area, masterminded the attack. The enmity between Laloo and Vicky is well known, and the former used Pintoo and his associates for the job. Pintoo used to be Vickys right hand, but they fell out a few years ago, the officer said.         
	The trio had turned into real estate promoters for a while, but found the business of supplying material to builders easier.

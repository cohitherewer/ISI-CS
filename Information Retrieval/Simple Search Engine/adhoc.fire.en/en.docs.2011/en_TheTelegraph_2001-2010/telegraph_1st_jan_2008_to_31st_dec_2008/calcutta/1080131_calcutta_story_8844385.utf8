     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Police are fanning out across the city markets to check if poultry meat sellers are flouting the order to buy birds only from the 12 firms declared flu-free by the civic body.
    
	We cannot take chances, as bird flu has arrived at Calcuttas doorstep. Poultry meat sellers have been asked to procure their stock only from the listed firms, said the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Vineet Goyel.
    
	The checks are being carried out by a team led by deputy commissioner (enforcement branch) Chanchal Dutta.
    
	Animal resources development minister Anisur Rahman spoke to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Wednesday and asked him to ensure that shops selling fowl from the government-approved firms are also allowed to run.
    
	An officer said all 24 chicken shops in the Gariahat market have been asked to down shutters. The police visited my shop on Tuesday and shut it down. I get my stock from a poultry in Beck Bagan that has not been issued the safe certificate, said Debashis Bagh, a trader in the Gariahat market. 
    
	Chief civic health official Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay said no uncertified bird has been sold in the city. Not a single bird has been seized.
    
	Among the firms declared safe by the civic body for their high level of bio-security and management practices of international standards are Arambagh Hatcheries, Amrit Breed Firm, Hitech Hatcheries and Shalimar Hatcheries.
    
	To tackle any outbreak of bird flu, the government has set up isolation wards in hospitals and cancelled the leave of the doctors, said Sanchita Bakshi, the director of health services. 
    
	 Mutton dearer: The flu scare has resulted in a slump in the demand for chicken and sent the prices of mutton and fish northward. The price of chicken has come down from Rs 80 a kg to Rs 25, while the price of mutton has gone up from Rs 200 to Rs 250. The small variety of prawn that sold for Rs 100 a kg a week ago is now Rs 170, said a buyer in Sinthee.

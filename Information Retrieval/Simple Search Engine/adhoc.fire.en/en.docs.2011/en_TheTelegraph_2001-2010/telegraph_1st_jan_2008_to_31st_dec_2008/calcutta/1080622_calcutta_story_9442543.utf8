	It is exciting to explore the unknown but the urge for the familiar is sometimes irrepressible        
	Cravings are strange, totally uncontrollable and beyond any logical manoeuvring. And thus last Saturday with a kalbaisakhi like thunderstorm threatening New Jersey, I felt the irrepressible urge to have Alu Posto and Murighonto for dinner. It was well past 8pm, and I had none of the ingredients to make them at home, but the urges continued. Of course, even I knew that living in a white middle-class suburb and desiring authentic Bengali food do not go hand in hand especially when one lives in America  but I was wrong.        
	I was never a fan of Bengali food. Overfed in childhood on a regular diet of fish and milky sweets, I avoided these at every opportunity. When stereotyped as a fish-lover based on my Bengali heritage  as people all over India are prone to do  I would resent the categorisation. I would watch my mothers market safaris in hunt for the elusive rui or ilish even in far flung Sikkim where my father was transferred in the late seventies and be vexed at her obsession with all things Bengali when we could have had momos and noodles for dinner instead. Why wasnt she more adventurous? Why not try the new?        
	When I moved to America, I launched into my own adventures, trying all that I had no scope to before. New York City attracts immigrants from the world over and with them their cuisines  from Peruvian to Slovenian to West Indian, you can find them all. Any New York evening you can see ethnic communities bonding over food in little Italy or China town or in any of the over two dozen Indian restaurants of Curry Hill.        
	And I tried them all  from the Korean bar-be-cue to Babaganoush to the Eritrean injera bread, nothing was too new for me. While my husband tried to dissuade me from Japanese sushi, I lapped it up not because I truly liked the taste of miso soup and plain rice around raw fish, but because the accompanying wasabi sauce spiced things up in sharp contrast to the usually bland American cuisine.        
	But along with restaurant adventures in the new land, my ego led me to another exploration. Like many single working women in India, I had never had to cook. But in a new country, newly married and with no one to help in the kitchen, cookbooks became my bible. While the feminists may have implied through my formative years that cooking was beneath us women  she is meant to work and achieve greatness  to me it became the opposite. Cooking was something I was intimidated by, something my husband was competent at and I had never tried, something that was my personal inadequacy, and just for that reason alone I had to master it.        
	Fortunately for me Indian food in America was also going through a sea change. With Westerners travelling to India and recent movements into the US of tech workers from different parts of India, restaurants were starting to experiment. A decade back Tandoori Chicken and Dal Makhni were synonymous with Indian food, but now much more was on offer. My American colleagues could finally discuss the crepe like dish they had for dinner at a South Indian restaurant in Brooklyn or the Malabar fish which was so different from the curries  a term commonly used for every Indian dish  they have been having for years. And I proudly introduced them to more.        
	But along the way, as my stay in America grew longer, so did my urge for familiarity and those very things that I thought I could do without. A stronger reason to master cooking took over my kitchen  my need to recreate a little part of what I had left behind. So I moved hesitantly from cooking simple egg curry to the more challenging Doi Maach.        
	And thus on that rainy Saturday night I went online and checked endlessly for Bengali food in New York and found the next best option  a Bangladeshi restaurant called Spicy Mina in the heart of working class Queens. And my 60-km trip in heavy rain and thunder proved worthwhile when I got my fill of Mangsher Chop, Alu Posto and Murighonto in the tiny restaurant.        
	Till then I had never realised that somewhere on this journey in this new land I had become just like my mother, happy with the familiar in spite of the many adventures.

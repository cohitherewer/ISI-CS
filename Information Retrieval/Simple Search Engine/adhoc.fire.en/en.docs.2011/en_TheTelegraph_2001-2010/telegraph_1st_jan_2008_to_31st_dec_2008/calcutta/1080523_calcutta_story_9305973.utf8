The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Money early but morgue delayed 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Money early but morgue delayed 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The forensic examination morgue that the Medical Council of India had asked SSKM Hospital to set up two years ago has been delayed further by a blame game between the departments that were supposed to do the job.        
	The health department sanctioned nearly Rs 1 crore to SSKM for the project on February 13, 2006, but the only thing ready is the skeletal structure of the morgue.         
	Another Calcutta hospital, RG Kar, received money almost six months later but completed the job much earlier. The forensic morgue at RG Kar became operational in March this year.        
	The morgue site at SSKM was changed after the discovery of an underground reservoir at the original site. The departments assigned to set it up are now blaming one another for the delay.        
	Sources at SSKM said a team from the medical council came for a review last month and was appalled by the lack of forensic examination facilities on the campus. Teams that visited the campus earlier made similar observations.        
	Students of SSKM are taken to the morgue at Medical College and Hospital for practical classes. Bodies requiring post-mortem are sent to Kantapukur.         
	The only morgue at SSKM is for storage of bodies that families of the deceased are unable to take away immediately.         
	An official of the hospitals electrical department claimed that the forensic morgue would be ready soon. Construction and wiring are complete. We only need to set up the cooling chambers and do some other internal work.        
	His counterpart in another section accused the electrical department for the delay.         
	Another senior official said efforts were being made to settle the dispute. We have spoken to all the departments concerned and asked them to complete the work by July 1.         
	Once completed, the morgue can store 30 bodies at a time.

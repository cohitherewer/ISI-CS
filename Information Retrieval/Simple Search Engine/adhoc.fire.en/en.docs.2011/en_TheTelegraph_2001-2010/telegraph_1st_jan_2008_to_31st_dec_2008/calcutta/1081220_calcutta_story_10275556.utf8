	The ninth Swastha Mela at Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, Narendrapur, will focus on medicinal plants and their use, production and marketing.        
	The two-day fair beginning December 24 will also feature a two-day symposium on the sustainable use of natural resources.        
	Researchers and villagers will participate in the fair, to be attended by ayurvedic doctors. Visitors can get their blood tests, ECG and other examinations done, said Swami Vishwamayananda, the assistant secretary of the ashrama and convener of the symposium.        
	A buyer-seller meet will be organised on December 25 to chalk out an effective marketing strategy for herbal medicinal products.        
	Various medicinal plants, medicines, food supplements and books and CDs on medicinal plants will be showcased.        
	The ashrama, which started a facilitation centre for medicinal plants this year, has a garden spread across five acres with more than 350 types of plants. It will also set up a drug-testing laboratory worth a crore of rupees.        
	Earlier this year, the ashrama completed a two-year training for rural women in preparation of medicines from plants.        
	Nearly 200 women from 18 villages across the state were trained in preparing medicines, food supplements and other products, said Salil Gupta, the consultant scientist of the facilitation centre.

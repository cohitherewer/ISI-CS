The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Little masters in the making
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Little masters in the making
          For many Calcutta Boys rsquo; School students, cricket comes before studies                               The Calcutta Boys School cricket team with their Swami Lokeshwarananda Memorial Challenge Cup				               
	Sourpya Dasgupta chose to change his stream in Class XI rather than change school and quit its cricket team. Former under-17 player, Debapriya Sur, says he will happily give up studies to wield the willow.         
	The boys at Calcutta Boys School (CBS) are passionate about the game, going out on to the field not just to win, but to enjoy. If you enjoy the game, success is always yours, feels Arijit Banerjee, who has played at the state level in the under-17 category.         
	We lay stress on academics, but realise that sport plays an integral part in the development of a child. Most children grow up in apartments, where there is hardly any open space to play. It is the responsibility of the school to provide them with scope and infrastructure, says principal Raja McGee. The schools cricket team was set up in 1968, but it is only in the past 10 years that their boys have clinched big wins.         
	The annual inter-house cricket tournament is an important event in every budding players calendar. For, thats when selectors keep an eye out for fresh talent. It gives us a ticket to play in the school team. Playing before a larger crowd is what gives us the kick, says Satrajit Das, a member of the school team.         
	Thirty players are shortlisted for the under-14, under-16 and under-19 categories each. The lucky 14 make it to the school squad. Biswajit Bhowmick, the current coach, claims that he gives as much importance to a budding players natural flair, guts and match temperament as his techniques. The training includes running, developing endurance, fitness exercises and field training. Strategies are worked out during game plan sessions.         
	We train the boys in staying at the wicket, keeping the score board tickling by taking singles and in picking up loose balls to hit boundaries. says Bhowmick. Net practice takes place in the school field for a couple of hours after school and on Saturday mornings. But when a tournament is close, the youngsters spend hours on the field every day.         
	Both our sports teacher and coach accompany us during tournaments. Their last-minute tips have often helped us get the better of a difficult situation, says Arijit Banerjee. Strategies are often revised according to the ground, pitch and after gauging the opponent team. We always keep a few batsmen in reserve so that the batting order does not topple, says sports teacher Soumen Mondal.        
	While its time for intense concentration during a match, the fun element cannot be separated from the game. The practice sessions are full of fun. Thats when we exchange notes on movies and girls or pull a prank on a teammate, said Arijit Banerjee.         
	The boys big clinches include Pankaj Roy Cup, organised by the Pankaj Roy Cricket Academy in April 2007, Millennium Cup Cricket Tournament, organised by Don Bosco Liluah in November 2007 and Swami Lokeshwarananda Memorial Challenge Cup, organised by Ramakrishna Mission, Narendrapur, in January 2008. They were also the runners up at the CAB Inter-School Cricket Tournament in May 2008.

	SHOUT OUT LOUD  
	Whats on your mind this week  Big blow for Bengal  
	October 3 will always be remembered as Black Friday in the history of West Bengal. It was on this day that Ratan Tata decided to shift the Nano project from Singur. It is the people of West Bengal who will suffer due to the egoistic stand of two political parties. For, industry is the main source of development in this age of globalisation.         
	It is not just the matter of one company pulling out. Its after-effects will be more dangerous. West Bengal has lost face before the whole nation. The major industrial houses will now think twice before investing in Bengal. The youth of the state, for whom the plant could have created a surge of job opportunities, stand to lose the most.

  Jadavpur University         Tearful farewell  
	nWhat do Steve Waugh and Sourav Ganguly have in common? Both were successful captains and both have been victims of unfair criticism.         
	In 2007, Ganguly had scored 239 against Pakistan in Bangalore to become the seventh highest scoring Indian Test batsman. This year, he was axed from the Irani Trophy squad for not performing in just six innings. Is this fair?        
	Havent big players like Sachin and Dravid also had their lean phases?         
	Our national selectors feel that Gangulys fielding and fitness are not up to the mark. But what about his experience? Does that not count?         
	Such an untimely end to Gangulys career has come as a huge disappointment to all his fans. We will miss miss you, dada.

	THE DIARY  Somewhere in between  
	When we met in my dreams 
  It was never in the morning, Nor in the evening, 
  But somewhere in between: 
  Perhaps at dusk? 
  Never at night, nor after daybreak, 
  But somewhere in between. 
  Perhaps at dawn? 
  When you told me 
  That I really meant a lot to you. 
  It was not the truth, nor was it a lie. 
  Perhaps it was somewhere in between?

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Repairs of Calcutta airports main runway will begin in November.        
	The repair work, which will require closing of the runway from 11am to 5pm for a fortnight, had to be deferred in June as the extension of the secondary runway was not yet over.        
	With the completion of the extension of the southern flank of the secondary runway by 440 metres, the airport authorities are planning to close the main runway for repairs.        
	Airport officials said the work was not taken up during monsoon  the extension was complete by then  to avoid damage to the bitumen surface.        
	The matter was discussed at a meeting between the airport authorities and the Airlines Operators Committee (AOC) on Friday.        
	We will request the Air Traffic Control (ATC) department and the airlines to allow us to take up repairs in the first week of November. The main runway will have to be closed for six hours during the day, airport director V.K. Monga said on Friday.        
	An AOC team surveyed the two runways on Wednesday and found rubber deposit on the main runway.        
	At the meeting, the representatives of various airlines also demanded strengthening of the surface of the two taxiways for smoother movement of aircraft.         
	But an official pointed out that since the taxiways were only used by small aircraft, which do not frequently land at Calcutta airport, there was no immediate need for repairs.        
	The airlines also asked for the installation of the Instrument Landing System on the secondary runway, but authorities said the runway needed to be extended by 400 metres on the northern side first.

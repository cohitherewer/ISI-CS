	Thirty-five black-and-white photographs of Fidel Castro, taken when the Cuban legend briefly visited Calcutta in 1973, will be on display between December 27 and 30 at the Nandan II foyer to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Cuban revolution. The photographs were taken by the late photojournalist Satya Sen. Organised by Prabha Khaitan Foundation and the Cuban embassy, the exhibition will be inaugurated by the chief minister on December 26    
	What led Job Charnock to settle on the banks of the Ganges and help found Calcutta? A reflection of the Thames in the Ganges? The Ganges is often compared with the Thames. It is as important to Calcutta, economically and culturally as the Thames is to London. However, they are treated very differently by the two cities.     
	While London celebrates the Thames Festival every year in September, about the same time in Calcutta, the Ganges is almost choked by the immersion of idols. Yet the parallel between the two rivers led the director of the Thames Festival two years ago to a project called Rivers of the World, which put up an exhibition of art works by school students from India, the UK and some other countries. At City Centre the exhibition of art panels ended on December 19.     
	This is the third year of the project, with different schools participating every year, but this year for the first time the exhibition travelled to Calcutta, said Marina Gandhi, the head of education, British Council in India. This year we have schools from London, Chonquing (China), Calcutta, Cape Town and Cairo, she said.     
	Drawings, paintings, clay models were created and then transformed into digital forms to form a single coherent artwork. If one theme, city of river, showed a glittering cityscape along the Ganges, polluted river showed animals being washed in the river and piles of garbage on the banks. A London school interpreted river of life with a serene, human face with flowers against a dark background. The works of the Calcutta schools are more intricate. In comparison London is simple, said Gandhi.     
	Taxing carbon    
	Business should be eco-friendly. That was the message at CDMEast, a seminar on carbon-efficient business in eastern India organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce on Friday at a city hotel.     
	CDM stands for Clean Development Mechanism, me-asures for businesses to shrink their carbon footprints and earn carbon credits. It was proposed by the Kyoto Protocol.     
	Business stalwarts are all for it. Subrata Ray, the associate director of Ernst amp; Young, suggested repowering technology (converting outdated power plants to energy-efficient ones with latest technology), developing clean coal technology (which reduces harmful emissions but is yet to be commercially viable for small businesses) and hydrogen technology (generating clean power from hydrogen).     
	B.L. Chandak, the vice-president, corporate finance, of CESC, spoke of carbon tax to curb emissions. He stressed on tapping hydro-electric and wind energy and generating power from municipal solid waste.     
	Bengal industries have large carbon footprints, the meet concluded. All the talk and numbers need to add up to a cleaner, greener tomorrow.

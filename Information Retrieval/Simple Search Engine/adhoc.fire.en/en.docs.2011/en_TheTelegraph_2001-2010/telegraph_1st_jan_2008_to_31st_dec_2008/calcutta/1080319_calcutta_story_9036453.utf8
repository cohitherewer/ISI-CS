           Art under attack: The Anjolie Ela Menon mural at Esplanade Metro station before it was damaged                               
	Apropos the report Mauled mural up for repair, February 21, the Metro Railway officials who damaged the Anjolie Ela Menon mural put up at Esplanade station were probably not aware of its value. Even if they were aware, it is unlikely that they knew how to care for it. I wonder if the damage thus caused can be undone through repairs. Many foreigners use the Metro. When they see or hear how the mural was damaged, they would wonder if Calcutta deserves its status as the cultural capital of India.

	It is sad that those who mauled the mural were oblivious of its value. Paritosh Sens comments in this regard reveal the mindset of bureaucrats who enjoy power but are not accountable.           
	Bhupen Bose,

	By and large Calcuttans appreciate art. However, one wonders the wisdom of putting up a costly mural in a Metro station. If the trains run on schedule, passengers wont have the time to appreciate a serious work. The mural should perhaps be relocated to an airport lounge.           
	A.S. Mehta, 
  New Alipore           
	The damage to the mural cannot be assessed only in monetary terms. The disrespect shown to an artists work is far more worrying. That the mural was a gift makes the offence by the Metro Railway authorities even more grave. They must apologise to Anjolie Ela Menon.

	The correctional services departments attempt to hold art workshops for convicts must be appreciated (Lessons in art for convicts, February 16). Merely calling jails correctional facilities is not enough. It is the moral obligation of the authorities to take steps like this.             
	The duration of the workshop must be extended and convicts in all correctional facilities should be allowed to attend it. The sentences of those who show promise in the workshop may be reduced. They should also get a chance to utilise the skills they pick up in the workshop after being released from jail.

	Apropos the report Girl claims molest in lab, February 20, the molestation of a schoolgirl by her teacher is all the more shocking because in this country, students are traditionally taught to look upon their teachers almost like gods. Teachers who are guilty of crimes against their students should be punished in the harshest possible manner.             
	Atif Ayaz and Farzana Ishrat, 
  Serampore                       
	The report Hammer on illegal floors, February 19, does not give law-abiding citizens the slightest hope. The Left Front has specialised in raising illegal constructions and filling up water bodies by tampering with civic records. The residents of the city are well acquainted with cosmetic drives and raids by the authorities. The civic bodys claim that the illegal buildings came up behind its back is hollow. It is difficult for anyone to believe that unauthorised floors can be added to a structure without tacit support of the civic officials and police.

	Apropos the report Park is litter dump, February 21, it is disheartening that a 2,000 sq ft patch of greenery in Rajarhat is being used as a garbage vat. Regular dumping of garbage inside the park underscores the civic bodys callousness. The number of parks and water bodies that have disappeared from the city is alarming.

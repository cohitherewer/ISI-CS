          A STAFF REPORTER                          Tarun Kanjilal                                  
	The body of a 47-year-old trader was found lying face down in a pool of blood in a passage adjoining his flat in Pallisree, Jadavpur, on Wednesday morning.        
	Tarun Kanjilals face was smashed in, several of his bones were broken and there was a cut above his right wrist. The nature of injuries suggests that he fell from the roof of the building, said police.         
	Tarun, the owner of a drugstore on Prince Anwar Shaw Road, lived on the third floor of 62 Pallisree with his wife Gauri.         
	Their 11-year-old twin daughters study in a residential school in Rajarhat.         
	Neighbours said the couple used to quarrel and fight frequently. Tarun was also known to drink heavily and return home late.         
	An investigator said he would sometimes climb on top of the water tank on the roof and drink.         
	Neighbours saw the body around 6.30am. There was a deep cut above his right wrist. When police turned the body over, we saw his face had been almost flattened, said Uttam Das, a resident of the area.         
	We have registered an unnatural death case and are waiting for the post-mortem and forensic reports, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.        
	Additional superintendent of police (industrial), D.P. Singh, said: A preliminary forensic report indicates that he either fell off the roof or committed suicide.        
	Gauri was taken to the police station and questioned for hours. We are also questioning other people. No one has lodged a complaint so far, said an officer.         
	A local grocer said Tarun bought some eggs from him around 11.15am on Tuesday and headed home on his scooter. His wife was riding pillion.

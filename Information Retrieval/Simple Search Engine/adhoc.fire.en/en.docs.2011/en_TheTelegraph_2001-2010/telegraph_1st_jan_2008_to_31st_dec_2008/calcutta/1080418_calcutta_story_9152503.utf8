          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police on Thursday started a probe into the alleged fraudulent withdrawal from the account of Ratna Das and mother Chandana with United Bank of Indias Kadamtala branch, in Howrah.        
	The duo had claimed that Balaram Das, whom Ratna, 21, was to marry on Thursday, had withdrawn Rs 93,000 from their account without their knowledge. The family has put off the ceremony (the two had registered their marriage earlier) till the fraud is arrested.        
	Officers talked to bank employees and verified some documents. We may seek help from handwriting experts, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police.         
	Bank officials told Ratna and her mother that someone had collected a cheque book for their account after submitting a copy of a police complaint stating that the old book had been lost. The complaint bore th e signatures of the mother and the daughter, which they claimed were fake.        
	Three cheques  together amounting to Rs 93,000  were found issued from the new book to B. Das and B.R. Das. Ratna claimed that the old book was still with her and that neither she nor her mother had ever issued any cheque from it to B.Das or B.R. Das.        
	They lodged a complaint on Wednesday.

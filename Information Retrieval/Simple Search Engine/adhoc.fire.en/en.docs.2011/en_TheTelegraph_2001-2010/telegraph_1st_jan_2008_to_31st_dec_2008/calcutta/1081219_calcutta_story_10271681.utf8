          A STAFF REPORTER      
	Two cases of eveteasing were reported within 15 minutes of each other in the Ekbalpore area on Wednesday night. One of the accused was arrested but the other fled.         
	Police said Sheikh Dhiraj, 30, a resident who works in Fancy Market, passed lewd remarks and tried to grab an 18-year-old girl when she was returning to her Maulana Mohammed Ali Road home at 10.30pm.        
	The girl, a Class XI student, had gone to a friends house nearby. When Dhiraj grabbed at her, she cried for help, alerting some people nearby, said an officer.         
	Dhiraj panicked and ran away.        
	Soon after, the girls parents, along with around 100 neighbours, went to Dhirajs house and abused his parents.        
	Some people in the crowd exchanged blows, which may have resulted in a clash between the two localities. We tried to bring the situation under control, said an officer.        
	Cops later found out that Dhiraj was married and had been harassing the girl for the past two months.         
	The other incident occurred on Mayurbhanj Road around 10.45pm. A youth, Mohammad Nasim, followed a 15-year-old girl and tried to grab her by the hand. The girl raised alarm and some local youths came to her rescue. They beat up Nasim and handed him over to a police patrol team.        
	Nasim is a resident of the area, an officer said.

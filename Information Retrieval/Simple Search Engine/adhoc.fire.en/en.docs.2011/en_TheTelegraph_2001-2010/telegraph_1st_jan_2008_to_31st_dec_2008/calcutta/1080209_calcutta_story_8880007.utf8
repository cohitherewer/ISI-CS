          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three students and an ex-student of Presidency College were injured in a clash on the campus between supporters of the SFI and Independent Consolidation (IC) on Friday evening.        
	SFI supporters, led by housing minister Goutam Debs son Saptarshi, Rajnish Tiwari and Riddha Chowdhury, attacked us, alleged Abhijit Sarkar, an IC supporter and mathematics second-year student.        
	Debojyoti Mondal, Moloy Bhattacharya and Soumya Mondal, who are students of the college, and Agnishwar, a former student of the mathematics department, were seriously injured, he added.        
	The injured were taken to Medical College and Hospital. Agnishwar was advised a CT scan. Debojyoti sustained an injury above the right eye.        
	We have received a complaint and have started a probe, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	The trouble started in the afternoon while a group of girls were putting up posters for a seminar organised by Ardhek Akash, a non-political magazine run by female students of the college. One of the posters was pasted over an SFI poster in the canteen, sparking a row, which snowballed into a fight.         
	We tried to stop some ex-students with Naxalite leanings from putting up posters on the campus, claimed Shubhodip Sarkar, a physics third-year student and SFIs Presidency College unit secretary.        
	About 15 of us were protesting. About 40 students came out of the union room and surrounded us. A skirmish followed. Some students complained to us that members of the students union had locked the main gate of the college. We forcibly opened the gate and dont regret having done so, he added.        
	According to Abhijit, the IC supporters had locked the gate to protest the campus violence.

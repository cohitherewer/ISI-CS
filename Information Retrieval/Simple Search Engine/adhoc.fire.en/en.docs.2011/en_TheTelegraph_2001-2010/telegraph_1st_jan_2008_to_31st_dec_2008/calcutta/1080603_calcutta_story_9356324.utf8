          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of a man who fell to his death from the window of a Srinagar hotel on Saturday night was brought to his Santoshpur home early on Monday.        
	The family of Sandipan Paul Choudhuri, an employee of a pharmaceutical company, accepted it was an accident and said they did not want the body to be sent for post-mortem.        
	Sandipan, wife Suparna, daughter Srijita, parents and in-laws had left Calcutta on May 27 and reached Srinagar from Jammu two days later.         
	Srinagars Nehru Park police station said Sandipan probably had weak eyesight and could not differentiate between the door and the window of the bathroom attached to his room.

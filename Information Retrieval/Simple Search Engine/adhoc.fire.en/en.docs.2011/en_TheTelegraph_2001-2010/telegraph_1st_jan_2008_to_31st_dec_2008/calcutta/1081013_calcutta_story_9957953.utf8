The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Disease scan after death 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Disease scan after death

	The civic body and the World Health Organisation (WHO) will survey the Thakurpukur locality where a man died of Japanese Encephalitis last Thursday.         
	Officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) visited ward 126 yesterday. A WHO team is scheduled to start its probe on Tuesday, said a state health department official on Sunday.         
	The matter is being taken seriously though there have been no further reports of the disease in the city, said Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay, the chief medical officer of the CMC.         
	Proloy Chowdhury, a 34-year-old resident of Sabarnapara Road, died at the School of Tropical Medicine after tests revealed that he was suffering from Japanese Encephalitis. The disease spreads from domestic pigs and wild birds. But Chowdhurys residence does not have a paddy field or a piggery within 5 km, said Chattopadhyay.         
	The health department has asked for details of Chowdhurys treatment and examinations from the School of Tropical Medicine authorities.         
	Health minister Surjyakanta Mishra on Saturday blamed the Centre for disruption in supply of vaccines to the state. Last month, a delegation led by Mishra met the Union health minister to request him to regularise vaccine supply in the state.

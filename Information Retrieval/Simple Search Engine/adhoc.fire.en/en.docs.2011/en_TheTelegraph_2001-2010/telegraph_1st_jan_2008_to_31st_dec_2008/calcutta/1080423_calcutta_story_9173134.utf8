The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Report backs owner claim 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Report backs owner claim 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Lolita Lekha nee Majumdar is the rightful owner of the seven-cottah plot in Tollygunge that some local residents were out to grab, police have informed the Alipore court.        
	We submitted a report to the court last week. The court has also been requested to demarcate her plot from the rest. We will provide all possible help to her if she wants to construct a house there, Praveen Kumar, superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, told Metro on Tuesday.        
	The plot in Ranikuthi has been a bone of contention between Lolita and members of a local club, Netaji Jatiya Sebadal.        
	When the 62-year-old NRI went to visit the plot at 130A Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road in March, the club members  backed by local Trinamul Congress MLA Arup Biswas  drove her out. They even threatened her with dire consequences if she ever visited the area to claim the property.        
	Initially, the opponents had promised to furnish papers to prove their claim to the plot. But they failed to produce any such documents, said Kumar.        
	On April 2, The Telegraph (see grab) had reported how the land grab was backed by Biswas and some officers of Jadavpur police station. Instead of standing by the woman, the police had blamed her for leaving the plot vacant for so long. A day after the report was published, police superintendent Kumar ordered an inquiry.        
	Biswas, who had asserted that the plot belonged to the local residents and that Lolita was an outsider, refused to comment on Tuesday.        
	Lolitas lawyer Dolla Adhikary said she was yet to get a copy of the police report. My client is the legitimate owner of the seven cottahs. She is out of town but will be back soon, she said.        
	She said they had filed a writ petition under Article 226 (infringement of fundamental rights) of the Constitution in the high court on April 10.        
	Lolitas father, Sailendra Mohan Majumdar, had bought the property  22 cottahs  a couple of months after Independence. But the state government took away 15 cottahs after the Urban Land Ceiling Act came into force in 1976.         
	After his death in 1996, Lolita applied to the Alipore court for a letter of administration (certifying her as the legal heir of her father) which she got in January 2007.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Schools a stage for them

	From the clairvoyant witches in Macbeth to the eloquent Portia in The Merchant of Venice, the students of Ashok Hall Girls Higher Secondary School have played all roles with equal elan. They also write their own plays, that often carry a social message.         
	Theatre hones a childs talent and brushes up her speaking skills. Participating in various inter-school competitions makes them confident of their strengths and also aware of their shortcomings, says Anita George, principal of Ashok Hall.         
	For students of this school, dramatics is compulsory, two periods a week, from classes VI to XII. They put up shows regularly during the school assembly or on various occasions like Rabindra Jayanti and fests. The training includes improving body language, expressions, diction, stage direction and choosing the right props and costumes. We teach them everything from physical fitness to role analysis, says Kaushik Bose, theatre faculty for English dramatics.         
	All genres of theatre are experimented with, from tragedies, comedies to plays with social messages. We take up topical issues like road accidents, female infanticide, global warming and ask students to write scripts on them. The aim is to make them more aware of the world around them. Moreover, theatre is therapeutic, adds Bose.         
	Many of our students have a natural flair for writing and we encourage them to write scripts, says Karuna Srivastava, faculty for Hindi theatre.         
	I teach them the right pronunciation and also the nau ras (nine emotions), she adds. The students bagged the Best Script prize for theatre festival Kolkata, City of Joy in 2006, organised by the British Council Library.         
	The play was written in verse, dwelling on the heritage of Calcutta. They also came third in Hindi Divas, 2007, organised at La Martiniere School for Boys. They had staged a play titled Hum Kahan Hai on the occasion. It portrayed the way the youth are forgetting their culture under western influence while the NRIs are able to hold on to their roots better.         
	Their other productions include parts of The Merchant of Venice, Macbeth, a Hindi translation of Tagores Juta Avishkar, Kabuliwala and other plays in Hindi .        
	Its as important to portray common people as historical characters. We have done plays on beggars and even a puchkawala. Theatre is about showing the truth to the people and not faking it, says Class XII student Gayatri Kaul.         
	For Class XI scriptwriter Neha Sharma, writing comes spontaneously. I write about anything that I see. It could be family issues or global warming, she added.

	The Victory March        
	Our robe is black, with helmets gold, 
  Lets unite, and get all enemies bowled. 
  Time for us to cheer and shout 
  As this victory will keep oblivion out. 
  Time had come when barriers broke 
  Indians and Pakistanis together awoke. 
  Tigers and Kangaroos share the plate 
  With Caribbeans and Kiwis as their mate. 
  No daring devils can give us a fright, 
  We can master them on any night. 
  The city and citizens can together try, 
  In the end we will 
  make them cry. 
  The royal forces are not so strong, 
  We will crush them with our swords on song. 
  The super kings with super stars 
  Are no matches for us in real wars.
  We beat the kings and tame the charge, 
  and then ride over the challengers. 
  Nor rain nor shine can stop our run 
  Kings men are born to have fun. 
  When lights go out and gardens go dim 
  We still shout the riders hymn. 
  Our faces never did go pale, 
  We know we are invincible.
  The City of Joy will erupt and rise 
  When riders take the ultimate prize.
  Once again then, we will say 
  Korechi, lorechi, jitechi re.

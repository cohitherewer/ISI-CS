          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three youths held retired IAS officer Timir Haran Sengupta and two of his family members at gunpoint and looted cash and jewellery worth over Rs 65,000 from their Ballygunge flat on Friday evening.        
	The trio entered the third-floor flat in a Ballygunge Second Lane housing estate by claiming that they wanted to fix an appointment with Sengupta. Once inside, two of them watched over the three family members with revolvers in hand while the other tied them up.         
	After taking Rs 7,000 in cash and gold ornaments from a cupboard, they walked away latching the main door.         
	Hearing screams from the flat, neighbours rescued the family members and informed the police.

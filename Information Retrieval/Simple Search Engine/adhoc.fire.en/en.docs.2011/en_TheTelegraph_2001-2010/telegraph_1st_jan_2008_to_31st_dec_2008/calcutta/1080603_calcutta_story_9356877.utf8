	A passenger on a long-distance bus was impaled by a rod attached to another bus, two buses piled up while trying to avoid hitting a car and a pedestrian was run over on VIP Road on Monday. Two died and five were injured in the mishaps.        
	Around 4.30pm, a South Bengal State Transport Corporation (SBSTC) bus travelling from Digha to Barasat hit the right side of a minibus near Golaghata. An iron rod attached to its windows bent on impact and thrust itself into the SBSTC bus, piercing the forehead of a middle-aged man sitting to the left of the driver.        
	Neither bus stopped after the accident, said Ashok Biswas, the additional superintendent of Bidhannagar police. While a police patrol van intercepted the SBSTC bus near the Haldiram stop, the minibus could not be traced.         
	The injured man died by the time he was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.        
	The driver of the SBSTC bus, Kajal Kumar Roy, initially fled but later surrendered at Lake Town police station. He lodged a complaint against the minibus driver.        
	Around 11.45am, five persons, including a child, were injured when a private bus on route 44 hit another bus plying on route 237 from behind near Dum Dum Park.         
	A traffic policeman who saw the mishap said the driver of the route 237 bus had to slam the brakes to avoid hitting a Maruti Alto  belonging to a senior officer of Jorabagan police station  that was crossing the road.        
	Around 2am, an unidentified youth was hit by a vehicle on the airport-bound flank of the road. A patrol van of Lake Town police station took him to hospital, where he was declared brought dead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Paris tryst for Sorcar scion
                                                                                                               Paris tryst for Sorcar scion
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Maneka Sorcar with her father in front of her grandfathers portrait                                  
	Her grandfather and father have enchanted the French with their tricks. Now, its Maneka Sorcars turn to win over French fans of her own.        
	The eldest daughter of P.C. Sorcar (Junior) will be representing the country at the Festival International des Magicienes in Paris between April 17 and 26.        
	Maneka will be the first woman magician from India to perform at an international magic convention, said the proud father.        
	The event will mark Manekas first solo performance in Paris. As far as I know, I will be the only woman magician performing there, said the excited 28-year-old.        
	She received the invitation for the convention at Forges les Eaux theatre early this year. Its an honour, for you have to attain a level of perfection as an artiste to be able to perform there. The council reviews shows of magicians from across the world and then chooses the ones they want to host. I was invited for a public performance, but I have also put in my name for the contest, so I have five confirmed shows, said Maneka.        
	She has a trick up her sleeve for the festival. Its a traditional Indian trick, but it had been taken over by foreigners and repeatedly performed by Houdini, explained the young magician. She has discussed the trick with her father and received a clean chit from him. I am using the simple Indian form of the trick, with some of my innovations.        
	Maneka is experimenting with the presentation, too. Ill be speaking in Hindi, in keeping with the nature of the trick, she said.        
	Her costume, too, will be Indian. It has been specially designed for this show. Its very colourful, very extravagant and very Indian.        
	Maneka will be accompanied by her father to London, where she will hold a few promotional shows, and then to Paris.         
	I have been asked to be one of the judges at the festival. I informed the organisers that I wouldnt want to be on the panel on the day Maneka takes part in the contest, said the senior magician.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Domestic guilty of murder
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Domestic guilty of murder
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Telegraph report on the death of the Bankas                                  
	A fast track court convicted domestic help Kebol Roy on Monday for the murder of his elderly employers, Tarachand Banka and wife Sarda, in their Camac Street apartment three years ago.        
	Subodh Kumar Batabyal, the judge who pronounced Kebol guilty, will announce the punishment on Thursday. If the verdict is capital punishment, the 23-year-old will become the second domestic help in just over a fortnight to be given the death sentence.        
	Nikku Yadav, a year older than Kebol, was sentenced to death on August 29 for the murder of 51-year-old Ravinder Kaur Luthra, in whose Ballygunge Circular Road apartment he had worked for seven years.        
	Tarachand, 68, and Sarda, 56, were found murdered in their seventh-floor flat at Mansarovar Apartments on the morning of April 18, 2005. Kebol had smashed Tarachands head with a frying pan and slit Sardas throat with a kitchen knife.         
	Like Nikku, who laid out an elaborate Valentines Day party scene after Ravinders murder to try and mislead sleuths, Kebol had taken deliberate steps to remove all tell-tale signs from the murder site before fleeing with jewellery and other valuables worth Rs 20 lakh.        
	From the murder weapons to the taps in the toilet, Kebol washed and wiped everything that he thought he had touched before and after the killings, investigating officer Subhasish Bhattacharya said.        
	But he forgot the knob of the almirah he had opened to take out the jewellery. He was in a hurry and forgot to erase his fingerprints on the knob, said Atanu Banerjee, the officer-in-charge of the homicide wing.        
	That was the most important piece of evidence for us.         
	The homicide wing, however, took a month to find Kebol. He was arrested from Ghorparan, a remote village in a Maoist-infested area of Bihar. He first tried to cook up stories but broke down during interrogation and confessed to the crime, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.        
	After the state forensic science laboratory confirmed that the fingerprints on the almirah knob were of Kebol, the police went about putting the missing pieces together.        
	Kebol planned the murder 48 hours before the incident. He had noticed Tarachand putting jewellery that he had purchased for a relatives wedding in the almirah, Bhattacharya said.        
	On the day of the crime, Tarachand woke up, collected milk packets left outside the main door and lay down on the couch in the living room to catch a few winks. The domestic help first struck him on the head with an iron rod. He then picked up a frying pan from the kitchen and smashed his employers head.        
	Kebol next entered the bedroom and killed Sarda in her sleep.        
	Those who saw Kebol leaving Mansarovar Apartments early in the morning were the only witnesses in the trial. He was convicted mainly on the basis of the forensic evidence we gathered, the investigating officer said.        
	The police said on Monday that Kebol would probably be sentenced to life imprisonment, if not death.

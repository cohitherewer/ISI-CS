  - Tata Steel contests army move to shift out cars          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Elliot Park                                        
	The wheel does not seem to be turning for Tata Steel in town. If the Nano has hit a political roadblock in Singur, a parking lot manned by the company on Chowringhee has run into trouble with the army.        
	Tata Steel on Friday moved the high court against an army notification disallowing parking of vehicles by its employees in front of Elliot Park.        
	The army, claiming to be the custodian of the plot on which the parking lot has come up, had sent the notification to the parks administrative officer, asking him to ensure that the place was vacated. The park, opposite Tata Centre on Jawaharlal Nehru Road, is maintained by Tata Steel.        
	Moving the petition before Justice Dipankar Dutta on Friday, counsel for the Tatas Anindya Mitra and Pratap Chatterjee argued that the company had the right to use the plot as a parking lot.        
	The company has been using the place on the basis of an agreement between Tata Iron and Steel Company (now Tata Steel) and the civic authorities on February 22, 2000. The agreement, registered in 2005, allows the company to park vehicles on the spot for 10 years, Mitra said.        
	The lawyers claimed that the company had paid Rs 10 lakh as 10 years rent to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). Since the agreement is still valid, the army cannot issue the notification, Chatterjee argued. A copy of the agreement was submitted to the court.        
	The lawyer representing the army, however, argued that the agreement had no legal validity as neither Tata Steel nor the civic body was the custodian of the plot. The land belongs to the army, he submitted.        
	Fort William had allotted some areas of the Maidan to Tata Steel for beautification. The company set up Elliot Park but later started using part of it as a parking lot. We are opposing that.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya accepted the existence of the agreement between Tata Steel and the CMC but refused to comment on its legality. During the hearing, Justice Dutta granted green activist Subhash Duttas plea to be made a party to the case. The matter will be heard again after the Puja recess.

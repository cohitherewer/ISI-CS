                                                                                                                                    Health hubs play with fire

        
	A Nandaram-type disaster awaits the state-run hospitals. Not one hospital in the city has the mandatory emergency exits. High-risk zones (transformer rooms and stores) are housed in the same buildings as indoor wards, while fire extinguishers and alarms are few and far between. Metro runs a reality check... 
 
	SSKM
 
	BEDS: 1,650.
 
	ABSENT: Fire alarms and emergency exits; fire extinguishers in the wards and staircases; disaster-management cell; trained firefighters.
 
	PRESENT: A fire extinguisher at the entrance to each building. A small water body is the sole source of water on campus to battle a blaze.
 
	Fire-fighting preparedness: Medical superintendent Ashok Kumar Ghosh admitted that fire-safety measures need to be upgraded. ldquo;We have approached the public works and fire services departments for the upgrade. Gas burners in the kitchen have been replaced with clay ovens, though they are more polluting. rdquo;
 
	RISK: Oxygen cylinders are stacked in the cardio-thoracic ward with no safety equipment nearby.
 
	DOCTORSPEAK: ldquo;Even the operating theatres are not equipped to fight a fire. rdquo;
 
	MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL
 
	BEDS: 1,450.
 
	ABSENT: Emergency exits and fire alarms in the wards, adequate fire-safety devices in the operating theatres.
 
	PRESENT: A few fire extinguishers.
 
	Fire-fighting preparedness: Medical superintendent Anup Roy said: ldquo;A disaster-management committee was set up a few years ago but no fire drill has yet been conducted. We have tried to make our canteens safe and installed fire alarms in the operating theatres. rdquo;
 
	RISK: Old electric wires hang all over David Hare building.
 
	DOCTORSPEAK: During a blaze, firemen can source water from the adjacent College Square tank.
 
	CALCUTTA NATIONAL MEDICAL COLLEGE
 
	BEDS:1,250 (approx.) 
 
	ABSENT: Fire alarms, emergency exits and underground water reservoir (the fire services department has recommended that the hospital, situated in a crowded locality, should have an underground reservoir with a capacity of one lakh litres and with a provision to replenish 2,000 litres a minute).
 
	PRESENT: A lone extinguisher on the ground floor of the gynaecology and obstetrics department, with a sand bucket beneath it. The bucket doubles as dustbin.
 
	RISK: A makeshift kitchen with an electric heater operates in the neurology ward. A heater is used in the urology ward, too. A room on the top floor of Raja Ram Mohan Block houses the lift machinery. A board outside reads ldquo;Danger 480 Volts rdquo;. Two electric heaters are used in the room for cooking, but there is an extinguisher inside.
 
	DOCTORSPEAK:Medical superintendent Mrityunjay Mukhopadhyay said: ldquo;The hospital doesn rsquo;t have a fire management cell. But extinguishers have been installed in the open canteen, emergency ward and the operating theatres. The wards, too, should have similar measures. rdquo; On the use of electric heaters, he said: ldquo;Rules are often not enforced rdquo;.
 
	NIL RATAN SIRCAR HOSPITAL 
 
	BEDS:1,890.
 
	ABSENT: Extinguishers in three of the four stores (deputy superintendent Surendranath Guchhait said each has at least one) and several wards (including paediatrics, medicine and radiology).
 
	PRESENT: A water body is the sole source of water on campus for firemen.
 
	RISKS: High-tension electric wires run along the ground floor of the radiology department. Seven cylinders are stored in the patients rsquo; kitchen, which has no fire-safety devices. Medicine store is located in the basement, violating safety norms.
 
	STAFFSPEAK: ldquo;The oxygen store has asked for extinguishers but the authorities are not completing the formalities, rdquo; said an official. More than 11 cylinders are kept in the store, which remains unmanned from 5.30pm to 9.30am.
 
	OFFICIALSPEAK: Fire services director D.P. Biswas said: ldquo;All our government hospitals are in fire-prone areas. The risk is maximum for RG Kar hospital, as it is a multi-storeyed building. The National Building Code of India states that hospitals should not be taller than 30 metres... After the SSKM canteen fire in 2007, we have asked the state-run hospitals to implement a series of fire-safety measures. But none has responded. rdquo;
 
	The director of health services, Sanchita Bakshi, said: ldquo;We have spoken to the fire department and are in the process of upgrading the safety measures in hospitals. A detailed plan has been worked out. rdquo;

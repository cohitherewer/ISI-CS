          Todays question: Should office hours change in keeping with the season? 
  More letters will be published next week                    Beat the heat: A policeman pours water to cool down on a hot summer day in the city. Picture by Suman Ballav

	Office hours should be changed in accordance with the season. But it will still be uncomfortable if the crowd on the trains, buses, taxis, autos is not distributed in a balanced way. All offices should maintain different working hours. For instance in summer, some offices should work from 7am to 3pm, some others from 9am to 5pm, from 11am to 7pm and 1pm to 9pm.This way the traffic load can be distributed.					            D.P. Bhattacharya, 
  Sonarpur								       
	Due to global warming, extreme weather conditions are expected. But matching office hours with the season is practically impossible. Instead, it would be suitable if five-day weeks can be started in all offices by adjusting the working hours accordingly.                 Ranjini Bhattacharya, 
  Dum Dum Cantonment								       
	No, office hours shouldnt be changed for two vital reasons; first, if evening or night shifts are started in summer it will affect the body mechanism and work output will be reduced. Second, irregular power supply makes the heat unbearable from 9am to 9pm. Hence, employees may not get sufficient rest before heading back to work. Rather, one should drink water, have light food and use umbrella to tackle the heat.                Indranil Sanyal, 
  Dhakuria								       
	The stipulated office hours must not be changed with the weather conditions. All metros should follow the same pattern. Else, one office will find the others unreachable after a certain period of time. Regularity has to be maintained for the sake of communication. The present system is the most acceptable one.                Kshama Agarwal,
  Girish Park								       
	Changing office timings, keeping in mind the season factor, doesnt make much sense. By this logic the school and college timings should also change. These amendments will cause chaos. Due to the ecological imbalances every now and then the temperature fluctuates. Hence changing office hours will result in a mismatch of timings in the other activities of the employees.                 Chameli Pal, 
  Batanagar								       
	The office timings should definitely be changed. Or else the sarkari babus and boudis find it really tough to attend office at 11am and leave by 4pm under the scorching sun. The timings should be changed to 5pm to 9pm.                 K.B. Goswami,
  Central Park								       
	Office hours and school/ college hours must be changed with season. In order to avoid different establishments from changing the office hours differently and on different dates it will be prudent to advance the clock in summer by an hour (say, from March 1) and retreat when the temperature comes down (on August 31). It helps in saving energy and offering convenience to people in general.                 Paramananda Pal, 
  Karaya Road								       
	The question of changing office hours in keeping with the season does not arise in areas of moderate climate like south Bengal or Calcutta. One may argue in favour of bringing forward the office hours by at least one hour (from 9am to 4pm) particularly during peak summer. Moreover, most modern offices are equipped with air-conditioners. Office goers, in fact, feel happier to be in office than at home during summer. Even in areas of extreme winter, like the hills, the office timing of 10am to 5pm appears reasonably moderate in view of availability of the sun for the maximum duration in this period.                 Subhankar Mukherjee,
  Address not mentioned								       
	Not at all. In an industrial belt, the mercury hovers around 40-47 degree Celsius mark during mid-noon but goes down a bit after sunset. Most offices are over by 5-6pm and by then the blazing sun relents. Office-goers are not so tormented while leaving for home. In the morning too when the banks open at 8am the heat wave is not unbearable.So rescheduling of office hours has no meaning.                 A.S. Mehta, 
  New Alipore       
	This could selectively be applied to schools and other educational institutions but would certainly not work in the state and central government offices, where by and large people do not report on time. Perhaps the idea can be implemented in private sector offices where attendance and work culture are better than in the government sector.                Anil Kumar Sen, 
  RC Chatterjee Lane								       
	 I appreciate the proposal of changing office hours. It would provide much comfort to the employees. But since ours is a tropical country people are used to dealing with the heat.                Rathin Chatterjee,
  Dum Dum								       
	 Absolutely not. There is no question of office hours being changed. The best time for offices to operate is from 10am to 5pm. So office-goers hardly have a chance of facing the heat. Besides, they work in the office under the fan or with air coolers or air-conditioners. It is the general public who face the heat. In fact, office-goers prefer to go to office because they are more comfortable there than in their own houses in summer.                P. Pramanik, 
  Santoshpur Avenue								       
	Hot spell in Calcutta lasts for a very short time so the change of office hours will cause tremendous inconvenience to both the people and the employees who come from the outskirts. It will only help them evade work.                 B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park								       
	Yes, office hours should be changed. Due to the unbearable heat at times office-goers fall prey to sunstroke. To avoid such misery, office hours can be changed in summer from morning to afternoon. During the British rule, offices used to shift to the summer capital in Simla. If the hours are changed officegoers will be able to travel comfortably in trains and buses without traffic jam.                 Manasi Chakraborti, 
  Behala								       
	It would be prudent if office hours start in the morning to enable office-goers to avoid the heat. Many middle-aged people cannot bear the sun as a result of which they fall victim to various illnesses. Many workers feel tired and exhausted during summer.                 Amaresh Paul, 
  Bandel								       
	Office hours no longer mean eight hours of duty. In sectors like IT, duty extends to 24 hours. A season can hardly change this work culture.

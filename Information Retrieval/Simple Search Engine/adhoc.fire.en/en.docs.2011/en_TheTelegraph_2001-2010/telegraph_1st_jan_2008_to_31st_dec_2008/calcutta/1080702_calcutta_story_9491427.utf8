          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The medical superintendents office at Medical College and Hospital and a kiosk were ransacked by a mob on Tuesday afternoon. Twenty-one people were arrested.         
	A policeman and a security guard were injured in trying to resist the supporters of the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital Employees and Public Health Security and Safety Samonnay Committee who went on the rampage.         
	The men earlier visited the superintendents office to hand over a list of demands, which included removal of illegal tea stalls on the premises.         
	About 50 of them ransacked the office, in the administrative block of the hospital, for more than 30 minutes, protesting inaction by the superintendent.         
	A large contingent of police brought the situation under control.

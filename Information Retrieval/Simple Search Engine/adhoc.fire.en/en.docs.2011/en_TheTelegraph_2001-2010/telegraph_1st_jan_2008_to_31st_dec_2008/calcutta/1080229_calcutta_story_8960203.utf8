The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Big Mac on return track by April   Burger boss bullish over Bengal
                                                                                                               Big Mac on return track by April     - Burger address being restructured to open with twin in two months          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                          A section of the interior of McDonalds when it opened in March 2007                                        
	Big Mac is on its way back. The 55 Park Street address  now shrouded in an under-construction canopy  will be buzzing with the burger crowd again by April-end.        
	Six months after an explosion had ripped through its first outlet in town, Vikram Bakshi, the managing director of McDonalds India (north and east), told Metro: Yes, absolutely, we are coming back. There is no reason not to, considering the kind of response we got here. In the next two months, two of our restaurants will get going, on Park Street and at Mani Square. We are hopeful that a third restaurant will open by the end of this year.        
	The restaurant is being restructured because of the fairly large impact and re-construction has started with some changes to the interiors, he added.         
	The international fast food chain had opened doors on March 9, 2007, only to be forced shut by a mystery blast on the morning of August 12, that killed a pedestrian and injured four employees.         
	With the final forensic report still a secret, the cause of the explosion is not clear yet. Theories range from AC duct pressure to dust in the AC ducts to LPG leak to methane accumulation to mala fide intentions.        
	In town on Thursday, Bakshi said: I would not like to speculate, but I believe it was a freak incident.... The LPG theory is full of holes.        
	The other confusion is about compensation. Aftab Hussain Ansari, 24, was killed by the impact of the explosion while waiting to cross Park Street and reach his home in Queens Mansion.        
	Somebody from McDonalds came to meet us in January, but where were they for so long? We have not received any compensation till now, Mohammad Alauddin, Aftabs father, told Metro.         
	There has been no response from the family. We want to help the younger brother with employment or sustainable compensation, claimed Bakshi.                                
	Alauddin has filed a case of negligence against McDonalds. It took four months for us to get the boys post-mortem report and the forensic reports have been denied to us, alleged R.K. Khanna, the lawyer carrying Alauddins brief.        
	Picking up the pieces after the freak incident on August 12, the burger giant remains bullish about Bengal. We continue to believe that Calcutta and the east is a large market. This will be the growth area for us in the next three to five years and we plan to open 15 restaurants here, said Bakshi.        
	The McDonalds at Mani Square, on the Bypass, will be a full-menu format affair with 150-plus covers. The chain also has plans for smaller restaurants and kiosks, plus tie-ups with railway stations and airports. We will invest Rs 100 crore in the east in three to five years. We are also considering putting up a separate bakery, here, concluded Bakshi.

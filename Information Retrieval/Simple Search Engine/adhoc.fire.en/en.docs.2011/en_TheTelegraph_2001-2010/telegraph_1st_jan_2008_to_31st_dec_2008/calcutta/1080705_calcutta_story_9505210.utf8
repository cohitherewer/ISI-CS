          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court (HC) on Friday asked the civic body to demarcate within a week the 7.5 acres on the Bypass that it had promised to hand over to the Crafts Council.        
	The council, along with the Charitable Trust, is to set up a crafts village on the plot to train artisans.        
	The court passed the order on an application by the Trust, which alleged that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) was not allowing it to start construction on the plot.        
	The trust lawyer submitted that the government and the CMC had in 1994 allotted 18.11 acres for the village. The lease deed was registered in 1999 but the CMC refused to sanction the construction plan, the lawyer said.        
	Later, the trust was told that it would be allotted only 7.5 acres. But then we came to know that even that land was to be included in Milon Mela and finally, that it would be handed over to a businessman.        
	The division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar asked the CMC to demarcate the plot within a week.

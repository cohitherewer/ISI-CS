          RITH BASU                        
	On Wednesday, the election commission announced a ban on poll graffiti on walls. Minister Subhas Chakraborty on Thursday termed the model code of conduct ludicrous.        
	The Telegraph, which has been running a sustained campaign against wall graffiti, provides a ready reckoner for citizens.              
	How many days before the election does the code of conduct come into effect?        
	Two to three months before the election dates, which the Election Commission will announce in Delhi.              
	Who do I complain to about a violation of the wall graffiti order?        
	In Calcutta, call the director of land records and survey (DLRS). In the districts, alert the district magistrate. Complaints can be lodged with external observers, who will be arriving in the state before the elections. The local police station can also be alerted.              
	What numbers do I dial?         
	DLRS  24791354; SDO, Bidhannagar  23596097; DM, South 24-Parganas  24793713; DM, North 24-Parganas  25523662.        
	Contact details of external observers will be printed in advertisements and posted on the election commission website (http://www.ceowestbengal.nic.in).                
	What do I do if the violation happens at night?        
	You can SMS your complaint to the electoral officers. Additionally, a helpline number and an email address will be generated and advertised through the media. These can be accessed 24x7.              
	Under what section do I lodge a complaint?        
	You do not have to mention any section as this is not a law. It is a model code of conduct to be observed prior to and during the elections according to instruction number 317/2008/JS-II dated 7.10.2008. of the Election Commission of India.              
	Does only the landlord or property owner have the right to complain?        
	Any citizen has the right to complain against wall graffiti. He or she does not need to own the premises being defaced or even live there.              
	Will I get protection from the political party against which I complain?        
	Your identity will be kept confidential. You dont even have to identify yourself while lodging the complaint. (Officials admit if complaint is lodged with police station, identity might be leaked.)              
	What should I say or write to lodge a complaint?        
	You need to very briefly describe what you saw, with the exact time and location. Do not write long letters or mails. It will be a bonus if you take a picture of the violation on your mobile phone camera.                
	What poll propaganda is allowed and what is not?        
	Wall-writing, pasting of posters and similar other permanent or semi-permanent defacement, which are not easily removable, are not allowed. Banners, flags, cut-outs and bunting (festoons) are allowed, but only with the voluntary permission of the occupant of the premises.              
	Who will enforce it?        
	The returning officer or district election officer will issue a notice to the offender (political party/association/ candidate/person) for removing the defacement. If they do not comply, the election commission will remove the graffiti but the expense incurred in the process shall be recovered from the offending party.              
	Can parties write wall graffiti after the polls?        
	They can, in the absence of concrete laws in the state to stop them.

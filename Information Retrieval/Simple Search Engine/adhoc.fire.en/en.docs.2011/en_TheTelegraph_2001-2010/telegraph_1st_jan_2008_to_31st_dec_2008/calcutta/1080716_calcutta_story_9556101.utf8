The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Beacon flout back in court
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Beacon flout back in court
  - State asked to produce fresh list of people entitled to the privilege          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	Illegal use of the beacon light atop official cars has again come under the high court scanner, following the Tarit Topdar controversy.         
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh on Tuesday asked the state government to file a fresh affidavit stating the rules on the use of the beacon and listing the dignitaries who were entitled to it.         
	The bench also asked the government to state what steps it had taken against those who illegally flaunt the beacon atop their cars.         
	Six months ago, on the basis of an order of the court, the state had submitted a list of dignitaries who could use the beacon. The list included the sabhadhipatis of all zilla parishads and the chairpersons of all municipalities but left out members of Parliament.         
	On June 2, traffic sergeant Sudip Maity had booked CPM parliamentarian Tarit Topdars driver at Shyambazar for traffic rule violation. Metro had reported that the car was fitted with a beacon, though Topdar as an MP was not allowed to do so.         
	After the incident, Manowara Begum of the All India Minority Forum had filed a petition in the high court, accusing the government of failing to take action against beacon-rule violators. The petition came up for hearing on Tuesday.         
	Begum submitted that the state had assured the high court it would ask the dignitaries not entitled to the privilege to remove the beacon from atop their cars. But the government has failed to keep its promise. Many unauthorised persons, such as Topdar, are still flaunting it.         
	She alleged that the police had neither seized Topdars car nor taken action against the MP for flouting the beacon rule.         
	The state lawyer argued that the police had fined the MPs driver.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ghost town at Writers
  - OFFICE CLOSED, MINISTER LEAVES          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A ministers office at Writers Buildings under lock and key, while the corridor of power lies deserted on Thursday morning. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	A perplexed minister of state for labour Anadi Sahoo left Writers Buildings as soon as he arrived on Thursday afternoon, as his room was locked.        
	I didnt know that my room would not be opened because of the bandh. Though my party had called the bandh, I came to Writers as I cannot shirk my responsibilities as a minister. But theres no use staying back as there isnt anyone around to give me a glass of water, Sahoo said while leaving the secretariat.        
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty blamed Sahoos embarrassment on his lack of experience. He should have just asked the caretaker to get his chamber unlocked, Chakraborty said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee followed his usual routine and stayed back at Writers till late in the evening, though the entire secretariat wore a deserted look.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, too, was present. I had to come for some urgent work, he said.        
	Policemen were found taking a stroll down empty corridors on the first and second floors and only a few senior IAS officers were browsing through the files.        
	Barring the VIP entrance, all other gates were closed. I dont have the attendance figures at Writers but it was far less than that on normal days, said inspector-general (law and order) Raj Kanojia.        
	Sources said that of the 6,500-odd employees at Writers, only around 25 had turned up for work.        
	The transport minister said that if required, the government would run buses during Fridays Trinamul Congress bandh.

				       Heartwarming act                          Leo rsquo;s Lair: Choopkatha Prashikhan Kendra performs Chhotoder Tolstoy at the Palladian Lounge on Saturday. The play was
  directed by Dolly Basu. Pictures by Rashbehari Das                        
	There was no cast list for Chhotoder Tolstoy. Director Dolly Basu did not want anyone to compare or measure the contributions of the child actors. ldquo;Theatre is much more than getting your lines and expressions right. It is a collective activity, where even the smallest contribution is important, rdquo; she said.   
	But naming no names, one must admit that the members of Choopkatha Prashikhan Kendra gave a heart-warming performance at the Palladian Lounge on November 8. The show featured three tales by Leo Tolstoy, presented through narration, songs, mime and dialogue.   
	 ldquo;I want the children to get the feel of all kinds of spaces. They have performed at the Academy of Fine Arts, at puja pandals and even in theatres on the city outskirts, rdquo; said Basu, a stage veteran. She has been running the Prashikhan Kendra for six years at her Salt Lake residence.             A scene from the play       
	The children who performed on Saturday were at the venue for five hours at a stretch. Some of them even suffer from learning disabilities.  
	The stories, each with messages on honesty, hard work and kindness, were further boosted with new- age messages against the use of chemicals in agriculture, corruption and female infanticide. Very few suggestive props and lights, designed by Nilotpal Das, were used on the makeshift stage. Music by Dolly Basu and Sanjay Das contributed considerably to the performance.   
	Theatre has a lot to offer children. ldquo;It saddens me to see the faces of children at reality shows who are there to win a car or something else for their parents. Theatre can be a therapy for all those children who cannot keep up with this stress, who have problems adjusting to society or the education system, rdquo; explained Basu.   
	Beginning with just five students, Basu now has a lively team of 27.   
	 ldquo;All it takes is sensitivity, kindness and a creative outlet. We didn rsquo;t aim at a spectacular show. The kids did not spend extra on costumes. The horns that the devils wore were what they made in craft classes, rdquo; said Basu. Not everyone had dialogues, but every actor strove to give his/her best.

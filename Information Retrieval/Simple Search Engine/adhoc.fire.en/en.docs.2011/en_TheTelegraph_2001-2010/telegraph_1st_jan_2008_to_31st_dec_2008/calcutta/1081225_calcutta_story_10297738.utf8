          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Syed Moinuddin, alias Pappu, an accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case, was granted conditional bail by the high court on Wednesday.        
	Pappu, who had spent 59 days in custody, will not be able to leave Calcutta without the courts consent. Justice D.P. Sengupta observed that Pappu should be given bail as the CBI probe in the case was over.        
	Ashok Todi, the main accused in the case, was brought to SSKM Hospital from the Presidency jail hospital on Thursday morning after he complained of a waist pain. Doctors advised traction. But as no bed was vacant at SSKM, he was sent back to the jail.

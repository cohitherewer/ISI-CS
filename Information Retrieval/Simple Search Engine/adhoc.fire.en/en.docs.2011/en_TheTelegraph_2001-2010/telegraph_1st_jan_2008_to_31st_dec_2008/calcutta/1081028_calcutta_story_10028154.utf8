The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | What amp; why of vector diseases
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       What amp; why of vector diseases
                            
	Eleven deaths in seven weeks. The fear over this festive season has more to do with the sting of the mosquito than the slump of the markets. Metro takes a closer look.              
	What vector-borne diseases are doing the rounds?        
	Malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis and lymphatic filariasis. Malaria and filariasis are caused by parasites; the rest by virus.              
	Why are blood tests often negative even if the disease has set in?        
	It takes 7-8 days after fever sets in for antibody to develop, so early tests can be negative.                
	How do they spread?        
	Through man-vector contact. Simply put, a mosquito that bites a carrier of the malaria parasite can transmit it to the next person it bites.              
	Why are they spreading so fast?        
	The diseases are spreading from one to multiple sources because of high frequency of man-vector contact. With such high population density and also high breeding of mosquitoes, parasites or virus are transmitted quickly.              
	What steps are taken to contain the diseases?        
	Vector control by killing adult mosquitoes (spraying repellants) and destroying larvae (oil poured into accumulated water), spreading awareness about avoiding mosquito bite (nets, coils, covered clothing) and preventing fresh water accumulation.              
	Why are they not being able to stop the spread?        
	No single method is 100 per cent effective. The sting operation has to be all-round and continuous.                 
	What are the medical options?        
	No medicines for dengue and chikungunya; only symptomatic treatment. Preventive vaccine for Japanese encephalitis. Drugs to control transmission of filariasis. Drugs for uncomplicated malaria; injection for complicated malaria. Drug-resistant malaria is emerging as a serious problem; it can be tackled with multiple drugs.              
	Why is the platelet count vital in dengue?        
	A drop in platelet count can indicate haemorrhagic dengue (internal bleeding caused by lack of coagulation), which needs intensive monitoring and medication.              
	Which diseases can turn fatal if not treated in time?        
	Complicated malaria or malignant malaria. Haemorrhagic dengue. Japanese Encephalitis.              
	What is the way out?        
	Rational vector management is a must, with correct dose of medicine and prevention of transmission by guarding patients against mosquito bites. Chances of transmission will be minimised if patients can be identified and treated early. Prompt hospitalisation is advised.

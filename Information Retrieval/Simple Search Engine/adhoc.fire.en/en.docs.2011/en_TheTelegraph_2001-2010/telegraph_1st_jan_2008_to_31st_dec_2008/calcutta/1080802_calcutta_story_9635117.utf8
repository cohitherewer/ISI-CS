	Two people were killed and seven injured in two accidents on Swami Vivekananda Road near Dakshineswar Temple on Friday.         
	Jayanti Raptan, a 34-year-old homemaker, was killed after a speeding bus on route 3 skidded off Swami Vivekananda Road and smashed into her roadside shanty around 2.15pm. Six people, including three children, were injured.         
	In the other mishap, 40-year-old Narayan Das was killed when a Tata Sumo knocked him down in front of his shanty before smashing into a SBSTC bus around 5.35am. Das and the driver were taken to a local hospital, where Das was declared brought dead. The driver fled before the cops reached the hospital.

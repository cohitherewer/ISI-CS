The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Websites led sleuths to murder trail
                                                                                                               Websites led sleuths to murder trail
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rakesh Guptas computer usage was the key                                  
	The hard disk of Rakesh Guptas computer led sleuths to his murder trail.        
	The data stored in the disk revealed that the 40-year-old company secretary had homosexual tendencies.        
	This set police on the trail of the men who allegedly killed Gupta after failing to blackmail him.        
	Gupta was a paid member of three pornographic websites. We understood his sexual preference after going through the computer in his Teghoria home, said an investigating officer of Baguiati police station.        
	It contained information about the websites Gupta had visited. We then rounded up some toughs in Sodepur, who tipped us off about Chandan Basu, he added.        
	Shibu, who had lured Gupta to a house in New Barrackpore for a few hours of fun on February 10, is absconding.        
	His friends Mithun Ghosh alias Jeet, Chandan, Laxmi Chakrabarty and Phulmoni Chakrabarty were present at the house that day. The four have been arrested.        
	Shibu and his associates wanted to extort money from Gupta. But when he became violent and refused to part with his ATM card and even threatened to go to the police, they got scared and strangled him, said an officer.        
	We are not sure who killed Gupta. That will become clear only after Shibu is arrested. His associates are giving contradictory statements. We are also not sure about the amount of money they had demanded from Gupta, added the officer.        
	According to him, Guptas wife Babita might have been in the dark about his homosexual activities.        
	On February 10, Shibu had called up Gupta and set up a meeting at Dum Dum station. The company secretary was then returning home after seeing his mother off at the airport.        
	Gupta went missing, only for his body to be found in a gunny bag in Sodepur the next morning.         
	Sleuths confirmed that Gupta had first met Shibu, who used to work in a garment shop, at a Salt Lake mall last year.        
	Malls and nightclubs often serve as pick-up places for homosexuals. Massage parlours in Salt Lake, Lake Town and on the fringes of the city are also being used for the same purpose. The owners of most of these parlours are criminals and blackmail visitors after trapping them, said an officer.

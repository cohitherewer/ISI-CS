The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Festive true spirit
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Festive true spirit
  - 257 pujas vie for CESC-Telegraph award            A STAFF REPORTER                          True Spirit judges Rupam Islam and Churni Ganguly at a puja last year                                  
	The CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja is not about extravagant pandals, giant idols or populist themes.         
	It is about celebrating Durga puja the way it is meant to be  in a sensible and sensitive manner.         
	As the curtains went up on the sixth edition of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja at Spring Club on Friday evening, new participants were initiated into what Dilip Samajpati, the senior manager of customer relations at CESC, called a movement rather than an award.        
	The movement has over the years grown from 100 pujas in 2003 to 257 this year and prodded Puja organisers to look at essentials like safety, civic consciousness and social commitment. And the results are showing.        
	There was not a single fire-related hazard during Durga Puja 2007 and the credit goes to you, the organisers, said Sudipta Bit of the state fire services department. This year, the briefing was restricted to first-time participants, who were taken through the entire gamut of True Spirit directives. In terms of safety measures, the judges panel would look at efficiency in crowd management and traffic control, provisions for first aid, precautionary measures for fire and electricity, participation in fire drill, efficiency in crisis management and the display of True Spirit signage (indicating facilities like first aid, toilets and drinking water).        
	The pujas would also be marked on parameters of civic consciousness such as absence of sound pollution, being eco-friendly, efficiency in waste management and adherence to immersion norms.        
	The enjoyment can be much more if you stick to the rules, pointed out Samajpati.         
	But there is more to the True Spirit Puja award than following the rulebook. It also expects organisers to pay special attention to the comfort of pandal-hoppers and then look beyond the festivities and care for the underprivileged.

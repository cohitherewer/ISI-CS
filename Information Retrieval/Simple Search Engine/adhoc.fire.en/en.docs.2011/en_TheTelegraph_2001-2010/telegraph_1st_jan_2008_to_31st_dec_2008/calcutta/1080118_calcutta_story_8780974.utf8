           Exploring genius
          In an effort to explore the thin line between madness and genius, one of Calcuttas oldest English theatre groups, The Red Curtain, is back with David Auburns Pulitzer-winning drama, The Proof. The play revolves around a mathematics genius and his daughter, who tries to prove her fathers authorship of a revolutionary theory after his death. The play was made into a film starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins. Closer home, actor-director Arun Mukhopadhyay adapted The Proof into Nirnoy, which had a successful run on the Calcutta stage. The Red Curtains The Proof is set in 28 Ballygunge Circular Road, a fictitious address cooked up by production director Sumit Roy, who adapted the play and set the characters in Calcutta. Here the family returns to Calcutta from abroad. Several sub-plots have been weaved around the main plot. Kabir Seth plays mathematician Prof. Rajat Sen, while Niharika Seth plays his daughter Sharmistha. The two other cast members are Sunayana Roy as Supriya Sen and Dhruv Mookerji as Anup Bose. The play is being staged to raise funds for Operation Smile, a project aimed at treating children with facial deformities.

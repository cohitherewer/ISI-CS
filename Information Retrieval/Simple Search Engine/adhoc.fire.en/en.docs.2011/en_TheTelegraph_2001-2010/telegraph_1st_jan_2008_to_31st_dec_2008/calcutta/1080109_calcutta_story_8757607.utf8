The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shooting prompts CU security bolster
                                                                                                            Shooting prompts CU security bolster
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Visva-Bharati hostel where a student was shot                                  
	Security arrangement in the 17 Calcutta University (CU) hostels is being tightened after Sundays shooting on the Visva-Bharati campus.        
	The university authorities wrote to city police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti on Monday requesting him to provide necessary assistance to step up security in the hostels, especially the ones for girl students.        
	Nearly 1,700 students stay in the 17 hostels, eight of which are only for girls. There is one guard per hostel.        
	We will soon hold a meeting with senior police officers to discuss ways to bolster security, said CU registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay.        
	Students staying in the hostels often complain of unauthorised entry of outsiders on the premises. For instance, drunk local youths loiter on the sprawling Hastings campus, where two girls hostels are located. Some of the students had demonstrated last year for a bar on entry of outsiders on the campus.        
	There is hardly any vigil in our hostel and we wont be surprised if an incident like the one at Visva-Bharati happens here, said a girl who stays in the Viharilal College of Home and Social Science hostel on the Hastings campus.        
	Round-the-clock vigil is being contemplated on the campuses after Sundays incident. We have held preliminary talks with the police in this regard, said pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Suranjan Das.         
	Asit Baran Rudrapal, the secretary of the universitys board of residence department, admitted that the existing security arrangement is inadequate. The university is not in a position to recruit additional security personnel, he said.

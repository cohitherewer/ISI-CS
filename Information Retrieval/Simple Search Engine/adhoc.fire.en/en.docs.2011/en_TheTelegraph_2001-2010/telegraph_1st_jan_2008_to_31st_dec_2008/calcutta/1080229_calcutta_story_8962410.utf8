The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sand kills man on VIP Road
                                                                                                               Sand kills man on VIP Road
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Sand patches on VIP Road pose a grave risk to motorists. Picture by Soumen Bhattacharjee        
	A 38-year-old schoolteacher was crushed to death by a speeding bus on VIP Road on Thursday morning.         
	Saswata Roy, head covered by a helmet, was riding a two-wheeler that skidded after hitting a patch of sand meant for use at a construction site bordering the thoroughfare.        
	The Kestopur resident was flung to the road and the wheels of the bus on route 44 rolled over his head, said a police officer, reconstructing the mishap on the basis of statements given by witnesses.        
	The bus driver has been arrested and charged with attempt to murder. He was driving recklessly, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).        
	Local residents alleged that suppliers dump sand on both sides of the artery for the buildings coming up along the stretch. The sand is later removed to the construction sites, but there are always spillovers along the road. These patches pose a risk to motorists, especially those on two-wheelers, said a Baguiati resident.        
	Officers of the Baguiati traffic guard said the mishap occurred around 9.40am, when Saswata, a teacher at Scottish Church Collegiate School, was on his way to Ultadanga.        
	He took a turn towards Dum Dum Park when his two-wheeler hit a patch of sand and skidded out of control. He fell into the path of the speeding bus. The driver slammed the brakes but it was too late; the bus ran over the teacher, said an officer of the traffic guard.        
	Roy, the fourth accident victim on VIP Road this year, had moved to a Kestopur flat with his wife and six-month old-son a year ago.         
	Saswatas wife and other family members went into shock after identifying the body in Baguiati police station. His wife was inconsolable. Seeing her condition, we sent her back home after asking some basic questions, said an officer.        
	Traffic on VIP Road is a mess, said a resident. The police should not allow suppliers to dump building material along the road, said Tanmoy Mondal, a former Trinamul Congress MLA of the area.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Two 21-year-old girls who fled their Howrah homes last month to marry each other appeared in court on Wednesday to clear the name of a 50-year-old relative arrested on the charge of kidnapping them.         
	Tapati Manna and Ranu Mandal (names changed) told the acting chief judicial magistrate of Howrah that Badal Manna had not kidnapped them, claimed the girls lawyer.        
	They married on their own on September 22 and started living in Jaipur as husband and wife, the lawyer quoted the two as saying.        
	Following a complaint by the girls families, Manna was arrested on September 30.        
	Samir Dey, the deputy director of public prosecution, Howrah, said: The marriage is illegal. Two persons of the same sex cannot marry and live like husband and wife. Hence, the girls have been sent to the safe custody of their parents.         
	Tapati appeared in court in T-shirt and trousers and sporting short hair, while Ranu wore a sari, ornaments and vermilion on her forehead. Tapati returned to her home in Gabberia, Panchla, with her mother Maya. Ranus father Arun, a motor mechanic, accompanied her to their home in Manikpur, Nazirgunge.        
	Both parents said they would recognise the relationship.        
	The families had pressured the girls to part since they became close after meeting four years ago.        
	On September 22, the girls left home leaving behind notes stating that they were going away since society would not recognise their relationship. They boarded the Jodhpur Express at Howrah the same day.        
	Tapati said: After the train started moving, I applied vermilion on Ranus forehead. We were staying with a relative of Badalda in Jaipur and worked in a zari factory. After we learnt that Badalda was arrested for kidnapping us, we decided to return to Howrah and reveal the truth.        
	The girls reached Howrah on Tuesday and went straight to Panchla police station.

                      Suchitra Mitra 85                    She had received an offer to record songs of Tagore even before she became a student of Santiniketan, but had declined it as she felt she would not be able to do them justice. Later, within weeks of Tagores death, she entered the hallowed portals of Santiniketans Sangeet Bhavan on a princely scholarship of Rs 20. Here, she had the rare privilege of learning from some of the greatest exponents of Rabindrasangeet: Indiradevi Chaudhurani, Shantidev Ghosh and Shailajaranjan Mazumdar. None other than renowned Rabindrasangeet singer Suchitra Mitra, she is today a legend in her own right in the history of Tagore songs. Today, on her 85th birthday, her numerous students and admirers have come together to celebrate the occasion through various cultural programmes. This evening, Indo Occidental Symbiosis hosts an event where the grand old lady of Bengali songs will be honoured and felicitated. One of her most distinguished students and well-known singer Purba Dam will perform solo. Agnibha Bandyopadhyay, Pubali Debnath and Sushanta Mukhopadhyay will also present Tagore songs. To be followed by a performance of Suchitra Mitras favourite dance-drama, Chandalika (dir: Alokananda Roy).

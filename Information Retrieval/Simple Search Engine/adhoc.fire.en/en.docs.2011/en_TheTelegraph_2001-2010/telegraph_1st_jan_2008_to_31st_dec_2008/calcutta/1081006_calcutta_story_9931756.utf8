          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee allegedly threatened the police commissioner that Bengal would burn unless those arrested for attacking Charu Market police station on Saturday were released immediately.        
	The leader called Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti on his cellphone after his force picked up 29 people from the Tollygunge and Lake areas on Saturday night.        
	Chatterjee called me and said jader dhorechhen tara amader doler lok. Oder chhere na dile Bangla jole jabe (those arrested are all Trinamul supporters. If you do not release them, Bengal will burn), Chakrabarti said.        
	The leader ignored the police chiefs warning that the conversation was being recorded.        
	Chatterjee, however, denied having threatened Chakrabarti. I told him innocent people were being rounded up and that we should not be held responsible for the consequences of such an action, the leader claimed.        
	A 100-strong mob had turned violent when a team from Charu Market police station reached the spot where a private bus had overturned, injuring 15 people.        
	An officer said some local youths, all drunk, were robbing the passengers on the pretext of rescuing them. The youths jostled with the cops and then raided the police station, where they pelted the officers with stones and set four vehicles on fire.        
	Deputy commissioner (south) Rajesh Subarno, deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee and officer-in-charge Shyamal Chakrabarty were injured.        
	The attack was masterminded by criminals from Jhalar Math, Private Road and Gobindopur. Three names have surfaced  Montu, Dyani and Arijit, said an officer.        
	Sources said the criminals involved in Saturday nights violence had managed to give the police the slip during the pre-Puja preventive crackdown.

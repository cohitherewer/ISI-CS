	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) will start work on projects worth over Rs 1,000 crore, including Vivekananda Road and Dum Dum flyovers and water treatment plants in Howrah and Garden Reach, this month.         
	If work is not completed within a year and a half, the agency will bear the cost for the delay.        
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya announced the decision to start the projects in a recent meeting. He also set the deadline.        
	Water treatment and solid waste management projects, worth about Rs 700 crore, comprise the largest chunk of work. Construction of a water treatment plant in Padmapukur, Howrah, the third phase of Garden Reach water treatment plant and solid waste management projects in Serampore, Mahestala and Budge Budge are slated to start in November.         
	The CMDA will also build new flyovers on Vivekananda Road and at Dum Dum. The Bagha Jatin flyover will be widened to six lanes. An underpass will also be built.        
	In addition, the government agency will build nearly 4,000 flats for low-income groups at Nonadanga, Rajarhat, Baishnabghata, Barrackpore and Chetla.        
	The ground work has started. If everything goes smoothly, the chief minister will lay the foundation of the Bagha Jatin flyover extension on November 23, said Debdas Bhattacharya, the director general of the CMDA.        
	The funds for the projects will come from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, wings of the state government and the civic bodies concerned.

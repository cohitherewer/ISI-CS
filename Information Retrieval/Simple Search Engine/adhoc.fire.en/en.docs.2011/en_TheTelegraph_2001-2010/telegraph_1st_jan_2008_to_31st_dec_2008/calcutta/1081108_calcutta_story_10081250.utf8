          An Indian student on how Michigan reacted to the Obama victory                                  
	It was a sea of heads on that chilly fall afternoon on October 2, when Barack Obama came to Michigan State University (MSU) for the Change We Need rally. Classes were either cancelled or made optional so that students could go and listen to the prospective future president of the United States. The event started at 2.30pm at Adams Field but there was a big queue right from 8am. Some had taken up parking spots from as early as 5am.        
	Around 20,000 people listened to his speech that day. MSU students showed their support by giving Obama a Spartan basketball jersey with his name and the number 08 on the back.         
	Obama had chosen the Stevie Wonder classic, Signed, Sealed, Delivered to close his rally.        
	Fast forward to Election Day on November 4. Television channels were asking viewers to go out and vote. An online networking site, Facebook, was plastered with voting graphics and provided constant updates on how many Facebook members had already voted.                  Michigan voters queue up on November 4 (AFP)      
	Starbucks was offering free coffee and Ben and Jerrys was offering free ice-cream to all voters. Michigan is primarily a Democrat state, and there were lots of people wearing Obama T-shirts, and many had the I voted stickers on them. There was excitement in the air all day.         
	Obama needed 270 electoral votes to win, and he seemed to be stuck at 207 for around 45 minutes. Finally when he won, shouts of delight could be heard from every apartment around us. There were vindictive hurrahs during McCains conceding speech and more happy tears during Obamas acceptance speech. An African-American friend had tears in her eyes in disbelief. To celebrate this epic moment, the student community uncorked champagne bottles and distributed Go Obama cakes. The whole state partied hard.

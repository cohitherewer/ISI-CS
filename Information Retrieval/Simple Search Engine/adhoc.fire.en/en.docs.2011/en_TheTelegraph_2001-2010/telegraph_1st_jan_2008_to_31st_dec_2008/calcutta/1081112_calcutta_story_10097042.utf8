The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Held to ransom by a handful
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Held to ransom by a handful
  - 100 CHAIRS, 10 LISTENERS, ONE SPEAKER amp; HUNDREDS SUFFER										                        A meeting in the Metro channel on Tuesday afternoon for which half of the north-bound flank of the thoroughfare opposite Metro cinema was cordoned off, slowing down traffic at the vital intersection.

	What does it take to clog a city centre? Not much, if you happen to be organising a meeting in the Metro channel. You get a prime location and a captive audience (thanks to the traffic snarl). And, theres nothing official about it! Metro explores the chaos corridor, also known as the Metro channel.              
	Why Metro channel?        
	A high court directive banned meetings and rallies from Esplanade East in June 1996. Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee ruled that Esplanade East  from the KC Das crossing to the Raj Bhavan (east) gate  was a thoroughfare and so police must not give permission for rallies or meetings there as they disrupt traffic flow and inconvenience commuters.        
	Political parties shifted to the spot on Rani Rashmoni Avenue  the Red Road approach from the SN Banerjee Road-Jawaharlal Nehru Road crossing  designated by the high court.        
	But when the thoroughfare opposite Metro cinema was widened, the Metro channel became the prime target for protesters  or rather anyone who had anything to say and could afford to put up a podium, hire a mike and put out some chairs.        
	Rani Rashmoni Avenue fell from grace and the Metro channel, opposite Metro cinema on Jawaharlal Nehru Road, emerged as the place to be seen and heard in.              
	Minimum effort, maximum effect        
	Take Tuesday afternoon. At 12.45pm, there were around about 100 chairs, 10 listeners and one speaker. Yet, half of the north-bound flank of Chowringhee was barricaded by police and rendered off-limits for traffic.         
	The car crawl and the police presence proved why the Metro channel is the most coveted meeting venue in the central business district.        
	Is official permission given for meetings in the Metro channel?        
	No. Theres nothing official about it. Policemen told Metro no permission can be granted to any meeting or rally as the Metro channel is part of a thoroughfare.        
	Sanction is only given to those seeking permission to hold meetings or rallies at two venues  near Shahid Minar and near the Mahatma Gandhi statue on Mayo Road.        
	But protest meetings and rallies in the Metro channel have become the norm. This is an everyday affair and so we ask political parties and other organisations to keep us posted for the necessary police arrangements to be made, said a senior official at Lalbazar.               
	What do organisers of the Metro channel meetings do?        
	First, the organiser checks with the office of the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) whether the venue is free on the given day.         
	Once it is clear that the proposed meeting is not clashing with any other gathering at the same site, the organisers provide details of the meeting to the police headquarters.         
	The letter is then forwarded to the Special Branch of the city police where a rough estimate of the turnout is calculated. Based on that figure, police arrangements are made and traffic diversion is planned.        
	But no certificate  stating You have been accorded XYZ place to hold a meeting from A hours to B hours  is given to the organisers.        
	How many such meetings are held every month?        
	On an average, 20-23 meetings are held every month in the Metro channel.        
	But October being the festive month, there were just 10, said an officer from the traffic department.        
	Now its back to normal with the Metro channel booked for November 14, 15, 18 and 22.               
	Why is the north-bound flank of the thoroughfare often barricaded and blocked?        
	A senior officer posted in the Metro channel and responsible for law and order usually takes the call of narrowing or blocking the flank.        
	Better be safe than sorry seems to be the motto for officers on the ground.        
	No officer wants to take a chance. So putting up barricades even if the turnout is small has become the norm. The traffic policemen on duty take orders from this senior officer as law and order takes precedence over traffic trouble, admits a senior traffic police officer.              
	As a result...        
	Even if there is a lone speaker and a handful of supporters, traffic flow at this vital intersection is impeded and the ripples are felt throughout the central business district.               
	What is the solution?        
	Just enforce the law. Stop all rallies and meetings from being held in the Metro channel because it is a thoroughfare. Shift all rallies to Shahid Minar or near the Mahatma Gandhi statue on Mayo Road.

	Who do you blame for the Metro channel meetings disrupting traffic?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Court rap for affidavit delay
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday accused the state government of harassing it by not submitting a counter-affidavit to a petition filed by a woman demanding a job, delaying the hearing.        
	The court cannot start the hearing till the state files an affidavit-in-opposition. This is hurting the interests of the parties concerned, said Justice Debasish Kargupta.        
	Sabi Singh Bauri had applied last year for a job on compassionate grounds after her husband, a non-teaching employee in a government-aided school in Burnpur, died. The matter was referred to the school education department, which refused her a job.        
	Bauri moved the high court in April. The state had prayed for time to file the counter-affidavit 10 times, alleged Swapan Banerjee, who appeared for Bauri.         
	The judge directed the additional advocate-general, Nisith Adhikari, to bridge the gap between the state administration and the judiciary.        
	The court had given the state the last opportunity and fixed the matter for hearing on December 10. The government prayed for one more day. The judge fixed the matter for hearing on December 11, said Banerjee.

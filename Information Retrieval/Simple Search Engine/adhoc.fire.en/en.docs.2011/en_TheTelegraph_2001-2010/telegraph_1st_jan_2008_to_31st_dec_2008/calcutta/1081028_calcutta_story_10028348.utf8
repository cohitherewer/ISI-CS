                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fifth sting in Dufferin tale
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on Monday slapped a fresh notice on Dufferin Victoria Hospital, where 23 trainee nurses have tested positive for dengue.        
	This is the fifth notice served on the hospital authorities in recent times, asking them to clear mosquito breeding dens on the premises. They have done nothing in this regard. We are planning to file a case against the hospital in the CMC court, said an official of the civic health department.        
	A CMC team that inspected the hospital compound on Monday found a number of spots where mosquito larvae could breed.        
	Water had accumulated in several pockets, added the CMC official.        
	Forty of the 53 trainee nurses at Lady Dufferin left the hospital on Sunday after signing risk bonds. Most of the 23 trainee nurses afflicted with dengue have left for their homes in North Dinajpur.        
	We wanted them to stay here because they might carry the disease to other districts but they had completed the course and wanted to return home, said Tanima Mondol, the medical superintendent of the hospital.        
	Some of those who have failed to clear all the papers have stayed back. Six of them have dengue, according to hospital sources.        
	The condition of a trainee nurse who was admitted to Medical College and Hospital has improved. None of the others suffering from dengue is seriously ill, though many of them still have fever, said a hospital official.        
	The hospital has sent the names and addresses of the nurses afflicted with dengue to the chief medical officer of North Dinajpur.

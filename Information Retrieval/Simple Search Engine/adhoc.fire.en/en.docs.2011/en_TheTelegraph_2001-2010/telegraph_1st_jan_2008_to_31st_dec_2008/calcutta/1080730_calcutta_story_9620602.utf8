The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic tax net on colony plots
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Civic tax net on colony plots
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic authorities will consult refugee rehabilitation records to determine the ownership status of colony plots.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has been losing around Rs 30 crore annually on these plots as the owners are claiming they are yet to get ownership rights or pattas from the government.        
	In the civic assessment records, most colony plots are still mentioned as government or colony land though over the past 35 years, the refugee rehabilitation department has distributed 7,500 bighas among the settlers, most of whom came from the erstwhile East Pakistan.        
	Unless the residents are officially notified as owners, they cannot be brought within the tax net. Even the owners of colony plots on which highrises have come up are claiming that they do not officially own the land, said a civic assessor and collector.        
	More than a lakh people who have bought flats on colony plots in east Calcutta, Jadavpur, Santoshpur, Garia, Behala, Dhakuria, Bagha Jatin and Beleghata cannot get their properties mutated in their names because of the ownership dispute.        
	The loser is the civic body, which would have earned at least Rs 30 crore a year as property tax from the people living on the colony plots.        
	In order to clear the pending mutation cases related to colony plots, we have decided to consult the records in the refugee rehabilitation department, said civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	Most plot-owners say they have not got pattas. So, we have decided to examine and find out the ownership status of these plots, said chief manager (revenue) Aniruddha Mukherjee.        
	If it is found that the owner of a plot on which an apartment complex has come up got patta 15 years ago, the the CMC will give mutation to a flat owner if he agrees to shell out his share of the outstanding property tax, added Mukherjee.        
	Property tax will be charged at a revised rate from the date of handing over of the pattas and the balance will be realised without any interest or penalty.

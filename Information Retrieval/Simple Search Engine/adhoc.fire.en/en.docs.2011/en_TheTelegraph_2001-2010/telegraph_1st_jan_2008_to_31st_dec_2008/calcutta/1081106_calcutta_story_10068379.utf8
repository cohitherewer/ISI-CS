The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Old taxi ban hits discount hurdle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Old taxi ban hits discount hurdle
          OUR BUREAU                           Taxi operators have demanded an exchange discount of Rs 70,000                                  
	The shift towards a greener Calcutta hit a hurdle on Wednesday, with Hindustan Motors refusing to increase the exchange discount on old taxis.        
	The discount rate can play a crucial role in the state governments attempt to implement a high court order on phasing out of commercial vehicles more than 15 years old.        
	While taxi operators had been demanding a discount of Rs 70,000 to replace their old vehicles with new ones, the state government had requested the company to fix the rate at Rs 50,000.        
	But Hindustan Motors, the makers of Ambassador cars that are used as taxis, refused to shell out anything more than Rs 35,000.        
	For 15-year-old taxis, we were not in a position to pay more than Rs 20,000. We have discussed every possibility but are unable to offer anything more than Rs 35,000, a Hindustan Motors official said.        
	The company sent a letter to the government on Wednesday explaining its stand, which came as a shock to taxi operators.        
	Sources in the transport department conceded that it was a setback to negotiations aimed at implementing the ban. We are planning to hold another meeting with all parties concerned by next week, said a transport department official.        
	In response to Hindustan Motorss decision to fix the discount at Rs 35,000, taxi operators threatened to join the operators of private buses and minibuses who had refused to negotiate with the government till their appeal against the ban was disposed of.        
	To implement the ban, around 7,000 of the 42,000-odd taxis plying in and around the city will have to be replaced by March 31.        
	Auto fuel: The green cause received a jolt on another front, too, with four of the five LPG filling stations in south Calcutta running dry. The filling station at Bosepukur struggled to cope with demand.        
	Over 1,000 autorickshaws had to be pulled out in south Calcutta because of shortage in supply, said Pradip Saha, the general secretary of the Autorickshaw Bachhao Committee.        
	At 1pm, Ratan Pals Gas Station on Tollygunge Circular Road was gheraoed by over 50 auto drivers who were turned away by three other stations. The blockade lasted for over an hour.        
	Many drivers were on leave or reported for work late because of Chhath puja. Thats why the tankers could not reach the city on time, said an Indian Oil official.

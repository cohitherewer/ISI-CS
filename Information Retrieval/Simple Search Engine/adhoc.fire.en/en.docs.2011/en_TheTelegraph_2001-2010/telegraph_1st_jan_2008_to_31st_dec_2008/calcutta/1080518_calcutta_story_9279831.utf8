                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Enduring beauty
										      eyewitness                        A sculpture by Meera Mukherjee. Picture by Pradip Sanyal		                 A work by Suhas Roy				                             
	The genius of Meera Mukherjee stands revealed once again at Galerie 88s current exhibition. There are three rooms in which her sculpture is being displayed and one cannot help noticing the sheer joy of creation that animated the works of this woman who had the courage to live life the way she wanted.        
	It is widely known that she used the lost wax process to produce the pieces and she was clearly inspired by scenes of everyday life to create works that even today have not lost any of their relevance and beauty. As she had documented in her books, for years she had travelled to the tribal regions where local craftsmen created exquisite Dokra pieces to learn the technicalities from them.        
	Mukherjee harks back to an idyllic life in the villages but underlying it all is her deep sympathy for the toiling masses. She was a trained classical singer and was widely travelled. She had lived in Germany too. Yet in Calcutta she led a very simple life.        
	She may have been inspired by Dokra but the pieces she herself created were of a more complex character. Small pieces like her Durga, the swimmers and the depiction of children plucking mangoes, of the ghats of Varanasi are marked by a dynamism she sought to create by using threads of bronze suggestive of action.        
	There is one monumental piece here. She tells a story through the human figures on the torso of the woman with flowing hair sitting upright and calm. It is true that these pieces have been exhibited earlier but Meera Mukherjee doesnt get dated.              
	Suhas Roy is better known today for the Radha images that he has replicated umpteen times. Few are aware that he is a fine printmaker, one of the best in Bengal, in fact. Once his prints could be bought for a song at the art mela in Chaplin Square. He had been trained in Hayters studio in Paris.        
	A portfolio of 12 of his prints executed in the 1960s but produced recently is on display at Gallery Rasa. Roy is elderly now and he had to seek help from someone in Delhi. These prints are quite small and are typical products of those times.        
	He makes much use of geometrical figures like pyramids, birds in flight and a human being who resembles a shaggy dog. It is a pity that his wonderful owls were not recreated. The portfolio is for sale.

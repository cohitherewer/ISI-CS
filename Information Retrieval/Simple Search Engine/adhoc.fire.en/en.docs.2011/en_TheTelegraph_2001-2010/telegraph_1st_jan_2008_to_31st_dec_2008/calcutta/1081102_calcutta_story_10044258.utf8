The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Man-made global mosquito menace
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Man-made global mosquito menace
                            
	The bad M is back. Mosquito-borne diseases have returned to the city with a vengeance after a brief lull in the past couple of years. Hundreds of people have fallen prey to malaria, dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis and 17 lives have already been lost this season.         
	According to the state health department, more than 60 per cent of cases of vector-borne diseases in West Bengal are in Calcutta and its fringes. Experts predict that in the next few years, such diseases will not only strike more people, they will spread to new areas.        
	A correlation between the spread of the winged menace and changing climate patterns has been established by experts.         
	According to them, the rise in the average temperature and humidity  a fallout of global warming  helps in the breeding of mosquitoes and other vectors as well the germs they carry. This increases the probability of transmission of diseases.        
	This was echoed at a health conference in Germany last year, titled Vector-Borne Diseases: Impact of Climate Change on Vectors and Rodent Reservoirs.         
	The vectors have globalised with climate change, said I.P. Reiter from France at the meet. But he added a word of caution. More than climate change, human activities are responsible for the spread of diseases.         
	There are no marked changes this year in meteorological parameters in Calcutta from other years, said G.C. Debnath, the regional director of the Indian Meteorological Department. So, climate change may be responsible for a gradual, long-term increase in vector- borne diseases, but inadequate planning and faulty execution of preventive measures may be held responsible for the current mosquito mess.

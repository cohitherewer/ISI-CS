The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Aamir tells a sweet story
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Aamir tells a sweet story
  - But with ads looking and feeling like short films, isnt the brand suffering?

	Have you seen the latest from Aamir? It is a lovely slice of life act. Aamir, the husband, makes breakfast for his wife, checks the refrigerator and says he will do the grocery before returning from work. She is bemused, then intrigued. He returns with more shopping bags than he can handle. His wife is reading the newspaper. Aamir wont let her get up and help. He says he will make the tea.         
	Then she sees it in the paper  that evening India was playing a cricket match. The penny drops. Aamir wants the TV to himself  she has to forego her soaps. That is why she was being bribed. She smiles and tells Aamir about the new feature from Tata Sky (Aamir in another Tata Sky ad in picture above). Thanks to it, Aamir can watch his cricket, the soaps that his wife wants to watch on another channel can be recorded. He orders her to make the tea. The ad film ends in a pillow fight.         
	This is a sweet, funny story. Hence this ad is likely to be remembered. That is saying a lot. For any ad to have an effect, it must be seen.         
	But how do you get noticed today? At any point of time there are at least 20 ads trying to grab your attention. On top of that there is an ingrained obstacle. We, the consumers, expect all advertising to be drum-beaters. As a result we tend to be a little cynical and by default ignore advertising. Countering this lethargy is a huge challenge.         
	The adman tries to meet this challenge by making ads feel less like propaganda and more like entertainment  visually, musically and most importantly, in terms of content. The practice of using celebrities in ads owes its origin to such a need. Lately the other trick the adman is using is injecting drama into the ad.         
	TV ads in any case are craftily made short films. Now they have started telling a story too. There lies the potential of a danger. If it is not seen to be an ad, would the brand get any mileage?         
	To prove this point I want to cite as an example  an ad about retirement. The one that starts with the just-retired man asking her wife if she remembers how to use a broom or make roti. The domestic help can be relieved and money saved.         
	She suggests asking for some money from their son every month. The self-righteous man protests. In the climax, the husband says he did all this nautanki because his post-retirement life is so secure that he is taking her to Singapore for a holiday. You know the ad I am talking about? What was the brand? Was it a bank? Or was it from post office savings? Was it HSBC or HDFC ? Or was it from LIC?         
	Do you remember?

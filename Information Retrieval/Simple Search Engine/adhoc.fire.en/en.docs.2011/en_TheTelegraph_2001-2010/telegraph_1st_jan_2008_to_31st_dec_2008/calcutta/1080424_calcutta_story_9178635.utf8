                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       B-school to open doors in July
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Yet another business school was launched in Calcutta on Wednesday. Calcutta Business School, started by the MBV Society, is located on a 16-acre plot in Bishnupur, 7 km south of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM). It will be operational from July this year.        
	We run schools and colleges but running a management school is going to be a different ball game. But we are sure we will do a good job, said S.K. Birla, the chairman of the board of governors of the management school.        
	The B-school will have state-of-the-art infrastructure, including a green building, air conditioning and wireless Internet connectivity round the clock.        
	It will offer a two-year, fully residential, postgraduate diploma in management. The first batch will have 60 students. There are plans to increase student intake to 500 over the next five years.        
	Admission will be based on the Common Admission Test (CAT) and the General Management Aptitude Test (GMAT). The fee for the entire course will be Rs 7.5 lakh.        
	We will conduct a special drive to attract overseas students, especially from Southeast Asia, said P.K. De, the director of the institute.        
	The first year of the course will be dedicated to building the foundation of the students through exposure to case studies, business modelling and project work, apart from regular classroom sessions.        
	In the second year, five clusters will be offered to students for specialisation. Each cluster will cover some functional areas like economics, finance, operations, marketing, MIS, HRM and strategy as well as application areas like information technology, retailing, banking, financial markets, hospitality and tourism.        
	The best teachers from India will take the first year classes. To teach the clusters in the second year, we will bring in faculty from all over the globe, added De.        
	Full-time faculty of the institute will be chosen from academicians and senior corporate executives.

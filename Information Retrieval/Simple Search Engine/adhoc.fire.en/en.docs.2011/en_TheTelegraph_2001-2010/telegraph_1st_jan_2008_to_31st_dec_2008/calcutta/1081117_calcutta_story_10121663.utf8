                      Kantha stories                    Biswajit Mukhopadhyay is an artist/craftsman with a difference. Instead of using the conventional canvas, paper, brush, etc, he uses cloth and needles to create multi-coloured dreams with threads. Sewing deftly, Mukhopadhyay brings alive complex, semi-abstract tribal motifs in his works. Born and brought up in Santiniketan, the culturally rich seat of Bengal Renaissance, Mukhopadhyay has the inherent vision for beauty. From a very young age, he developed a keen interest in old, forgotten art traditions of Bengal. This was further stoked as he came in close contact with the tribal arts of the region. This inspired him to unravel the mystery of the peculiar, typical symbolism associated with folk art. His venture in creating art pieces with Kantha embroidery is his tribute to an ancient tradition and also a way to boost and revive this ethnic art form. Musical Drawings and Surreal Paintings in Stitch, the ongoing show of his works, features unconventional, semi-abstract designs that improvise on the folk arts of Bengal and Bihar. With his unfettered imagination, he creates a riot of colours as he crafts a synthesis of various art forms in his works. Rich in colour and texture, his thread-woven creations present a mind-boggling array of human forms, flora and fauna, and abstract motifs that are bound to captivate those with an eye for the aesthetic. Original and individualistic, what makes the pieces remarkable is that, besides being a work of art, they can also be used as scarves, stoles or even wall-hangings.            Event: An exhibition of Kantha-stitch embroidery works by Biswajit Mukhopadhyay

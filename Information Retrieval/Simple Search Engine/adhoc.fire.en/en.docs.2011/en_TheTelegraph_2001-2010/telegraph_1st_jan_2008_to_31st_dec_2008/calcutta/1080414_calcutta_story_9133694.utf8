          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Medical Council of India (MCI) has requested chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to urge industrialists to set up private medical colleges.        
	The issue was discussed between Bhattacharjee and a two-member MCI team at Writers Buildings on Sunday. Recently, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had appealed to the industrialists to set up medical colleges in their home districts.        
	The chief minister promised to take action, said Ketan Desai, the chairman of MCIs platinum jubilee celebration committee. Desai and Indrajit Roy, the chairman of the MCIs postgraduate medical education committee, met Bhattacharjee. State health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra was present.        
	Two private medical colleges have been planned in Jadavpur and Kalyani. The private colleges should not be run only for profit, said Roy. According to MCI officials, it requires an initial investment of Rs 100 crore, minus the land price, to set up a medical college.        
	The MCI team also stressed the need to set up five-six medical colleges in the state. Apart from the ones in Kalyani and Jadavpur, two state-run colleges are being planned in Malda and Baruipur. Bhattacharjee pointed out that there was a problem in procuring 25 acres for the Malda college.        
	MCI has suggested a relaxation of the rules on setting up a medical college. The rules state that a college will be allowed to come up on a plot measuring 25 acres. According to the MCI suggestion, two plots measuring 25 acres and within five km of each other will do.

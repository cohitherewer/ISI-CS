                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Cabbies look beyond Amby 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Taxi owners say Indigo Marina (picture top) and Maruti Omni are well-suited as cabs                                  
	Taxi operators have asked the state government for permission to replace the 7,000 Ambassador taxis over 15 years old with new Tata Indigo Marina or Maruti Suzuki Omni cabs.        
	The request followed Hindustan Motorss decision not to offer an exchange discount of more than Rs 35,000 on old Ambassador taxis.         
	Taxi operators had asked for a discount of Rs 70,000 while the government had requested the company to fix it at Rs 50,000.        
	The 7,000 taxis have to be phased out by April 1 next year to comply with a high court order. Only Ambassadors are currently allowed as cabs.        
	If Hindustan Motors isnt willing to co-operate, we can switch to other manufacturers. Indigo Marina or Omni will be suitable replacements. There are lucrative offers, said Bimal Guha, the general secretary of Bengal Taxi Association. Tarak Barik, the secretary of Calcutta Taxi Association, echoed him.        
	Both refused to elaborate on the lucrative offers.         
	We will consider the proposal to issue taxi permits to other vehicles, said state transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.        
	This is the time for bargaining and a lot of arm twisting will take place, said a transport department official, who was not aware of the lucrative offers.

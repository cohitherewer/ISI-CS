          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police are clueless about Bikash Agarwals murder more than 24 hours after the trader was shot outside the Howrah housing estate where he lived. Agarwal was returning home with his wife after watching the night show of a film.        
	We are questioning Agarwals wife Vandana, the sole witness to the murder, and his business associates, said an officer of Golabari police station.        
	Family members told the police that the trader was not threatened before the murder. They were also not aware of any business rivalry.        
	Currently, we are groping in the dark, added the investigator.        
	The modus operandi of the killers suggests that they were professionals, said officers working on the case.

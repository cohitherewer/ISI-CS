                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Spaceman targets students
  - City boy now Nasa biggie, steers spread of scientific spirit          SAMHITA L. CHAKRABORTY                          Jaydeep Mukherjee.   (Bishwarup Dutta)                                              
	This Calcutta boy sure has gone places. Jaydeep Mukherjee is the interim director of the Florida Space Institute at the Kennedy Space Center and also the director of the Nasa Florida Space Grant Consortium, which encourages the culture of science among students.        
	Back in his birthplace  to visit relatives, take it easy and visit Santiniketan if possible  the Nasa biggie took time out to speak at the MP Birla Planetarium on Tuesday evening.        
	All over the world, science is being overtaken by pseudo-sciences, leading to a culture of anti-science among people, Mukherjee told Metro before the talk. The only way of countering this is by inculcating a scientific spirit among people, especially students.... Next time I would love to visit some city schools and speak to the kids.        
	As the director of the Nasa Florida Space Grant Consortium, Mukherjee is keen to collaborate with national space programmes, planetariums, and institutes offering courses on astronomy and astrophysics. We would like to make the Birla Planetarium a node for Radio Jove, said Mukherjee, referring to the Nasa programme that brings alive astronomy and science for school students.        
	Mukherjee dwelt on the various Nasa satellites and spacecraft but his eyes sparkled when it came to Indias moon mission Chandrayaan-1. Till now the global space research community had little idea about Indias space prowess. It is only after the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) sent a spacecraft to the moon did they sit up and take notice, he smiled.        
	Born in Calcutta and schooled in Mumbais St Xaviers College and then Florida University, Mukherjee is an annual visitor to Calcutta and a Planetarium regular. He gives us inputs about developments in space and astrophysics, and the latest Nasa programmes, said Debiprosad Duari, the director of research and academics at the Planetarium.

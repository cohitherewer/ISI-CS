The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Evaluation under cloud after review 
                                                                                                               Evaluation under cloud after review 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The marks of more than half the review applicants of B.Com 2007 have increased, raising doubts about Calcutta Universitys evaluation system.        
	We will analyse the results after the review outcome of the other two streams  arts and science  is announced. We may have to change the system of evaluation, said Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of the university.        
	The review results of B.Com (Part I and II), announced on Monday, revealed that the scripts of around 60 per cent of the applicants had not been correctly assessed.        
	The aggregate of some of the students has increased by 10 or more after the re-evaluation, said an official in the universitys examination department.        
	We are preparing a list of candidates whose marks have risen by 10 or more. Action will be taken against the teachers who had originally assessed their scripts, the official asserted.        
	Thanks to the increase in marks, the overall result status of around 10 per cent of the applicants has improved. For instance, some of the students who had failed have secured pass marks after the review, the official said.        
	A number of candidates who had missed the honours grade have now made the cut, while a few who had passed in P division have been elevated to the second.        
	Many teachers and college officials feel the universitys assessment process has lost its credibility after the publication of the B.Com review results.        
	The university should find out whether the answer scripts are examined with care, said Gyanankur Goswami, the principal of Shyamaprasad College and the president of West Bengal Principals Council.        
	The principal of a north Calcutta college, however, fears the review results will open a floodgate of students seeking re-evaluation from next year. This will increase the workload manifold.        
	This was the first time the university announced the review results of all B.Com applicants together. From next year, the review results of all three streams will be published at one go. The earlier system was to stagger the announcement of individual results.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rent hike, damages settle Wakf plot row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Shaw Wallace building on Bankshal Street. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Shaw Wallace and Prince Gholam Mohammed Wakf Estate, a trust that owns Tipu Sultans properties, on Monday amicably settled an old dispute over a building following the state governments intervention.        
	The settlement was executed in the presence of company officials, Tipu Sultans descendants and the minister of state of minorities affairs, Abdus Sattar, at Bikash Bhavan in Salt Lake.        
	The Shaw Wallace Company will pay Rs 1 crore as compensation to the Wakf estate, a considerable part of which will be spent on helping the poor descendants of Tipu Sultan. The company, which used to pay Rs 32,000 to the estate as monthly rent, has agreed to pay Rs 6 lakh a month, said Sattar.        
	The building in contention was built by Shaw Wallace on a Bankshal Street plot, measuring two bighas and six cottahs and owned by the Gholam Mohammed Wakf Estate.        
	Gholam Mohammed was the youngest of the five sons of Tipu Sultan.        
	The company had taken the plot on lease in 1909. The lease expired in 1984. A number of litigations on the fate of the plot followed the lapse of the lease period.        
	In 2005, the new management of the company took an initiative to settle the dispute in court. We are happy that the matter is finally settled, said Lalit Gupta, the vice-president of Shaw Wallace.        
	The estate, too, had started negotiations with the government and the company, seeking an enhanced lease rent and compensation.        
	According to its terms and conditions, the estate is supposed to give seven per cent of its income from the properties to the Wakf Board. The remaining 93 per cent is to be spent on development of two city mosques named after Tipu Sultan and other religious purposes, helping poor descendants of Tipu Sultan and other welfare activities of the community, said Sahid Alam, a descendant of Gholam Mohammed.        
	Sattar said the government was also taking steps to settle disputes over other properties of Tipu Sultan.         
	We have already settled a dispute between the Wakf Estate and the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. There is a similar dispute centering around Tolly Club, which is also a property of Gholam Mohammed Estate Trust. We are trying to get it settled amicably.

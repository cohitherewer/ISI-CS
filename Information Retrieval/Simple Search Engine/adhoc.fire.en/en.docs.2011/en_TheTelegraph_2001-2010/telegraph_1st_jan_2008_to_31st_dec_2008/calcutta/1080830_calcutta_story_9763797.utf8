                      Goodwill steps                    With its unique language of improvised Indian classical dance performed by an international ensemble, Sohini Moksha, a Madrid-based dance troupe, is committed to building bridges of love and friendship in a world torn apart by hatred and strife. United by a shared passion for dance, it spreads the message of goodwill and peace through inspired creativity. Recreating the mythological, mystical magic of India through classical temple dance, Sohini Mokshas dynamic dance dramas depict excerpts from ancient epics and legends. It portrays the true flavour of classical India, casting a spell of Vedic mysticism and philosophy, along with pure rhythmic dance forms rooted in a 2000-year-old classical tradition. Embodying multiculturalism in the true sense of the term, this evenings presentation, featuring dancers from Spain, India, Jamaica, France and Iraq, promises to captivate and enthrall the audience. To be preceded by a preview of sculptures by Uma Roychoudhury.

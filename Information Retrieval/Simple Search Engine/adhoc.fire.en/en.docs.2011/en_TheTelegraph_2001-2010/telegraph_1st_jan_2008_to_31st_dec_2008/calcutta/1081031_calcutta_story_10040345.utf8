The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Trade, travel take a hit
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Trade, travel take a hit
          OUR BUREAU                               
	The blasts in Assam have rocked trade and travel between Calcutta and Guwahati.         
	As nine explosions ripped through Guwahati, the gateway to the Northeast, and three other towns in Assam on Thursday, traders began counting losses and the airlines and railways reviewed their schedule.        
	Jet Airways was the first to react, cancelling its two evening flights between Guwahati and Calcutta. The flight from Calcutta, scheduled to take off at 6.30pm, was cancelled at the last moment.        
	According to rough estimates, around 500 passengers fly and 8,000 travel by train between Calcutta and Guwahati daily. The airlines and the railways have told us that their Friday schedule would not be affected. But many people have cancelled their tickets, both air and rail, after the blasts, said a travel agent.        
	William Francis, who works in a private firm in the city, was planning to visit Shillong next week. I didnt take a chance after the explosions and cancelled my air tickets, he told Metro on Thursday evening.        
	Fliers who arrived from Guwahati on Thursday were yet to recover from the blast blow. My cousin is too shocked to speak. He was passing by Pan Bazaar, in Guwahati, minutes before it was rocked by a blast, said Dibya Bhattacharya, of Jadavpur, who had come to the airport to receive Subhajit Mullick, 23.         
	Mullick, who had gone to Guwahati on a business trip, had to be helped into the car.         
	City-based traders with links in Guwahati were quick to feel the heat. Panic has gripped Assam. My distributor called me up and cancelled all orders till further notice. Our consignment is stuck outside Guwahati, said Pradip Banerjee, an employee of a frozen food company.         
	Guwahati is the main entry point for the Northeast. If things remain uncertain there, trade between the Northeast and the rest of the country will be affected, added Banerjee.        
	Exports from Calcutta to Guwahati include readymade garments, engineering products, construction material and liquor. Forest products, crude oil and tea comprise the return cargo.

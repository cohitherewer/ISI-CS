     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Cancer patients who develop mouth ulcer after undergoing chemotherapy may soon find a drug to reduce the severity and duration of the side-effect. And Calcutta will have contributed to the breakthrough.
    
	There is no specific treatment for chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis, which makes eating, drinking and even talking difficult. 
    
	There are, however, non-specific, supportive treatments, like chlorohexidine mouthwash and vitamins. Doctors also advise a lot of fluid intake.
    
	This could change with a new drug, now in its phase-II tests at a Calcutta hospital and 105 other institutes in India, the US and four European countries. Among the 30 Indian centres are All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad and Gujarat Cancer Research Institute in Ahmedabad.
    
	The drug has been developed by a US-based company called Serenex. Cancer cells divide rapidly and chemotherapy affects cells with this characteristic. Hence, the rapidly dividing cells in the mouth, throat and intestines get affected, causing ulcers, said Jaydip Biswas, the director of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI), the Calcutta connection in the test.
    
	In the first phase, the drug was administered to healthy volunteers by the US-based developers and in the second phase, it is being tried on a limited number of patients from different parts of the world. Biswas, who has gone through the first phase report, believes the drug will prove very effective. 
    
	The clinical trial co-ordinator at CNCI, Partha Nath, said patients who developed oral mucositis after the second cycle of chemotherapy were being administered the medicine. The aim is to see if the duration and severity of the mucositis is significantly reduced. We will be able to comment on the results after a few months, said Nath. 
    
	A 75-year-old patient from Malda, who was administered the drug, said his mouth ulcers had stopped bothering him.

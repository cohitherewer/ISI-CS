          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	One of the injured in Wednesdays rail mishap has not regained consciousness while another had to spend a sleepless night on a trolley at NRS Medical College and Hospital.        
	Naushad Ali suffered injuries in his head and chest and is in a critical condition. A CT scan revealed that there was no clot in his brain. But he is still unconscious and will be under observation for 72 hours, said an official of NRS Hospital.         
	The mason from Murshidabad stays in Belgharia. He was on his way to a construction site on the train on Wednesday.        
	The authorities did not shift him from a free bed in the surgery ward to the intensive care unit (ICU) despite repeated requests, said Sabirul Islam, Naushads neighbour. The doctors said there was no vacancy in the ICU.         
	Sumit Ranjan Chakraborty has also been admitted in the surgery ward but is yet to be allotted a bed.        
	I have to lie straight and am having difficulty in breathing. I requested the nursing staff to provide me with oxygen support, said Chakraborty, lying on trolley No. 31.         
	There is no fan here and I have to struggle for every breath but the doctors are not doing anything. My brothers are also requesting the doctors to allot a bed but they said there was no space, added Chakraborty.         
	He underwent a CT scan and was put on drip. A doctor treating him said his condition was stable.         
	There is always a shortage of beds in the hospital. We are trying to allot a bed to Sumit Ranjan Chakraborty as soon as possible. His medical needs are being taken care of, said a hospital official.        
	Tapan Shraddha, another passenger injured in the mishap, suffered multiple fractures in his leg after falling off the train. He is awaiting surgery.        
	Doctors treating him said he was conscious and out of danger.

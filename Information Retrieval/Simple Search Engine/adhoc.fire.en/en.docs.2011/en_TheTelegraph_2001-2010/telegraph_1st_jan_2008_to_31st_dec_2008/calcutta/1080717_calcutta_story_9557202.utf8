                      Humour heritage                    Perhaps the most powerful, direct and unbiased mode of artistic representation, cartoons are unfortunately under-rated as an art form in our country. Usually amusing and at others absurd, extravagant or even shocking, such illustrations brilliantly catch the pulse of society. They highlight the flaws, frailties and injustices of a generation by portraying them in exaggerated fashion. Besides their original intent, cartoons serve as important social and historical documents, revealing interesting bits of information about an age that textbooks would fail to provide. Of late, historians in the city have begun taking interest in salvaging lost newspapers and journals in a bid to recover cartoons of yesteryears. Kolkata Smiles 08, the ongoing exhibition of cartoons, has on show works that celebrate the cartoon heritage of the city. It features both rare vintage and contemporary cartoons by eminent cartoonists including Chandi Lahiri, PCL, Shaila Chkaraborty, Amol Chakraborty (a cartoon by him appears here), Rebotibhushan Ghosh, Anup Ray and Debasish Deb.

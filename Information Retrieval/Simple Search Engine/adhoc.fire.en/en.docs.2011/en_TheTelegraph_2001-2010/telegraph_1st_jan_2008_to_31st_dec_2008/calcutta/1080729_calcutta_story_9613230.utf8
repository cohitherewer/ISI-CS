                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Subhas admits failure
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The government has failed to convince drivers and conductor of private buses to switch from the commission system to a fixed salary, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said in the Assembly on Monday.        
	In every meeting with the government, the bus workers unions agree to the abolition of the commission system. But later they go back on their word, the minister said in reply to a question from Manas Bhunia of the Congress.        
	The commission system has long been held responsible for rash driving and mishaps. In 2006-2007, Chakraborty said, 472 people died in 2,200 road accidents in the city.         
	In an attempt to stop rash driving, the government has set up 20 centres in the city to train drivers.        
	The minister also blamed pedestrians for the rising mishap count. Yesterday afternoon, while passing by Writers, I saw a well-dressed man crossing the road through a gap in the median. When I confronted him he said he was saving time. He later realised his mistake and apologised, said Chakraborty.

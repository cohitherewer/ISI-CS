     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	A woman in her early 30s was found dead, with her legs and spine broken, on the courtyard of a police housing estate in Ultadanga on Friday morning.
    
	A preliminary probe revealed that the woman, yet to be identified, committed suicide by jumping from the roof of an 11-storey building in the compound.
    
	The post-mortem report did not indicate that the woman had been sexually abused. The injuries seem to have been sustained by the impact of the fall. There is also no evidence of the woman having been pushed off the roof, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).
    
	The police suspect the woman had jumped to death around 6am, though the body was spotted four hours later.
    
	The sweeper failed to notice the body while cleaning the premises as it was lying between two apartment blocks. The womans dupatta was found hanging from the grilles of a third-floor balcony, said an officer of Maniktala police station.
    
	The woman was wearing gold bangles and rings and had on a white kameez printed with designs in green and a yellow salwar. 
    
	The looks and the clothes suggest she was from a well-to-do family, said another officer of Maniktala police station.
    
	No one in the housing estate had seen the woman before. It seems she lived in a nearby area and selected the building as it is one of the tallest in Ultadanga and also easily accessible. The gates of the estate remain unmanned and elevators function round-the-clock. Any one can enter a building in the compound at any time of the day and climb up to the roof, said deputy commissioner Shamim.
    
	Lalbazar has asked all 48 police stations across the city to find out whether any missing diary has been lodged. We are also contacting our counterparts in North and South 24-Parganas and sending them photographs of the woman. We hope she will be identified in a day or two, Shamim added.

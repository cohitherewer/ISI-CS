  - Science teacher accused of grabbing school student          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A Class IX student of a Madhyamgram school has alleged that she was molested by her science teacher in a laboratory on Tuesday afternoon.        
	The student of Sudhir Memorial School lodged a complaint against the teacher, Biswajit Santra, with Barasat police station.        
	I had gone to the laboratory for some work. As soon as I entered the room, someone grabbed my hands from behind. I turned around and saw Biswajit Santra. I was too shocked to react for a few moments but later screamed for help, the girl said.        
	Some employees rushed to the laboratory and found her crying alone. I narrated the incident to them but they did not believe me, she alleged.        
	The girl then went home and told her parents about the molestation. Accompanied by neighbours, the parents and the girl went to the police station and lodged a complaint. Later, they marched to the school and put up a demonstration, demanding Santras arrest.        
	A police team rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control.        
	An officer of Barasat police station said: The teacher cannot be arrested right now as there was no witness to the alleged molestation. We have will speak to the girl first to ascertain what had exactly happened and then question Santra. If found guilty, he will be arrested.        
	When contacted, Santra refused to comment.         
	The school principal, Anuradha Volkia, said: We have ordered an internal probe into the allegation. The governing body of the school will meet on Wednesday and discuss the issue.

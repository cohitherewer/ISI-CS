The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Beef-up after bullets
                                                                                                               Beef-up after bullets
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police claimed to have intensified vigil in the Ballygunge-Karaya belt following Sundays shooting in the chief ministers neighbourhood, that left four persons injured.        
	Patrolling has been intensified in the area since last night, a senior officer at Lalbazar said on Monday.        
	Three associates of Mohammad Aslam, the snatcher who fired the bullets, were detained on Monday.         
	The police said Aslam was part of an organised gang operating from the Topsia-Tiljala-Karaya belt.        
	He and other members of the gang have been involved in many theft and robbery cases. Some have even become small-time developers in Topsia. We are trying to net the rest of the gang members, said the officer.        
	The police were caught napping when Aslam went on a shooting spree while running through the Ballygunge neighbourhood to escape a 100-strong mob. He has been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.        
	Local residents alleged that the police, despite their claim of having turned the area into a fortress, always find themselves chasing goons after a crime is committed. They have never pre-empted a crime, said a resident.        
	The police have blamed the spurt in crime to the mushrooming of slums in the Palm Avenue-Karaya stretch.        
	Raids are conducted regularly in the slums but the goons, mostly backed by political leaders, manage to flee on each occasion, said an officer of Karaya police station.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       City camp by healer of stars 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Goverdhanlal Parashar, an ayurved practitioner whose massages have reportedly healed George Bush, Big B and American senator Bobby Jindal, attended a medical camp in the city this weekend.        
	The 53-year-old and his six-member team treated about 650 patients at the camp organised by Jodhpur Association and Kamani Jain Bhavan from Friday to Sunday. Parashar is one of the few osteopaths in the country.        
	There are nearly 7,000 osteopaths in the US but hardly any in India, though osteopathy originated here. It is an expensive subject to study and practise. Osteopaths tend to stick to a place and charge patients heavily. Mostly rich people are aware and go in for the treatment, said Parashar, who got his doctoral degree in alternative medicine from New Age International University in Italy.        
	He is associated with Shri Sanwarlal Osteopathic Centre in Jodhpur and has been providing free medical services on weekends for more than 20 years.        
	He cannot cure slipped discs, migraine, frozen shoulder and osteoarthritis.         
	Parashar is set to head the board for a certificate course on osteopathy to be started by Indira Gandhi National Open University in January next year for physiotherapists and MBBS doctors.        
	They are already aware of the human anatomy. The course will teach them how to manipulate bones and nerves, said Parashar.

                      Ideas and images                    A student of art before he ventured into photography, Nikhil Bhandari has been successful in using the latter as a medium to create images that are unique and autonomous. His photographs are not only works of art on their own, but, more importantly, are made possible only through an innovative use of photographic technique. The Camera with the Third Eye, the ongoing show of his recent photographs, finds Bhandari producing images that bear little resemblance to any real subject, whether an object or a human form; his images are powerful visions on their own. The artist transposes images one above the other and then amalgamates them into an independent image much like a painter lays coats of paint in layers. Through this, he achieves not merely a new hue or sheen, but a completely original perception. His colours, remarkable for their clarity and brilliance, seem to float in the background and stand free in a space of their own along with the image. Liberated from the vestiges of what can be seen and recorded, his photographs are aesthetic emblems of his fantastic creative designs.                    Event: Exhibition of photographs by Nikhil Bhandari When: Till September 3; 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Akar Prakar, P238 Hindustan Park

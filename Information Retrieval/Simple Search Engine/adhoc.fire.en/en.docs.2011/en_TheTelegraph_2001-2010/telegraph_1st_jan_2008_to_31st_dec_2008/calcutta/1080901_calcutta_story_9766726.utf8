The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 17-year-olds fight to the finish
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       17-year-olds fight to the finish

	Keshav Rathi, a 17-year-old from The Assembly of God Church School, would practise driving the family car, was possessive about his cellphone and played noughts and crosses seated on the back bench when his teacher turned to face the board. Yet he always knew the answers. In fact, he would top class almost effortlessly.        
	It was Keshavs dream to see his name on the list of school toppers after the ISC exams. But that wasnt to be, for soon after the selection tests in January, he was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia. He was hospitalised on January 30, 2008, a month before the finals.        
	The first time his teachers heard about his disease was when Keshav failed to collect his report card. Moved by his determination to appear for his exams despite declining health, his English teacher Joyeeta Mukherjee sent the young mans name to The Telegraph Education Foundation for consideration in the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage category.        
	Keshav finally won the award. But he couldnt take the stage at Science City on Saturday morning. After a month spent fighting the disease, he had succumbed on March 1.        
	His mother Suman Rathi, father Shashikant and younger brother Pratyush received it instead.        
	Throughout his battle with the disease, the only thing Keshav talked about was when he would be allowed to go back home so that he could prepare for his exams, says Suman. Weeks in the hospital were not enough to drag him down. Till his last breath, his only query was about the ISC exams. At the end, we lied to him about the date to give him hope that he had time to appear for them, recounts the distraught mother.        
	Through it all, Keshav remained an inspiration for those around him. He was a fighter. I saw him shrink with my own eyes. He was in frightful pain but still so hopeful, recalls Mukherjee.        
	Keshavs illness, and strength, provoked a lot of his friends into action. His classmates would come and pray for his health outside ICU. Determined to take the exams from his hospital bed if necessary, his books were brought to him. He urged his classmates to hit the books and not waste time at the hospital, his mother remembers.        
	Keshavs courage, just like his academic skills, seemed to come naturally. Says Suman: He topped at least seven to eight subjects in class. He made his friends quit smoking because he didnt approve of the habit. It was as if he made use of every moment he lived.        
	And now, Keshav will live on through the Keshav Rathi Memorial Award for Courage, instituted by The Telegraph Education Foundation this year.        
	Another young star to receive a certificate of honour on Saturday was Srijoy Bardhan, also battling cancer. Yet the student of Mahesh Sri Ramakrishna Ashram Vidyalaya in Rishra scored 92 per cent in the Madhyamik.        
	Keshav Bagla of St Xaviers Collegiate School fights the limitations forced on him by Lumber Melingomylocele every day.         
	And despite a seizure and fall while writing his ISC Hindi paper, he still scored the highest in it.        
	Another hero was Anusha Misra of La Martiniere for Girls. Despite numerous ECGs, trips to the hospital, a stroke and an operation that left her weak and speech-impaired, Anusha did not give up and she has now not only gained the use of her right hand and has improved her speech, but she has even resumed regular classes.

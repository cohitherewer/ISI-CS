The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Female fans flock to fashion film   What women want
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Female fans flock to fashion film     - Director plays the woman card to draw the post-Diwali crowd          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                                  
	Of women, by a man for women. That seems to be the winning formula of Fashion.        
	Women by the hundreds are queueing up at ticket windows in town to watch the rise and fall of supermodel Meghna. The protagonist is femme fatale Priyanka Chopra. The director is woman-friendly Madhur Bhandarkar. The theme is the all-glam world of modelling. And the audience is predominantly female from first day, first show.        
	Ask the director if he is a magnet for the maidens, and he laughs out loud. Women are always big fans of mine, he tells Metro on the phone from Mumbai. Even with Page 3, more women watched the film than men. They watch my cinema and love it because I give them a perspective. Fashion is about the youth, about a profession like modelling which many young girls are aspiring to pursue.        
	If the heroine is the hero of Fashion, the women are the majority in the multiplexes.        
	Says Sonia Ghosh, a 27-year-old IT professional: Priyanka Chopra is brilliant; Fashion is worth a watch just for her. And kudos to Madhur Bhandarkar for understanding the female mind so well, right from Chandni Bar.        
	Designer Anamika Khanna, who has a sequence in the film, isnt surprised with the craze among women to catch Fashion. Its about a world they are curious about, she says. Also, from the promos, with all the girls walking around, it comes across as a chick flick, something that is very in right now.                          
	Fashion, for sure, is in. Holding its own against a multi-starrer comedy like Golmaal Returns, the other Diwali release, the film has done great business across most multiplexes.        
	At a time when most films have struggled at the box office, its heartening to see a film with no hero do so well. The fact that so many women are flocking to see the film has definitely emerged as its trump card, is how a Bollywood trade analyst sums it up.        
	The female card has clearly worked. Priyanka Das, a second-year student, who watched Fashion over the weekend with five girls from her class, gives the film a thumbs up. It revealed so many things from behind the veil.... Most of us only see how pretty the models look on the ramp in all those designer clothes but so many things happen behind the scenes.        
	What women want is often what works for men too. We had gone to see Priyanka and Kangana (Ranaut). At first we were a bit awkward because it seemed like we were trespassers in a womens-only hall. But then we quite enjoyed the experience, smiled college-goers Sunny and Akash.

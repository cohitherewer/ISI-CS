                      In search of the self                    Featuring paintings by 27 artists working in various leading print media houses of the city, Second Self, the ongoing group exhibition, explores the creative vision of those whose daily creative output varies according to the news stories of the day. Brushes and paint are not the only weapons of creative expression for these artists. The computer plays no less a part in producing their art works. Depending on the theme, they create cartoons, computer graphics and several other styles of illustration. But the life of such art is limited to a single day. It is their original works done on canvas that reflect their true spirit and style. Besides artists working full-time with newspapers, the exhibition also includes a few freelancers. For all of them, this show is a way of discovering their second selves.

     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	The Met office on Thursday issued a cold wave warning for Calcutta and all Bengal districts for the next 48 hours.
    
	The director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, G.C. Debnath, said a cold wave warning for the next two days has also been issued for Jharkhand and parts of Bihar and Orissa.
    
	We have also issued a warning for rain or light snow in Darjeeling and Sikkim till Saturday noon, said Debnath.
    
	Calcutta shivered on Thursday as the North Wind blew strong and the maximum temperature could not rise because the sky was cloudy. The maximum temperature was pegged at 18.7 degrees Celsius, nine degrees below normal. The minimum temperature was 13 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal.
    
	As the sky is expected to get clearer tomorrow, the North Wind is likely to blow stronger, pushing the mercury down further. So, we expect a cold wave on Friday and Saturday, a Met official said.
    
	During winter, if the minimum temperature dips five degrees or more below normal, in meteorological parlance it is called a cold wave. As far as we can remember, Calcutta last experienced a cold wave in 2004, a Met official said.
    
	Met officials said a severe cold wave was raging across northern India and the wind from the north is very cold and dry. As the North Wind is likely to blow stronger from tomorrow, we expect the minimum temperature to drop sharply, an official said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       93-yr-old gets back land

	A 28-year wait ended for Mahamaya Roy Chowdhury, 93, on Thursday when the Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) returned to her the plot on which she had always wanted to build a house.        
	The CIT returned Mahamaya her seven-cottah plot in Jodhpur Park in accordance with a high court directive. My mother is relieved to get back the land. It means a lot to her as our father had bought it, her youngest son Debabrata, who teaches in the US, told Metro.         
	Debabrata took possession of the land along with elder brother Bibekananda, also a teacher. My mother wanted to build a house and move in here. But she had to live in a rented house. We will try to fulfil her dream by building a house on the plot, he said.        
	The CIT had acquired the plot for public purpose and was to raise a commercial complex there. The court struck down the acquisition and on September 16, ordered that the land be returned to its owner.         
	Mahamaya moved a contempt plea on Wednesday, saying the order hadnt been carried out. Justice Dipankar Dutta ruled that the land be handed over to her by 11.30am on Thursday.         
	The CIT, however, took two hours more to complete the formalities. There was a mismatch in the dimensions of the plot mentioned in the documents with the Roy Chowdhurys and the CIT. Both sides argued for sometime as a crowd looked on.        
	In the letter of possession, the Roy Chowdhurys mentioned that they hadnt got back their original plot. The plot is shorter by 3 ft 3 inches on the western flank and by 4ft on the eastern side, the family said.

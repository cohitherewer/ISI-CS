The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | No copyright for playwright
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       No copyright for playwright
										      STAGE                        Rituparno Ghosh acknowledged Utpal Dutts play Aajker Shahjahan (top) as an inspiration for The Last Lear (below, a still from the film)				                                 
	The Copyright Act is just as applicable in Bengal as it is elsewhere, but as far as Bengali theatre is concerned, it hardly seems to exist.         
	The very term illegal seems laughable when the royalty given to playwrights for a performance (if at all) is between Rs 10 and Rs 100. Can a dramatist really afford to pursue a case in court?         
	Says playwright Manoj Mitra: Only those of infinite patience people who are virtually creative maniacs can continue to survive as playwrights in Bengal.         
	Unlike in other states, theatre here is director-centric and the playwright is the least important person . Technical hands get their fees (however small) as a matter of course. Not so the scriptwriter.         
	It is common to find our plays being staged night after night with groups not even informing us. What is alarming, however, is the practice of using our names but misusing our scripts. Lines are dropped, important characters left out and other characters added. The spirit of the play may change altogether, but the writers let it pass, says popular playwright Chandan Sen.         
	Recently two controversies rocked the theatre world. Ratan Ghosh claimed that he was the original playwright of Putul Naacher Itikatha and not Arun Mukhopadhyay. And critics said that since Aurangzeb was written by Indira Parthasarathy in Tamil in 1974 and translated by Satya Bhaduri (the Bengali version appeared in SAS magazine of 2007), Mohit Chattopadhyay could not claim it was his original work. It would have been more fitting, they said, if he had said he was the editor.         
	But Chattopadhyay has said that he has given due credit to the writer and translator and many new elements have been added. Ratan Ghosh has published his script of Putul Naacher Itikatha in the SAS magazine of 2008.         
	Upcoming playwright Rajarshi Dey had lodged a court complaint against director Debesh Chattopadhyay on a similar matter, which was settled out of court.         
	Publishing a play gives the playwright legal security. He can prove that a particular work is his and establish the date of its creation, thereby protecting himself against plagiarists. He can ensure according to the Copyright Act that quoting or publishing more than a certain number of lines of that particular work without his permission is illegal.         
	Badal Sircar has taken care to acknowledge every writer whose works have inspired him or he has adapted.         
	But if original works can be ignored, what hope do adaptations and translations otherwise have?         
	Says Sourav Banerjee of Nabagrantha Kuthir, one of the biggest publishers of Bengali plays: Many people are afraid that if the name of a foreign or established playwright is mentioned, he may claim royalty, which in the case of foreign playwrights will be far higher than what is given to playwrights here, says Banerjee.         
	The All India Radio once came under fire for breaking copyright laws with Tennessee Williams The Glass Menagerie.         
	In Bengali theatre, the issue of royalty for performance hardly arises. Some 50 years ago Manmatha Roy and some others had founded Natyokar Parishad to deal with issues of royalty and safeguard playwrights rights. It was based in Soumendra Chandra Nandis house. Roy was president, Nandi secretary and I was assistant secretary, though then I had only one play to my credit, says Mitra.         
	The Parishad insisted that every published script be accompanied by a statement that groups interested in performing the play would have to pay an honorarium of Rs 10 to the playwright and get his permission. The Parishad functioned for 10 years and the amount it collected was Rs 30, Mitra adds.         
	The only place where the miracle of royalty still works is in publications. The Nabagrantha Kuthir offers royalty to playwrights for just one edition, which is 5-15 per cent of the sales, depending on the writers reputation and marketability.         
	But as it often happens, publishers never inform authors how many copies are being published. So one fine morning you might hear that your collection has gone into reprint, yet you are none the richer, rues Chandan Sen.         
	My publishers have been more or less conscientious, says Mitra. But his works have been widely used by makers of serials and telefilms without his knowledge.         
	The rate at which they lift works is unbelievable. I once turned up at a teleserial shoot to find that half of the lines given to me had been lifted from my own plays  Parabash and Sajano Bagaan. When I asked the so-called scriptwriter, he said: After all you are going to speak the lines, so please let it be.         
	Chandan Sen says that Bengali plays are regularly published in Bangladesh without permission from authors or publishers. Only recently I found they were airing a serial based entirely on my play Dui Hujurer Galpo, but as usual they had forgotten to give any credit to me.         
	Obviously the time has come not only to ensure that more plays are published but that playwrights are taken seriously and given their dues.         
	A glimmer of hope is Rituparno Ghoshs acknowledgement of Utpal Dutts play Aajker Shahjahan for his film The Last Lear. He took permission in advance from Dutts family. During his lifetime my father never earned anything as a playwright, but now at least Rituda was decent enough to pay royalty. Which, however nominal, is a remarkable instant in this country, says Dutts daughter Bishnupriya.       SEBANTI SARKAR

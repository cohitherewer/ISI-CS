	Students who cleared the Higher Secondary and ISC examinations will have to wait at least a fortnight to apply for admission to any of the colleges affiliated to Calcutta University.         
	The university on Tuesday issued a circular asking colleges not to start the admission process till further notice. The colleges were barred from even announcing a date for distribution of admission forms.         
	As in previous years, colleges can begin admitting students to BA, B.Sc and B.Com courses only after the university informs them about changes in the admission criteria.         
	The university usually issues the relevant circular in the last week of May or the first week of June, just before the announcement of Higher Secondary results. University officials said they were unaware of the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Educations decision to declare this years results much earlier than on previous occasions.         
	Now that the results are out, we will prepare the admission guidelines that need to be followed by the colleges as soon as possible, vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said.         
	The university has already amended some of its admission rules. For instance, students who have cleared the Class XII examinations from other boards with English and four other subjects will be able to seek admission to any of its affiliated colleges.         
	A meeting of the West Bengal Higher Education Council has been convened on Wednesday to finalise the 2008-09 academic calendar.  
	HS 2009 dates  
	The Higher Secondary examination of 2009, to be conducted by West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, will commence on March 16. According to an official, the examination will continue till April 16. The official added that the practical examination should be completed by January 19.

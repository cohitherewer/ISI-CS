	It was an ideal way of ushering in the festival of colours. WLC college organised Beautiful Mind, a sit-and-draw competition for 30 underprivileged children on March 19, as a run-up to Holi.         
	The children, sponsored by NGO Hive India, were aged between eight and 12 years. As they sat huddled in a classroom, excitement was writ large on their faces. I am happy to be here. I want to be a painter when I grow up, said Ajay Ghosh, one of the participants. The budding artist was sketching a football match.         
	We wanted to let the children play with colours and allow free play to their imagination, said Jaydeep Ghosh, centre head of WLC college. Thus the participants were given no particular topic, but were free to doodle as they pleased. Swapna Khatun bagged the first prize for the event. She had depicted a scene from rural Bengal. Arghadeep Chakrabarty and Ajay Ghosh were the runners-up.         
	WLC College has been organising sit-and-draw meets for under-privileged children for the last two years. We plan to organise more such events in future, said Farhana Naz Ahmed, a WLC official.

  Techno India         Quiz time  
	Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) organised the final rounds of All India Science Quiz on March 22. The preliminary rounds had been started in September 2007. Quizmaster Dilip Ghosh conducted the event, held at three levels.         
	There were six rounds of quizzing. The first four rounds were visual where the teams had to identify famous personalities, animals and parts of the human anatomy. The most interesting round was based on experiments. Among other things, it saw the quizmaster wrapping a piece of wood and a metal object with sheets of paper and setting both on fire. The paper wrapped around the wood burned, but the one around the metal did not. The students were asked to explain the phenomenon. In the sixth round, they were given clues to guess the name of scientists.         
	Don Bosco School, Park Circus emerged winners at the junior level, Modern High School won in the middle level while Salt Lake School bagged first position at the senior level.

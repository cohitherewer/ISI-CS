The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A Japanese at Kakdwip
                                                                                                               A Japanese at Kakdwip
										      caleidoscope                                Kunal Basu (centre) and Aparna Sen at Starmark, South City, on Friday. Picture by Pabitra Das; (below) a swan				                           
	How exotic is it to have a Japanese wife? My friend Sujan Chakraborty, who is present here, had told me of this professor from Kakdwip with a Japanese wife for whom he was seeking accommodation... Twenty years after I heard the story, here it is, Kunal Basu smiled at the audience gathered at the new Starmark store at South City mall for the launch of his book The Japanese Wife, which has been in currency ever since Aparna Sen decided to make a film out of it.         
	Like much recent fiction about India, The Japanese Wife, published by HarperCollins India, was also penned in a colder country. The story, set in the hot, tropical Sunderbans, was written in the Arctic winter of Montreal, Canada, where Basu lived in 1996. With a snowstorm then raging outside, the Matla in spate and kites flying in a clear blue sky must have seemed quite distant. Quite exotic, really.         
	Aparna Sen read out sections from the collection. The title doesnt give away that The Japanese Wife is a short story with 11 more to follow. And Other Stories has gone out of currency in titles, hasnt it? Basu asked.              
	Orkut poetry        
	Those who meet online also meet offline. Those who scrap also write poetry.         
	The Kobita community on Orkut released a book on February 8 at Kala Kunj called, what else, Kobita, on the selected poetry of its members. The procedures were remarkably like other offline events  writer and poet Nabanita Dev Sen was present and a cultural programme followed. A film made by the members and the moderator of the community Abin Chatterjee was aired. This book consist of poetry in three different languages: Hindi, Bengali and English.        
	The writers are from diverse fields, ranging from management to media to theatre, and also housewives and students.        
	The poetry, too, had offline concerns. In My reminiscence at a midnight platform, Anunoy writes: Clock strikes twelve, smoky anguish prevails:/ Impatience grows higher, tranquillity unravels/ Pin-drop stillness rules the midnight platform,/ Sounds of shoes have faded fulfilling their term.        
	In Kisher Lorai (What is the conflict for?), Souvik complains about the rat race in the world outside and how poetry is a counterpoint.         
	The swan problem        
	Overheard at a crowded stall selling idols on the eve of Saraswati puja: Dada, please be careful about the swan. Remember the bird flu. Dekhben jeno haansta jhimiye na thake (See to it that the swan, the goddess vaahana, looks healthy).       (CONTRIBUTED BY SUDESHNA BANERJEE AND DEBANGANA SAHA)

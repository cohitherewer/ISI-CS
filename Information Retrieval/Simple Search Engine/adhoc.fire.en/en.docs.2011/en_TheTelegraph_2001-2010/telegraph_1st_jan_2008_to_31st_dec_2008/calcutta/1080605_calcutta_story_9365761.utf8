                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bystanders shun bus hit-and-run victim
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A bus knocked down a woman and sped away on Wednesday morning and some bystanders watched her writhe in pain for some minutes before an elderly man stepped in.        
	Pronoti Dey, 45, was standing in front of the Shyambazar Metro Railway station around 11.30am when the bus dashed her. None of those who witnessed the accident went near her as she cried out in pain before losing consciousness.         
	It was left to an elderly man to take the initiative and move her away from the road. The tyre had gone over her left foot and she was bleeding from the forehead, too. A police team reached the site within five minutes and took her to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, said Hari Das, who was setting up his watch shop when the accident occurred.        
	Pronoti, who lives on Shanti Ghosh Street with her husband Shyamal and 17-year-old son  it is barely 100 metres from the accident site  was shifted to SSKM Hospital later in the day.        
	Tapas Guha, the officer-in-charge of Shyampukur police station, said the bus (route 78) was impounded but the driver and the conductors fled.        
	Residents and shopkeepers said accidents were frequent on this road. Buses try to power their way ahead. If two of them take the bus bay, four others dont. There is never a safe moment, Paltan, a shop owner, said.

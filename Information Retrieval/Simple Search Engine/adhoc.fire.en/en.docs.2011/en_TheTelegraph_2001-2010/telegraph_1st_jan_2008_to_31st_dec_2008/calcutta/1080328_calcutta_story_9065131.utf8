	The Students Federation of India (SFI) suffered a fresh blow on Thursday when its members were defeated in all the four seats of Jadavpur Universitys arts faculty students union elections. The results were declared on Thursday afternoon.        
	Forum for Arts Students (FAS) won three of the four seats. All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) bagged one.        
	The SFI had also failed to capture the students union of Presidency College earlier this month.        
	The results of the Jadavpur University poll show that a majority of the students have not supported us. But SFI candidates have got 40 per cent of the total votes, said Koustav Chatterjee, the secretary of the SFIs Calcutta district committee. The margin of loss for each post has gone down considerably this time, he added.        
	FAS has won the election for the second time in a row. The poll was held on Wednesday. Counting of votes began at 11am on Thursday and the results were out at 3pm.        
	FAS has won the posts of general secretary, vice-chairperson and assistant general secretary (day), while AIDSO has bagged the post of assistant general secretary (night).        
	Amartya Ray, a first-year postgraduate student of international relations, won by a margin of 330 votes and became vice-chairperson. We were expecting to win but had to work hard, because certain sections of the organisation had become weak, he said.        
	The new general secretary, Lokeshwari Dasgupta, a second-year history honours student, won by 267 votes. The assistant general secretary (day), Somshukla Biswas, and assistant general secretary (night) Sharmishtha Barman, won by 302 and 14 votes, respectively. Well strive to improve in the areas we failed this year, said Uttiya Basu, the secretary of SFIs Jadavpur University local committee .

        Clay creations
   Driven by an abiding interest in the idea of cultural exchange, German artist Angelika Lebe draws on eclectic influences in her creations. Currently on her maiden visit to India, she has conducted a week-long workshop at Artspace, Baruipur, in collaboration with local artists Anitya Roy and Tamal Bhattacharya. Focusing on the give-and-take of ideas, approaches, methods and techniques, it gave birth to pieces of pottery that fall outside the ambit of its usual practice. Clay and Alchemy, the ongoing exhibition of ceramic pottery, presents the results of the various innovations on clay conducted by Lebe and the participants of her workshop. 

 Event: An exhibition of ceramic pottery When: Till February 6; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

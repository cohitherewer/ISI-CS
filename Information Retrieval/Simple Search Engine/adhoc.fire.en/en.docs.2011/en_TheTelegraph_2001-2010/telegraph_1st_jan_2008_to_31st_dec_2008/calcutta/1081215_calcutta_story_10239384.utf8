The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Welcome to new wasteland
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Welcome to new wasteland
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                           The absence of autorickshaw stands in New Town is one of the many transportation problems faced by residents. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Suresh Ranjan Talukdar, 62, had used his lifes savings to buy a flat in Rajarhat. In March, he shifted base from Siliguri  where he had spent the past 25 years  and moved into his prized possession. Talukdar and his family were in for a shock.        
	No electricity, no drinking water, no drainage system, no sub-post offices, no banks or ATMs, no markets, no medicine shops, no taxi stands. Its impossible to live in such a place, he shudders.        
	Talukdar and family moved back to Siliguri in October.        
	They would have been joined by hundreds on the road out of Rajarhat if everyone had a fallback option like the Talukdars. Some are moving into rented accommodation in other parts of the city but many are staying on, hoping against hope that basic civic amenities are provided soon.        
	Metro continues with its series on the New Town nightmare.              
	Problem number 2: Connectivity is a killer. Literally. Residents recounted how a middle-aged man had suffered a heart attack at night a few months back but could not be rushed to hospital in time because there was no transport available. The man died before medical help could reach.        
	There is just one bus terminal that was inaugurated recently in Action Area I. There are no taxi stands or auto routes. Residents have to depend on the trickle of shuttle taxis and call-centre cabs. Rickshaws are the only steady means of transport within New Town and there are no fixed rates. In the absence of medicine shops, markets, banks and postal services, most residents still depend on Salt Lake or VIP Road. A couple of convenience stores have opened recently in Action Area I but that is just not enough for the 1,000-plus residents. Even after 24 months, the dream township cannot fulfil the basic needs of the residents.                
	Residentspeak: Every time anybody needs a haircut, a trip to Salt Lake is a must. The situation is almost hilarious. Even for grocery or vegetables one has to visit Salt Lake on a weekly basis, shrugs Sanjib Behra, 36, an engineer.        
	For Deepak Sen, a retired trader, every day in the one year he has been here is a struggle. There is no transport system. The rickshaws often charge Rs 35-50 for a distance that should cost Rs 15-20. The shuttle taxis and call centre cabs are unsafe for women.        
	Sagar Sen, an engineer, is desperate to move out of New Town. Coping with an emergency in New Town is impossible. There arent even medicine shops or clinics. And no ATMs for a financial crisis. Some modern villages are better off.        
	Debojyoti Patnaik, 39, regrets his decision of moving into New Town. Almost every block in Salt Lake has access to a market and a park. Couldnt the same be replicated for a township three times the sprawl of Salt Lake? Forget other problems, the lack of transport and basic amenities are enough to turn my New Town dreams into a nightmare.                
	Officialspeak: Hidco admits to the lack of basic civic amenities in New Town, but blamed it on the limited number of people who have moved in so far.        
	It is not our responsibility alone to arrange for transport, ATMs, postal services, or shops. There will be quite a few markets eventually. Very few people live in New Town as of now. If taxi, auto or bus operators dont consider New Town a feasible destination, we cant help it. If entrepreneurs dont see a sizeable market in New Town, what can we do? demanded a Hidco official.                
	What Metro saw: In the absence of taxi and auto stands and the lack of private buses in New Town, transport is a real bother. The lack of medicine shops, banks, sub-post offices and markets is a serious problem.

	A traditional but long neglected dance form of Bengal has finally found pride of place in a university curriculum. The newly-formed Centre for Studies in Dance Forms of Bengal at Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) has turned the spotlight on Gaudiya Nritya, which has had a hard time finding a foothold among the classical Indian dance styles.         
	The centre will function from the second floor of RBUs Jorasanko administrative building, but the course curriculum and fee structure are yet to be finalised.         
	We hope to start classes with a workshop in August. It will focus on the various aspects of Gaudiya Nritya, said centre head Mahua Mukherjee. The centres activities include organising workshops, lecture-demonstrations, seminars, publications, field studies and research on the dance forms of Bengal, like Jhumur, Raibeshe, Dhamali, Dhali, Lathi, Baul and Kirtan.        
	The Centre for Studies in Dance Forms is one of the 28 centres approved by the RBU executive council. Courses conducted by these centres will be open to people from all disciplines and in most cases will lead up to a certificate or diploma, said university vice-chancellor Karuna Sindhu Das.

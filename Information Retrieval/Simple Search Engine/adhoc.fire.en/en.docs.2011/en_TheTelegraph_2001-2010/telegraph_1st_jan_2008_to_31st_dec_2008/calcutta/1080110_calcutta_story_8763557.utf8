	The one-man committee report on the violence at Jadavpur University (JU) last April was tabled before the executive council on Wednesday.
    
	The members of the council  one of the two highest policy-making bodies of the university  decided to discuss the report only after going through it. 
    
	The vice-chancellor of the university, P.N. Ghosh, said the report would be discussed in the councils next meeting, which has been scheduled after a fortnight.
    
	According to sources, the report has raised questions about the role of Karmachari Samsad, the CPM-backed employees union, in fuelling campus violence and highlighted lapses on the part of the authorities in maintaining security. 
    
	Copies of the report have been distributed among the council members. They asked for time to read the report before participating in a discussion on it, stated Ghosh.
    
	It was not possible for us to go through the report during the meeting, said Swapan Ghosh, the general secretary of the Samsad.
    
	The commission was set up by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee after JU was on the boil for a fortnight in April 2007 following the students elections in the science faculty. 
    
	The Samsad had alleged that We the Independents, which won the election, and the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu)  both anti-CPM organisations  had ransacked its office on the night of April 5. 
    
	Ashoke Mohan Chakraborty, the additional chief secretary in charge of higher education, conducted an inquiry and submitted the report to the chief minister on October 17. The report was sent to the university the same day. It was not made public allegedly because the recommendations would cause resentment among Samsad members.

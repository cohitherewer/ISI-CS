                      The brink of reality                    A rational, serious artist with a keen sense of the world, Sumitro Basak reflects the senses of the times in his works. Creating an ambiguous world filled with deceptive realities, his works are a complex metaphor of contemporary life and society. On The Verge, the ongoing exhibition of his recent creations, has a unique visual language that appears to be inspired by paper cutouts of human-body parts. His figures are amorphous, fluid forms who inhabit a thin world created out of various shapes of varied colours and textures. There is a tension between the seen and the unseen in them, a sense of lurking presence that is haunting and suggestive. Basaks visual rhetoric needs to be deciphered as a language of disguises, where truth and lie become one.                    Event: Paintings by Sumitro Basak When: Till April 8; 2 pm - 7 pm (Today: 3 pm - 7 pm) Where: CIMA Gallery, 43 Ashutosh Chowdhury Avenue

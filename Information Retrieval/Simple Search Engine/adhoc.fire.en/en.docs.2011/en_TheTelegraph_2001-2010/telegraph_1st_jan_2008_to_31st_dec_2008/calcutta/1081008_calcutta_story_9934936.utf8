The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wood nest to pandal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wood nest to pandal

	Puja 2008 is into its final lap, yet Sohrab Sardar still wears a dazed look. This is his first Durga puja in Calcutta but that is hardly the reason why the Muslim farmer from a South 24-Parganas village would not budge from the 41 Pally Club pandal in Haridevpur.        
	The puja, given Four Star status on the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja scales, is using Sardars lifelong collection of twigs, branches, weaver birds nests and beehives to build its pandal.        
	Each branch or collection of twigs reveals itself differently  as a live form held frozen in a moment of action.        
	Before reaching the goddess, be prepared to be confronted by a huge lizard over the archway, be blessed by a 10-handed goddess on the right and a mother with child on the left. The walk within is lined by porcupine, tortoise, owl, kite and other creatures, all in their wooden avatars. Most are single pieces, some I have done up a bit, says Sardar.        
	His collection started with weaverbird nests gathered as a six-year-old. After turning 10, he worked with carpenters for seven years. While watching trees being sliced in the saw mill, he came alive to possibilities in the shapes of twigs.        
	Thus started a collection that invaded the farmers three-bigha plot, courtyard and cottage. My family asked me what was the point of preserving twigs. But I knew this was an art form. Appreciation came from stray visitors like minister Kanti Ganguly, artist Samir Aich and neighbours.         
	One of them, a van rickshaw-puller, alerted 41 Pally puja co-ordinator Dipankar Chatterjee. I work for a mobile company and had gone to the area to set up a tower about five months before the pujas, Chatterjee recalls. He found the clubs puja theme for the year in Sardars hut.        
	We have been decorating the pandal for over two months with the 200 artefacts we brought, says Sardars younger son Mintu. The result is showing. The crowd is swelling at the puja.

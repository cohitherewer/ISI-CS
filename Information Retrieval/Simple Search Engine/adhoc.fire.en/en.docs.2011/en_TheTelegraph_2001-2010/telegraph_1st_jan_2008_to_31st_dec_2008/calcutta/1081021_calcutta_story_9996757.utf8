                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Coal crisis   in power fall
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The city and its suburbs were powerless and sweaty for several hours on Monday as a coal crisis struck the Bakreswar plant and the maximum temperature remained a couple of degrees above normal.         
	The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company said Tuesday could be worse if coal supply did not improve.        
	Power cuts started around 9.30am and continued till around noon, when the shortfall was around 120 MW. Supply improved in the evening, bringing some relief to citizens.        
	We reduced the shortfall to around 70 MW in the evening, an official of the distribution company said.        
	Sources in the CESC said the duration of loadshedding in most localities of the city on Monday was between 60 and 90 minutes.         
	 The power scenario in Calcutta and the districts has been grim since Puja. The weather has become warmer since the monsoon withdrew and the evening peak-hour deficit in Bengal has shot up to 4,500 MW. In Calcutta, demand peaks at around 1,400 MW in the evening, said a power department official.        
	Power generation in Bengal has been sluggish since June because of coal shortage. Power minister Mrinal Banerjee had met Coal India officials in September and requested them to find a solution.         
	But supply of coal hasnt improved. We need 10,500 tonnes of coal daily at the Bakreswar power plant but our stock is almost nil, an official said.        
	A 210-MW unit of the Kolaghat plant was shut down after a snag was detected in its generator transformer and a 300-MW unit at Sagardighi has been closed for maintenance.

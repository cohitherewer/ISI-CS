The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fairway falls foul of marauders
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Fairway falls foul of marauders
          KINSUK BASU                                                One of the 1,000-plus holes dug on the Maidan. (Amit Datta)		    
	A fairway on the Maidan fell foul of a marauding army on Saturday and months of careful nurturing were destroyed by hours of callous trampling.        
	The green carpet of a nine-hole course that the Calcutta Ladies Golf Club has been rolling out on the Maidan was the victim of plunder by over a lakh DYFI rallyists.        
	The greens around the clubs nine holes have been ravaged, said Anuka Datta Kanungoe, the captain of the 116-year-old golf club.        
	No buses were allowed to be parked on the field, but several two-wheelers cut through the greens. People drove across and trampled on our manicured playing turf, relieved themselves and reduced our precious course to a mess. Considering we are the only golf club in the world run and managed by women, its such a disgrace, she said.        
	With the course no longer worthy of tee-off, the club has shot off a letter to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya explaining their plight and urging him to ensure that the golf course of the heritage club is spared the next time such a rally mauls the Maidan.        
	Its not just a field but a golf course. Unfortunately, except for a few holes, most of the course has been the damaged. We will have to sow the special grass all over again, said Pushpa Shaw, the secretary of the club with 300 members.        
	We put in a lot of effort and even hired a special gadget to mow the grass. Thats all gone waste now. Its a tedious process and it will take us at least a month to revive the course, added Shaw.        
	The prime casualty will be preparations for the All India Ladies Amateur Golf Championship beginning on January 26 at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC).        
	The Maidan course would have served as the practice ground for some top women golfers participating in the championship. But Saturdays invasion of the greens changed all that.        
	If some leading women golfers will be hit next year, the little ones are already feeling the hurt.        
	For Chitrangada Singh, a student of Upper KG at Modern High School, Monday and Friday mornings are special as she chips and putts away to hearts delight at the Calcutta Ladies Golf Club.        
	But Monday morning was heartbreak time. I practised for a very short while in one corner of the turf and then left for home with my grandmother. The area around the course was so dirty,  complained little Chitrangada.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Diamond display adds to Diwali sparkle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Diamond display adds to Diwali sparkle
          POULOMI BANERJEE                          The man, his Girl and her diamond: Elizabeth Taylor flaunts the 69-carat Taylor-Burton as she walks the red carpet with Richard Burton at the 1970 Oscars                                  
	Ever wanted to see the diamond that Richard Burton gifted Elizabeth Taylor, and which the actress sold off after their divorce? Been fascinated by the myths of the Hope diamond and wished you could see the gem? Now you can, or at least something as good.         
	With Calcutta becoming the fastest growing diamond market in India, premier diamond brand De Beers Group Marketing is bringing to the city replicas of 75 world-famous diamonds, including the Cullinan I, the Hope and the Taylor-Burton.        
	The replicas, made of crystallised carbon, have the same size, weight and look of the original. You wont be able to tell the replica from the original except that the original will have more fire. But the replicas are also quite expensive  the collection is worth at least Rs 55 lakh, said Premjit Sengupta, the business manager of De Beers Group Marketing.         
	The originals, of course, are priceless.        
	The last time such a display was held in Calcutta was in 2002.        
	According to Sengupta, this is a good time for showing the stones in Calcutta as Durga puja-Dhanteras-Diwali is a festive time.         
	Calcutta is also an important stop as the jewels are likely to give a fillip to the already expanding diamond market in the city.         
	In 2007, business grew by 31 per cent and we are expecting a similar growth this year too, said Sengupta.         
	Such a promotional event doesnt result in an instant increase in sales, but it does boost interest. The interest in diamonds was always there, but now there is greater availability  more shops now stock diamonds and there is greater awareness about the gemstones, he explained.         
	Sengupta is optimistic that the recent stock shocks will not take the sheen off the exhibition.         
	Jewellery is an intrinsic part of our customs. People will always buy for weddings and other occasions. So, I dont think this is a bad time, he said, talking about the exhibition that was first held in London in 1994.        
	While the Taylor-Burton may be the most popular among the exhibits, the Cullinan I is steeped in royal history. The pear-shaped gem with 74 facets is the largest cut diamond in the world. It is set in the Royal Sceptre of the British emperor and kept in the Tower of London with the other crown jewels.         
	Then there is the much-coveted and much-maligned Hope diamond. The 45.52-carat stone is believed to be cursed, bringing misfortune upon its owner. Legend has it that the Hope was mined in India and was gifted to Marie Antoinette by King Louis XIV. Both were beheaded.        
	But Calcutta wont get a glimpse of the most famous diamond of India origin  the legendary Koh-i-Noor. The Koh-i-Noor replica was a part of the exhibition, but was damaged after a show in Japan, Sengupta said.         
	The exhibition will be on at Diamond Dimensions at Chowringhee between October15 and 30.

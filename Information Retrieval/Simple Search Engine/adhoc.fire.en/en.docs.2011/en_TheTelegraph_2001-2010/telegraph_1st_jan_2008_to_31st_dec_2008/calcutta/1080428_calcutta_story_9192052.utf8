                      The journey within                    Current socio-political uncertainties and an enquiry into ones identity and the positioning of the self in such circumstances pique the interest of artist Uma Ray. Her drawings reflect a self-introspective nature, portraying her personal complexities and her own endeavour to overcome them. By the artists own admission, the ongoing exhibition is about an inward-looking journey through a path resting between myth and reality which, she feels, every person has to undertake at some point in life. Her works deal with innumerable questions about truth, life, its end and through all this, arrive at a conclusion about her own role in the celestial design. Mostly an outcome of her immediate experiences, they are related to religion, philosophy, cultural heritage, or in effect, the various conflicts and confrontations Ray has encountered in her life. Shot in the geographical and psychological space between Cape Town and India, her video Native, betrays her enquiry into the real, the unreal and what lies in between.                  Event: An exhibition of drawings and video by Uma Ray 
  When: Till May 2; 3 pm - 7.30 pm

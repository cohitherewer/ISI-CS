          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police picked up a few employees of Taj Bengal on the charge of being involved in an illegal construction but had to let them go after being confronted by the hotels guards.        
	The hotel management did not speak but sources said the three cops from Alipore police station were forced to release the employees  it was not clear how many  after failing to substantiate the charge.        
	Following a complaint by the hotel against the inexcusable behaviour of the cops, city police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti asked deputy commissioner (south) Rajesh Subarno to probe the matter.        
	The officer leading the three-member team has been asked to state what prompted him to go to the hotel. As for the alleged illegal construction, we would like to know whether he had proper information, said Subarno.        
	Police sources said a sub-inspector and two constables from Alipore police station arrived at the star hospitality address around 8.30pm on Wednesday and went straight to a spot where business meetings are usually held.        
	On spotting the employees there, the three cops accused them of being involved in an unauthorised construction and ordered them to come to the police station.        
	The trio also threatened them with dire consequences when the employees expressed their reluctance to follow the order. The men finally gave in and started accompanying the cops on their way out.        
	It was at the gate that some hotel guards intervened.        
	When the guards asked why the men were being taken out, the cops said they were involved in an illegal construction on the hotel premises, said an officer.        
	The guards tried to explain to the officers that the charge was baseless, but they would not listen and insisted on taking the employees away. It was then that the security personnel challenged the cops to substantiate their charge and to produce documents empowering them to whisk away the men. Caught in the act, the cops were forced to let go of the men, the source added.        
	A senior officer at Lalbazar said the sub-inspector did not apply his mind before visiting the hotel. He went on a raid without any evidence.

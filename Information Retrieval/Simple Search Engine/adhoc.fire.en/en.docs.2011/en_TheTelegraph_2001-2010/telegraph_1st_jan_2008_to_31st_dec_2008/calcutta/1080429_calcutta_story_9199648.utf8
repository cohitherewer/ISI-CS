          A STAFF REPORTER                          Warren Buffett (right) with his friend and bridge partner Bill Gates at a programme in New York. (AFP)                                  
	A group of 35 students of IIT Kharagpurs B-school will make the investment of a lifetime next weekend when they interact with the guru of the stock market, Warren Buffett.        
	Ranked the richest man in the world by Forbes in its latest list of billionaires, Buffetts company Berkshire Hathaway will be the training ground for the batch, even if for a day. They will get the opportunity to not only ask Buffett how he made his millions but also attend Berkshire Hathaways annual general meeting.         
	The 12-day trip to the US, beginning Thursday, has been arranged by Vinod Gupta, an Omaha-based alumnus of IIT Kharagpur after whom the B-school is named. Students of the University of Omaha, with which IIT Kharagpur has a tie-up, visited the institution last year.         
	I cant believe that I am going to meet the most famous investor in the world in person. He is a legend, said Kunal Nagar, a second-year student of the Vinod Gupta School of Management.        
	Buffett earned the epithet Oracle of Omaha for his unfailing sense of judgement while making investments. He is a philanthropist, too, just like his friend and former Forbes topper Bill Gates.        
	While the highlight of the students trip will surely be the meeting with Buffett, they will also get to visit the headquarters of some of Americas other big companies and attend classes at the University of Omaha.        
	We will visit the New York headquarters of Citigroup during the trip. This is a management students dream come true, Nagar said.        
	The students will drop by at the Nasdaq in New York to get a feel of daily operations in the worlds largest electronic stock exchange.        
	Classes at the university will teach the students practices like applied business simulation and visualisation, virtual team management, knowledge management and marketing on the Internet.        
	The trip will be special. They will get to meet teachers with expertise on a variety of areas, see how American businesses operate and meet a legendary business leader, said Gupta, the chairman and CEO of InfoUSA Inc.

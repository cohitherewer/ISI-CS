	The sting has claimed four more lives, taking the toll to 24 this season.        
	Madhabi Patra, a 41-year-old homemaker, died of malaria at ID Hospital in Beleghata on Thursday morning. The resident of Raja Rajendralal Road (ward 34) was admitted to the hospital on November 30 with high fever and body ache.        
	Principal M. Ghosh said: The symptoms were similar to that of malaria but the blood test was negative.        
	Ghosh claimed the woman died of septicaemia but the death certificate mentioned septicaemia and severe malaria as the cause of death.         
	At the same hospital, a 40-year-old woman died of haemorrhagic dengue on Wednesday evening. Officials said Tufni Bhuniya, a resident of Tangra, was admitted on Tuesday with high fever, rashes and body ache.        
	Raju Das, 38, died of malignant malaria at Howrah District Hospital early on Thursday, said a doctor. The Jagachha resident was admitted to a nursing home with high fever on Monday and shifted to the district hospital on Wednesday.         
	Mayor Gopal Mukherjee, however, said he was not sure whether Das died of malaria as he had also been suffering from jaundice and typhoid.        
	An 83-year-old man died of unknown fever at Vidyasagar Hospital in Behala, where he was admitted on Monday night. The Bishnupur resident had also complained of nausea and body ache.        
	Anti-malaria medicines are being distributed from all state healthcare centres and CMC clinics, said an official.

	Climate change can lead to security problems even in the strongest country in the world. The National Intelligence Council in the US recently assessed how climate change could threaten the countrys security in the next 20 years.          
	Political instability, mass movement of refugees, terrorism and conflict over water and other natural resources are some of the possible fall-outs of climate change. The assessment was made on the basis of a series of studies conducted mainly by Columbia Universitys Centre for International Earth Science Information Network.          
	The centre also ranked other countries on the basis of their vulnerability to increase in sea level and water scarcity and their ability to adapt to the overall effects of climate change. We can pinpoint areas of high projected climate change that are also in historically unstable regions. This suggests that climate change is likely to heighten political risks, said the deputy director of the centre, Marc Levy.          
	South Africa and countries in Asia, especially in the Indian subcontinent, are considered to be under threat from security risks associated with climate change. China, Philippines, India and Bangladesh are all vulnerable to sea-level rise and water scarcity in varying degrees.          
	Most countries in the subcontinent will be found wanting in terms of the ability to combat climate change socio-economically and technologically, said an Indian environmentalist.          
	Egypt offers perhaps the best example of security problems triggered by climate change affecting a country. About 37 per cent of the population in the land of the pyramids, which has witnessed recurring internal strife, lives within 10 metres of the sea-level in the Nile delta. Changes in rainfall or temperature pattern have started to affect agricultural harvest in countries like Sudan, Iran, Iraq and Ethiopia.          
	Unfortunately, there has been very little research on the issue in India so far, said a senior official of Tata Energy Research Institute.

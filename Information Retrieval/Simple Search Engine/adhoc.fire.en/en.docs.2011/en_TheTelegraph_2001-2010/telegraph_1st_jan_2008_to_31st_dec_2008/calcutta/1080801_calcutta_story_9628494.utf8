          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Gods own country is all set to woo tourists from Bengal. The Kerala government has launched a special campaign to promote the state in Calcutta and is holding talks with the state government on mutual co-operation.         
	Distance and accessibility are the main reasons why tourists from Bengal dont visit Kerala in greater numbers, M. Sivasankar, the director of Kerala Tourism, said on Thursday. He was in the city for a road show to showcase the states many delights.        
	According to him, out of the 66 lakh domestic tourists visiting Kerala every year, only two to three lakh are from Bengal. The long train journey  it takes more than two days from Calcutta to Thiruvananthapuram  and only a few flights from Calcutta are a major deterrent for tourists from this part of the country.        
	We are holding talks with the Bengal tourism department as well as airlines on how to improve connectivity, said Sivasankar. The road show is aimed at those who are making plans for the Pujas.        
	Kerala has succeeded in projecting its tourism worldwide. Bengal is also in the process of promoting its tourism and we will help each other, said state tourism minister Manab Mukherjee.        
	In a bid to attract more tourists, Kerala has introduced a host of packages, including rural tourism, eco-tourism and working vacations. As part of working vacations, workshops are being organised on houseboats with a capacity for 200 passengers, said Sivasankar.

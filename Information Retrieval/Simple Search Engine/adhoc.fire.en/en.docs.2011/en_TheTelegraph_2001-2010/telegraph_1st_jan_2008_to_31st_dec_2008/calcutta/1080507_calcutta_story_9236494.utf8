          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An assistant sub-inspector on Tuesday became the first insider to be arrested on charges of playing a role in the constable recruitment scam in Calcutta police.        
	Deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim said Nanda Kumar Pal, posted in the Central Reserve Office, had been given the task of verifying whether those who had reported for police training were the ones who took the recruitment test in January.        
	He allowed some of them to join the training school despite knowing that dummy candidates had represented them in the test, said Shamim.

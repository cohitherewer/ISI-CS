          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The state government has decided to set up an apparel training and management institute in the city to boost the export of readymade garments.         
	The project, worth Rs 25 crore, will come up in two years. An autonomous body called Apparel Export Promotion Council, funded by the Union ministry of textiles, will set up the institute.         
	The council members made a presentation to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings in this regard. Micro, small-scale enterprises and textiles minister Manab Mukherjee also attended the presentation.         
	We have earmarked a 5-acre plot in Salt Lake for the project. The site will be finalised after the council members visit the plot, said Manab Mukherjee after the session.         
	Stitching and embroidery work of the kind in demand across the globe will be taught to the students at the institute. Management principles will also be taught to the students.        
	This will be the first institute of its kind in the eastern part of the country and second in the country. It will widen the scope of export of readymade garments, said Mukherjee.        
	We have plans to open 12 additional training centres along with the institute, said Rakesh Vaid, the chairman of the council.

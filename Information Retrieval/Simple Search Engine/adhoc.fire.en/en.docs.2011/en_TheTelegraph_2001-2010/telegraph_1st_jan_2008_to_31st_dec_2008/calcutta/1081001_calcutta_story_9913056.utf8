                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Phoney salesmen rob flat

	Armed robbers masquerading as cellphone salesmen entered an 82-year-old barristers flat on Tuesday afternoon and made off with cash and valuables worth Rs 3 lakh after assaulting him and tying him to a chair.        
	Sachindra Kumar Roy, a bachelor, who shares the Gariahat flat with sisters Uma, 74, and Shanta, 60, had been greeted by three smartly dressed youths when he answered the doorbell around 1pm. The trio claimed to be representatives of a cellphone manufacturer and spent five minutes explaining an exchange offer to the Supreme Court barrister in Hindi.        
	The youths, aged between 27 and 35, were well-mannered. We had no reason to suspect them, which is why my brother let them in, Shanta told Metro.        
	Moments after taking their seats in the living room of the third-floor flat at Sukhoneer, an apartment block adjacent to The Gariahaat Mall, one of the youths made a call and another man arrived at the door. Shanta ushered him in.        
	Around 1.15pm, the leader of the group took out a gun and asked the Roys to hand over the keys to the almirahs. Uma, confined to a wheelchair because of an amputated leg, was about to scream but stopped when the man held the gun to her head. Once Shanta handed over the keys, the robbers tied her and Roy to two chairs.        
	When the barrister tried to break free, they hit him on the forehead and hands with an iron rod. Two fingers on my uncles left hand were fractured, said Sabyasachi Banerjee, a nephew of the Roy siblings.        
	The robbers took 10 minutes to clean out the lockers and suitcases in the three rooms. Apart from Rs 25,000 in cash, they took away jewellery, watches and cameras, said Vineet Goyel, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	The guard of the apartment block was taking his scheduled lunch break when the incident occurred. It seems the robbers timed their entry with the guards lunch break, Sabyasachi said.        
	Archana Banerjee, who lives in a second-floor flat at Sukhoneer, said she and other neighbours came to know about the incident well after the robbers had fled. It was only when Sachinbabu shouted for help that we realised something was amiss.

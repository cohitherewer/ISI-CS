	A 23-year-old from the slums of Pilkhana, Howrah, is set to be the first Muslim woman to drive professionally on the streets of Calcutta.         
	Zubaida Khatoon, who appeared for her driving test on June 13, will start applying for jobs as soon as she gets her licence. Her training started four months ago, after she was selected for a driving and soft skills course by the West Bengal Minorities Development and Financial Corporation. She was the only girl in the batch of 40.        
	The authorities at the corporation were surprised by her application. Though there were no restrictions on who could apply for the course, we were not expecting a girl to evince interest. We explained to her that there were other courses she could take up but her mind was made up, said Jawaid Akhtar, the managing director of the corporation.         
	Zubaidas father, Mohammad Salauddin, is an attendant at Steel Authority of India Limited and her mother, Mehara Khatoon, does social work in Howrah slums. My parents were supportive of my decision to enrol for the driving course, said Zubaida.         
	She liked the classes on spoken English, computers and personality development that were part of the course and hopes the lessons will secure her a job as driver-cum-assistant.        
	Zubaida is confident about employment when she joins the small band of professional woman drivers in the city. Times are changing. Women are flying planes, running big stores and holding positions of power. I think they will have enough confidence to let a girl drive their car.        
	The eldest of the three siblings, Zubaida also runs a vocational training centre at her home. Most women in our country are dependent on their fathers, husbands or sons. I want every woman to be independent, she said.

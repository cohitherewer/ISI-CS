The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Immersion takes toll on river
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Immersion takes toll on river
          JAYANTA BASU                           water woes: The Hooghly is choked with idols, bamboo structures and other puja items after immersions. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	The Hooghly has become more polluted after immersions, defeating attempts to make the process environment-friendly.         
	A study by SAFE, an NGO, found that the levels of oil, grease and total suspended solid in the river went up sharply after immersions this year. The amount of oxygen dissolved in the river water also went down significantly compared with the pre-immersion figure.        
	The study indicates that it is not enough to stop people from throwing flowers and other puja items into the river; immersion of idols  many of which are painted with toxic colours  and their bamboo structure can severely pollute the water and harm aquatic life forms.        
	We have made adequate arrangements so that flowers, leaves and other puja accessories are not thrown into the river. But we do not have the infrastructure to collect the bamboo structures of idols from the water. Calcutta Port Trust should remove such debris from the river, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the mayoral council member monitoring immersions.        
	The norms do not allow us to take such responsibility, said a senior port trust official.        
	Environment activist Subhas Dutta, on whose petition the high court ordered the municipalities and Calcutta Port Trust to share the post-immersion clean-up bill equally, feels the port trust has the social responsibility to clean up the river. The port trusts appeal against the verdict is pending.        
	Retrieving the idols and their structure immediately after immersion is the best option, felt Dutta.        
	Priests have told me that there are no religious restrictions against removing idols from the river after immersion. Puja organisers can spend a little extra to clean up the river. The civic body, too, can train people in dragging the structures to the bank after immersion.        
	Debasish Kumar, the secretary of Tridhara Sammilani, which was adjudged Model Puja in CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja, said: I do not think puja committees will oppose such a proposal. Idol makers can even collect their respective structures after they are dragged back from the river.        
	An environment activist felt a similar model of restoration should be followed for parks and roads where pandals were erected by damaging the greenery.        
	The civic body welcomed the proposal. We spend a fortune every year on the upkeep of parks. The money is basically wasted because pujas and melas devastate the greenery, said a senior civic official.        
	We will take appropriate steps once we receive the proposals, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department. The department started a green puja award last year to encourage eco-friendly pujas.

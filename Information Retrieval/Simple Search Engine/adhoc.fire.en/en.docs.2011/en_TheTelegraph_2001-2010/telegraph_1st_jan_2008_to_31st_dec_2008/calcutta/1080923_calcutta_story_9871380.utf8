          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 17-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl who married in secret at Dakshineswar temple on Sunday evening allegedly committed suicide a few hours later after the boys family refused to accept the marriage.        
	The two jumped in front of a train near Vivekananda Bridge, said police. Residents of the area found the bodies around midnight.         
	Government Reserve Police have sent the bodies for post-mortem and started an unnatural death case.         
	The boy, who worked part- time in a garage, lived with his parents and two siblings in a slum near Dakshineswar station, while the girl resided in Dakshineswar railway colony with her family.        
	The boys parents were not opposed to the relationship, but wanted him to marry only after he had a steady source of income.        
	The boys maternal uncle, Tapan Naskar, said: My nephew had started working recently. My sister wanted him to wait at least five years before marrying. But he paid no heed to her advice and married the girl, keeping his parents in the dark.         
	On Sunday, the teenagers bought wedding clothes on their way to the temple. Around 7.30pm, the boy returned home with his wife. His mother refused to let them in.        
	The boys father said: Even after fighting with us, my son waited outside our shanty for a long time. I saw them last around 10pm. When I came out of the room around 10.20pm, they werent there. Neighbours told me that they had walked towards Dakshineswar station.        
	He went back inside thinking the two would return soon. His brother-in-law informed him about their death.        
	The girls mother alleged her daughter and son-in-law were driven to suicide by the boys mother.

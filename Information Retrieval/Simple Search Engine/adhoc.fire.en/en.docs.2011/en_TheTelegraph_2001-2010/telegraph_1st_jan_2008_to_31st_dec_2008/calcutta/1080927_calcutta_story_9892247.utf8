                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Airport store boost to exports

	A cold storage facility for perishable cargo was inaugurated at Calcutta airport on Friday.         
	The Centre for Perishable Cargo will be able to handle 12,000 tonnes of goods annually, 10 times the amount exported through Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	The Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority spent Rs 6.75 crore to develop the centre for the Airports Authority of India. The facility was on a trial run since June.        
	The centre will boost export through Calcutta airport. The eastern and northeastern parts of the country will be benefited, said Jairam Ramesh, the Union minister of state for commerce and power, while inaugurating the centre.        
	Fish, prawn, vegetables, tea and flower are exported to Europe, Southeast Asia, West Asia and the US through Calcutta.         
	But many traders from the region export vegetables and other perishables through Mumbai and Delhi airports, which have cold storage facilities.        
	These traders will now export through Calcutta, said an airport official.

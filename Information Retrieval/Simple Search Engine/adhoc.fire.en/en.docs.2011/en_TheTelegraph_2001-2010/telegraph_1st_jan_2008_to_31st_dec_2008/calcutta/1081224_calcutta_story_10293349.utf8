          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday rejected the bail petition by Pradip Todi while the city sessions court asked the seven accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case to appear before it on January 15.        
	Lawyers representing Pradip Todi later moved a bail plea in the Supreme Court.        
	Ashok Todis counsel told the sessions judge that his client was seriously ill and needed treatment at private hospitals. The judge asked the Presidency jail hospital authorities to place a report on Todis health on January 2.        
	Wife killed: The body of Gita Sau, a 35-year-old employee of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, was found in a gunny bag in the septic tank of her Kasba house on Tuesday. Husband Sunil is absconding.         
	The couple used to quarrel often after he married again in Bihar. Gita went missing after dinner on December 13. Her sister lodged a complaint with police.

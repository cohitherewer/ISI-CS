The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Expedition of Ray classics restored
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Expedition of Ray classics restored
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Soumitra Chatterjee and Waheeda Rehman in Abhijaan                                  
	The abhijaan (expedition) of Satyajit Rays film restoration has reached the half-way mark. Out of 37 films (including documentaries and shorts), 14 have been restored and two more, Shatranj Ke Khilari and Kanchenjungha, are on the table.        
	Of those dusted and done, Abhijaan has been the most challenging, said Josef Lindner of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.        
	The audio of the film was severely damaged and we spent $26,000 on that alone. Moulds had destroyed the negatives, turning them into a solid block. Restoring it was like a jigsaw puzzle, said the Academy archivist at the American Center on Thursday.        
	Lindner is in town along with film critic Peter Rainer for the screening of four restored Ray films and also some of the maestros favourite Hollywood films at the 14th Calcutta Film Festival.        
	Aparajito, Parash Pathar, Teen Kanya, Joi Baba Felunath and a short film, Two, will be screened at the festival.        
	The restoration in the Academy at Los Angeles involves an intricate and tedious process of developing a master positive from the damaged negatives, improving the quality digitally and also restoring the audio system.        
	We have restored Sikkim, a documentary film that has never been screened in India. We will show a video format of the documentary at the end of the festival in Nandan III, said Lindner, whose favourite Ray film is Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne for the music and the performances of Rabi Ghosh and Tapen Chatterjee.        
	As for some of Rays favourite films, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, Double Indemnity, The General, Trouble in Paradise, A Night at the Opera and The Maltese Falcon have made the cut.        
	The seven films have been selected after going through journals and letters that Ray wrote to some Hollywood directors. These are films that he loved and was influenced by. Some, like Citizen Kane, opened a whole new path for him.... Hitchcock was Rays antithesis and so we added Rear Window, said Rainer.        
	The Hollywood films will be screened at Rabindra Sadan from November 11-17, at 11.15am. Rays restored films will be screened at Nandan III, November 11-14, at 3.15pm.

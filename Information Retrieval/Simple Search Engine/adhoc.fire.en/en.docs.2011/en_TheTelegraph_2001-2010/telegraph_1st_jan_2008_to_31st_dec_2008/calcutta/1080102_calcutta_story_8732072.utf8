        Depiction of the last bastion
   The Last Sanctuary, in many ways, marks a transition from the early works of Vasudevan Akkitham. His early works are often stories about a personal displacement. It seems that there is a pressing need in the artist to stabilise his moorings; to create a point of reference, an illusionary wall to project those personal shadows upon. Akkitham, much like a Coleridge, admits that painting in itself is a lost battle: what remains with the artist is the sense of agony and anxiety about not being able to express perfectly what he had conceived. Many of the works showcased in his ongoing exhibition deal with an imaginary world of birds and animals, and this imaginary world is under the threat of extinction. It is a shrinking territory as the insatiable human greed encroaches upon it. The world is perceived like a burning zoo and projected through images that are at once alluring and terrifying. One of the works from this exhibition, titled The Churning, appears here. 

 Event: An exhibition of paintings by Vasudevan Akkitham When: Till January 2; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Ganges Art Gallery, 33A Jatin Das Road

     A STAFF REPORTER
                      
	The wounded tiger captured from Jharkhali, in the Sunderbans, was roaring at the slightest provocation on Tuesday, much to the delight of its attendants at the Alipore zoo hospital.
    
	The impatience and anger show its condition is improving, said veterinary surgeon Swapan Kumar Ghosh, bandaging the wounds with colleague Gopal Samanta.
    
	True to its nature, the beast was expressing displeasure by biting at the cord with which we were tying its limbs for treatment. This aggressiveness was absent when it was brought to the zoo hospital last Friday... We are happy with the progress, Ghosh added.
    
	Zoo director Subir Chowdhury said: The animal is still under medication. We cannot say right now when it will be fit enough to be brought before visitors.
    
	On Tuesday, only mediapersons were allowed a glimpse of the Royal Bengal Tiger.
    
	The minor wounds have almost dried up but the deep ones, especially those on the left hind leg, will take some time to heal, said Ghosh.
    
	The tiger, suffering from anaemia, has been on iron supplement for the past few days. We will test its blood next week to check whether the haemoglobin level has risen. We hope the level will rise, as the animal is consuming eight kg of meat daily  one kg of pork in the morning and seven kg of buffalo meat in the afternoon, said a zoo official.
    
	The tiger was caught on February 22, by forest department staff and Jharkhali residents, with critical wounds on left hind leg, right foreleg and other parts of the body. It seems a crocodile had bitten off the paw of its left hind leg, the official added. Since it has lost the ability to hunt, we will shift it to a sanctuary after recovery.
    
	In the wild, a tiger lives around 15 years; in captivity, it survives two-three years more.
    
	The longevity of a tiger in captivity is more because it gets food daily, unlike in the forest. Moreover, in the wild, a tiger has to share its kill with others. Its hunting skill, too, declines with age, said Samanta.
    
	We hope this tiger will live around 18 years if it stays in a sanctuary, he added.

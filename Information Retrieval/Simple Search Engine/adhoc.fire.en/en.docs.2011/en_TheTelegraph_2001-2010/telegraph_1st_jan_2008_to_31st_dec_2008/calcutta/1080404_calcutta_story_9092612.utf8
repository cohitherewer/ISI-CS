The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Film school stays shut
                                                                                                               Film school stays shut
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Satyajit Ray Film amp; Television Institute remained shut for the third consecutive day, despite student pleas for a quick solution to the labour problem triggered by Citu.        
	We want our classes to resume. We cant afford to waste any more time due to a political problem, said Nairit Dey, a final-year student of sound engineering.         
	The second-year and third-year batches are the worst hit. At stake are several diploma films scheduled to start from April 20, added Amaresh Chakraburtty, head of the direction and screenplay-writing department.         
	Two days have passed since a Citu-led group of contractual labourers brought work on the campus to a halt by denying entry to a new security agency hired by the institute.         
	On Thursday, the institute authorities reiterated their decision to keep the campus shut until the new agency is allowed to work.         
	Since this is a residential campus, its not safe to keep the institute open with the agitating workers scattered all over, said the institute director Swapan Mullick.         
	Both the Centre and the state government have been alerted but they are yet to step in to resolve the crisis.

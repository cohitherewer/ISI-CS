                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jammu mum on agent
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta police seem to be veering around to the view that Mukhtar Ahmed, arrested last Friday for his alleged links with the Mumbai terrorists, was an undercover agent of Jammu and Kashmir police.        
	The prolonged silence of the Kashmir police on Mukhtars identity has prompted the city sleuths to accept the reports that the 39-year-old was one of them, sources said.        
	The city police had sent an email to their Kashmir counterparts three days ago to ascertain Mukhtars identity. There has been no response yet. Obviously, they do not want their agent to be identified, the source added.        
	The city sleuths, however, are wondering why the Kashmir police had no clue about the plot to attack Mumbai on the night of November 26 if Mukhtar had indeed been their agent.        
	The charge against Mukhtar is that he had procured 32 SIM cards from Calcutta and passed them on to the terrorists in the Mumbai attack.        
	The theory, though unconfirmed, is that the SIM cards had been passed on to the terrorists only to keep a tab on them, said an officer of the Special Task Force, which is handling the Mukhtar case.        
	Then how come the Kashmir police were in the dark when one of the SIM cards was activated on November 26, the day the 60-hour siege of Mumbai began? the officer asked.        
	If supplying SIM cards to terrorists was an undercover operation, it had failed. There was no communication from the Kashmir police during the three-day shoot-out between NSG commandos and the terrorists.        
	Records show that the terrorist using the SIM card had made a series of calls to others in the group spread across Mumbai while the siege was on.        
	Officers said either the SIM cards were not being monitored or Mukhtar had been working for the terrorists. The answer lies with the Kashmir police who are keeping mum on the issue, the officer said.

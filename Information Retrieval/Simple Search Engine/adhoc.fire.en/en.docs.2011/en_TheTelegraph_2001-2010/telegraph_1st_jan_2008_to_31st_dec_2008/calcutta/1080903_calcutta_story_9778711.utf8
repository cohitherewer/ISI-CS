The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rs 91 crore   lost in power theft 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rs 91 crore   lost in power theft

	CESC will request the state government to raise a special police force to check power thefts in some city pockets, an official of the power utility said on Tuesday.        
	The company has suffered a loss of around Rs 91 crore in the 2007-2008 fiscal because of power theft, said the CESCs executive director (corporate development), Santanu Chatterjee.        
	It is becoming difficult to check the menace without a special police force. We will approach the state government for a crackdown on the power thieves, he added.        
	The state electricity act in force between July 2002 and June 2003 had the provision of creating a special force to prevent power theft. But the provision was not included in the central Electricity Act that came into force after June 2003, making the state act void.         
	Officials said around 150 illegal connections have been detected in the CESC-served areas of Calcutta, Howrah and Hooghly. The authorities will send a letter to its consumers this month to create awareness on the issue.

  - Medical student 7th to jump to death at Metro station this year          A STAFF REPORTER                                                       Anupam Dutta		    
	Medical student Anupam Dutta took friends by surprise on Monday when he asked them to forgive him if he had ever hurt them and then left everyone in shock by jumping on a Metro Railway track.        
	Anupam, a reclusive 22-year-old who could have become the second doctor in his family after father Nepal Krishna Dutta in another two years, chose instead to become the seventh person to die on the Metro tracks this year. Nobody in his family or small circle of friends had an inkling of what was going on in his mind.        
	After classes were over, he asked everyone to take care and sought forgiveness if he had ever inadvertently hurt anybodys feelings. We were a little surprised, yes, but did not see beyond it, said Debamalya Banerjee, his senior in college.        
	Anupam walked out of Medical College and Hospital around 2pm. He was dead 27 minutes later, crushed under a Dum Dum-bound train at Central station. Himangshu Mukherjee, who was standing next to the youth on the platform as the train came in through the tunnel, could only shriek in horror as more than half of the first compartment went over him.        
	He looked very calm. Suddenly, he dropped his bag on the platform and jumped in front of the train. He waited till the last second so that the driver could not brake, Himangshu said.        
	Anupam did not die instantly, though. We saw him move his arms. We tried to bring him out without moving the train but it wasnt possible. We had to take the train backward. When we put him on an ambulance at 3pm, we knew that the chances of him surviving were bleak, a Metro Railway official said.        
	A resident of Purbapara, in Garia, Anupam was taken to the emergency ward of his college, where he died at 3.14pm. The youths father, who hadnt been told of his sons death until he reached the hospital around 5pm, said Anupam studied past midnight on Sunday and spoke and behaved normally till he left for college. He was tense about his fifth semester, due in two months, but he had always been a good student. Why would he do anything of this sort? We have nothing to live for.        
	The suicide disrupted Metro services till 3.10pm.

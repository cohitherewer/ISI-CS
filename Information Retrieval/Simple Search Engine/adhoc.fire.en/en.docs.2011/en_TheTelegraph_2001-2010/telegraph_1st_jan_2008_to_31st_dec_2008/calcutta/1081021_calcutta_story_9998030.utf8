The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Company debut on campus
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Company debut on campus
  - IIT entrepreneurs aim to recruit rather than be recruited          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          (From left) Aniket Panda, Kanav Hasija and Mrinal Mishra                                        
	One way to beat the recruitment blues is to just do it, yourself.        
	Kanav Hasija, Aniket Panda and Mrinal Mishra were planning their own thing when they came to know of each others plans. Bingo! A start-up was born in the classrooms of IIT Kharagpur.        
	The Kharagpur Consulting Group (KCG) has done pilot projects for two international clients and bagged three more since being formed in August. The company will be registered by December and the trio behind it could be recruiting instead of being recruited during campus placements next year.        
	We decided to team up after realising that integrating our skills would make this group complete and competitive in the market, said Hasija, a third-year mechanical engineering student specialising in patent and legal consultancy.        
	Chemical engineering student Aniket, in his fourth year, is the technology and market research consultant in the group. Mrinal, a fourth-year student of metallurgy, does financial analysis and strategy-building for clients.        
	Fellow IITian Prabhar Ranjan is the financial adviser to the group, which has a support team of 14 other students.        
	B.K. Mathur, head of training and placements at IIT Kharagpur, described the companys birth as a triumph of the institutions entrepreneurial spirit. We encourage students to become entrepreneurs and be job-providers rather than job-seekers.        
	Hasija and Cos first goal is to establish ourselves by next year. If we can do that, which we are confident of, we will give campus placements a miss, said Hasija.        
	The bouquet of services includes problem solving and consultancy for patent drafting, valuation, marketing, distribution and finance. The companys official website hit cyberspace a few weeks ago.

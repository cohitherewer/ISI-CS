                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Travel lines open, few takers

	Air and train services between Calcutta and Mumbai remained normal on Thursday, though there were a number of cancellations by passengers going to the terror-stricken city.        
	A group of doctors supposed to travel to Mumbai for a conference on radiotherapy cancelled their journey at the last moment. The conference was at the Taj. If it was a day earlier, anything could have happened to us, said Subir Ganguly, one of the doctors.         
	All flights operated on schedule on Thursday, said an airport official.         
	According to an Air India spokesperson, around 10 per cent of tickets were cancelled.         
	South Eastern Railway officials said trains to Mumbai were on schedule.        
	Most passengers arriving at the city airport from Mumbai had a story to tell.        
	Palash Adhikary, a 34-year-old doctor based in Australia, and his family could have been held hostage at the Mumbai Taj had they not checked out the night before.        
	We reached Mumbai from Brisbane on Tuesday and checked into the Taj. Later that night, we moved to Kemps Corner Hotel, he said.         
	When we were returning to our hotel on Wednesday night, we heard explosions, followed by gunshots. We shudder to think that it could have been us there, he said.         
	Adhikary was accompanied by his wife and their two children.        
	Textile trader Pravin Jindal, 30, who arrived in Calcutta from Surat via Mumbai with his wife to attend a wedding, said the sight of the car wreckage at Santa Cruz left him shaken. Terrorists had lobbed grenades in the area on Wednesday night.        
	Security was beefed up at Calcutta airport on Wednesday night itself. Additional personnel were deployed and check-points set up at all the entrances. All vehicles arriving at the airport are being checked.

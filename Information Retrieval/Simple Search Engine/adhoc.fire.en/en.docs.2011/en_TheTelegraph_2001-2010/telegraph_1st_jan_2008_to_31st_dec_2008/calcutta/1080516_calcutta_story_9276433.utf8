                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Finance hub in Rajarhat
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The city may get a financial hub on the lines of Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai.        
	The state government has got proposals for developing a special zone for financial services. A financial centre on the lines of Bandra-Kurla Complex could be developed at Rajarhat, said a senior government official on the sidelines of the pre-centenary celebrations of Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) on Thursday.        
	The stock exchange may develop the hub on a five-acre plot in Rajarhat that it will get from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the official said.        
	Nothing has been finalised yet. The state housing development infrastructure corporation will show the plot to the CSE management in a few days, the official said.

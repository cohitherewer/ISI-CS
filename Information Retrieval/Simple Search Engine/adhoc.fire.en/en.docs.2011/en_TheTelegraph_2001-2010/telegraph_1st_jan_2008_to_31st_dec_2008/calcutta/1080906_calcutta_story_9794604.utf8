                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Boy molested in school
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A student of Class VIII was sexually abused by his seniors in their Ekbalpore school last week.        
	After Mohammad Ehsaan (name changed) told his parents about his ordeal, his family lodged a complaint with police. The next day, his parents went to the school and demanded action against the culprits.        
	But the authorities asked us to meet the guardians of the accused students and reach a settlement. They told us that if we proceeded with the police case, it would spoil the boys careers. But we want them to take stern action so that these boys do not dare victimise other kids, Ehsaans mother said.        
	Acting on the complaint, Ekbalpore police have started a criminal case. We havent made any arrests as the school is trying to settle the issue, said an officer.         
	The incident took place when Ehsaan had gone to the toilet on August 27. Four or five Class IX students followed him there. They asked me to undress and then abused me physically. I pleaded with them to let me go but they paid no heed. They threatened me with dire consequences if I complained to the authorities, said Ehsaan, a resident of Dent Mission Road in Ekbalpore.         
	Residents expressed their anger against the school for mounting pressure on Ehsaans family to work out a settlement.        
	There have been a couple of such incidents in the school earlier too, but the authorities didnt take any action. Its a heinous crime and those responsible should be punished, said Ainul Haque, a resident.

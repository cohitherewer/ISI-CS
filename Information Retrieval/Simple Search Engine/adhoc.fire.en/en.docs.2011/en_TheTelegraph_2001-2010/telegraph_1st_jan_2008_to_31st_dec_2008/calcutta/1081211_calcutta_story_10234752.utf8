          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The debris of the gate. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Jadavpur University on Wednesday asked a contractor and a consultant to stop their ongoing projects on the campus, a month after a gate they were constructing collapsed, killing two labourers.         
	The decision by the universitys highest policy making body, the executive council, will delay the construction of a multi-storeyed building and two student canteens, apart from a number of other projects.         
	We will not allow the contractor and the consultant to work on the campus any more. They were asked to stop work on all the projects they had been asked to execute. This will delay the completion of the projects by four to five months, said vice-chancellor Pradip Narayan Ghosh.         
	According to him, the universitys experts in civil and construction engineering will examine the projects and submit a status report. Depending on it, a decision will be made on appointing a new contractor and consultant, he added.        
	Gate No. 4, near the arts faculty, collapsed on November 18, trapping four labourers under the debris.         
	The ongoing projects have been funded by state and central government agencies and some of them are time-bound. The stop-work notice to the contractor and the consultant will cause a lot of inconvenience. But we cannot allow the contractor and the consultant to continue work after two labourers were killed, said a member of the council.         
	The vice-chancellor said the mishap was being investigated and the final decision would be taken on the basis of the report.         
	The contractor and consultant have not yet been blacklisted, he added.

	The fourth day of the Burrabazar fire saw lakhs being added to the losses of the traders. Here are four who have been hit hard:
 
	Name: Padam Surana, 35.
 
	Shop: The Suranas own eight shops in Nandaram. They deal in suitings.
 
	Lost: ldquo;We could salvage a portion of the stocks from our first-floor shop. The rest were destroyed, rdquo; said Surana. 
 
	Insured: Partially.
 
	What will he do now: ldquo;We do not have any alternative source of income. We will have to start from scratch, rdquo; said Surana. 
      
	Name: S.L. Jain, 65.
 
	Shop: Six garment stores in Nandaram, bearing the name KT Fabrics.
 
	Lost: The Jains ferried out stocks on the night the fire started. But the major portion of the stocks was left behind.
 
	Insured: No.
 
	What will he do now: ldquo;I am going to rent a gaddi in some other katra nearby and start afresh. I also have a business in Rajasthan, rdquo; said Jain. 
       
	Name: Harshad Shah, 55.
 
	Shop: A shop on the first floor and a godown on the fifth floor of Nandaram. He trades in dress material and ready-to-wear garments.
 
	Lost: Shah fears that apart from the stocks, the fire has devoured some bearer cheques and vital documents. 
 
	Insured: Partially.
 
	What will he do now: ldquo;I am praying that I have some stocks left to start afresh, rdquo; said Shah.
       
	Name: Ratan Kumar Gupta, 48 .
 
	Shop: Two shops on the fifth floor of Nandaram.
 
	Lost: Chains and buttons worth Rs 4 lakh.
 
	Insured: No.
 
	What will he do now: ldquo;The firemen said that some shops on the fifth floor were not destroyed. I hope my shops are among them. I have no other business to fall back on, rdquo; said Gupta.

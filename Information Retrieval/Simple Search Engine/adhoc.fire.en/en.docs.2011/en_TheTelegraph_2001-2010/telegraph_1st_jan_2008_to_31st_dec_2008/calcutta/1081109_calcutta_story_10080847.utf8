The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Roadside bather with the eyes of a god
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Roadside bather with the eyes of a god
										      eyewitness                        Sumitro Basak with his pop-up book at Studio 21. Picture by Pradip Sanyal				                           
	Magpies collect bright objects that catch their fancy and like to display them as conspicuously as possible. Artist Sumitro Basak possibly follows the example of these birds, or so it appeared at a slide show of his work organised by CIMA Gallery at Studio 21.         
	The young artist trained at Kala Bhavan in Santiniketan explained that slide shows were a regular feature there, although he was aware that these often altered the scale at which a work was meant to be exhibited.         
	Basak, who recently held a similar presentation at the Yale University gallery, tried to illustrate how he appropriated elements of popular culture, illustrations for childrens books and everyday things to create his small watercolours and also his beautifully-crafted pop-up books.         
	Basak said he had taken an avid interest in calendar art with illustrations of deities from childhood, and that extended to cinema posters, jatra and cassettes of folk songs popular in villages and small towns once he became a student in Santiniketan. His years in a Bowbazar school had also left a lasting impression on him.        
	In his works, far from producing a mishmash of all these, Basak juxtaposes specific elements to underline certain issues that he wishes to highlight.         
	Men bathe at a kerbside pump with the discarded clay image of a popular deity standing beside them. One of the men untying his lungi has the eyes of the god, thereby bringing out the surprise element.         
	Basaks use of pictorial space often reminded viewers of the works of the Bengal School masters and Indian miniatures, although the urban scene and its quirks are what Basak is preoccupied with.        
	He went on to his village home in Burdwan where the ladies of the household are experts in the dying art of alpana. In some of his slides he demonstrated how he used the alpana form in his own village home, and replicated it in the space of CIMA Gallery.         
	He spoke about inhibitions of the lower orders, and how at Yale university he was told that the art gallery is not really public space, whereas the marketplace and bus stands are definitely so. His works have often grown in scale when pure colour and form are in equilibrium. Basak also showed Robert Sabudas magical pop-up books.              
	Calcutta cant afford to languish in its present state of urban decay. It must strive to regain lost prestige and mend its global image, because it still has the potential to become one of the greatest cities of the world.        
	Fervent words from Paolo Ceccarelli, the Unesco chair in urban and regional planning for local sustainable development, and the president of the International Laboratory of Architecture and Urban Design, who fell head-over-heels in love with this much-maligned metro.        
	The Italian professor from the University of Ferrara was delivering the keynote address at a conference  Yesterday/Tomorrow. 50 years of urban conservation and innovation in Italy  at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre recently.        
	The conclave preceded the inauguration of an exhibition titled identically and organised by the consul-general of Italy in Calcutta in collaboration with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR).        
	Mounted at the Jamini Roy Gallery of the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, the exhibition dealt with the most important aspects of the Italian experience in the field of architectural, urban and landscape heritage conservation.        
	Model urban renewal projects in Italy like social housing in the historic centre of Bologna, regeneration solutions for the earthquake- hit Friuli region in northern Italy or recycling residential reuse in a Genoa ghetto were showcased.       Soumitra Das and   Subhro Saha

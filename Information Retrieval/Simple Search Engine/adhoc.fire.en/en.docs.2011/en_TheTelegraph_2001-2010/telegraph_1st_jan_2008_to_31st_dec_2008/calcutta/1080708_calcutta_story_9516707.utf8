	The high court on Monday commuted the life sentence of three bank dacoits to 12 years imprisonment after admitting a plea to verify how they have rectified themselves in a correctional home over the past 10 years.        
	The state government has modified jails into correctional homes... The court is commuting the life sentence of the three convicts to 12 years imprisonment so the state could see whether the purposes of the modification has been served, the division bench headed by Justice G.C. Gupta observed.        
	Abdul Gayen, Samar Roy, Manoj Singh, Abul Akunji and Dinesh Ram were arrested on charges of looting Rs 4.5 lakh from State Bank of India branch in Mominpore in December 1997.        
	Akunji died while the trial was on and Gayen was released by court. The other three were sentenced to life term.        
	The trio moved the high court against the trial court order. The trial came up for hearing in March, after eight years. Sekhar Basu and Jayanta Chaterjee, who represented the three, submitted: The state government has converted the jails to correctional homes... If the convicts spend the rest of their lives in jail, how will it be proved that the governments purpose has been served?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | India through foreign eyes 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       India through foreign eyes 
                          John Elliot. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                    
	Evidently, fighting broke out along border between West Pakistan and India this afternoon. India says Pakistan started it; Pakistan says India. Who knows? But India has been launching limited attacks on East Pakistan border for the past 10 days. What are you supposed to do when a war starts and the cable office is closed? Play poker. Go to sleep  writes Peter R. Kann in his Dacca Diary, a despatch for The Wall Street Journal on December 14, 1971, which he could never send. It was later printed by his paper and went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 1972.         
	While Kann could afford a snooze when cable offices were closed, foreign correspondents today cover their beat minute-by-minute as South Asia emerges as a hot spot in the international arena.        
	It is in this backdrop that the Foreign Correspondents Club, a group of correspondents from abroad and a few Indian journalists covering South Asia for foreign media, celebrates 50 years of its existence with the book Foreign Correspondent, Fifty Years of Reporting South Asia, published by Penguin.         
	The book is mainly the effort of the club, said John Elliott, the president of the club and the India correspondent of Fortune. He is also one of the editors of the volume along with Bernard Imhasly, the former South Asia correspondent of Swiss daily Neue Zuercher Zeitung and Simon Denyer, the Reuters bureau chief for India and Pakistan.         
	The club received 400 articles, of which 80 were selected. Rather than events, we focused on good writing, says Elliott.         
	This explains why Indira Gandhis assassination doesnt appear in the volume. Nor is there anything on Benazir Bhuttos death or on Musharraff. What the book does have is a collection of articles on myriad topics from tiger hunting and domestic helps to wars and the economic boom, seen from a different perspective.         
	A case in point is Barbara Crossettes last interview with Rajiv Gandhi, for The New York Times. While talking of the danger to India and Indian leaders as the country took on a larger role in the region, she writes: He (Rajiv Gandhi) said that the danger would not come from the Soviet Union, however, which was too busy with its own problems. Are you talking about the CIA again? I asked him. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, his mother, used to say that she feared the American intelligence agency would kill her one day... Mr Gandhi smirked. In the end, Mrs Gandhi was shot in 1984 by Sikh bodyguards  Now her son, who had many enemies among disaffected Indians... has followed her into martyrdom.         
	Crossettes underlying remark is that the Gandhis, who publicly blamed the foreign hand, were, ironically, killed by men of their own country.         
	The volume recreates the history of South Asia over 50 years with some remarkable photographs, mostly black and white, from Indian and foreign shutterbugs, including Raghu Rai, Pablo Barthalomew and Bob Nicholsbird.         
	The book opens with BBC journalist Robert Stimsons 1949 valedictory despatch Goodbye to India, where he recounts the experience of reporting a country that was largely critical of his own countrys rule. Indians were most considerate partly because they value formal good manners and partly because Mr Gandhi (Mohandas), in his own dealings with individual Englishmen, set a good example. But Elliott, who lived through the 80s, says: It is not a country that takes kindly to criticism.                     ANASUYA BASU

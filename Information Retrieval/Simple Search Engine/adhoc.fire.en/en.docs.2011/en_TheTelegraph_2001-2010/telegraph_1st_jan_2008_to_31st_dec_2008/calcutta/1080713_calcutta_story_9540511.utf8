	Do you like Aamirs new hair cut? He is sporting this very close crop with a parabola prominently running through his scalp. It apparently is called the injury cut. You must be wondering where you saw it? Was it in a film magazine or was it in the daily paper? Soon you will remember that you had the best look at it in the TV ad for a Samsung mobile. In the ad, Aamir says nothing about the phone  he just holds it in his ear swivels around with a very impressed look on his face and makes all sorts of noises that could be interpreted as notes of exclamation. Yes, that was what Aamir was paid for.        
	Not too long back, using celebrities in advertising was considered a creative shortcut. But then Big B or Small K started acting difficult  they would not do an ad unless it was interesting. So scripts were written which were unusual, had scope for acting and after all that, if possible, tried to do some good to the brand.        
	By the time you finished handling the celebrity, the advertiser was on your back. He has become wiser now. He knows that when his ad with Sachin is released, not only will there be three more Sachin ads running, but giving Sachin company during the commercial break will be Dhoni, Bachchan, Shah Rukh and Aamir with their brand endorsements. So his ad needs to stand out. A strange demand, since the primary reason why celebrities are put in an ad is to break the clutter. Now celebrities were creating their own clutter.         
	Signing a star was no longer enough. You needed a script that did justice to the brand and the star both. Some used specific dimension of the star persona and attached it to the brand. A good example of this is Akshay Kumar, the macho man in the Thums Up campaign. A new twist to this school of celebrity advertising was found in the recent Mamaji Aap ad for Brylcream featuring Dhoni. The cricketer has been used splendidly in the script that dovetails star personality and marketing intention.         
	The great captain in the making, we all know, comes from a modest background. Millions of youths in second-tier towns idolise Dhoni. They also get inspired by him  if Dhoni can, we can also. This ad takes him and his hairstyle back there. Dhoni had to lend his current celebrity status and his past non-celebrity origin. The script did the rest.         
	The idea is to expand the hair styling market in the non-metro markets and establish Brylcream as the agent for this transition.         
	Celebrities from the silver screen are competent actors. Some are even great actors. No wonder the ads they appear in usually get enriched by their enactment of the script. Remember the series Aamir did for Coke or the one he did for Toyota Innova. That is par for the course.         
	The demand made by the Samsung ad on Aamir the actor was of a hole-in-one. The unique thing about this new Samsung mobile is its 3D surround sound. How do you demonstrate 3D surround sound in a television ad? Just claiming such a property may not be persuasive enough. Demonstrating it is nearly impossible as the ad will be played mostly on TV sets that cannot reproduce 3D surround sound.         
	So the ad took the short but significant step of moving its goal from demonstrating 3D surround sound to displaying the effect such sound will have on a listener. Aamir was chosen to do this somewhat difficult task. He had to credibly show the effect of 3D surround sound without the sound being audible to the viewer.         
	The surround sound technology did not have a visual identity. Aamir had to give it one through his acting. That was a tough enough ask. Add to that the fact that Aamir is an actor  we all know most of the time what he emotes on the screen is not necessarily what he personally feels. A good actor, they say, never allows us to remember that he is faking. In a film when the audience immerse themselves in the story, the distinction between the character and the actor blurs  it perhaps is easier for an actor to get away with it. In a short ad film, where Aamir does not have the shield of a story or the guise of a character, the challenge is many times stiffer. Aamir excels.         
	Otherwise no one would believe him. Let alone buy the phone.       SHILOO CHATTOPADHYAY

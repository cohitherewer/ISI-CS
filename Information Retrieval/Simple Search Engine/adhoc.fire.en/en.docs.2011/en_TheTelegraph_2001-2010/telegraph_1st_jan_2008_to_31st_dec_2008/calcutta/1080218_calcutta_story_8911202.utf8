                      Fantastic world of art                    The paintings of Subhas Roy prove contrary to the popular idea that art imitates life. Imagination is the cornerstone of his creations. Having spent his formative years in Santiniketan, he was inspired and influenced by legendary artists Benode Behari Mukhopadhyay and Ramkinkar Baij. Fantasy World 08, the ongoing exhibition of his paintings, offers an insight into the workings of his imaginative mind. What is interesting in his works is the way in which he makes myth and reality combine effortlessly. Merging the fantastic and the scientific, the cheerful and the fearful, the frivolous and the serious, the sensual and the spiritual, Roy succeeds in depicting poignant images of human life that convey a subtle, yet clear message to the perceptive viewer.            Event: An exhibition of paintings by Subhas Roy

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The 11-year-old girl whose father lodged a police complaint against AMRI Hospital for allegedly stopping her treatment because of unpaid bills is in a critical condition.         
	Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or SLE, has affected Kiran Kajarias kidney, said T.S. Kuckrejja, the executive vice-president of the Salt Lake hospital. She is producing very little urine. Being on ventilator support for the last four days has made her condition very critical.         
	He added: She is being administered intravenous antibiotics, sedatives and drugs to maintain her blood pressure level. She is also undergoing blood transfusion.        
	The girls family has been informed about her condition. Kirans doctor Soumyabrata Acharya told us on Monday that she was bleeding from the nose. We are all shocked. She is so young, said Kirans cousin Anisha Begum.        
	SLE is a rare disease that causes the immune system to attack the bodys cells and tissues.        
	Kirans father Suchit, who is asthmatic and unable to work, had complained to the police on Sunday that the hospital authorities had not treated the girl for three days because the dues were not cleared. The treatment was resumed allegedly after police intervention.         
	The hospital authorities denied the allegation. At no stage did we threaten to stop treatment. We had only asked for the dues to be cleared, said Kuckrejja.        
	According to him, the total amount of dues touched Rs 1 lakh on Tuesday and Kirans relatives have only paid Rs 12,000. The girl was shifted from Marwari Relief Society Hospital to AMRI Hospital on April 25.

     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	More than 72 hours have elapsed but there is no clue yet to what had triggered the underground blast on Shakespeare Sarani.
    
	Police suspect the presence of a chemical compound as the blast cause, while state forensic experts are hinting at a leak in an underground gas pipe. 
    
	Experts from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) and IIT Kharagpur are waiting for their test results before suggesting a cause.
    
	It is pointless suggesting anything without carrying out the tests, said a senior CFSL official.
    
	IIT Kharagpur professor Panchanan Pramanik, who had collected samples from the blast site on Thursday, said: Tests are on and it would take us a day or two to say anything conclusive. But we can rule out the possibility of a gas leak.
    
	Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Jawed Shamim said: If forensic tests confirm a chemical compound had triggered the blast, it would be a matter of serious concern. The presence of a chemical compound underground cannot be a natural phenomenon. Someone must have planted it there.
    
	The blast around 9.45am on Wednesday had ripped through a pavement in front of the Hindustan Unilever building, tore into a tree and created a crater. 
    
	Four pedestrians were injured. Three of them were released from a private clinic on Thursday, while the fourth  Pijush Banerjee  is still under observation there. 
    
	We will decide after a week how to remove the foreign particles from his body, said an official of the clinic.

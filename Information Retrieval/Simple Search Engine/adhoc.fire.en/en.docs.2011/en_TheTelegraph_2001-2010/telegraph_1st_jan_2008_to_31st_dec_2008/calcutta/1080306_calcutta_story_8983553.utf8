                      Immigrant images                    In her photo-documentary project, The Americans, Gauri Gill takes a series of solitary journeys through the US, documenting the Indian diaspora as it has settled across the country in rural areas, small towns and big cities, retaining its traditional signifiers of Indian identity and merging within a larger American plurality. Addressing her subjects with the trans-national gaze of a travelling photographer, Gill pays tribute to the increasing tribe of the new Americans  Indian immigrants. The resulting colour photographs are simultaneously humorous, poignant, ironic and beguiling. Gills portrayal of her subjects and their lives emerges through her strict attention to detail and sympathetic juxtapositions.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Gauri Gill When: Till March 8; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Bose Pacia, Stephens Court, 18 Park Street

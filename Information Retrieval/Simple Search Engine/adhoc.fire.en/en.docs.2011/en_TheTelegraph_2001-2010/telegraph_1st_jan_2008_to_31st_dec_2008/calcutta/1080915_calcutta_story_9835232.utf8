                      In step with the times                    Arriving in Calcutta as a newly-wed in 1958, Guru Thankamani Kutty spent the next 10 years preparing the ground for setting up of an institution that could nurture and spread the essence of a classical dance form, at the same time evolving a unique style of her own. In 1968, she founded Kalamandalam Calcutta, which went on to become a leading academy of classical dance arts in eastern India, teaching dance forms like Bharata Natyam, Mohiniyattam and Kathakali. With the support of her husband, Kathakali exponent late Kalamandalam Govindan Kutty, she instilled in her students the ideals of spiritualism associated with classical dance forms, training many dancers who have now become successful artistes in their own right. This evenings programme celebrates 50 years of her stay in the city where she has dedicated her lifes work, inspiring and enthralling students and audiences as much with her performance as with her devotion to her craft. Beginning with a dance by senior students of Kalamandalam Calcutta and felicitation to the Guru, it features performances by some of her most well-known students Anita Mullick, Abhoy Pal, Debjani Majumder, Molly Roy and Anusua Banerjee. The programme ends with a classical dance presentation by Malabika Sen and artistes of Kalamandalam Performing Wing.

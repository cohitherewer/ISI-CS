  - Slo-mo manual operation at international airport          A STAFF REPORTER                          An aerobridge at Calcutta airport. A Telegraph picture                                        
	The only aerobridge at the international terminal of the city airport was pressed into service after more than a year on Wednesday night, only to be shut down within hours following a snag.        
	There was a problem with the visual docking guidance system (VDGS) of the aerobridge. Until the snag is fixed, it cannot be used on a regular basis, an airport official said on Thursday. The visual docking guidance system helps align the aerobridge with the door of an aircraft.        
	The moveable bridge, through which passengers walk into the aircraft from the terminal building or vice versa, was procured in 2007 and has been parked in bay No. 43 since. But the aerobridge could not be used because of a problem with the bay surface.         
	After the bay was resurfaced early this week, the authorities decided to operate the aerobridge on Wednesday night, during the landing of a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt. The technicians realised that the aerobridge could not be automatically aligned with the gate of the aircraft because of a snag in the VDGS.         
	The gadget then had to be adjusted manually, delaying the offloading of passengers by more than an hour and prompting the authorities to shut down operations again.        
	The fact that the international terminal has been functioning without an aerobridge for so long proves how far we are from achieving global standards, an airport official said.        
	In the absence of an aerobridge, passengers are ferried on buses. Visitors from abroad often cite the absence of an aerobridge as a major drawback of the airport.        
	The Calcutta airport has three other aerobridges, all of which are deployed in the domestic terminal.        
	Officials said they would try to operate the aerobridge manually on Thursday night. But manual operation restricts the capacity of the aerobridge to handling only one flight a day. Automation is a must, said a source.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Apology act in ragging row
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Bengal Engineering and Science University                                  
	The Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) authorities on Friday claimed that the six girls who were suspended on charges of ragging on Thursday and let off hours later have apologised for their conduct.        
	The accused, however, claimed that they were innocent and they had only expressed regret if their activities had offended anyone.        
	The suspension order was withdrawn within three hours on Thursday after students led by the Independents Consolidation (IC), which controls the undergraduate union on campus, started an indefinite sit-in in front of vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjeas office.        
	The universitys disciplinary committee, which is probing the complaint of ragging filed by two first-year girls of the information technology and computer science departments, cancelled Fridays meeting that was to decide on the fate of the accused.        
	Registrar Biman Bandopadhyay said the committee could not meet as the probe was still on.        
	The six girls have written to the vice-chancellor, apologising for their conduct. The letter prompted the authorities to withdraw the suspension. I hope the disciplinary committee will meet on Monday, said Bandopadhyay.        
	According to the rules, the vice-chancellor can suspend any student charged with ragging, pending an inquiry.        
	The girls from the civil engineering department accused of mental torture by the two freshers, denied the apology. We are innocent. Why should we submit an apology? Ninety per cent of the boarders of our hostel told the disciplinary committee that the charge of ragging was false. The freshers complaint was politically motivated, said one of the accused.        
	In our letter to the vice-chancellor, we expressed regret if anyone had been offended by our conduct, she added.        
	The SFI, arch rivals of the IC at the Shibpur institute, submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor, demanding the removal of Lt.-Col. A.K. Ghosh, the professor-in-charge of student activities, and Chaitali Roy, the superintendent of the hostel where the ragging row erupted. The student body accused the two of being partial towards the IC.        
	SFI leader Afazuddin Ahmed said: We are demanding stern action against students involved in ragging.

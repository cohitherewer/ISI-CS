                      Mystical realities                    The painterly world of Rini Dhumal is permeated by a serenity that compels attention. Her protagonists convey a deep sense of loss and foreboding through their watchful stillness and stoic forbearance. Dhumals sensitivity and inner vision enable her to reflect on the complex psyche in moment of trauma and sublimation. Charged by these insights, her work has a lyricism touched by pain and disenchantment. While her work does not concern itself with socio-political isms, her understanding of the numbing routines and rituals and the yearning of self renewal make Dhumal a perceptive storyteller, revealing underlying unpalatable truths of everyday happenings. In Of Mortal, Mythic and Divine, the ongoing show of her recent works, she represents divine and human figures, birds and beasts along with floral and mythic motifs, weaving them together into a pattern that recalls the iconography of engravings in religious art, murals and temple sculptures of ancient India. Her oil and mixed media works feature portraits of divinities, gods and goddesses, the Buddha and Buddhist monks, Hindu devotees or devotional singers, mythological figures of birds and lions, all evoked with an abandon of an artist who is deep into the mystique of reality.                  Event: An exhibition of recent works by Rini Dhumal When: Till December 20; 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Sanskriti, 5C Alipore Park Road

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Petitions against phase-out
  - Bus owners move high court          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          An old commercial vehicle that faces a government ban                                        
	Bus-owners organisations moved five petitions before the high court green bench on Friday seeking modification to the order upholding the environment departments decision to phase out 15-year-old commercial vehicles.         
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice D. Dutta admitted the petitions and asked the respondents to file affidavits within 10 days.        
	Moving the petition on behalf of Bengal Bus Syndicate, Minibus Operators Coordination Committee and other organisations, Ashok Banerjee argued that the environment authorities did not have the right to issue a notification banning commercial vehicles in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area from April 1, 2009.        
	The lawyer stated the transport department had issued a similar notification in 2005, intending to phase out old vehicles from January 1, 2007. But Justice J. Biswas of this court had set aside the notification as it was bad in law.         
	The lawyer claimed the life span of motor vehicles could only be fixed under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. But since the act is central legislation, only the Union government has the right to fix an age limit, said Banerjee.        
	Environment activist Subhas Dutta, on whose petition the court had passed the phase-out order, said: The court has the power to ask appropriate authorities to phase out old vehicles.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Wings on their feet
										      They are the sporty kind, but their passion is not cricket. The young basketball players of Don Bosco enjoy the game, but don rsquo;t want a career out of it                               Students of Don Bosco at a basketball practice session.

	It is four oclock on a summer afternoon. Ten boys run to get their hands on the ball. Class X student Nirmit Nevatia runs with it, Kevin Mok lunges at him in desperation, snatches the ball from under his nose and in one swift move, shoots it into the hoop. A triumphant cheer goes up from Kevins team as Nirmit looks on.         
	For the boys at Don Bosco School, Park Circus, basketball is a bit of a cult thing that everybody tries his hand at, some time or the other, though only a chosen few get to be on the elite school team that has a long line of success.         
	We consider the playground an important arena where characters are built, friendships forged, loyalty and team spirit developed, says Father Siby Joseph, the principal.        
	The school has a 34-year history of basketball. Until seven years ago, there was only one court. Recently another cobbled field was refurbished and made match-worthy.        
	The team won the YMCA Inter School Basketball championship and the state basketball Inter School Championship from 2002 to 2004 and in 2007. It held on to the Bosco Challenge Shield for 26 years. The team was also ranked sixth in the National School League organised by the Basketball Federation of India at Bangalore.        
	Being good at the game also meant dealing with reverse ostracism, recalls Bernard Lee, captain of the school team in 2007.         
	Many schools wouldnt invite us because we were too good. Thus we had to snatch an invitation at times, he laughs. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and Assembly of God Church are the toughest teams on the circuit, feels Kevin, who is part of the basketball squad .         
	The school has two teams  Under-13 for classes VI to VIII and Under-18 for classes IX to XII. From around 25 boys in both groups, a lucky 12 are selected for the final team. Nothing makes these players give up their two hours of practice after school on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturday mornings.         
	If you miss out on practice, you lose your touch and tend to become sloppy, says player Akshay Maheswari.         
	Following a proper diet is also important, as I realised after bingeing on junk food. I had developed an embarrassing paunch, says Nirmit, the school team captain.         
	Good infrastructure, including two giant basketball courts, open for students at all times during school hours and an excellent coach, have a big hand in their success, admits Kevin.         
	But none of the youngsters consider the game as anything more than a hobby. There is no future for the game here. It is not like the US, where a student can get a scholarship to the best university on the strength of his basketball credentials alone, says Class X student Raunak Kasera, who has played for the Under-13 Bengal team.

	Its only words                        Onomitra Khan of Beadon Street Shuvam receives his prize      
	There was no birthday cake for Sukumar Ray but a bouquet of 150 voices. That is how the Shishu Kishore Academy recently celebrated Sukumar Rays 101st birth anniversary at the Sisir Mancha on November 1.         
	The eight-hour programme (from noon to 8pm) had children from all over Calcutta and the districts expressing their views on Rays works and reciting his poems.         
	The children were divided into two groups. Those in group A (five to seven years) had to speak for five minutes on any poem by the maverick writer, while those in group B (eight to 10 years) had to speak on any of his stories.         
	Obhipsha Mukhopadhyay, a Class VI student of Vivekananda Mission School, topped group A with her explanation that Rays Shangihara, about a snobbish bird, was a lesson on tolerance and friendship. Oshmita Khan of Beadon Street Shuvam and Ranjabati Chakrabarty of Abriti Tirtho won the second and third position in the same group.         
	Debarati Chakravarty, a Class XI student of Bagbazar Multipurpose School, topped group B with her interpretation of the valuable tip to happiness in the story Dushtu Dorji. Dont be over-ambitious, trust in your own talents and always stick to the right path, she explained. Onomitra Khan of Beadon Street Shuvam and Arka Banerjee of Uttarpara Government School came second and third respectively from the group.        
	Jatiner Juto, was according to Arka, a warning for todays children, who are more familiar with the concept of use and throw, to take care of their things.         
	Those yearning for the fun element of Rays poems, had their fill in the second phase of the programme when children of all ages took to the stage to recite his famous nonsense rhymes. All participants received certificates and winners came away with books.

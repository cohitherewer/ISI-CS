										      Know your Minister                                          
	The city has given a new minister to the Centre  Congress-man and three-time Rajya Sabha member Santosh Bagrodia, who was sworn in as minister of state for coal on April 6. Though elected from Rajasthan, Bagrodia was born and brought up in a business family in Calcutta.        
	The family shifted to MG Road from Cossipore in 1945, when Bagrodia was just five years old. In 1966, they moved again to Ballygunge Circular Road, where they still have a house.        
	Bagrodia studied in St Xaviers College and fondly remembers bunking classes, hanging out at Flurys and playing table tennis. My favourite professor was the accountancy teacher, Professor Pinto. I also liked principal Father Joris. He was a strict disciplinarian and we were terrified of him, says the minister.        
	His fondest memories are of the period when he stayed on MG Road. The house had so many people that it was like having an entire village in a building. Thats the house where I spent my school life in and got married. Memories of Holi still bring a smile to his face.        
	His favourite restaurant was Skyroom. I loved the baked vegetable and the Baked Alaska there, says Bagrodia, a strict vegetarian. The Bengal Rowing Club is another favourite when it comes to grabbing a bite. I like having matar kachauri there and, of course, the phuchka.         
	Politics leaves little time for movies now but the minister, who visits Calcutta frequently, was once a regular at Globe, New Empire and Paradise.        
	His portfolio  coal  has brought him close to the city, Bagrodia claims. Coal has its headquarters in Calcutta though there are no mines here. I will see what I can do for the city.         
	Bagrodias wish list for a new-look Calcutta is long. I want the city to change faster. I wish the buildings could be painted to make them look brighter, the roads could be wider, there was walkable footpath available and the city was cleaner. When I was young, the streets used to be washed daily.        
	The 67-year-old has a simple reason for shifting base to Rajasthan. Regional sentiments are very strong in India. One has a stronger support in the place where one has his roots. The decision was not without pain. Of course, I was hurt. I was born and raised in Calcutta. But I am a practical man.

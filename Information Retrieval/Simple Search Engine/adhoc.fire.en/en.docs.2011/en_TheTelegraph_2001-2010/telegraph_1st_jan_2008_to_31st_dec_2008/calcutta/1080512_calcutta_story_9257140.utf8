                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Duo die over illicit affair
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A man and a woman ended their lives on Sunday morning, allegedly after their extramarital affair became public.        
	Sadhan Adhikary, 32, and Mina Biwi, 26, were found dead in the Barasat shop where they worked. A bottle of pesticide was found beside them.        
	Police said after a preliminary probe that the duo had consumed the poison on Saturday night.        
	The two came to know each other while working in the shop,said Joy Biswas, the sub-divisional police officer of Barasat. Sadhan, a resident of Baluria, in Barasat, was married a few years ago and had three children.        
	The duo developed a relationship which continued even after Mina was married off recently. A few residents of the area came to know about their affair and passed on the information to their respective families. They must have decided to end their lives following pressure from their families to part ways, said an investigating officer.        
	Mina had come to her parents house a few days ago. She had a fight with us over her illicit affair, after which she left home on the pretext of visiting a neighbourhood shop. She did not return at night. We got her death news the next morning, said a relative of Mina.        
	On Sunday morning, some residents saw the shutter of the shop half-closed. We became curious and went inside, only to find the bodies lying on the floor, said a resident.        
	Student suicide: Khuku Ghugu, 16, a resident of Ballys Anandanagar area, set herself ablaze around 7.30am on Sunday. She had sat for Madhyamik this year from Anandanagar Girls High School. Neighbours saw smoke coming out the window of her room and informed her mother, who was then at their vegetable shop a few yards away. No suicide note was found. Police sent the body for post-mortem.

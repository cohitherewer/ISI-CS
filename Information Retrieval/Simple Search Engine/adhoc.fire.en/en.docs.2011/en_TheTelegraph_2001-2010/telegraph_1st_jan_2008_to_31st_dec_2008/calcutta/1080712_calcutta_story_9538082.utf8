          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The conductor of a private bus pushed off a cardiac patient in his late 40s after he protested against reckless driving on Friday morning.        
	Palash Moitra lodged a complaint with Maidan police station and driver Madan Roy and conductor Tarun Haldar were arrested.        
	The duo have been charged with misbehaviour and wrongful confinement, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Moitra, a resident of Behalas Vidyasagar Sarani, boarded the bus on route SD 18 on his way to office on Free School Street.         
	The bus was being driven recklessly after it crossed Race Course. I protested but they did not pay any heed to it, Moitra wrote in his complaint.         
	He asked the conductor to stop the bus at the Mayo Road crossing where he gets down every day. But the conductor ignored my plea and the driver, instead, pressed on the accelerator to overtake another bus, the Food Corporation of India employee recalled.        
	The bus finally stopped at the Rani Rashmoni Avenue crossing. I told the conductor that I was a heart patient and would have problem walking the stretch back to the Mayo Road crossing.         
	Hearing this, the conductor and the driver started abusing him. The conductor later pushed him off the bus.

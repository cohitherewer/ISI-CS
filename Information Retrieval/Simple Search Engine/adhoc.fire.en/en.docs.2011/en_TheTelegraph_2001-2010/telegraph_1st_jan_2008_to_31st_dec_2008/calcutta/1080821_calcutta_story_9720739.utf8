The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rail services to be merged
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rail services to be merged
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The operations of Metro and Circular railways and the management of the East-West Metro project could be handed over to an autonomous body.        
	In a meeting with railway board chairman K.C. Jena last Monday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee agreed to a proposal from the railways to hand over the rail transit systems in the city to such a body.        
	The chief minister has agreed in principle to an autonomous body handling operations of the rail transit systems, said a senior official of the Eastern Railway on Wednesday.        
	Sources said Bhattacharjee directed senior government officials to work out the modalities in consultation with the railways.        
	The recently formed Calcutta Metro Rail Corporation (CMRC), which will construct and operate the East-West Metro, may be given the charge of operating the transit systems. Its role will be similar to that of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.         
	This is the idea of the Planning Commission and we have discussed the issue with the railway board. Once the East-West Metro Project is complete, we can work on the integration of the rail transit modes. The CMRC can manage the combined operations, said state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.        
	Currently, Eastern Railway operates Circular Railway trains. Metro Railway runs underground services from Dum Dum to Tollygunge. The route is likely to be extended to Garia by March. The East-West Metro, linking Howrah station with Salt Lake Sector V, is expected to be ready by 2014.        
	Once the services are integrated, a passenger using more than one transit mode for a journey will not need to buy separate tickets. In all metropolitan cities, transport systems are under one body, said a rail official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Drunk cop suspended
                                                                                                               Drunk cop suspended
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The antics of a sergeant on an evening out with his wife have led to his suspension.        
	Bimal Kumar Das, in his late 30s, allegedly screamed at his wife after dinner in a restaurant on EM Bypass and tried to hit its staff members on Sunday. The Ultadanga police station officer was too drunk to stand straight, witnesses said.         
	Officers of Parama Investigation Centre stated in a report submitted to the police station that Das started quarrelling with his wife and shouting at the top of his voice after coming out of the restaurant around 11.30pm.        
	He shooed away those who tried to pacify him and even attempted to hit the restaurant employees when they told him that they were calling the police.        
	It was quite a scene. The man just refused to calm down. He abused guests and even those outside the restaurant. We had to call the police, said an employee of the restaurant.        
	Das revealed that he was a policeman at Parama Investigation Centre, prompting the officers there to inform their counterparts in Calcutta police. Based on preliminary findings, the sergeant was suspended on Monday.        
	It is difficult to go into the details of the case; all we can say is that his behaviour was unbecoming of a Calcutta police officer. Even if you are not on duty and not in uniform, you are expected to carry yourself in a manner that upholds the dignity of the force, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyel.

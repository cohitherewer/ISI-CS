	The blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad have triggered a flurry of security activity in the city involving top cops and officials of the state home department.         
	Following an alert from the Union home ministry, the state administration has decided to throw a security ring around key installations, especially malls and multiplexes.        
	The alert identifies malls and multiplexes as probable terror targets. We have been asked to boost security in these places, said a police officer.         
	On Sunday afternoon, home secretary Ashoke Mohan Chakrabarti, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and the director general of police, A.B. Bhora, held a meeting with the mall authorities in Lalbazar.         
	We recommended a string of security beef-up measures to the mall officials. Following the blasts on two consecutive days, all of us have to be very cautious, said the home secretary.         
	South City Mall has already organised special training sessions for its guards and decided to increase their number by 10 to 15 per cent. Metal detectors will soon be installed. The beef-up covers the parking area as well, said Sanjeev Mehra, the vice-president (mall operations) of South City Mall.        
	Asoke Biswas, the additional superintendent of North 24-Parganas police, asked the malls and amusement parks in and around Salt Lake to upgrade their security.         
	The airport and railway stations, too, have been under the scanner since Saturday night. On Sunday, the airport and the stations had 30 per cent more security personnel than on other days.         
	A police post has been set up at the entry to the airport where all vehicles are being checked. Six persons have been arrested outside the terminal buildings on suspicion. Around 250 bicycles and 60 motorcycles that were parked illegally have been confiscated.        
	Inside the terminal buildings, the number of CISF personnel has been augmented, said senior commandant K.N. Tripathi. Sniffer dogs have been deployed and members of the quick reaction team posted at strategic points. A special squad is keeping a watch inside the terminals.         
	At Howrah and Sealdah stations, anti-sabotage checking is being conducted jointly by the Railway Protection Force and Government Railway Police.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Rally to hold up traffic
  - Leave home early to catch train, says Front chairman          OUR BUREAU                                     
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has spoken out against bandhs but he cannot stop the city from being paralysed even without a bandh call.         
	On Monday, the whos who of the red brigade will bring the heart of the city to a standstill in the afternoon to raise their voice against imperialism. The Left Front rally is held every year on September 1.        
	Thousands of people from across the city and the districts will assemble at Park Circus Maidan, from where they will set out for Deshbandhu Park in Shyambazar at 1pm. The effect on traffic is likely to be felt till at least 6pm.         
	We will try to ensure that vehicles carrying patients and students are not stopped, said Left Front chairman Biman Bose.        
	He requested people with trains and planes to catch to leave home early. One side of the road will be open.         
	Schools like St Xaviers, Don Bosco Park Circus and Mahadevi Birla Girls have, however, declared a holiday on Monday to make sure students arent inconvenienced. Other schools are giving over early or have adopted the wait-and-watch policy.         
	We will be working on Thursday to make up for the lost day, said Melvin D Souza, a senior co-ordinator at St Xaviers.         
	Junior section classes at St James will end at 10.30am instead of 1.20pm, said the senior master S.K. Mundul.         
	Shri Shikshayatan School will close over three-and-a-half-hours early at 11.45am. Calcutta Girls and Loreto Sealdah have declared a half-day.         
	We cant declare a holiday. Why should those who stay nearby have to miss classes? asked Sangita Mondal, a teacher at Loreto Sealdah.        
	Modern High, though near the rally route, will stay open, as will La Martiniere for girls and boys. We dont know what the attendance will be like,, said Modern High principal Devi Kar. South Point High School will stick to the normal schedule.         
	There will be more than 3,000 policemen on road. Their primary job will be to keep an eye on law and order and clear the path for the rally, said a senior Lalbazar officer.        
	Roads leading to Sealdah, Howrah, Shyambazar and Moulali will be used by the participants to reach Park Circus. Entering the city from the airport, Salt Lake and the fringe areas will be tough, said special additional commissioner (traffic) Ranveer Kumar.        
	Snarls are likely on roads where the supporters will park their vehicles. Hundreds of vehicles will be parked on BT Road, Galiff Street, Bhupen Bose Avenue and APC Roy Road, said an officer.

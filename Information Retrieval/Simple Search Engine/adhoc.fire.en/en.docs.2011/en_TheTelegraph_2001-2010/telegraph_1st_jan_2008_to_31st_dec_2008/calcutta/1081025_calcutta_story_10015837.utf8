                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Heavy rain alert for weekend
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Met office on Friday warned of heavy rain in parts of the city in the next 48 hours.        
	A low pressure over the west-central Bay of Bengal is likely to intensify into a depression over the weekend, causing cloud cover and rain.        
	The showers will bring down the temperature, though the weatherman has ruled out an early winter.        
	Under the influence of the atmospheric system, some parts of the city and their adjoining areas and the coastal districts may receive heavy rainfall in the next 48 hours. Maximum temperature is likely to drop but there is no chance of early onset of winter, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The weather has been dry  with the maximum temperature rising to 34 degrees Celsius  since the monsoon withdrew from the state on October 13.        
	The maximum temperature started dropping from Thursday. Today it was 29.3 degrees, two degrees below normal. The temperature is likely to drop further over the next two days, a Met official said.        
	The minimum temperature, however, is unlikely to drop as the sky will remain cloudy.         
	Fridays minimum temperature was 25.6 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal.        
	The Met office has also issued a rain warning for East and West Midnapore, Howrah, Hooghly, and North and South 24-Parganas.         
	The sea may be choppy. Winds at 45 km per hour are likely to lash the Bengal coast, said an official.

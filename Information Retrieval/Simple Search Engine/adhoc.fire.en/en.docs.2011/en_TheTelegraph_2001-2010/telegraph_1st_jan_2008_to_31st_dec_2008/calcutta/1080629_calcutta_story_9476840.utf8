	Only 50km from Calcutta, Halisahar is known for Sadhak Ramprasads Kali temple. But this small town in North 24-Parganas, which dates back several centuries, has much more to offer.        
	Halisahar became prominent as a port and shipyard during the rule of the Pala dynasty. Under the Senas, it developed into a trade hub. The Muslim and British rule saw culture and Sanskrit education flourish in the town. In more modern times, a number of jute and paper mills were set up there.        
	Rani Rashmoni, Rajib Lochan Roy, who lost his life in 1857 revolt, and Bipin Behari Ganguly are some of prominent people born in Halisahar.        
	Foreign ships continued to dock in Halisahar when the British were in power. East India Company exported indigo, rice, cotton and jute through the port. There is now a beautiful park near it, offering a panoramic view of the river.         
	A stone Ganesha idol with four hands was found in the Dangapara area of the town. It was probably sculpted between 12th and 13th Century. Another old statue of Buddha was found in Baruipara-Somdighi.        
	The Kali temple was founded in the 17th Century with financial help from the local zamindar and pundits. The municipality has renovated the temple.

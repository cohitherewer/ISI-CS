          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A computer science student in Delhi has been arrested for creating a false profile of a Calcutta girl on the social networking site Orkut, leading to the victim being deluged by indecent proposals.        
	A team from Calcutta polices detective department travelled to the capital to arrest Pawan Madhukar, 29, on the charge of stealing the girls personal details from her real Orkut profile and creating a second one with her face superimposed on obscene pictures.        
	Deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Jawed Shamim said the team seized the hard disk of Pawans personal computer during a raid on his Vasant Vihar house on Thursday. He will be brought to Calcutta after the completion of legal formalities.        
	The cyber crime wing of the detective department had been on Pawans trail for two months. The 20-year-old girl (name withheld on request) had gone to Lalbazar in February to file the complaint.         
	She had created her own Orkut profile last year with photographs and mentioned her personal details, including her cellphone number. The girl was shattered when she saw a second profile with her name in the web portal and obscene pictures in the album, an official said.        
	The police immediately contacted the Orkut administrators and requested them to block the fake profile. They responded to our request. Our officers then traced the IP (Internet Protocol) address of Pawans computer and the telecom service provider he was subscribing to, the official said.        
	Pawan initially denied he was responsible for the girls false profile, saying someone might have framed him. But when our experts saw the contents of the hard disk of his personal computer, they were sure that it was Pawan who had committed the crime.        
	Shamim said proving Pawan guilty in a court of law would not be difficult. In this case, we do not need any witness. The hard disk is enough to put him behind bars for two years.

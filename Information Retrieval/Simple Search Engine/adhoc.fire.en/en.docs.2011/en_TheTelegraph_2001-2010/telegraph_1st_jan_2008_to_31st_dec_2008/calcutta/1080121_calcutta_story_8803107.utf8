     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	The Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIMC) is looking beyond its flagship two-year postgraduate programme and gearing up to add more seats to its doctoral programme and one-year postgraduate programme for executives.
    
	We are planning to double the number of doctoral students to 20 from the 2008-2009 academic year, said director Shekhar Chaudhuri.
    
	A parliamentary panel that visited the IIMC campus on Friday had asked the institute authorities to boost the doctoral programme.
    
	According to Chaudhuri, the doctoral programme will not only improve research, but also play a crucial role in developing case studies and new models of managing enterprises. We are focussing on making the doctoral programme more attractive, he added.
    
	The plan for the doctoral programme includes increasing the stipend, providing dedicated space for research and accommodating more students families on the campus.
    
	The institute also intends to increase the number of seats in the postgraduate programme for executives from 40 to 120 in the next two years. The response to this programme for executives is encouraging and we are looking at phased expansion, said Chaudhuri. 
    
	IIMC is also recruiting more faculty for the marketing course in order to strengthen it, said a source.

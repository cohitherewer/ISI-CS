The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stark, poetic cityscape
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Stark, poetic cityscape
                              A photograph by Shahid Datawala                            
	Photographers should take heart from the fact that two city galleries are holding exhibitions of photographs. K2 is doing so for the first time and Seagull (on Satish Mukherjee Road) has mounted a splendid exhibition of Shahid Datawalas stark but poetic urbanscapes.         
	Datawalas black-and-white photographs are all about angles, textures and volumes, and some of these have such a tangible, tactile quality, like the photograph of peeling paint, that the process of degeneration of a structure becomes a visible reality.         
	Datawalas lens scales the vertiginous heights of buildings along with hawks, and focuses on an art deco building with wooded parkland behind it. He explores abandoned building projects whose concrete shapes take on a sculpturesque quality.               
	The K2 exhibition is more of a mixed bag. Ritendra Roys plants are amateurish and Shankar Sridhars colourful Tibetan monks belong to the National Geographic genre. Amit Dattas child running in an alley has possibilities but the print is too small. Suman Dattas windows is well composed. Indranil Ghoshs black-and-white photograph of the old woman sitting before a clay image with a cat passing by is quietly compelling.               
	Painting in the so-called photo-realist style has become a trend among Indian artists for the past few years. And as his current exhibition at the Seagull Media Centre proves, Delhi-based Roy Thomas, who is originally from Kerala, is no exception. He culls images from the media and paints tiny creatures and martial arts performers over them in his bid to add another dimension. Whether he is successful or not is debatable.                    SOUMITRA DAS

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Excursions, camping trips, day trips and learning by doing are fast becoming the guiding principles of city-based schools.        
	The schools are organising overnight excursions and field trips to help students from classes III to XII learn their subjects better.        
	There is a lot that one can learn from outdoor trips that is not possible in class. Which is why it makes it necessary for schools to allow students to go out and learn, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls High School.        
	Apart from Mahadevi Birla, Ballygunge Siksha Sadan, Birla High School for Boys and Shri Shikshayatan are among the institutions that are organising annual trips for their students to places of historical, geographical or even environmental importance.        
	Earlier, school trips were limited to picnics at the zoo or the botanical garden for younger students and some factories and places of historical importance in and around the city for seniors.        
	The concept of outdoor education has not caught on because of bad planning by schools and overprotective parents who prevail on the institutions not to organise such trips, said Ranjan Biswas, the managing director of Trailblazers India, which organises educational trips and camps for schools.        
	Experts admit that convincing parents to allow their children to join trips is always difficult. But transparency, better planning and involving parents in organising the trips make the process easier, said an expert.        
	Parents are usually hesitant about sending their children to long trips, fearing about their safety. But they are opening up to the idea of late, said Sharada Narayanaswami, the principal of Shri Shikshayatan school.        
	So, instead of day excursions, schools are now organising two-night-three-day trips or even weeklong outings, during which students learn through simulations, demonstrations, games, and interactions with the local people.        
	So while Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society School is planning a trip to Kerala, the girls of Mahadevi Birla have just come back from the Araku Valley.        
	Mahadevi Birla is even planning a trip to Egypt for students of classes IX to XII.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A key equipment went out of order at the airport for two-and-a-half-hours on Thursday night, making it difficult for the short-staffed Air Traffic Control (ATC) to monitor overflying aircraft.         
	The Flight Data Processing System (FDPS), which provides information about a flights route, direction, altitude and other technical details to an ATC two hours before it enters the flight information region concerned, was down from 11.40pm on Thursday to about 2am on Friday.        
	The information by FDPS is vital to maintain proper separation between aircraft. Planes change altitude based on the data, said an ATC official.        
	It is becoming difficult to work in the night shift because of shortage of officials qualified to handle radar operations. Added to this, there is malfunctioning of equipment. These issues need to be addressed immediately, added the official.        
	On Thursday night, the ATC officials had to prepare the flight progress information manually. This did not delay flight operation. But with such a huge number of overflying planes, things could have gone haywire, said another official.        
	A senior official of the Airports Authority of India, however, said it was a minor problem which was solved.        
	During each night shift, the ATC has to handle more than 500 overflying flights and nearly 100 planes landing in and taking off from the city.        
	Since June 23, the ATC officials at the airport are not working extra night shifts to protest transfer of trained ATC personnel.

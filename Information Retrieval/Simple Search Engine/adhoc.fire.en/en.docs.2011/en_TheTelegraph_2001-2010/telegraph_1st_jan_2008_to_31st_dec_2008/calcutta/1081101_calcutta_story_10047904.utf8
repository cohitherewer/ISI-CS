                Putul Gagoi, 53, a resident of Assam, and Ram Gopal Kankani, 35, a trader in Burrabazar, were arrested on Thursday night for their alleged links with a currency racket in the city. Gagoi was arrested in Kidderpore after he gave fake notes to a garment shop owner in Five Star Market. The shop owner found the paper and print of the Rs 500 notes to be of inferior quality and informed the police. Ninety-nine fake notes of Rs 500 denomination were seized from him. Gagoi said Kankani had given him the notes. We are trying to find out if Gagoi has links with any currency racket in the Northeast, police said.

	Calcutta on Wednesday received its first hailstorm of the year, which brought down the minimum temperature by four degrees. The Met office said the sky is expected to clear on Thursday, with possibility of a further dip in the minimum temperature.        
	The minimum temperature in the city on Wednesday was 17.1 degrees Celsius, which is normal, but four degrees below the minimum temperature on Tuesday.        
	We expect fair weather tomorrow. The next 48 hours are expected to be pleasant, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The hail that fell in Alipore was 7 mm in diameter, added Debnath. The Met office recorded 10 mm of rain in 24 hours from 8.30pm on Tuesday.        
	Met officials said a cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) had formed over central Bengal on Monday, leading to incursion of moisture from the Bay and development of rain clouds.        
	The cyclonic circulation showed signs of shifting towards the east-north-east. The clouds are expected to move away from the city on Thursday, said a Met official.        
	According to the weatherman, there is little chance of a sharp drop in minimum temperature over the next few days. However, the rains have brought down the minimum temperature by several degrees since Tuesday, said the Met official.        
	In many parts of the city, the morning rain was accompanied by gusts of wind from the south-west, and hail.        
	Apart from Calcutta, there was moderate rain in North 24-Parganas, East Midnapore and Nadia.

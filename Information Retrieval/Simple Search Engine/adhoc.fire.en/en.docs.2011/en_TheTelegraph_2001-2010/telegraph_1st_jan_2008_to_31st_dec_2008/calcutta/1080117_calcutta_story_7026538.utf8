	The Nandaram Market complex fire was brought completely under control on Wednesday morning, more than 100 hours after it broke out.
    
	For the first time since the blaze started at 1am on Saturday, a team from the state fire and emergency services went up to the 13th floor of Nandaram around 8.30am on Wednesday.
    
	Now we can say the situation is completely under control. It has taken us five days to douse the blaze, said fire services director D.P. Biswas.
    
	It was around 7.30pm on Tuesday when the term fire under control was first used in the internal communication of the firemen. The official declaration came at 10.01pm.
    
	But pocket fires could still be spotted in parts of the building throughout the night, keeping the fire-fighters busy.
    
	On Wednesday morning, neither flame nor fume could be seen. There are now only six tenders around the building. By tomorrow, the figure will drop further, said Biswas. The 54-metre hydraulic ladder of the fire department was also removed during the day.
    
	The battle with the blaze finally over, the firemen are now directing their efforts at cooling the building. There is still tremendous heat inside. We need to spray water on the building for the next few days to bring down the temperature, said a fire department official.
    
	The department has allowed traders to climb up to the fifth floor of Nandaram Market to assess their shops and godowns. It will take at least a week for the entire building to become accessible, the officer said.
    
	As for Kashiram, he said: Since the extent of damage there is greater than in Nandaram, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation will decide when the traders can be allowed in.

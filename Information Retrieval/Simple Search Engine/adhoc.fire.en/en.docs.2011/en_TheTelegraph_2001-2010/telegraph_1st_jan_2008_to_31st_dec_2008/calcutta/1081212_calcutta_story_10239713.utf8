          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Anand Singh, alias Abbas Ali, who was arrested for stealing a taxi last week, was found on Thursday to be the killer of a BJP leader in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Anand had fled a Ghazipur jail in Uttar Pradesh while the murder trial was on.        
	Anand was arrested on December 7 for robbing a taxi driver and hijacking his vehicle. He was living in Nadial, on the southern fringes of the city, with a new name  Abbas Ali, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.         
	On Thursday, the 23-year-old allegedly told the sleuths that he, along with two of his brothers, had shot BJP district leader Sarabjit Singh in May 2007 over a land dispute. The trio were arrested and lodged in Ghazipur jail.        
	Four cases of extortion and kidnapping are also pending against Anand in Uttar Pradesh, sleuths have learnt.         
	We have sent a message to our counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, said Shamim.        
	Anand escaped from jail on March 22 and went to Mumbai. He came to Nadial with a bar dancer and rented a room pretending to be a family man. The woman, however, left after a week, said an officer.        
	Anand began developing his underworld connections in Nadial, the officer added.        
	On December 7, he and his associate, Irfan Ali, hailed a taxi and asked driver Imtiaz Alam to go to the airport.        
	Near the Taratala crossing, the duo bashed up Alam and snatched Rs 1,800 from him, pushing him out of the vehicle and sped off.         
	While probing the incident, sleuths picked up Anand. The taxi and money were recovered, said an officer.        
	Shamim said a Uttar Pradesh police team would visit the city to question Anand.

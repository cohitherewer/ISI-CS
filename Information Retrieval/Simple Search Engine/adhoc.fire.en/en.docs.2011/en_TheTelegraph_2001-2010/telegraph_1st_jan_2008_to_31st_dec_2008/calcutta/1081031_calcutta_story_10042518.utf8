                      Stitching stories                    An exotic fabric embellishment technique, Indian embroidery has a rich heritage that recalls the romance, mystique and magic of the Middle Ages. Traditionally used to decorate items of attire, embroidery involves delicate, yet dense stitching on designs drawn on the fabric. Embroidery may also use other materials such as metal strips, pearls, beads, quills and sequins. This intricate method of creating beautiful designs on cloth has been transformed into an unconventional form of art by Rita Rakshit. From a very young age, she began depicting pictures stories with needle and thread, creating an amazing likeness to paintings done on canvas. Her subjects include landscapes, portraits and figurative works, which she creates through a laborious, painstaking process. Different Approach, the ongoing solo show of her works, mainly depicts scenes from rustic life, legend or folklore, and is a colourful testimony to her creative spirit.                    lEvent: An exhibition of embroidered works by Rita Rakshit lWhen: Till November 5 (except Sunday); 2 pm - 7 pm lWhere: Artists Circle, 46 Circus Avenue

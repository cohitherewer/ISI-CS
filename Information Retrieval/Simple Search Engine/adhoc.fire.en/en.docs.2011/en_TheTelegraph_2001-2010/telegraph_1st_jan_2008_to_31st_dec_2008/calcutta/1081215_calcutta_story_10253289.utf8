                A fire broke out on the ground floor of AMRI Hospital in Dhakuria on Sunday morning causing panic among employees and patients. Around 12.30pm, thick black fumes filled up the entire ground floor and started to drift into the floors above. Two tenders rushed to the spot and brought the fire under control after an hour. Since the entire hospital is air-conditioned, the smoke and fumes stayed. Firemen had to break some windows to clear the fumes. A short-circuit in the main meter box might have caused the blaze, said a fire brigade official. No one was injured.

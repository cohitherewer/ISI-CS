                Actor Soumitra Chatterjee, who suffered a left ventricular failure in Siliguri on Wednesday night, was brought to Calcutta by air on Thursday afternoon. His condition was stable and he was brought home. Chatterjee was in Siliguri to perform at the Vodafone Odeon Theatre Festival, organised in association with t2.    Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim would give his ruling on December 1 on the formation of a special committee to inquire into Trinamul Congress MLA Javed Khans role in the Rizwanur Rahman case. CPM MLA Rabin Mondal had written to Halim requesting him to constitute a special committee to probe if Khan had tarnished the image of the House by getting involved in the Rizwanur Rahman case.    Flight services between Calcutta and Bangkok continued to be suspended for the second consecutive day on Thursday. Jet officials said the flights would be cancelled till November 29 because the Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok was closed for operations.    Ten persons, including five monks of Bharat Sevashram Sangha, were injured on Rashbehari Avenue on Thursday after some residents of a nearby slum threw stones at them. Swami Biswatmananda, the chief co-ordinator of the Sangha, said the monks were attacked without any provocation.    Officials investing the felling of trees in the Botanic Garden raided two sawmills at Nazirgunge, Howrah, on Thursday and seized two trucks full of tree trunks. One of the sawmills was sealed. Officials suspect the trunks are of the trees chopped off in the garden.

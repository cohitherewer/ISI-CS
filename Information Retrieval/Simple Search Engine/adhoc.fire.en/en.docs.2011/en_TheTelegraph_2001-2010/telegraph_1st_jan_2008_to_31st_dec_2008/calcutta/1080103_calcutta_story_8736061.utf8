                                                                                                            Fake LPG kits: cheap but deadly 
          OUR BUREAU                          The car with a fake LPG kit that went up in flames on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	A day after a car powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) went up in flames near Alipore zoo, experts said the kit installed in the Maruti Omni was a fake.        
	The explosion caused by the alleged gas leak reduced the car to rubble and endangered the lives of Gopal Pramanik and family. The residents of Bongaon had hired the vehicle for a joyride into town on New Years Day. At 1.50pm, the eight passengers barely managed to scramble out before the car exploded.        
	The biggest casualty was Pramaniks daughter Ria, 7. She fell while scrambling out of the car and hurt her throat. An X-ray confirmed a rupture, said her father.        
	The cause, said automobile expert S.M. Ghosh, was a fake LPG kit. After inspecting the car on Wednesday, Ghosh said: This was one among the 2,000-odd cars running on fake LPG kits in and around the city.        
	A Metro lowdown on LPG as car fuel        
	What is LPG?        
	LPG is commonly used as cooking fuel. It can be used in the liquid and gaseous forms.        
	Why is it used as car fuel?        
	It is a clean fuel, with emission levels significantly lower than petrol or diesel-driven cars. It is 35 per cent (approx) cheaper than petrol. Mileage, though, dips by around 10 per cent.        
	Is it legal?        
	The use of LPG as automobile fuel became legal in India from April 24, 2000. Safety terms and conditions prescribed by the Automotive Research Association of India must be followed.        
	Is it safe?        
	Vehicles run with proper LPG kits are safe, thanks to a multi-dimensional safety valve and auto-shut system in case of a gas leak or accident.        
	What is a fake LPG kit?        
	One that is not authorised by the motor vehicles department. The fitter of the kit does not have government certification. There is no quality control over these kits.        
	Why is it popular?        
	The price point  a fake LPG kit costs Rs 10,000-14,000; the real one costs Rs 18,000-22,000.        
	What is the danger?        
	Ask the Pramanik family. With fake/faulty multi-dimensional safety valve and auto-shut mechanism, the car can blow up in the case of a gas leak or accidents.        
	Whose responsibility is it to check fake LPG kits?        
	The public vehicles department and police. Complaints against fake LPG kits can be lodged with public vehicles department (22145455) or traffic control room (22143644).

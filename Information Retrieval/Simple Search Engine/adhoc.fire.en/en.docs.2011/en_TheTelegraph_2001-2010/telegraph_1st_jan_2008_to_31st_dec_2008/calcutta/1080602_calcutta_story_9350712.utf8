                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kidnap slur on spurned suitor

	A Bally college girl who had spurned the advances of a youth from the same locality was allegedly kidnapped by her suitor early on Sunday.         
	The family of Pragya Jha, a second-year B.Com student of Ballys Lalbaba College, named Anil Rajak as the kidnapper in a complaint with Bally police station. Anil, the girls father said, was a goon who would torment his daughter whenever she stepped out.        
	Pragya woke up around 4.30am on Sunday to study for her examinations and went to fetch water from a tubewell just outside the boundary wall of her home at Purbo Sapuipara, in Chandmari, when the youth allegedly whisked her away.        
	Anils mother, Jhuma Devi, contested the allegation and said Pragya had long been in a relationship with her son. There is no question of Anil kidnapping Pragya. I am confident that if she is with him, it is with her consent.         
	Pragyas mother was the first to suspect something was amiss when she did not return home 15 minutes after going out of the gate to fetch water. Sudha Devi immediately woke up her husband Baidyanath Jha, an employee of National Iron and Steel Company, and son Prakash.         
	The duo searched the neighbourhood and visited the homes of some relatives and her friends, but Pragya was not to be found. They went to the police station after that.        
	We have received a complaint from the girls family and the investigation has begun, but nobody has been arrested yet, a senior police officer said.        
	In one of his alleged romantic stunts 10 days ago, Anil accosted Pragya, gave her a pistol and asked her to shoot him if she did not love him.

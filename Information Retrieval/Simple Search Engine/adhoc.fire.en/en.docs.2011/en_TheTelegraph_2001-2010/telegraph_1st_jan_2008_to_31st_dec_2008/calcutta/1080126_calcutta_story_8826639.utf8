	Mercedes Benz rolled out its new-generation C-Class in Calcutta on Friday, barely 15 days after it was unveiled at the 9th Auto Expo in New Delhi. DaimlerChryslers best-selling entry model now has a host of new safety and luxury features for the same price as its old model and has already posted 15 bookings from the east. 
    
	Speaking at the launch at ITC Sonar Kolkata, Sanjiv Sahajwala, the director (sales and marketing) of DaimlerChrysler India, said: Mercedes has posted a growth of 18 per cent in India in 2007-08. The eastern segment contributed a sale of 71 units, a 13 per cent growth over last year. Interkrafts, the sole Merc dealer in India, sold 19 units of the old C-Class last year. 
    
	Hiteshwar Singh, the CEO of Interkrafts said: The sales of the old C-Class were somewhat dampened by the news of the launch. Of the 71 Mercs sold in Calcutta, 28 are E-Class, 14 the flagship S-Class and 10 CBUs that include the M, the SLK and the CLS, said Singh.
    
	The small Merc, as the C-Class is popularly known, reflects the modern Mercedes design idiom of elegance and aggression with larger dimensions leading to more front shoulder room. Available in two-litre petrol and 2.2-litre diesel, the four-cylinder engines generate 10 and 20 per cent higher torque. The model will have six-speed manual and auto transmissions. 
    
	The interiors have twin-tone leather upholstery with iPod and bluetooth connectivity. Safety features from the S Class, including a speed-sensitive suspension and steering, have been introduced here. 
    
	All this comes for a neat Rs 25,19,128 for the C200 Kompressor (petrol) and Rs 28,03,879 for the C220 CDI (diesel)  all prices ex-showroom, Calcutta  a tad cheaper than its nearest rival, the BMW 320i, priced at Rs 26,70,000 (ex-showroom) that will roll out in Calcutta by June this year.

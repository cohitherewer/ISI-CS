                      Cinema stories                    One of Indias most influential film critics and film historians, Chidananda Das Gupta has been writing on cinema since 1946. Seeing is Believing, his book of informed and thought-provoking essays, is a fascinating survey of the journey of Indian cinema over the last six decades. This evening, Penguin Books India and Crossword host the launch of the book, along with a panel discussion on How Indian is Indian Cinema? to mark the event. Participants: Gautam Ghose, S.V. Raman, Ashoke Vishwanathan and Ananya C. Chakraborti. Moderator: Samik Bandyopadhyay. Aparna Sen will introduce the panel.                  Relevant to todays war-torn world, The Palace of Illusions takes readers back to a time that is part-history, part-myth, and wholly magical. Narrated by Panchaali, the wife of the Pandava brothers in The Mahabharata, the novel offers a rare feminist interpretation of an epic tale. It presents Panchaali as a fiery female, who redefines for us a world of warriors, gods and the ever-manipulating hands of fate. This evening, its author Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni will take part in an interactive session on the book with Dr Sanjukta Dasgupta, who will read excerpts from it.

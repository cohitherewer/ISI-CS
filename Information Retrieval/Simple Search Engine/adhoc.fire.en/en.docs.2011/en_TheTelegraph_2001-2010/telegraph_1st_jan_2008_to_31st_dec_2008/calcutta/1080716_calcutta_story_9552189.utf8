                      Priceless gem of love                    Based on a legend from the Mahabharata, Saradindu Bandyopadhyays Monikahini tells an enchanting tale about the innocence and bravery of youth. Satrajit, a poor farmer, became rich after he found the precious Syamantak gemstone. But he always lived in fear that someone would steal it. When Lord Krishna arrived at his palace, he secretly had the gem sent out of the country for fear that his guest might steal it. However, the gem was lost in an accident and was ultimately recovered by Lord Krishna, who fell in love with Satrajits daughter Satyabhama and eventually married her. Performed entirely by child actors, the play is embellished with verse, music and dance, with parodied songs of Bengali music bands as its background score. Script, music and direction: Suranjana Dasgupta.

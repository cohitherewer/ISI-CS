	The warm spell over the past few days took a break on Tuesday, with the minimum temperature dropping to 15.1 degrees Celsius. On Monday, the minimum temperature was 21.3 degrees Celsius.
    
	We expect little change in weather on Wednesday, said G.C. Debnath, the director of Regional Meteorological Centre, in Alipore. He attributed the sharp drop in temperature to some sudden changes in the atmospheric condition.
    
	The anti-cyclonic circulation (clockwise movement of air) over the Bay of Bengal, that had been sucking in moisture, weakened on Monday night. Along with it, a cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) over north Bengal has shifted to the east.
    
	Under the combined effect of the two, very little moisture came in from the sea over the past few hours and the sky cleared. Moreover, from Monday night, the North Wind was blowing in strongly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. All these have led to the drop in the minimum temperature, explained Debnath. 
    
	Asked whether it would be cool in the next few days, Debnath said: Its very difficult to predict now.
    
	The minimum temperature in Calcutta started rising from January 18. On Monday, it shot up to 21.3 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above normal.
    
	Warm and moist air was blowing in from the sea, resulting in cloud formation and a rise in the temperature, said an official.
    
	The Met office predicted that the sky over the districts would remain cloudy on Wednesday.

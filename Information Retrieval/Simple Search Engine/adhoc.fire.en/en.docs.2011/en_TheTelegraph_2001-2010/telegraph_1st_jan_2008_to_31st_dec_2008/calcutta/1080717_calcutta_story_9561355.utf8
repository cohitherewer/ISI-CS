	It was a pitched battle as 16 students locked horns over the topic The womens reservation bill is a threat to male dominance, at the eastern zonal finals of the ninth inter- institutional L N Birla Memorial debate, held on July 11 at the Vidya Mandir auditorium.         
	A preliminary round was held the previous day and seven schools, from the participating 20, reached the finals.         
	With topics ranging from senile social adaptation to pan-national governance, students blended anecdotes with statistics to prove their stand.         
	The contest started with Ranjan Mitter of IIM Calcutta speaking about todays youth culture, and how GeNext can participate in nation building.         
	Anushka Sen of Modern High School, speaking for the motion, used an analogy from Gone with the Wind. She explained how Scarlet OHara improved business returns after her husband failed to do so in his entrepreneurial ventures. She also spoke about the lack of opportunities given to women in a male-dominated society.         
	Sahana Srinivasan from the same school retorted with the example of Adam and Eve, painting a picture of equality and justice between both sexes since time immemorial. The girls from Birla High School mentioned politicians like Indira Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee and Jayalalitha who overcame hurdles in a male-dominated world to hold fort.         
	The proposed 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament was a hot topic of contention among students. Arpit Banerjee of Birla High School for Boys began with a self-composed ditty, Kyunki beti hamari MP banegi, going on to suggest that a pro -womens bill politician would prioritise issues like dowry and foeticide.         
	Avilash Patil from La Martiniere School for Boys bagged the runners-up position while Wamika Mimani from Ashok Hall emerged the best speaker. Both the speakers have qualified for the national final, to be held towards the end of the year.         
	The competition has been very tough, and as the last speaker I had doubted whether I would make an impact. I am happy that the judges liked what I had to say, said Wamika.         
	La Martiniere for Boys was adjudged the best speakers.

	A Howrah youth who had allegedly duped the director of a Bhutan-based call centre of Rs 2.43 lakh was arrested in Behala on Monday.        
	Police came to know during the interrogation of Bobby Sil, 34, that he and his mother had been arrested in December last year following a complaint by the joint commissioner of income tax.        
	The duo had been charged with collecting money from youths after promising them jobs in the income tax department. They were released on bail in April, 2008.        
	Sil took Rs 2.43 lakh from Yash Bahadur, the director a call centre in Thimphu, saying he would help him get back the Rs 1.5 crore that a Calcutta-based agency owed him, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	Bahadur mentioned in his complaint that he had entered into a deal with the agency for sharing the database of clients.        
	Bahadur, who visits the city frequently, met a man in the agencys office who identified himself as Biman Das three months ago. Das told Bahadur that Sil could help him get the money back, said an officer of the detective departments anti-fraud section.        
	When Yash approached Sil, he identified himself as the owner of a recovery agency that has clients across the state. He claimed he ran a unit that specialises in loan recovery through lawyers and musclemen. As told by Sil, Bahadur paid him Rs 1 lakh in advance last May, said the officer.        
	But there was no progress thereafter. Sil then played another trick. He told Bahadur that he had convinced the agencys proprietor to sell a property and clear the dues. He even showed Bahadur some forged documents to back his claim, the officer added.        
	For the entire process, Sil demanded Rs 1.43 lakh, which Bahadur paid.        
	The director realised a fortnight ago that he had been duped. He lodged a complaint with Bowbazar police station, which was sent to the detective department. We raided Sils Howrah house but he could not be found. The officers were tipped off that Sil would spend Sunday night in Behala. A trap was laid and he was picked up, said Shamim.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Salt Lake hit-and-run boy critical
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Salt Lake hit-and-run boy critical
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The condition of nine-year-old Namit Kumar, who was critically injured in a hit-and-run case outside his school on Wednesday, deteriorated on Thursday morning.         
	The Class III student of Salt Lakes Kendriya Vidyalaya I was admitted to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals with brain haemorrhage. A CT scan on Thursday revealed multiple blood clots in his brain and Namit was wheeled in for emergency surgery. He was later put on ventilator.        
	We have removed some of the clots but the boys condition is still very critical, said a hospital official. The next 48 hours are crucial, he added.        
	Namits father Ramesh Ram and class teacher Anjali Das visited Bidhannagar (North) police station to lodge a complaint against the unidentified driver of the Tata Sumo that dashed Namit.        
	The police sent a part of the registration number of the Sumo  noted down by a witness  to the motor vehicles department. Since the number is incomplete, it may take some time to identify the vehicle. But we are confident of tracking it down, said an officer.        
	Ram said he was hoping the police would trace the rogue driver soon. If the police can track down the Sumo driver, we can claim compensation. We cannot afford the treatment cost on our own, said Ramesh, who works in the HMV unit on Jessore Road.         
	On Wednesday, Namit had got off the school bus to play with some friends while waiting for other students. As he ran across the main road after a ball, a speeding Sumo knocked him down and sped away.        
	Shaken by the accident, some 20 parents gathered in front of Kendriya Vidyalaya-I in Laboni on Thursday and urged the principal to take steps to ensure the safety of students.

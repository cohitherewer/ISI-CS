	ARIES        
	Youve got to admire his boundless energy. Theres no one else with whom youd rather dance or engage in some casual flirtation with. Watch out for the jealous and domineering streak.              
	TAURUS        
	An irresistible force, for sure. But stubborn Tauruss refusal to entertain any opinion but his own drives you wild. Breezy disregard for his advice will set him off. Best not to tangle (or tango!) with this one.              
	GEMINI        
	A Gemini can be hard to handle. The twin attracts a bevy of admirers and the dizzying speed with which he moves can spin your head. Nonetheless hes such a spirited and sensationally exciting playmate that you may just want to give him a whirl.              
	CANCER        
	The loving Crab prefers long quiet evenings by the glow of the TV set and tends to retreat into his shell when you insist on gallivanting. By the time this cautious, one-step-at-a-time person is primed for some action, youre well on your way to dreamland.              
	LEO        
	The hot-blooded king of beasts lights your sensual fires and you wouldnt be averse to sharing champagne with him. Still, the lions restless prowling is totally unacceptable and do you really dare to tame him?              
	VIRGO        
	Though you can enjoy a brief conversation with the quick-witted Mercurian, it wont take long for him to reveal that hes compulsive about neatness and hygiene. A fanatic, hypercritical and something of a hypochondriac as well, but hugely caring.              
	LIBRA        
	Whether painting the town as your circles most popular person or cuddling in private, he is a charmingly cunning mate today. So what if his antics conflict with your need to negotiate a truce?               
	SCORPIO        
	Certainly he is mega-sensual, but when it comes to temper there is no match. Turbulent Scorpio is subject to fearsome rage, especially when he thinks hes been crossed in love. Caution: This may be hazardous to your health.              
	SAGITTARIUS        
	Finding happiness with an idealistic Archer? We bet you will. Never mind that he tends to fritter his myriad talents and that his penchant for straying drives you mad. His passion for probing your romantic options will make him an adventurous mate.              
	CAPRICORN        
	When a fiercely determined Goat sets out to win your heart, you may as well succumb. His burning ambition and admirable plans cant fail to impress. And what he lacks in expertise, he is willing to learn. After all, slow and steady wins the race.              
	AQUARIUS        
	His soaring intellect makes your evening a flight of fancy, seldom touching ground long enough to connect. Hes a dreamer whose kisses feel curiously remote, even at the height of lust. Hes all for universal love, but you believe charity should begin at home.              
	pisces        
	Though drawn by his soulful presence, theres something about the slithery Fish  could it be his self-indulgence?  that makes you think youd be better off without him. Still, one melting look from this poetic dreamer and you can forget your reservations.

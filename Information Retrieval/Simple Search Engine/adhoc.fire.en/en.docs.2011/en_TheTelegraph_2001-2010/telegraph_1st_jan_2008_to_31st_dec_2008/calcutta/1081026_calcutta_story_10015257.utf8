	I have a dream. A dream that one day, every bathroom in our land will be clean. Where every citizen, regardless of race, creed, caste or religion, will know how to use and flush a toilet.        
	So, imagine my surprise when I learnt that there are people, even as we speak, who are living my dream. Injustice? No, inspiration.        
	I have recently returned from a two-week road-trip through Germany. Road-trips necessitate adventurousness in lavatory matters unthinkable in most parts of India. This was a cause for concern.         
	Yes, so elevated was my paranoia (shared by many of my countrymen, I am sure) that I doubted even the legendary German orderliness on this most critical score.        
	But the anxiety was entirely unwarranted. For the considerable charms of Germanys culture and history, food and drink, faced stiff competition from the awe inspired by one remarkable revelation: that every single bathroom in a nation  public, private, even part of a mass transit system  can be clean.         
	Nay, so spotless that some Indian doctors might consider operating in them.But isnt it true that a bathroom is only as clean as the last visitor leaves it? Yes, if you are in India, where experience reveals that users in general lack aim and so many are so concerned about the environmental crisis as to deem flushing unnecessary.         
	However, with typical German efficiency, when in doubt, you will have a three-pronged approach to fall back on.        
	First, they educate. Which has nothing to do with literacy, and everything to do with manners. That, per force, leads to clean bathrooms, roads, forests, beaches. You will be hard-pressed to find a single piece of litter in the entire nation.        
	Second, where footfalls are high, they hire a lady and equip her with a mop, a pair of gloves and a sense of purpose. She will then enter every stall after every visitor leaves it, cleaning and disinfecting with a smile, expecting only a nominal tip of about 30 cents.         
	For such dedication, we would willingly pay more. Isnt it too small a price for peace of mind and bladder? (Note: this method alone is enough to keep the Oktoberfest loos spotless. Even with hundreds of thousands of drunks, where manners cease to matter well before noon and one-litre beer mugs make self-restraint impossible.)        
	Third, they employ technology. Yes, we know the Japanese invented pots that can dispense with your waste, test your blood and teach you trigonometry in the time that it takes you to button your pants, but the German contraptions are almost as impressive.         
	Highway rest stops across Germany have pay-and-use facilities. As you enter the bathroom, a machine takes 50 cents and issues you a coupon. Once you have done the needful in one of these stalls and stand up, the toilet automatically flushes. Which is in the world of tech-enabled toilets yesterdays news.         
	Then, a magical thing occurs: the toilet seat is raised away from the pot and begins to rotate. On closer inspection, there is a piece of material  bearing disinfectant  fixed in position, against which the seat is scrubbing itself clean.        
	So even if you dont know what to do, the toilet will do it for you. Then you can redeem the coupon issued on entry against any item at the rest stop. So if you are a paying customer, you pee for free.        
	It is symphonic in its beauty. But with perfection comes one-upmanship. As a result, for some bathrooms, mere cleanliness is no longer enough. They throw in some humour, too.         
	On exiting one ruined castle nestled in the Mosel Valley, you will find a bathroom that no man is likely to forget in a flush, er, rush. Above the urinal, you will find two levers. One, presumably, brings on the water. The other, presumably, belongs to the guillotine that hangs above the pot and your near and dear ones. Which is which?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sting thrives in warm winter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sting thrives in warm winter
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The vector menace has not subsided contrary to predictions, thanks to the delayed winter.        
	Met officials said there was little chance of the winter chill setting in this week, adding to the citys woes.        
	Two dengue cases were reported in the past two days at the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Enteric Diseases. Both patients are from the Maniktala-Phoolbagan area.        
	At Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, three patients were diagnosed with dengue and two with malaria in the past week.        
	State health department sources said though there had been no vector death in the past two months, eight to 10 per cent of the patients suffering from fever are testing positive for malaria and dengue.         
	Health experts said mosquito larvae were born when the days minimum temperature was 20 degrees Celsius or more. There is a drop in the larvae count in winter as the minimum temperature usually drops below 20 degrees. But this year, thanks to the continuing warm spell, larvae are still being born, said D.K. Neogi, a former director of the School of Tropical Medicine.        
	The number of dengue and malaria cases is more than in the corresponding period last year, said health services director Sanchita Bakshi.        
	The minimum temperature on Sunday was 19.7 degrees Celsius, six degrees above normal. On Friday, the minimum temperature rose up to 22 degrees. The Met office said the minimum temperature was likely to drop by one or two degrees in the next few days.        
	A low-pressure system  western disturbance  over Kashmir is blocking the North Wind. The system is moving eastward but another disturbance is approaching. There will be no significant dip in the temperature in the next few days, said an official.

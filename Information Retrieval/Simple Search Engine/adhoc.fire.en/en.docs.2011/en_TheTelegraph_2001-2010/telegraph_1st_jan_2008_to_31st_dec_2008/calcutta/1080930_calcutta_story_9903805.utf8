	Jadavpur University will probe an alleged leak of the BA (Sanskrit) entrance test paper this year.        
	Nearly 500 students had applied for the course. The 40-odd who made the cut have been attending classes since July.        
	Students of the universitys arts faculty have alleged that a non-teaching employee, who is a member of the CPM workers union, sold photocopies of the question paper.         
	According to the complaint, a teacher of the Sanskrit department had asked the non-teaching employee to photocopy a printout of the question paper. He allegedly made more copies than were needed and sold the extra ones to applicants.        
	The complaint was taken up by the universitys executive council last week. The council decided to set up a panel to probe the allegation, said pro vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta.        
	The students have demanded action against the employee and accused teachers of the Sanskrit department of negligence.        
	Members of the department should have been more careful before assigning any confidential work to an employee, said a teacher.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scholar accuses JU of minority bias
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Scholar accuses JU of minority bias
          MITA MUKHERJEE                              
	A research scholar has alleged that he has been denied lectureship at Jadavpur University (JU) because he is from a minority community.        
	Babar Ali Shah, doing post-doctoral research in applied geology at JU, has lodged complaints with the President, Prime Minister, Lok Sabha Speaker, University Grants Commission, state and national minority commissions and the state minority affairs department.        
	The 38-year-old alleged that the person who piped him to the post, a research fellow from IIT Bombay, was less qualified than him.        
	JU denied the charge saying teachers are appointed entirely on the basis of merit.        
	Shah, who wrote in his complaint that he had done postgraduation and Ph.D in applied geology from JU, had made it to the final panel of three candidates from among 17 applicants.        
	But the candidate who was selected for the post on September 15 does not have a Ph.D degree, he alleged.        
	I have been engaged in post-doctoral research in the university for nine years... It is unfortunate that I have not been selected even though I feel I am adequately qualified... This is an ideal example of deprivation of a minority community...        
	As I do not belong to the mainstream community, I do not know, if that be the reason in my case to remain beyond focus of attention of the university authorities while selecting lecturer for the geology department, Shah wrote in his complaint.        
	In response to the letter, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee wrote to the university on October 8 seeking an explanation.        
	The state government, too, may seek a report from the university on the issue. The minister of state for minority affairs, Abdus Sattar, said: Shah has complained that the authorities have done injustice to him by not selecting him for the post. Jadavpur University being an autonomous body, the government cannot question its policies but can seek a report on the issue. The matter is also being referred to the chief minister.        
	Vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh said the selection panel comprised well-known experts in the subject. We appoint teachers entirely on the basis of merit. The candidate who the experts felt was most suited for the job has been appointed.

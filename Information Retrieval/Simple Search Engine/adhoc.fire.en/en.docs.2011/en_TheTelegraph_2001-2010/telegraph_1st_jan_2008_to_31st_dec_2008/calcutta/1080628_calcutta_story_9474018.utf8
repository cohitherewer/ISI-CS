The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Death on tracks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Death on tracks

	A marriage registrar married to a Writers Buildings employee killed herself by jumping on the Metro Railway tracks at Kalighat station on Friday morning.        
	Geeti Roy, 32 and the mother of an 11-year-old daughter, left her Bosepukur Road home around 10am and presumably went straight to Kalighat station.         
	At 11.12am, just when a Dum Dum-bound train had entered the station, she jumped on the tracks before any of the passengers standing next to her could react.        
	The driver pressed the emergency brakes, but she was run over, a Metro Rail spokesperson said.         
	Unlike in most Metro Rail suicides, the train did not crush Geeti because she fell on the drain between the first two rails. As she lay there, perhaps still alive, passengers were evacuated and the train was moved backwards for security personnel to lift her.         
	It was around 11.45am by the time Geeti was taken to SSKM Hospital, where doctors declared her dead.        
	Metro Rail services were disrupted for almost an hour. Six Dum Dum-bound trains were cancelled. Normality was restored around noon.        
	Geetis husband Salil and other family members were unavailable for comment, but neighbours said she had appeared depressed for the past few days.         
	She was otherwise a very lively person and always smiling, said Rupa Ghosh, a neighbour. However, for the past few days, she looked depressed. We asked her the reason but she did not divulge anything.         
	Another neighbour said Geeti would often complain about loneliness when her husband was in office and their daughter, Aritrika, in school.         
	The police gave another version. Preliminary investigation has revealed that of late Geeti was upset with the academic performance of her daughter, an officer at Kalighat police station said        
	Geeti was popular in the locality because of her work as a marriage registrar and involvement in para activities. She was one of the organisers of social and cultural events, said Baishali Dey, a neighbour.

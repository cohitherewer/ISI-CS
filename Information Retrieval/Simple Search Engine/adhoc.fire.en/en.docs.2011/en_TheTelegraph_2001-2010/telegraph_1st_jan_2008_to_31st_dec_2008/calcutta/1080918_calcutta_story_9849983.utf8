          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 45-year-old man surrendered at Tiljala police station on Wednesday morning after suffocating his wife to death with a pillow, suspecting her of having an affair.        
	As the police recorded his statement, the couples children  an eight-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son  woke up beside their mothers body and alerted neighbours when she wouldnt respond to their calls.        
	According to police, Soumen Sardar strangled Ashtami, 40, after midnight in their Nonadanga home. He told us that they had fought after dinner and gone to bed. Soumen woke up and suffocated his sleeping wife with a pillow, said an officer.        
	Soumen, who worked in a petrol pump in the area, was arrested as soon as he confessed to the murder at the police station around 5.30am. He was produced before the court in the afternoon and remanded in judicial custody.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that relations between the two had soured over the past year. Soumen suspected that Ashtami was going around with another man and this led to the rift. They used to quarrel every day, added the officer.        
	Neighbours told the investigators that they heard the couple shouting at each other on Tuesday night. But that was nothing new as they quarrelled frequently, said one of the neighbours.        
	The police informed Ashtamis parents in Basanti. We will hand over the children to them, said another officer.         
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Ajey Ranade said: We are trying to ascertain whether there was a motive behind the murder.

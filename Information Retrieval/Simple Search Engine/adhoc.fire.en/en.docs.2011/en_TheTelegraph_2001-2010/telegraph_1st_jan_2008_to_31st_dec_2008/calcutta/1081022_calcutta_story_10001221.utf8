                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Glare on hoax call family
          OUR BUREAU                          The locked doors of the Guha flat on Tuesday. Picture by Rith Basu                                  
	Police will seek court approval to prosecute the elder sister of model Suranjana Guha for calling the airport security staff on Monday and falsely identifying three event management professionals as terrorists.        
	Moments before that, the three  Ananya Dutta, husband Sudipto and Prithwiraj Ghosh  had dropped Suranjana from the team travelling to Agartala for a fashion show as she was not carrying her identity card.        
	By the time the police harassment was over and their identity established, the trios flight had left. They later boarded another flight for Agartala.        
	We will move the additional chief judicial magistrates court in Barrackpore with a plea to prosecute Nilanjana Guha, said North 24-Parganas police superintendent Supratim Sarkar.        
	Nilanjana will be prosecuted under IPC Section 182 (providing false information, with an intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person). If convicted, Nilanjana will face a jail term of up to six months or a fine of up to Rs 1,000 or both.        
	The event managers had lodged an FIR against Nilanjana and mother Papiya, who, too, had allegedly picked a fight with them over the phone.        
	A police team went to the Hudco Housing Society apartment in Ultadanga, where the 20-year-old model lives with her sister and mother. They apologised for the hoax call, said a police officer.        
	The Guhas were not to be found when Metro visited the housing estate on Tuesday.        
	The main door of the third-floor apartment was locked and the windows were shut. Some neighbours, however, insisted that Papiya and her daughters were inside.         
	They added that the mother and daughters kept to themselves and some even hinted at something fishy going on.        
	Sudipto, of Ananya Advertising and Co-ordination, said he would take legal action against Nilanjana and Papiya. I will consult my lawyers tomorrow, he said.        
	Just before entering the airport I told Suranjana to keep her identity card ready. But she told me she had forgotten to bring it. Since she lives close to the airport, I asked her to call her mother and request her to bring the card, Sudipto recalled.        
	Suranjana called her mother who, instead of rushing to the airport with the card, allegedly accused Sudipto and his wife of harassing her daughter.         
	Sister Nilanjana then called the airport security staff and said the three event managers were terrorists.

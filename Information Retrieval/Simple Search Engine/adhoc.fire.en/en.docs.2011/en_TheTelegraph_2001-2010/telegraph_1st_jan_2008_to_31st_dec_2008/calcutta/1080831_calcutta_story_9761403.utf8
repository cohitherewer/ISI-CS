The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Big monsoon for Bengal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Big monsoon for Bengal

	Data from Indian Meteorological Division (IMD) shows that rainfall in West Bengal during the current monsoon season is about 40 per cent more than the average expected rainfall. s        
	According to sources at the department, the excess rainfall during June and July has been more pronounced in south Bengal with almost all the districts in and around greater Calcutta registering heavy rainfall.         
	During June and July there has been 39 per cent more rainfall throughout West Bengal. Almost all the districts in south Bengal have registered more rainfall than average, confirmed G. C. Debnath, the director of Indian Meteorological Division.        
	Weather observations indicate an erratic monsoon, which has left areas like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala drier, while areas like West Bengal are getting more rain. Recently atmospheric scientists at a workshop on Environmental Pollution of Biosphere and its Management, held at St Xaviers College and organised by ICFAI Research Centre and state environment department, addressed the issue of the changing monsoon in the region.         
	Though Indian scientists are still shy of admitting the direct linkage of climate change with changing monsoon pattern, scientists abroad, such as a research team at the University of Liverpool working on Indias monsoon, have claimed that climate change is expected to trigger substantial changes in annual monsoon profile of the country. Bangladesh, close to West Bengal, had an early monsoon this year that experts are also linking to climate change.         
	A warmer climate will change rainfall and snowfall patterns, lead to increased droughts and floods. Rising heat will lead to increased evaporation of surface water; the air will also expand and this will increase its capacity to hold moisture leading to excessive rainfall.         
	But is the worse yet to come? Debnath pointed out that unlike last year, there has been yet no incidence of excessive rainfall within a very short period. Last year Calcutta experienced 18.9cm rainfall within a day, resulting in widespread waterlogging within the city.        
	According to the IMD expert Calcutta is unlikely to see the kind of rainfall that Mumbai experienced in 2005, climate change notwithstanding. The western city had 94.4 cm rainfall on July 26, 2005, the highest ever rainfall recorded in one day in any city in India. Calcuttas record dates back to 1978, when the city experienced 38 cm rainfall in a day.

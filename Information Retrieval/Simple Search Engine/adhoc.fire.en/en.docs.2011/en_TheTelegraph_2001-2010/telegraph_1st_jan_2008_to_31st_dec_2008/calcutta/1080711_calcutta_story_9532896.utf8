                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rs 18-lakh heist ends in staircase

	A five-member gang carrying a gun and posing as CBI officials took Rs 18.22 lakh from a traders office at Burrabazar on Thursday, but were caught by local residents who challenged them on their way out of the building.         
	While the gang was fleeing with the loot, other traders in the building on Armenian Street, barely 100 metres from Burrabazar police station, raised alarm and shut every possible escape route.        
	Two of the robbers, Anil Singh and Rabi Kumar, were chased and caught in the staircase of the building. The other three  Wazir Singh, Karshan Kumar and Narendra Singh  tried to melt into the crowd but were tracked down.         
	Sitaram Sharma, an employee of the garments wholesaler who was robbed, was arrested, too, for tipping off the gang about his owner keeping cash in the fourth-floor office. We recovered Rs 18.22 lakh from the arrested men. A 9mm pistol with four cartridges was found on one of the goons, said DC (central) Ajay Ranade.        
	The robbers, all from Haryana, had entered the five-storied building around 12.15pm. They went straight to the office of garments wholesaler Dinesh Biyani, Ranade said.         
	Biyani was with his manager Amarchand Jain and Sharma when the five men barged in, one of them brandishing the pistol. They introduced themselves as officials from the CBIs anti-corruption wing and asked Biyani to open the cash box. When the trader refused, three of them pounced on him and tied his hands and legs. They disconnected the telephone line and opened the cash box. Seeing the pistol pointed at him, Jain kept mum. The robbers then stashed the cash into two bags and left.        
	I saw them walking along the corridor. On being asked who they were, the gun-toting youth said they were from the CBIs Delhi unit. As I walked towards them, the man shouted that he would kill me, said Gopal Malpani, a trader.         
	When Malpani shouted for help, residents and other traders blocked the ground-floor exit. We caught two of the robbers near the main gate and informed the police, said Rajesh Khaitan, another trader.        
	A police team reached the area soon after. We found Wazir and Karshan at the rear of the building, said an officer. Narendra, who was carrying the money, was caught last.

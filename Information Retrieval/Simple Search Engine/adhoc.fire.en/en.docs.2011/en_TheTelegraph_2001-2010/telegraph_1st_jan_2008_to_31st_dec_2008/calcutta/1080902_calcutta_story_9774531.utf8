The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Speed-breakers on safety path
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Speed-breakers on safety path

	Three men were killed on Sunday night when the motorcycle they were riding went out of control after hitting a speed-breaker on Taratala Road and crashed into a divider. The bump, which is not demarcated in any way and does not come with a warning for motorists, is difficult to spot, especially at night when the stretch is often dark.        
	There arent specific norms for erecting speed-breakers but the Indian Road Congress, a statutory body of road transport engineers, has suggestive guidelines.        
	Speed-breakers should be erected at least in pairs and separated by approximately three-and-a-half-feet so that cars are forced to slow down but are not damaged. Single speed-breakers often damage vehicles, said A.K. Das, the executive traffic and transportation engineer of the transport department.        
	The speed-breakers should be marked with white reflective paint and there should be warning signs at least 25 to 30 metres ahead, he added.        
	Speed-breakers should also be properly sloped and their height should depend on the condition of the road so that vehicles are not damaged and drivers do not lose control.        
	Speed-breakers in the city seldom follow the guidelines. Like uneven stretches of roads, they pose threats to the lives and limbs of motorists and pedestrians. Heres four of the danger zones:               
	Where: Prince Anwar Shah Road        
	What we saw: There are four speed-breakers between Rammohan Mission High School and the Lake Gardens flyover connector, separated by 25 to 50 metres.        
	All the bumps rise steeply and only one carries faint marks of white paint. There are no signs warning of speed-breakers in the vicinity. Since the stretch is poorly lit, motorists find it difficult to spot the speed-breakers.        
	Voices: Crossing the stretch is like riding a roller coaster. The bumps are so steep that once my six-year-old son fell off the cycle-rickshaw while crossing one of them, said Sudeshna Chakraborty, a Lake Gardens resident.              
	Where: Taratala Road        
	What we saw: Theres a speed-breaker within 100 metres of the site of Sundays accident. Neither is it painted nor is there a road sign indicating its presence.        
	Moreover, tree branches have been heaped by the side of the road near the bump close to the Territorial Army Camp.        
	Voices: Mishaps are common on the stretch. We often spot the bump late and have to brake suddenly. Two-wheelers ram into the back of my car, said Gaurav Kumar Shaw, a New Alipore resident.              
	Where: Pratapaditya Road        
	What we saw: Four speed-breakers line the one-way stretch from Rashbehari Avenue to Mudiali. None has been painted or has signboards with warning. The bumps rise steeply and lack a smooth slope. Pillion riders often struggle to stay on a two-wheeler while crossing the speed-breaker. Residents said at least one biker loses control every day while crossing the steep bump near the spot where Pratapaditya Road turns towards Mudiali.        
	Voices: They were painted in August last year but the marks faded long back. There has been no major mishap on this stretch so far but the way motorcyclists have to slam brakes near the bumps, an accident is only a matter of time, said Biswanath Das, a resident of the area.              
	Where: DH Road, near SN Roy Road crossing at Behala        
	What we saw: The part of the road that caved in last month has not been repaired. Instead, rubbish has been dumped on the spot, near the DH Road crossing, in front of Ajanta cinema. Cars and motorcycles coming down the Taratala flyover are forced to hit the brakes all of a sudden.        
	According to a home guard posted at the connector, two-wheelers often lose control on this stretch and even buses find it difficult to negotiate it.        
	Voices: I have seen motorcycles and bicycles skid over sand and stone chips on the road. Vehicles kick up such a cloud of dust that it is difficult to keep our eyes open, said Prasanta Chatterjee, a motorcyclist who stays in Behala Sakherbajar.

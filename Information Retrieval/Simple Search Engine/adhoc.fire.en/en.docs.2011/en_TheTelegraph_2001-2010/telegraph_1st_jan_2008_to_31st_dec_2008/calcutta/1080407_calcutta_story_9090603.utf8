  - ICSE schools tamper with guidelines        MITA MUKHERJEE                                    
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations will launch a drive to stop affiliated schools from violating guidelines regarding assessment of students in internal tests.        
	According to council officials, a section of schools, some of them recently set up, is reducing the council-prescribed pass marks in terminal and annual examinations to attract students.        
	Many more schools, particularly reputed ones, are increasing the pass marks in the internal examinations to ensure that those who appear for the board examinations do well.        
	Lowering the pass marks is strictly not allowed, as this can lead to a tendency among students to be satisfied with low scores, said an official.         
	Increasing the pass marks, on the other hand, leads to stress among students and forces them to take private tuition, added the official.        
	Each affiliated school is expected to maintain the council-prescribed minimum pass marks in the internal examinations. Increasing and decreasing the qualifying marks will not be tolerated, said the council additional secretary and the officiating chief executive, Gerry Arathoon.         
	According to the council rules, the minimum pass marks for students in each subject should be 35 per cent at the ICSE level (classes V to X) and 40 per cent at the ISC level (classes XI and XII).        
	The issue was raised in a recent meeting of the heads of affiliated schools, stated Arathoon         
	Council sources said many students have to face problems in moving from one school to another because of tinkering with pass marks. Schools where they seek admission some times turn them away if their previous school had promoted them even after securing less than 35 per cent marks.         
	The fact that some schools are lowering the marks came to our notice when we examined the transfer cases, said Arathoon.         
	The council has found out that there are schools that have raised the pass mark in internal examinations to as high as 50 per cent.         
	Our pass mark is 45 per cent from preparatory to Class XII. We have fixed a higher pass mark than is prescribed by the council to make our students aim high, said the principal of a school in north Calcutta.

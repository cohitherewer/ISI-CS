          A STAFF REPORTER                          The charred remains of a room at Writers Buildings. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhayaya                                  
	The state government had set up a committee in November 2006 to look into the safety measures, including the fire-fighting preparedness, at Writers Buildings.        
	The panel, which included the secretaries of the public works, fire services and environment departments and senior police officers, had recommended a series of measures.        
	The government decided to implement the recommendations on a war-footing, but Thursdays early morning fire at the secretariat revealed that those have remained on paper.        
	Its true that some of the recommendations on fire safety at Writers are yet to be implemented, fire secretary P.S. Kathiresan said.        
	Some committee members found during an inspection that 22 kitchens were operating at Writers without permission from the state pollution control board. The panel said the canteens should either take adequate fire-safety measures or close down. But the plan was not executed.        
	Metro focuses on some other recommendations and runs a reality check:              
	Recommendation: Pump sets should be fixed and waterlines laid within a week.        
	Reality: Hydrants did not work on Thursday.    
	Recommendation: Separate electric meters should be installed so that blocks could be quickly isolated during a fire.        
	Reality: Separate meters have not been installed.    
	Recommendation: Hanging electrical wires and telephone wires in the protected area should be removed.        
	Reality: Hanging wires can be spotted in every nook and corner of the secretariat.    
	Recommendation: The director of fire services should plan escape routes.        
	Reality: There is no such exit at Writers. We could not prepare escape routes as we are yet to get a layout of the building, said an official.    
	Recommendation: Smoke detectors should be installed.        
	Reality: The detectors did not work on Thursday, though the PWD claimed they were okay. The height of the rooms was a problem. So, the gadgets did not function, said an official.     
	Recommendation: Regular mock fire drills should be held.        
	Reality: Mock drill was organised only once.    
	Recommendation: Four transformers of 630 KVA each should be installed.        
	Reality: Only two transformers of 630 KVA have been installed.

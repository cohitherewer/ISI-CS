	Five veterinary doctors are criss-crossing the city markets every morning to check if the ban on sale of poultry products is being adhered to. On Friday, Metro accompanied vets Gautam Mukherjee and Malay Chatterjee on their inspection round in south Calcutta...   
	Stop 1: Charu Market, 10.20am  
	Armed with the government circular issued on February 5, the two doctors entered the market and immediately spotted a vendor with a crate of eggs. Dont you know that the sale of eggs is banned? he was asked. Policemen have told us to stop sale, but these are the last few I have from earlier stocks, pleaded the vendor. All other shops selling chicken or egg were shut.        
	Docs diary: One person found selling eggs; chicken zero; warning issued.        
	Stop 2: Bansdroni Market, 10.45am        
	The CMC control room had received a complaint about the ban being flouted. Where can I get some eggs? asked Chatterjee, posing as a customer. We have stopped selling chicken and eggs, was the reply. Some traders had switched from chicken to fish.        
	Docs diary: Sale of chicken and eggs zero.        
	Stop 2: Naktala Market, 11.05am        
	A repeat of Bansdroni  a complaint had been lodged; but no evidence of sale.        
	Stop 4: Arambaghs, Naktala, 11.20am        
	An unscheduled stop. The freezer was full of chicken and poultry products. This is the leftover stock. We have stopped all sale, asserted an employee. The vets handed over the ban circular and directed them to empty the freezer. They have two days to clear out the leftover stock, said Mukherjee.                                
	Stop 5: Garia-Rathtala hawkers, 11.30am        
	The sight of hawkers selling eggs and even chicken forced the car to a halt. The vendor selling chicken was warned of police action. Loka, loka (Hide, hide) was the whisper, as those selling eggs dived for cover. Two were caught and warned.        
	Stop 6: Garia market, 11.40am        
	One shop was found selling eggs, other vendors scrambled to hide. The inspectors left a circular with the Byabsayi Samity to enforce ban.        
	Stop 7: Arambaghs, Unnayan Commercial Complex, noon        
	The freezer was stocked with leftover poultry products; employees insisted they were not being sold. Shops can have their licence cancelled, warned Chatterjee.        
	Stop 8: Arambaghs, Ruby connector, 12.30pm        
	Action replay.        
	Stop 9: Kasba market, 12.50pm        
	A clean chit.        
	DOCTORSPEAK: We will submit a report to the CMC, which will ask local wards to enforce the ban, failing which the local police station will raid and seize poultry products.

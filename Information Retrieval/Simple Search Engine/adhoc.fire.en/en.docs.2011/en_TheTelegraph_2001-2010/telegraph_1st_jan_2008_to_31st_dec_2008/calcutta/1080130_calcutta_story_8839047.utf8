 - Funds for training in defence matters
     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                  
	The state government on Tuesday decided to resume its financial support to Calcutta University (CU) for running a training programme for researchers in microwave and millimetre wave.
    
	The state cabinet today approved the funding for the training, which will offer postgraduate diplomas in microwave and millimetre wave, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said.
    
	The university authorities had stopped running the programme two years ago, after the state government withdrew its financial support.
    
	CU had recently appealed to the government to revive the funding, as the demand for training in microwave and millimetre wave is on the rise, said Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of the university.
    
	The radio physics department had launched the training programme in the late 1980s with funds from the defence ministry. The ministry, which introduced the programme to encourage research in defence matters, had laid down a condition that the state government would have to take over the funding after a certain period.
    
	Accordingly, the ministry stopped sponsoring the training programme in the mid-1990s and the state government took over after that.
    
	But the state discontinued its financial assistance two years ago, following which the university stopped the programme.
    
	We are happy that the government has finally agreed to resume its financial support to the university. Those willing to carry out advanced research in defence matters will benefit, said Sushanta Sen, the dean of universitys technology faculty.
    
	Researchers from any institute can enrol for the programme.
    
	The fund is mainly required for paying salaries to the teachers engaged in imparting the training, added Das.

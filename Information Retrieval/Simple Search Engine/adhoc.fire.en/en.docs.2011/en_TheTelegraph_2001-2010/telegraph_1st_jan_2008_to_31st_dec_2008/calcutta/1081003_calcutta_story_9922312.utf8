                      Capturing woman power                    For several years now, clicking pictures has been a way of life for UK-based photographer Jenny Borgerhoff Mulder. Her primary area of interest being street photography and informal, incidental portraiture, she first visited India in 2003. Here, she was instantly struck by the variety and power of the colours and shapes that made up the everyday life of the common people. Shakti: Women of India, her ongoing debut exhibition of photographs in the city, features portraits of women from all walks of life. Taken without any preparation, her impromptu images capture her subjects as they naturally are, and are real, spontaneous projections of the way in which women in India lead their daily lives. Aesthetically exquisite, the pictures reveal the genuine compassion and respect the photographer has for her subjects. So much so, it would not be incorrect to state that only a woman could have shot images with such subtlety and sensitivity. Mulders like-mindedness and her understanding of what it is to be a woman, allows her portraits to become symbols of natural, inborn feminine power. Unlike many contemporary photographers who document the violence and deprivation of womens lives, she prefers to show women not as victims of persecution or poverty, but as individuals who have triumphed in the face of adversity; women whose beauty shines through in spite of the sufferings and hardships that are a part of everybodys lives.

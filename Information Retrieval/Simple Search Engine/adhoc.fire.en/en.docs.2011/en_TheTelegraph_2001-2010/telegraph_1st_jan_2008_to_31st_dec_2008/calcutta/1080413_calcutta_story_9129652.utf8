Mukutmanipur
										                                    
	Asias biggest earthen dam had not seemed inducement enough to spend a weekend in Mukutmanipur, but the incredibly beautiful lake created by the dam, nestled among thickly forested hillocks, alone was more than worth the trip.        
	After a comfortable three-hour drive from Calcutta and a nice cool bath, we were raring to explore the town, situated at the confluence of Kumari and Kangshabati. The surroundings are so quiet that from our cottage on the top of a hillock we could hear the drone of the engines of the country boats in the lake below. The call of an oriole or the shrill laughter of a kingfisher occasionally broke the silence.        
	The staff at our resort encouraged us to go for a boat ride. It appeared a risky proposition, given the condition of the vessels but turned out to be an unforgettable experience. The gentle lapping of waves, the cool breeze and the spectacular beauty all around made for a wonderful time. For the more adventurous, a quick swim in the cool water is in order.        
	A half-an-hour boat ride took us to a small island that serves as a deer park. Hiring a rickshaw is a quick and efficient way to explore the island. There are plenty of deer and they seemed happier than the ones at the Alipore zoo! The kids thoroughly enjoyed feeding them.         
	After plates of mouth-watering snacks, we set out again for a walk around the lake and watched the sun set behind the hillocks. After a lovely dinner, it was time for a session of stargazing on the terrace of the resort. The calm surroundings and the cozy cottage made for a wonderful nights sleep.        
	Breakfast was outdoors, followed by a hot cuppa. The religiously inclined can take a short boat trip to the other side of the dam, where on top of a hillock stands an old temple visited by both Jains and Hindus. The idols were excavated during the construction of the dam. For the not-so-religious, a snooze on a hammock is recommended.        
	While checking out from the resort at Mukutmanipur we were wishing that weekends were a little longer. The drive back to the city was unusually quiet  we had enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and were disappointed at having to return so soon.

	Mukutmanipur is about 400 km from Calcutta, in Bankura district, near the border of West Bengal and Bihar. It is well connected through bus services and can be reached by Rupashi Bangla, which leaves Howrah station for Bankura at 6am.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       After floods, diarrhoea

	Several residents of Behalas Satyajit Ray Sarani, one of the worst-hit areas since last weeks showers, have complained of a diarrhoea attack. Two of them are still in hospital.        
	The residents said the two roadside tubewells in the area (ward 129), their only source of drinking water, were submerged till Friday.        
	Nilanjana Bhattacharya, 20, and Rohan Lal Chakraborty, 21, were admitted to Vidyasagar State General Hospital on Monday with abdominal pain and symptoms of severe diarrhoea.        
	Two others were released from the hospital on Monday. At least 14 others have complained of similar symptoms.        
	Nilanjana was vomiting and suffering from severe abdominal pain. Besides, traces of blood were found in her stool, said father Abhay Bhattacharya. Nilanjanas three-year-old son Nishan and grandmother Himani were admitted to the hospital but were released on Sunday.        
	Nilanjana and Rohan are now much better, said Asit Kumar Mondol, the medical superintendent of the hospital.        
	The civic authorities, however, are not too perturbed over the outbreak. Its a simple case of diarrhoea, not enteric. Only three persons have been affected. We have sent a medical team to the spot and are keeping a watch on the situation, said Debdwaipayan Chattopadhyay, the chief medical officer of health of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	Metro on Monday found some parts of Satyajit Ray Sarani still waterlogged. The stretches that were dug up for laying sewer lines have not yet been filled up. Mosquito larvae were found in several of the dug-up patches.        
	The residents are also fearing an outbreak of malaria and typhoid.         
	I have drawn the attention of the mayor and the municipal commissioner to the residents plight. They only expressed helplessness, said local Trinamul Congress councillor Anjan Das.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Prey to disasters at station 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Prey to disasters at station 
                                          
	Bomb hoaxes have become a part of daily life in Calcutta after serial blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad. If disaster strikes, can the authorities cope with the consequences? Metro explores how prepared the two major stations are in tackling a crisis        
	Sealdah station        
	Official voice: Our disaster management personnel and equipment are present at strategic locations so that there is no delay in an emergency, said B.K. Sharma, the spokesperson for Eastern Railway.        
	What we found: The disaster management cell at the station became defunct two years ago. The two fire engines and two ambulances that must be kept on the premises were absent. There were also no cranes at the station.        
	The fire department told us theres a shortage of engines. The ambulances kept at the station became unusable and were not replaced. An ambulance or fire engine will take at least half an hour to reach the station, said an official.         
	The room of the disaster management cell where the equipment are supposed to be kept has turned into a rest room. The main gate still proclaims disaster management cell but a small door inside the station managers room leads into a air-conditioned sitting area with an attached bath that is used by senior station officials.        
	We have a full-fledged disaster management cell which is under lock and key, claimed station manager Mohan Lal.        
	Passenger concern: The railway authorities are not at all prepared. If there is a terrorist attack, many people will die because the authorities will take a long time to react, said Krishna Bhati.         
	Howrah station              
	Official word: The station is equipped to combat any untoward incident, said B.K. Sharma.        
	What we saw: There are no fire engines and ambulances at Howrah station. The NGO that kept an ambulance at the station stopped doing so two years ago because there was not enough business.        
	The disaster management cell is also absent, making co-ordination among various agencies difficult. During summer, many people faint in the station. We have a tough time informing the doctor, said an RPF officer.         
	Passenger concern: The passengers are under the impression that steps are being taken to improve station security. Railways should take this very seriously, said Bina Mukherjee.                    ZEESHAN JAWED

                      Magic of monsoon music                    One of the most fascinating aspects of Indian classical music is the rich relationship its ragas share with the world of nature. The moods of monsoon have found subtle and evocative expression in Hindustani classical music, which has some of the most poignant compositions on the season. Set to ragas, they conjure up a wide range of emotions: majestic (veer rasa) yet full of pathos (karuna), joyful (sringar) yet immersed in loneliness (viraha-sringar). Celebrating the season of rains, Films Division, Government of India and Nandan, West Bengal Film Centre jointly host Melody of Monsoon, featuring documentaries on music inspired by the spirit of the season. Melody of Monsoon (dir: G.L. Bhardwaj; 6 pm) personifies the season as a goddess which nurtures the earth, nourishing seeds into sprouts, buds into blossoms and ripening flowers into fruitfulness (Tagore). Raga- I (dir: S.N.S. Sastry; 6.45 pm) features Ustad Amir Khan rendering the raga Megh Malhar as an invocation to the rain gods. Then the Rains (dir: Ramesh Gupta; 6.50 pm) is a pictorial characterisation of monsoon built entirely on music and visuals.                    Event: Screening of documentaries on monsoon ragas When: Today; 6 pm onwards Where: Nandan II

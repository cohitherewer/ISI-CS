                                                                                                                Field day for scouts 
                                        With winter holidays still on, it rsquo;s relaxation time for most kids. These two enjoy their walk down Howrah Bridge. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta              
	It started off as an experimental camp by Lord Beadon Powell in 1907, involving just 20 young boys. Today the scout movement has spread its wings to 183 countries.         
	Indian Scout and Guide Fellowship of Greater Kolkata organised its centenary celebration on December 16 at the Shri Shikshayatan School grounds. The theme of the event was One World One Promise and it saw children from 18 schools coming together to stage plays, group dances and cultural activities based on national integration.         
	Seven prominent scouts and guides, who have dedicated their lives for the betterment of society, were felicitated on the occasion. They included Pushkar Lal Kedia, Kashi Prasad Kedia, Sandhya Guha Roy and Ram Nath Agarwal. The chief guest of the event was R.K. Johri, additional director general of police.         
	Other notable guests included Human Rights Commission (West Bengal) director Shyamal Sen and industrialists Amitabh Kejriwal, Ravi Poddar and Rohit Bihani.         
	Addressing students, teachers and parents on the occasion, Avinash K Gupta, secretary of scouts programme, Calcutta chapter, said: Scouting implies a different type of living, with a marked character development and motivation to serve the society.         
	Teachers and parents also felt that the Programme instilled values into growing minds, prompting them to look beyond book-bound activities to community service. It also made students self-reliant and fostered in them a tremendous sense of leadership.         
	The camps organised by the Fellowship are a must for all schoolchildren. Life is all about being a complete and resolved human being, said Kamal Sen, a parent.         
	Moulding a new Einstein is not the prime criterion of school education, realisation of lifes greater goals should be our priority said Kavita Shukla, a teacher from a reputed school.         
	Students also demonstrated some emergency-rescuing activity. All the events stressed on unity and integrity to maintain community harmony. The celebrations concluded with a magnificent display of fireworks.

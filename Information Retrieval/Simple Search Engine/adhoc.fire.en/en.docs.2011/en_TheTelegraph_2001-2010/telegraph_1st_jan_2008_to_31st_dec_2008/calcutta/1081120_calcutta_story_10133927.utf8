                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cricket talk, then crash

	Sumit Ranjan Chakraborty, who survived the train tragedy, spoke to Metro from his hospital bed about the Wednesday morning ordeal.              
	I boarded the Naihati-Sealdah local from Belgharia station. The train was very crowded, as usual. I was in the first compartment, hanging out with a few others holding on to the vertical rod.        
	I was discussing Indias last ODI victory against England with a man hanging next to me. As the train came close to the transformer post, the rod suddenly came loose. Before I could react I lost my grip.        
	The man next to me hit the post and both of us fell together. A couple of seconds later, some more passengers fell and at least two landed on me.        
	I dont remember too well what happened after that. The pain was unbearable and I was struggling to breathe. We were lying in a pool of blood. I passed out as I tried to crawl out from beneath the men, most of whom were unconscious.        
	I came to around two hours later and found myself lying on a bed at Sagar Dutta Hospital. I later learnt that my brothers, after being informed by a neighbour who saw me in the mass of men, arranged for an ambulance and took me to the hospital.        
	I was vomiting and feeling dizzy. Doctors suspected I had suffered an internal head injury and advised my brothers to take me to NRS Medical College and Hospital.        
	After a painful journey that lasted an hour  we had to stop at every major crossing between Kamarhati and Sealdah  we reached NRS at 3.30pm.        
	I was taken to the emergency ward from where they shifted me to the orthopaedic ward. Its 7.30pm now and I am yet to get a bed.        
	The hospital authorities are making my brothers run from pillar to post. Some of those who are in charge of the ward have hinted that a bed could be arranged against some payment.         
	I am lying on a metal trolley which is hurting my back and waist.

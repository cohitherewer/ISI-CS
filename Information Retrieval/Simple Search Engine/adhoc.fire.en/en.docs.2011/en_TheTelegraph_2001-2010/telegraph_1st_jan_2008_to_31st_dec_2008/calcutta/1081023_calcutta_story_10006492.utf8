          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The bodies of the five family members who died while on a holiday in Sikkim were brought back to their Bankimpally home in Madhyamgram on Wednesday afternoon.        
	The sole survivor of the family, Dipali Dhar, 44, returned with the bodies of husband Ashish, 50, daughter Debparna, 22, and father-in-law, Rakhal, 80. Two other relatives  Pushpa and Satyen Biswas, both 70  also died in the accident on Monday.        
	Dipali fainted several times as she got down from the car in which the Sikkim government sent her home. As we brought down the bodies from the Matador, she started crying hysterically, said a relative.         
	The family was returning to Gangtok after visiting Baba Mandir on Monday when their jeep plunged 500 ft off the road. Dipali had stayed back in Gangtok on the fateful day.

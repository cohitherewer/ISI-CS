The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Area-wise tax put off again
                                                                                                               Area-wise tax put off again
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has deferred for the third time the introduction of an area-wise structure of property tax, setting April 2009 as the new deadline.        
	The deadline has been deferred to April 2009, civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Tuesday. Officials cited lack of preparatory work for the postponement.        
	Introduction of the area-wise tax structure was one of the conditions laid down by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) before it sanctioned a $220-million loan to the CMC in December 2001 for the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project.        
	The bank had set fiscal 2003-04 as the deadline for implementing the system, but later granted a three-year grace to the civic body.        
	The CMC had earlier decided to implement the system in April this year. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had said in June 2007: We must introduce the area-wise structure from the next fiscal.        
	But after an appraisal of the preparatory work, senior civic officials decided on Tuesday that the system could not be enforced before next April.        
	The meeting was attended by civic commissioner Bandyopadhyay, chief manager (revenue) Aniruddha Mukherjee, assessor collector (north) Bhaskar Bhattacharya and the director in charge of the environment improvement project, Shantanu Bose.        
	The municipal valuation committee is working out the area-wise rates on the basis of which the property tax will be calculated. In the present system, the property tax of a structure is calculated on the basis of its notional rent, which is fixed arbitrarily.        
	There is, however, a difference of opinion within the CMC on whether the new system will benefit middle-class house-owners. While the mayor thinks the system will reduce the tax burden on many households, valuation committee members fear middle-class house-owners in city proper will be hit hard by the area-wise tax structure.

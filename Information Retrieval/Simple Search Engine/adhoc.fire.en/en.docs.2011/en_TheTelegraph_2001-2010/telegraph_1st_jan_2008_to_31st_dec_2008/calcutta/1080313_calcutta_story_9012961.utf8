                The state government on Wednesday requested the high court to not take into account the CBI probe into Rizwanur Rahmans death. The high court, in its order dated October 16, had asked the CBI to probe the unnatural death of Rizwanur Rahman. But going beyond the jurisdiction of the court order, the investigating agency had lodged a murder case before starting the probe, advocate-general Balai Ray told the court. The final hearing of the case started on Wednesday before Justice Dipankar Dutta. Rays submission will continue on Thursday.    The military police have decided to probe Tuesday nights incident in which a 33-year-old army major, Rajneesh Jha of the Sixth Grenadiers Unit, allegedly beat up the driver of a Tata Sumo that he had hired after the latter refused to follow his directions. Park Street police have started a case of causing grievous hurt and wrongful confinement against the major.     Two fires broke out across the city on Wednesday, leaving three persons injured, two seriously. The first blaze started around 3.30pm at a godown at Taratala. The next broke out at a chemical factory on DC Dey Road, in Tangra, around 4.50pm. The three men who sustained burns in this blaze were unit employees.

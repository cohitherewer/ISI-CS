  - Pending count 3.25 lakh with 21 sanctioned posts vacant          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                          
	The number of pending cases in Calcutta High Court has shot up from 2.52 lakh to 3.25 lakh within a year, owing largely to the inadequate number of judges.        
	The court has a sanctioned strength of 58 judges but 21 of the posts are vacant for the past eight months.        
	All three lawyers organisations of the court are planning to launch a movement to fill up the posts when work resumes from Friday after the Puja vacation.        
	The number of cases pending in the court was 2.52 lakh in July 2007. At last count it had gone up to 3.25 lakh. Repeated requests by lawyers to both the state and the central governments have yielded no result, said Bidyut Kiran Mukherjee, the president of Calcutta High Court Bar Association.        
	We are planning to launch a sustained movement to press for the immediate appointment of judges to the vacant posts of the high court, he added.        
	The lawyers blame the growing number of pending cases on the indifferent attitude of the both the state and central governments in filling up the 21 vacant posts.        
	The mode of agitation would be worked out once the court reopens. The scarcity of judges has delayed hearings over the past eight months. Even criminal matters are not being heard in time, alleged Mukherjee.        
	A year ago, the high court administration had recommended the names of eight advocates for appointment as judges.        
	The state law department had also put forward the names of six candidates from the higher judicial services for promotion to high court judges.        
	The central authority recently decided to appoint two advocates as judges. That will not solve the problem, said a senior official of the high court.        
	The huge number of pending cases in the 202 subordinate courts in Bengal is another problem area.        
	In early 2007, the number of cases pending in the lower courts was 13 lakh. The figure is set to cross 15 lakh by this December.        
	Laptops were provided to the subordinate court judges and fast-track courts were set up for speedy disposal of cases in the lower courts. But of the 687 posts of judges in the lower courts, more than 250 are lying vacant. The number of pending cases is rising every day, said an official of the state law department.

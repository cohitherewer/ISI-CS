                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ENT hospital to open in May
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta is set to get its first dedicated ENT hospital next month.         
	The 25-bedded hospital, spread over 5,000 sq ft, is coming up in Mukundapur, off EM Bypass, on the southern fringes.         
	Construction work is on. The hospital will be operational in 20 days, said Alok Roy, the chairman and managing director of MediaSynergie Pvt Ltd, which is behind the Rs 9-crore project.         
	Although 30 per cent of the population suffers from ENT (ear-nose-throat) problems, there is no speciality hospital to deal with them in Calcutta, added Roy.         
	The hospital will have clinics for hearing problems, headache and sinusitis, dizziness and head and neck oncology. There will also be a dedicated clinic for ENT problems among children, said Roy.        
	Three NRI doctors, currently practising in the UK would take charge of various departments of the hospital. State-of-the-art equipment, including those for laser surgery, will be installed in the hospital.        
	MediaSynergie is setting up a 500-bed multi-speciality hospital close to the ENT one. The multi-speciality hospital will be coming up on a four-acre plot.        
	A super speciality cancer hospital is also being set up on EM Bypass by Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.         
	The 35-bed hospital, adjoining the existing Apollo hospital, will have facilities for chemotherapy and radiotherapy, said R. Basu, the CEO of Apollo Gleneagles, Calcutta. The hospital is expected to be operational by the end of this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal edifices of trade hub
                                                                                                               Illegal edifices of trade hub
  - 4 councillors from 4 parties turn blind eye to mushrooming unlawful buildings                                              
	Of every 100 buildings in Burrabazar, 80 are illegal, say civic records. And the count is rising by the day, mocking the Calcutta Municipal Corporations declared resolve to demolish such structures.         
	Residents across Burrabazar say councillors often look the other way whenever they are approached with complaints of illegal structures coming up in the trade hub.        
	Metro visited four wards, represented in the civic house by as many parties, and checked the ground reality.                
	Ward 25        
	What we saw: A multistoreyed structure is coming up at 45 Girish Park North. The building plan has not been sanctioned, said an official of the local Borough IV. The compound, as a signboard at the entrance shows, houses an office of Trinamul Congress leader Sanjay Bakshi, whose wife Smita is the local councillor.        
	Localspeak: Residents alleged that Sanjay Bakshi is trying to set up a commercial complex at the site. The signboard is a message to the local people not to raise their voice against the illegal structure, said a tenant in an adjacent building.        
	Councillorspeak: I will not comment on the matter, said Smita Bakshi (Trinamul).                
	Ward 23        
	What we saw: A dilapidated, five-storeyed building at 6 Shiv Thakur Lane, more than 80 years old, is growing vertically. An official of Borough IV said the width of the road in front of the building  six ft  doesnt allow construction of any additional floors.        
	Localspeak: The building can collapse any moment, yet the civic authorities are not taking any step to raze the illegal parts. Our repeated complaints to local councillor Bharti Jha have not drawn any response, said a resident of Shiv Thakur Lane.        
	Councillorspeak: I am out of station and so will not be able to speak to you, said Bharti Jha (CPM).                
	Ward 22        
	What we saw: A lane where two-wheelers would ply till a couple of years ago has been all but blocked because of illegal construction. The buildings at 58 and 59 Sir Hari Ram Goenka Street and at 14 and 16 Baisakh Street are extending horizontally, encroaching on the lane.        
	Localspeak: A doctor who has a chamber between 58 and 59 Sir Hari Ram Goenka Street said the lane has narrowed to such an extent that if a person falls ill, he cannot be brought here.        
	Councillorspeak: I am not aware of any illegal construction in my ward, said BJP councillor Meena Devi Purohit.                
	Ward 45        
	What we saw: The rear part of the three-storeyed building at 3/1/2 Armenian Street has been razed and is being reconstructed illegally. The owners have not obtained the civic bodys consent, said an official of the local Borough V. The building, housing shops, is near Nandaram Market, that burned for over 100 hours in January.        
	Localspeak: The promoter is pressuring us to vacate our shops to facilitate the construction. The councillor and the police are not helping us, said a shopkeeper at 3/2/1 Armenian Street.        
	Councillorspeak: Repeated calls on Congress councillor Santosh Pathaks cellphone went unanswered.                    ZEESHAN JAWED

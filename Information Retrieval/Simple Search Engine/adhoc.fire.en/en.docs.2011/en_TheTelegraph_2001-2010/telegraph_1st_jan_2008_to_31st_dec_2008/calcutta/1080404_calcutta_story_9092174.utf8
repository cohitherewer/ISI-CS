The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Snag delays SBI cheques
                                                                                                               Snag delays SBI cheques

	There is bad news for the State Bank of India (SBI) account-holders desperate to encash cheques at the beginning of the month.        
	Due to tech trouble, local cheques drawn on a bank other than SBI are not getting credited before 10-12 days. Even the clearance of demand drafts is taking over a week.        
	The slowdown at SBI from last month is caused by the implementation of a new centralised cheque-clearing system.         
	There is a problem in cheque-clearing. We are implementing a centralised centre at our Jeevan Deep office, but some software-related problems have cropped up, creating a logjam in the cheque-clearing process, said an official at SBIs local head office.        
	We hope to normalise things soon, he added.        
	Nearly 18 lakh savings and current account-holders of the bank across 175 branches in the city are affected.        
	Kallol Mukherjee, of Southern Agrifurane Industries Ltd, a liquor manufacturer, is among those hit hard. Our total business loss due to the cheque-clearing problems at SBI would be Rs 24 lakh. Work has almost came to a standstill, he said.        
	Tapan Das, a salaried person with his savings bank account at the CR Avenue branch of SBI, has been waiting for his UBI cheque to be cleared for the past 10 days.        
	I had a few monthly household bills to pay this week. I could not because the cheque was not credited in my account. Will SBI compensate me for that? demanded Das.        
	The problem surfaced while implementing the new clearing system, a programme the SBI implemented after months of deliberation. Earlier, the local cheque-clearing process followed a one-tier system  the branch of the account-holder and the local service branch for processing the cheque. Now, it will be a two-tier system with the centralised cheque-clearing centre, said an official.        
	No data was available on how many cheques are cleared by SBI branches in town every day, but RBI statistics for 2006-2007 reveal that 6.84 crore cheques, valued at Rs 682,358 crore, were cleared.

                Calcutta police have asked their counterparts in Pune to come down and examine Syed Mohammad Desai, aged 50-plus, who was arrested from a market near Karaya police station on February 16. Cops claimed Desais arrest was made on the basis of a tip-off and that he was booked under the Foreigners Act since he failed to produce documents supporting his status as a Pakistani national. Police found out that Desai had been arrested and prosecuted in Pune in 1999 in connection with an espionage case. He had been awaiting deportation after being set free on completion of his seven-year jail term for passing on classified information about the Khadki ordnance factory in Pune to the ISI. On January 23, Desai escaped from police surveillance.    Octogenarian Prafulla Kumar Ghosh, believed to be mentally unstable and depressed, who was fasting for the past five days demanding speedy justice from Calcutta High Court, fell unconscious on Tuesday. Ghosh, originally a resident of Dhuburia, in Jalpaiguri, alleged that some local hooligans had abducted his wife and manhandled his daughter. His plea for justice from both Dhuburia and Tufangunge courts had yielded no result. Later in the evening, police took Ghosh to the high court health centre.     Two police constables, Ashok Dey and Pradip Das, arrested for raping a deaf-mute girl, moved bail prayers before Calcutta High Court on Tuesday. However, the division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice P.S. Banerjee refused to grant their prayer. Police had rounded up the girl on September 18, 2000, for roaming around aimlessly. The next day, she was produced in Alipore court. During her return to Presidency jail from court, the two cops and one of their colleagues allegedly raped her in the prison van.    Three persons riding a motorcycle without helmets were injured when their two-wheeler skidded off Circus Avenue around 10.15pm on Monday. The injured were identified as Mohammad Israil, Mohammad Parvez and Mohammad Anwar Ali, all aged between 23 and 24 years. They were taken to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital. The motorcycle was impounded.    An unidentified man, aged about 50, was run over and killed by a vehicle at the crossing of JM Avenue and Aurobindo Sarani around 10.30pm on Monday. He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where doctors declared him dead.    Durga Devi Sardar, 90, was run over by a truck on Prince Anwar Shah Road around 8.35am on Tuesday. She was rushed to MR Bangur Hospital, where she was declared dead. Police said Durga Devi was crossing the road when the accident occurred. The truck was impounded and the driver arrested.     Burglars took away a camera, Rs 1,000 and some documents from a school in Kasba on Monday night. The burglars entered the premises by breaking open the rear door.

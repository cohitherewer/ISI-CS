	The Bagnan rural museum may have made it to the central governments list of must-see tourist spots in the Howrah district in March this year, but it is yet to shed its shoddy look or overcome the basic drawbacks of rural living.        
	From Bagnan Anandaniketan Krishtishala, the museum came to be known as Howrah Zilla Sangrahashala in 2001 and came to enjoy the status of a district museum. But it clearly needs a thorough overhaul.        
	The display seems like a makeshift rural exhibition with hand written captions on bits of paper. It does not have a generator to meet the long spells of power cut. The items damaged in the 1978 floods are yet to be restored. And because of lack of adequate security, its collection of historic coins and other valuable objects have to be stashed away in bank vaults.        
	State director of archaeology Gautam Sengupta described the museum as interesting with a wide range of collections. The state has been funding the museum for the last two years, it has huge possibilities of growing into a really important museum, he added.        
	The seed collection is, indeed, valuable and varied put together by founders Tarapada Santra and Amal Kumar Ganguly. If Santra, a government clerk, was an obsessive collector of terracotta tiles, old manuscript, samples of rural craft, stone and metal art objects, Ganguly was all for rural uplift.         
	But the galleries displaying the artefact need to be properly curated. Take the Howrah District Gallery, for example. Ideally, this should be the core gallery offering detailed insight into the various aspects, attractions and afflictions of the district. The walls here are lined with photographs and hand written signs.         
	The space assigned for rural craft is far too small. More information is needed than a mere announcement Polo ball, Deulpur, Panchla. The ball, made from bamboo, was once an internationally recognised indigenous craft used all over the world. Little of the history or speciality of Amtas scissors, the nowas of Udayanpur in Panchla, the tabla and khol of Madarigram is available. The two examples of zari art, which is practised by a large majority of Howrah craftsmen, leave one wishing for more.        
	The anthropology and the terracotta sections are a treasure trove. The first offers artefact in pottery, metal ornament, tribal weapons and traps. The gallery on terracotta has items from 3rd Century BC to 19th Century AD from Harinarayanpur and Bachri in Howrah, Chandraketugarh and other places.        
	A list of terracotta temples in Howrah catches the eye: char chala mandir in Sultanpur, dutala dalan mandir in Jaypur, baro chala mandir in Deulpur, nabaratna mandir in Ganeshpur and more.        
	The stone and metal gallery and the gallery on scroll paintings also have a number of rare and exquisite objects.It is this kind of local flavour that visitors, mostly scholars, school students and the occasional foreign traveller, will find interesting.        
	The museum is open from 10.30am to 4.30pm. We arrange seminars and workshops in December when there are a number of visitors, said museum curator Banya Banerjee. A new gallery on masks is on the offing. Initially, the collection had only a few Chhau masks, we have added to it with masks from the south, north, east and west, she added.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 38-year-old man, who was arrested on September 18 for duping his business partner of Rs 50 lakh, was denied bail by an Alipore court on Wednesday.         
	The judge remanded Zamirul Rahman in police custody till September 26, said an officer of special staff port division, a wing that tracks criminal activities in the port area.        
	The day after Zamirul, alias Azad, was arrested, his wife Shaheen Parveen surrendered before the court and was granted interim bail.         
	According to an officer, Zamirul and Wasim Ansari, 37, along with their wives, launched a company  Shine Enterprise  a year ago. The company dealt in loading and unloading of goods and ship repair at Kidderpore port.         
	Zamirul, a resident of Ekbalpore and Wasim, who stays in Garden Reach, opened a joint account in a Kidderpore bank for encashing cheques.         
	Five months back, Zamirul opened a new account in the companys name, with himself as the sole account holder. He started depositing company cheques in this account and encashing them, another officer said.        
	Last month, Wasim grew suspicious and lodged a complaint against his partner with Ekbalpore police station.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CM wants local tongue in panchayat work

	Think global, act local.        
	This was chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees message to the 34 newly elected sabhadhipatis and sahakari sabhadhipatis from 17 zilla parishads who logged in for a seven-day residential workshop at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta.         
	Inaugurating the workshop on Sunday, the chief minister stressed the importance of the local language in achieving excellence in governance. We must make sure that all work at the panchayat level is done in Bengali. All circulars and forms, without any exception, should be printed in Bengali, Bhattacharjee said.         
	Minutes before, he had urged the participants to become familiar with modern tools that would connect them to the world. When one has to work with speed, one must use the tools of e-governance. Just like you open your letters, you need to learn how to check your e-mail.         
	The participants listened to the chief minister in rapt attention as they got ready for the workshop which will introduce them to modern managerial skills, including e-governance. Its quite difficult to work for development at the local level keeping in mind the global perspective... We need to use the best available tools in the world to meet the local needs, said Ashit Patra, the sabhadhipati from Hooghly.         
	As information technology will play a key role in the delivery of governance, the Joka institute has organised computer classes for the participants every evening. The workshop will also expose the men and women in charge of local governance to the nitty-gritty of housing, employment, drinking water supply, sanitation, waste management, infrastructure development and electrification.         
	Since proper fund utilisation is the key to good governance, the participants will be given tips on resource mobilisation and asset management. The chief minister urged the sabhadhipatis and their deputies to learn the art of prioritising and focus on the needs of the poorest of the poor.         
	There are many schemes available. You have to learn to prioritise them and draw up a list of beneficiaries, Bhattacharjee said.         
	Raghabendra Chattopadhyay and Bhaskar Chakraborty, professors of the institutes newly launched public policy and management group, will conduct the workshop. We will discuss the role of panchayats in flood control and in promoting agriculture, minor irrigation, elementary education and public health. The gender aspects of development, too, will be touched on, said Chattopadhyay.

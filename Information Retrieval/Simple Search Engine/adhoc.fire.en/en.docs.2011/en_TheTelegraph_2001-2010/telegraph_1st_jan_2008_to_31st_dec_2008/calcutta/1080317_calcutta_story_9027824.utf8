          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of an unidentified youth, about 20 years old, was found on a pavement on Rabindra Sarani on Sunday. His throat was slit. The body was covered with a lungi.        
	Pedestrians found the body after they removed the lungi when they saw blood stains on it. They alerted Posta police station. A murder case has been started. Investigations are on to ascertain the cause of death, said Ajey Ranade, the deputy commissioner of police (central).        
	A preliminary probe revealed injuries on the youths legs and hands. The killers had throttled him before slitting his throat.        
	It seems he was murdered elsewhere and the body was dumped on the pavement at night. He was clad in a vest and lungi. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said an investigating officer of Posta police station.        
	Officers of Posta police station have picked up several hoodlums of the area for questioning. His photograph has been sent to all the police stations for identification. The youth seems to be a labourer, the officer added.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 50-year-old married woman was arrested on Tuesday evening when she went back to a jewellery shop in Posta from where she had allegedly stolen ornaments 10 days ago.        
	As soon as Janaki Devi walked into Mahesh Soni Jewellery Shop Pvt Ltd in Madhav Kesta Seth Lane, employees detained her and called police.        
	Janaki initially resisted arrest but later confessed to stealing gold ornaments during her last visit to the shop on June 21.        
	Police raided her house in Singha Lane in Kasba and recovered jewellery worth Rs 45,000. On Wednesday, Janaki was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody.        
	On the afternoon of June 21, Janaki visited the shop with a child and browsed through several items for over an hour. She left without buying anything, promising to return soon, said a senior officer of Posta police station.        
	When the employees took stock of the inventory before closing the shop, they found a gold chain weighing around 35 gm, two pairs of gold earrings and a gold thumb ring missing. The manager of shop scanned the images taken by a security camera and zeroed in on Janaki as the suspect.         
	As she was about to leave on Tuesday evening after browsing through the items, we detained her and asked her to confess. She broke down after an hour of interrogation by the police, said a shop employee.

	Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) will hold elections to its students union on December 30, after a gap of three years and a recent spell of unrest.        
	We hope the elections will pass off peacefully, registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay said on Monday.        
	The Shibpur campus has seen several clashes between rival student groups  the SFI and the Independent Consolidation (IC)  in the past two years. The authorities had shut down the university after last months unrest and ordered all male students out of their hostels.        
	The registrar cited technical reasons for not holding elections in the past three years.        
	Besu was upgraded to a deemed university from an affiliate of Calcutta University in 1993. It was upgraded further to a state-aided university in 2004 through the Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur Act, 2004.        
	The 2005 campus polls were held in accordance with the rules laid down for a deemed university, Bandyopadhyay said. But the December polls will be held according to the 2004 act.        
	Besu has also decided to abide by the election guidelines laid down by the Lyngdoh Committee, set up by the Centre to regulate campus politics.        
	According to the guidelines, a candidate must have 75 per cent attendance and must pass in all subjects in semester examinations. We are happy polls are finally being conducted after the upgrade to a full-fledged university, said Rajarshi Dutta, the IC convener.        
	In the 2005 elections, IC candidates won 27 of the total 40 seats in the undergraduate courses. The seats have increased to 54 with new courses being introduced, a Besu official said.

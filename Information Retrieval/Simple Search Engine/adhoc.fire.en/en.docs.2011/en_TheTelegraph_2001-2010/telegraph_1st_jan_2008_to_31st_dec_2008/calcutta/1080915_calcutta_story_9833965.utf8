The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slip roads for smooth ride to airport
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Slip roads for smooth ride to airport
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Three slip roads are being planned in north-east Calcutta for snarl-free access to the airport.         
	The proposal was discussed on Saturday at a meeting attended by the local MP and representatives of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), public works department (PWD), irrigation department and three civic bodies.        
	A slip road, also known as access road, is a short road connecting a motorway with another. Three such links to the airport are likely to be built from Haldirams on VIP Road, the Jessore Road end of Belghoria Expressway and the Nagerbazar intersection, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami.         
	Frequent snarls on VIP Road as a result of heavy traffic volume have necessitated an alternative plan.        
	A committee has been formed to conduct a detailed survey and come up with a short-term solution for traffic congestion on the way to the airport, added the minister. A flyover is, of course, the long-term solution.         
	At Saturdays meeting, the AAI representative proposed an elevated corridor from Belghoria Expressway to the Haldirams crossing with an interchange for independent access to the airport.        
	There is a vacant plot near the crossing where the interchange, which will also be elevated, can be built and linked to the Belghoria Expressway extension.        
	A flyover from the crossing of the VIP Road-airport connector to the new terminal building is also under consideration. The arrival terminal will be on the first floor of the building and the departure terminal on the ground floor. The flyover will be aligned with the arrival terminal, said an AAI official.        
	Around 6,000 vehicles head to the airport daily. The figure is expected to increase to 24,000 after the modernisation, the first phase of which will end in 2010. The four-lane flyover from Chitpur to the Lake Town-VIP Road crossing that the transport department has planned will also add to vehicle count on the main airport artery.        
	Traffic can hardly move on VIP Road during the morning and evening peak hours. We told the state government officials that the situation would soon be out of control if steps were not taken, said a senior airport official who attended the meeting.         
	The drainage problem in and around the airport was also discussed on Saturday. The choked canal near the airport was identified as the chief culprit.         
	There are areas in the airport compound that were under knee-deep water last monsoon. The new terminal building is supposed to come up in one such area, added the airport official.        
	It was decided at the meeting that experts from Jadavpur University would be asked to prepare a plan for dredging the canal. The irrigation department would execute the plan.

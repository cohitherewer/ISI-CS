                The joint director and head of office of the Indian Botanical Survey of India, G.S.Giri, was showcaused on Tuesday for the felling of at least 30 full-grown trees in Indian Botanic Garden without the forest departments permission. The chopped trees were later sold through auction. The disciplinary action follows a directive from state forest minister Ananta Ray.     Acting on an intelligence report about possible terrorist attacks in Calcutta, senior officers of the city police called upon the officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations in the city on Tuesday to step up intelligence gathering. Led by police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, the top cops asked the officers to meet people more frequently and collect data on newcomers in their areas. The officers were also asked to keep a tab on hotels and check cars entering and leaving the city.    An unconscious woman aged around 32 years was found floating in a pond in Sodepur in Thakurpukur on Tuesday morning. The unidentified woman was taken to Vidyasagar State General Hospital, where she was declared dead.

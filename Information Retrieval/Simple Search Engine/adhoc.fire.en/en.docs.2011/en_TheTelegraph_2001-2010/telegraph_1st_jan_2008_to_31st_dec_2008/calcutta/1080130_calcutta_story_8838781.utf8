	The civic authorities, stung by frequent fires in markets, have decided to make the process of issuing or renewing trade licences more stringent from the next fiscal.
    
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) earns Rs 30 crore from the 4.2-lakh trade licences it has issued.
    
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya and civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay met on Monday and decided that traders seeking a trade licence or renewal of an old one will have to first provide no-objection certificates of the building issued by the fire and civic building departments.
    
	Unless we are sure that all fire-fighting arrangements are in place and the building is neither illegal nor unsafe, we will not issue or renew a trade licence, said an official of the licence department.
    
	It will be self-contradictory if one civic department declares a building unsafe or illegal and another issues a trade licence to the traders housed in it, said Bandyopadhyay.
    
	After all market fires, the civic body had learnt that the traders had valid trade licences but the buildings lacked fire-fighting arrangements. This will end if we can streamline the process of issuing or renewing trade licences, said an official.
    
	A trade licence is issued under Section 435 of the CMC Act, 1980. But while issuing the document, the conditions in the section are not adhered to. The mayor and the commissioner resolved to reverse the process, said the official.

          A STAFF REPORTER                           A dance performance at 2006 Rajasthan Divas                                   
	Rajasthanis in Calcutta will celebrate their home states 59th birthday on March 27.        
	The focus of the Rajasthan Divas celebrations this year will be on the states relationship with Bengal.        
	Calcutta is home to around 12 lakh Rajasthanis, most of whom are in the forefront of business and entrepreneurship. Hence, it is appropriate to throw light on the relationship between the two states, said H.M. Bangur, the president of the Calcutta chapter of Rajasthan Foundation.        
	Every year, the government of Rajasthan organises a 10-day event to celebrate the states birthday in cities where the foundation has its branches.        
	The programme will kick off with a panel discussion. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, Hannan Mollah (MP), Amraram Chowdhury (CPM MLA from Rajasthan) and writer Buddhadeb Guha will be among the speakers.        
	On Day II, Tanusree Shankar and her troupe will present dance drama Mrignayani at Gyan Manch. Bickram Ghosh and Jaya Seal Ghosh will present A Tribute to Rajasthan on March 29. The festivities will end with a Rajasthani Kavi Sammelan at Vidya Mandir on March 30.        
	The event is being held with help from groups like International Marwari Federation, West Bengal Provincial Marwari Federation and Spandan, said Sundeep Bhutoria, the secretary of the city chapter of Rajasthan Foundation.

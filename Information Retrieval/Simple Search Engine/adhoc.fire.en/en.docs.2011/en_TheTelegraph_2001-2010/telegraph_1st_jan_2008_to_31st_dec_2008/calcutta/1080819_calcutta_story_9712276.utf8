          Parents and professionals join hands to sensitise society on the problems of autistic children                          Parents and children participate in an autism workshop               
	Your child cannot cope. He cannot sit at one place and disturbs everyone. We cannot fit him into the class.        
	She has to be taught the dance steps separately, madam. I am unable to concentrate on others when she is around.        
	Everywhere, wherever they go, autistic children face such challenges and barriers which you and I do not.         
	Are they different from us?         
	Yes, they are. These children are on the Autism Spectrum (AS). Their needs and abilities are different, as are the ways to address their requirements.         
	They face barriers in communicating with the world at large. Yet if they are handled sensitively, it will go a long way in building a relationship based on trust and understanding with the society they live in. With the right support system, people with autism can live healthy and meaningful lives.         
	This guiding principle led a few parents and professionals of the city to come together and form a non-profit organisation called Parents Circle Time Autism Identified (PACTAI) in an attempt to attend to the individual needs of such children.         
	The objectives of PACTAI are:         
	 To sensitise society about the existence of autistic populations and foster their acceptance within society.         
	 To create awareness through lectures, seminars, workshops and conferences.         
	 To counsel parents on ways of coping with the day-to-day stress of dealing with an autistic child.         
	 To form a club to enhance social skills of autistic children through activities like dance, music, yoga and painting.         
	 To develop manpower resource like care givers and trained personnel.         
	 To open, run and maintain a rehabilitation centre, respite centre and a home to take care of the emotional, social and medical needs of autistic adults.         
	 To have a permanent address for the society.         
	PACTAI is holding its inaugural conference from August 24 to 25 where autism authority Dr Stephen M. Shore will address adult autism issues, including education, employment, advocacy and disclosure at Saturday Club. Shore serves on the board of the Autism Society of America and several other institutions. This will be his first visit to eastern India.         
	Representatives from schools including Modern High School, La Martiniere, Birla High, Akshar, The Heritage, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, India Institute of Cerebral Palsy and Loreto House will attend. Calcutta University, too, has signed up.         
	Parents of children with special needs, educators and doctors have come forward to support the cause of PACTAI.         
	This is just the beginning.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fumes cloud phase-out plan
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The state transport authorities and transport operators failed to reach a consensus on Friday on the phase-out of commercial vehicles older than 15 years.         
	Private bus and minibus operators told transport minister Subhas Chakraborty that they were unwilling to negotiate till a verdict was reached on their appeal against the recent high court order that set a deadline for scrapping old commercial vehicles. Taxi unions, however, agreed to discuss compensation.        
	We told transport operators that commercial vehicles over 15 years old will not be allowed to ply in the city after March 31, 2009. We are imposing the ban to comply with the high court order, Chakraborty said at Writers Buildings after meeting the transport operators.         
	The unions were asked to suggest the amounts that the government should offer to the owners of banned vehicles, he added.         
	Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate, the largest union of private buses, said: An appeal has been lodged on our behalf against the order. We told the government representatives that we are not ready to discuss compensation while the matter is sub judice. Abashesh Daw, the general secretary of the Minibus Coordination Committee, echoed Saha.        
	Tarak Barik, the secretary of the Calcutta Taxi Association, however, said: We accept that the ban must come into effect. The government has to ensure that we are cushioned against losses to the maximum possible extent.         
	Madan Mitra, a Trinamul Congress leader and president of the Progressive Taxi Mens Association, said: We will meet transport officials on Monday. We are sure there will be bargaining.

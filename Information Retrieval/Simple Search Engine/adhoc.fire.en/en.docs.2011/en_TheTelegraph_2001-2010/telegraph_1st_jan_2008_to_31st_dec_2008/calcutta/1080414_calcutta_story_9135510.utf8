                Two armed youths were arrested on Saturday night before they could carry out their plans of robbing Poila Baisakh shoppers. One of the youths was picked up from the crossing of Ram Lochan Mullick Street and Mahatma Gandhi Road. A firearm and five rounds of cartridges were found on him. The arrest was carried within an hour of a team from the detective department picking up a youth in front of Entally market. A loaded single-shot gun was found in his possession, said an officer.     Ganesh Biswas, a 37-year-old daily labourer, committed suicide by consuming poison in his Barrackpore home on Saturday evening after finding that his daughter Purnima had hanged herself from the ceiling of her bedroom. According to police, the family was facing financial problems. Ganeshs wife had gone out for work at the time.

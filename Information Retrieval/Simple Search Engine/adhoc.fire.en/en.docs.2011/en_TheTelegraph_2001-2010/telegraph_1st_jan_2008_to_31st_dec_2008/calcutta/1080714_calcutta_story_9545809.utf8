                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rain warning for 24 hours

	Rain lashed the city and its neighbourhood on Sunday and more rain is expected in the next 24 hours.        
	Monsoon activity is normal over Calcutta, said the weatherman. There is also a cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) over Gangetic Bengal that is sucking in moisture from the Bay of Bengal and triggering rain.        
	On Monday we expect the sky to remain cloudy. There will be light to moderate rain in Calcutta and its adjoining areas in the next 24 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	A Met official said there is no heavy rain warning for Calcutta in the next 24 hours, but there may be heavy rain in isolated areas of Birbhum, Murshidabad, Nadia and Burdwan districts.        
	The Met office recorded 27.1 mm rain at Alipore on Sunday. The showers resulted in accumulation of ankle-deep water on Madan Mohan Burman Street, Muktarambabu Street, Jodhpur Park Lane, Picnic Garden Road, Bagbazar Street and Baithakkhana Road. The water receded fast from all the roads except Madan Mohan Burman Street.         
	The chief engineer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Tushar Ghosh, said the waterlogging problem on Madan Mohan Burman Street would not be solved until the drainage pumping station at Marcus Square is commissioned.        
	It is likely to be commissioned before the Puja, added Ghosh.

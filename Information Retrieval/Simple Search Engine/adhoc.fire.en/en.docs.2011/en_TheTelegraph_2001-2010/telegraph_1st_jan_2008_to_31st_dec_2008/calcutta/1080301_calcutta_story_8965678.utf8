          A STAFF REPORTER                          The mangled remains of the autorickshaw that was dashed by a bus on Friday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Three persons in an autorickshaw died after the vehicle hit a bus and was flung into a ditch along Diamond Harbour Road, in Bishnupur, on Friday morning.        
	Traffic on the artery was suspended for around two hours after the mishap.        
	Police said the mishap occurred when the auto tried to overtake the Esplanade-bound bus from the wrong side.        
	It overturned after hitting the bus and was flung into a roadside ditch, the officer added.        
	The dead have been identified as Swarup Gude (who was driving the auto), Anwar Ali Sheikh and Sukumar Hazari. Anwar and Hazari were Thakurpukur-based traders.        
	Two other persons travelling in the auto were injured. All five were taken to a local hospital, where the three were declared dead.        
	The two others were shifted to MR Bangur Hospital as their condition deteriorated.        
	The police impounded both vehicles, though the bus driver managed to flee.        
	A search is on for the driver and we hope to arrest him soon. We are also drawing up plans to rein in errant drivers of autos and other vehicles, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).        
	Hazari was the only earning member in his family of five. How will the family sustain itself? wondered Sukanta Das, a relative of Hazari.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safe and sound for Puja crown
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Safe and sound for Puja crown
            
	Alipore-Kidderpore  
	Kidderpore 25 Palli, which has preservation of the tiger as its theme, tries to fit the bill of a model puja while keeping aesthetics in mind.         
	The puja has excellent fire management facilities, a room for the main electric switch and two sound-proof generators. There are also five closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, 100 security guards and 32 fire extinguishers on the premises, according to organiser Shakuntala Bhattacharya.         
	Last years Two Star winner 66 Palli has tried hard to organise an even better puja this time. However, the depiction of its theme, the misuse of natural resources, is too complicated. The pandal is a cross-section of a weaverbirds nest.        
	The puja was inaugurated by inmates of old-age home Nabanir. Green policemen and CCTV cameras are in place, as are drinking water, toilets and emergency phone numbers. But traffic management is a problem at this popular puja.        
	In its 70th year, Badamtala Aashar Sangha, which has Mithun Chakraborty as its brand ambassador, has depicted Battala illustrations. Theres a seating area to rest tired feet and listen to the chanting of shlokas after a spot of pandal hopping.         
	Mominpur Sporting, a first time entrant to True Spirit, has revisited the time of Gopal Bhar in its pandal. Durga is depicted in aatpoure (homely) attire here. Straw mat installations line the way to the pandal.         
	Akalbodhan Venus Clubs pandal, shaped like a boat, gets marks for innovation. The interior, with lanterns, fishing nets and an uneven wood surface, is like that of a boat. The goddess is depicted as Bonbibi, the guardian of the Sunderbans, and is being worshipped by Hanuman.        
	Firefighting, emergency lighting and drinking water facilities are sadly absent.        
	Kidderpore Pally Saradiyas pandal elaborately depicts articles used in puja through galicha ropework. The goddess, on an elephant, and her family, has a lakkhir shara as the ekchala framework, with the entrance to the pandal lined with patachitra illustrations.        
	At Kolahol Goshthis puja, which has Rabindranath Tagore as its theme, there are wheelchairs for the disabled. The puja committee has set aside 20 per cent of its budget for charity, claimed organiser Swapan Sanyal. Blankets will be distributed among the underprivileged on Saptami.         
	Howrah        
	Several Howrah pujas have come up with creative themes, served with a dash of social commentary. But most seem to have bypassed the basics.         
	Santragachhi Kalpataru Sporting Club, for instance, has designed its pandal as a khelaghar  a childs fantasy world where rocking horses, masks and spinning wheels vie for eyeballs. There are several messages for visitors, one of which is not to use plastic bags. Ironically, the pandal itself has plastic covers on the roof. The organisers have an ambulance but it needs a visit to the garage.        
	The club hasnt compromised on security, though. The presence of CCTV cameras confirms it.        
	Ichhapur Milan Sangha, too, has put up a board asking people to stop using plastic bags. But the organisers apparently dont believe in practising what they preach. We noticed an offering of fruit before the idol wrapped in polythene.         
	The showstopper in Howrah on Sashthi was Olabibitola Sarbajanin Durga Puja, having a budget of Rs 6 lakh and nabapatrika as its theme. The organisers said they spent a major portion of the budget on safety measures, even choosing fire-resistant paint for the plaster-of-paris walls. They also arranged for CCTVs, a generator, an ambulance and a doctor in keeping with the True Spirit guidelines.         
	Last years True Spirit Two-Star winner, Kamardanga Sitalatala Baroari, has recreated a jele para (fishing colony), complete with small houses, a temple, a school, boats, fishing nets and a pond. The problem is, the pond isnt barricaded.        
	Arupara Sarbojanin, near the Milan Sangha maidan, depicts the poor state of healthcare in Bengal. There are clay models of patients lying on the floor of shabby hospitals and ramshackle ambulances. But the organisers themselves are yet to arrange for a first-aid box or a wheelchair.         
	The most eco-friendly pujas were those of Nabarun Sangha in Shibpur and Alapani Sangha. The first one depicts threatened folk arts and the other showcases Bengals patachitra and mud dolls. Alapani Sanghas pandal has a thatched roof but no fire-resistant chemical has been sprinkled on it. We wet the straws regularly to prevent fire the natural way, a volunteer said.        
	Chittaranjan Smriti Mandir, which is expecting a lakh visitors every day, has taken adequate safety measures. At Netaji Balak Sangha, only one volunteer attended fire-fighting drills.               
	Tangra-Salt Lake        
	A number of pujas in Salt Lake have chosen the green theme this year. Though DL block depicts the Mahabharata episode where Arjuna aims for the eye of the fish, the surroundings are dotted with clean city, green city posters.        
	We have also made it an entirely plastic-free zone. If any devotee is spotted bringing fruits for the goddess in plastic bags, we are offering them jute bags free of cost, said joint puja convener P.S. Mukherjee.        
	While most pujas have stocked a first-aid kit, a handful have gone a step further and tied up with hospitals. A nurse, ambulance and oxygen cylinder are at an arms length, said the vice-president of the Salt Lake BE (East) puja committee, Rajat Saha.         
	The idol at BE (East) is made of coconut shells. Fire safety has not been ignored. The main power switch  which was dangling dangerously from tree trunks at some pujas  has been kept in a separate room and is manned around the clock.                   66 Palli

	At Salt Lakes Labony estate, the organisers have handed the fire safety job to experts. We will have at least one trained fireman at our pandal round-the-clock, said joint secretary of the puja committee, Aruni Mukherjee.        
	Two CCTV cameras will be operational between Sashthi and Navami. We want to make our puja as safe as possible, he added.        
	Most pandals boast of fire extinguishers but few organisers know how to use them. At Tangra Gholpara Sarbojanin Durgotsav, however, committee members pointed out and explained the function of different types of extinguishers. We have six large water-based spray systems to use in case of general fires and six Dry Chemical Powder systems to use for electrical fires, said the auditor of the puja, Silajit Sinha.              
	Barisha        
	Aesthetics and civic sense blend in most of the pandals in the Barisha belt. Tribal art, performers and idyllic rural scenes form attractive backdrops and the accent on safety and amenities  fire-protection devices, drinking water and first-aid  is in keeping with the True Spirit guidelines. But there are disappointments, too.         
	The idols at Barisha Yuvak Brinda were bold and colourful. Gombhira, a tribal masked dance, inspired their look. Episodes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata were carved on the wooden walls. The puja was neat and orderly, but the waste disposal system could have been better.         
	The organisers of the 65-year-old Barisha Tapobon puja on Chandi Charan Ghosh Road, for instance, failed to manage traffic well on Sashthi. The 18-foot Durga idol appeared impressive but the facilities for visitors could have been better.        
	Barisha Shakti Sangha, on James Long Sarani, made a good impression on the first day. Apart from the mandatory safety measures and first-aid facilities, the organisers have arranged for people to clean the pandal at regular intervals.         
	A cluster of thatched huts, hanging lanterns, spears planted on the ground and walls embellished with Madhubani art combine to recreate the ambience of Santhal festivity at the Barisha Shakti Sangha pandal. Another attractive prop is the dome standing on bamboo poles. Plastic has not been used anywhere in the pandal.        
	A group of physically challenged children sponsored by Sanchar, an NGO, trooped in for a glimpse of the puja on Sunday and were treated to a live performance by Santhal artistes from a remote village in Midnapore.         
	Rated a Three Star puja last year, Paschim Barisha Sarbojonin  organised by Behala Youth Club  has created an oasis of serenity this year in the form of an ashram in the mountains. The amenities include emergency medical facilities, complete with a doctors chamber.        
	At Udayan Pally Sarbojanin Durga Puja, the focus is on security. The organisers have arranged for metal detectors and CCTV cameras to scan visitors.        
	The eye-catching Barisha Club pandal was made out of wood and metal.              
	Ballygunge-Kasba        
	A few hits and several misses marked the True Spirit story on this stretch. At most pandals, signs had not been put up, first-aid boxes were locked away and drinking water was yet to arrive. Some organisers blamed the rain, others said it was too early.         
	At Falguni Sangha, signs and fire extinguishers were absent. Neighbouring Saradia Sammilani, which had been done up by residents of the area, was in much better shape. There was a help desk, a wheelchair, a well-stocked first-aid box, clean toilets, a sweeper to keep them that way, proper electricity connections, emergency lighting arrangements and volunteers and security people for crowd and crisis management.        
	We hold story-telling and other creative sessions for kids and help the needy, said Sriparna Basu, an organiser of the puja, which won Four Star and Three Star status in 2003 and 2005, respectively. Adi Ballygunge had a drinking water sign stuck on a lamp post. Palm Avenue Nivedita Sangha puja, organised by women, was nothing special, but the community work record of the organisers was.        
	Picnic Sunrise Club had narrow entrance and exit, Sunil Nagar Sarbojanin didnt have a first-aid kit ready and the toilets were dirty at Rabindra Memorial Sporting Club. Bosepukur Parijat Club had a dirty water tank and unclean toilets.        
	Rajdanga Naba Uday Sangha, in contrast, had first-aid arrangements, a wheelchair, CCTV camera for security and good community work record. Only the ladies toilets were a disappointment.        
	Rajdanga East Recreation Club had put up all the signs but there was no drinking water and the medicine shop where first aid was supposed to be available was closed.        
	East Kolkata Township Welfare Association maintains four beds at Ruby General Hospital and Genesis round the year for needy patients. It had arranged for a generator.         
	Bosepukur Sitalamandir was a bit chaotic. The crowd-puller puja, with shelter as its theme, depicted a man resting under a tree and recording the chirping of birds. There were plenty of securitymen but they were lazing about. The fire safety measures were good.        
	Kasba Pally Sangha did not have a ladies toilet or emergency lights. Kasba Kheyali Sanghas presentation of a fishing village with boats made entrance and exit difficult. Ramalal Bazar Sarbojanin Durgotsab Committee had a dirty toilet and a decrepit wheelchair. The first aid box was locked away somewhere.         
	Most organisers spoke of their community work. The bomb scare ensured that most had taken security seriously.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Arms racket across border
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Arms racket across border
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Bangladeshi criminal Subrata Bayen, who was arrested on October 13 in a Palm Avenue flat, was allegedly running an international arms smuggling racket from the city.        
	According to officers of the Special Task Force (STF), Bayens men would steal imported pistols from the Bangladesh police armoury and smuggle them to Calcutta.        
	Investigations revealed that improvised firearms made in Bihar are in demand in Bangladesh and are routinely smuggled across the border.         
	In exchange, 9-mm pistols made in Italy and Germany would be stolen from the Bangladesh police armoury and smuggled to Calcutta, said an STF officer.        
	The arrangement worked because the 9-mm pistols fetched a higher price in India than in Bangladesh, while the Bihar-made arms are more affordable for criminals across the border, the officer explained.        
	Bayen visited a number of countries, including Dubai, Nepal and Hong Kong. We are probing whether his business network extended to these countries, too, said Rajeev Kumar, the special additional commissioner of police (STF).        
	A most wanted criminal on the list of Interpol, Bayen had been living in Calcutta for the past few years and also ran an extortion racket in his country.        
	Sleuths said Bayen had earned several crores in the past few years. He was also planning to invest in Tollywood, they added.

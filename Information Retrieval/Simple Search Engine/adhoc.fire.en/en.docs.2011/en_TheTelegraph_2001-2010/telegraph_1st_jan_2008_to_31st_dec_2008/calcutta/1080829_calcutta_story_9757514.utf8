          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The second panel set up by Calcutta University to probe the sexual molestation charges against a teacher of Viharilal College of Home and Social Science filed its report on Thursday.        
	Sources said the university syndicate had forwarded the report to the sexual harassment complaints committee for final investigation.        
	The authorities had to set up the second panel as the students of the college were not satisfied with the first probe report that had reportedly given a clean chit to the accused, Indubhusan Mondal.        
	A postgraduate student of the college had lodged a complaint in December alleging that Mondal had molested her on November 30. The university had set up a one-member panel headed by Sanjukta Dasgupta, the dean of arts, to probe the allegation.        
	But no action was taken against Mondal. In protest, the students boycotted Mondals classes.

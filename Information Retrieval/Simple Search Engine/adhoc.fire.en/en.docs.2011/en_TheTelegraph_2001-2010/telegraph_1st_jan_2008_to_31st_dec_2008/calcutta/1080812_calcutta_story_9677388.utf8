                      Panorama of contemporary art                     Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life, Spanish avant garde artist Pablo Picasso, had remarked. Dan Rice had defined art thus: There are three forms of visual art: Painting is art to look at, sculpture is art you can walk around, and architecture is art you can walk through. Times have changed and experimentation with form, medium and content have been carried out from time to time, widening further the scope of the interpretation. The current exhibition of drawings and paintings titled, Art for Life, by well-known artists of the country, both senior and upcoming talents, once again emphasises Picassos observation. Hosted by members of All India Institute of Medical Technologies, the show is in aid of World Congress of Biomedical Science. The show is worth a visit for both connoisseurs of art as well as art lovers to watch a wide spectrum of the very best works of contemporary artists from all corners of the country. It is exhilarating to witness a priceless treasure-trove where a Paritosh Sen or Ram Kumar frame shares space with Tapas Konar or Mona Rai; Haku Shah or Anjolie Ela Menons works are on display along with Thota Vaikuntham or Gopi Gojwani, or an Aditya Basak painting next to a Jogen Chowdhury (a painting by him appears here), Paresh Maity, Rabin Mondal or Jaya Ganguly frame. On the whole, a very satiating experience, one that Calcuttans will remember for long.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A young peon of an engineering company lost his job and landed in jail on Wednesday after allegedly trying to cheat his employer of Rs 9 lakh by cooking up a story.         
	The city head of the South India-based firm where Ajay Banik worked had asked him to encash a Rs 9-lakh cheque in a central Calcutta bank. The peon, in his early 20s, set off for the bank from the Clive Row office around 12.30pm, said an officer of Hare Street police station.         
	He returned to the office around 4pm with his clothes dirty and torn. He told the employer that a woman drugged him after he came out of the bank with the money.        
	The woman offered me a glass of water. I passed out after drinking the water and do not know what happened after that. When I came to, the handbag in which I had kept the money was gone. The shopkeepers in the area could not say where the woman went, Banik allegedly told his boss.        
	He was not convinced with the account and lodged a complaint with Hare Street police station. Banik was brought to the police station and interrogated for over an hour.        
	We were suspicious about Baniks story from the very beginning. During interrogation, he started making contradictory statements. He started claiming that somebody had hit him on the back of his head and fled with the bag, said an investigating officer.        
	A team of policemen raided Baniks house in Charu Market, where he lives with his wife and child, and found the entire amount there.         
	A preliminary investigation revealed that Banik had returned home after withdrawing Rs 9 lakh from the bank and handed over the amount to his wife.

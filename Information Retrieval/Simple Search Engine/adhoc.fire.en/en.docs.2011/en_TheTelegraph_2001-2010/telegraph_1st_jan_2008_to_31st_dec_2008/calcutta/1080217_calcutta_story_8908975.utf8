The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rhythm of warm and cool
                                                                                                               Rhythm of warm and cool
										      eyewitness                                Works by Siraj Saxena (top) and Anju Chaudhuri				                           
	Siraj Saxena, whose works are being exhibited at Anant Art Gallery in Alipore, is a familiar name from Bharat Bhavan in Bhopal. On the face of it Saxenas canvases depict farmland, water bodies and rivers, much the same way as Ganesh Haloi. But their sensibilities are poles apart.        
	Saxena, unlike Haloi, uses bright, often scintillating colours that burn like fire. He uses various shades of blue, from midnight to cobalt, brown, orange, yellow and various shades of green, the colours sometimes layered over each other, lurking underneath like a shadow. In a couple of instances there are contrasting shades like strawberry pink and sea green which can be striking.        
	The rectangular space he works on turns into an interplay of light and dark shades, which he creates by stippling the surface to create a kantha-like effect. Saxena also creates a ripple effect to suggest water bodies, or repeats over an area a more ornamental design usually seen in Oriental watercolours.        
	Of course, Saxena is not interested in depicting farmland. As the eye glides from one canvas to the other in various shades of often contrasting shades, it is the successive fields of colour that it gravitates to first. These works hover somewhere in between abstract and representation, veering closer to the former. Their references to actual farmland notwithstanding, Saxena seems to be more interested in the rhythm of light and shadow, warm and cool shades.               
	Anju Chaudhuri is based in Paris, but every winter she returns to this city, and occasionally she does hold exhibitions of her work. This time she has chosen to display her paintings on canvas and paper and prints at Gallery Sanskriti.        
	Nature continues to be Chaudhuris inspiration, and her interest lies mainly in autumn leaves floating in the breeze and flowers of the potpourri variety. It is true that by using vividly contrasting ribbons and dabs of yellows, greens and reds she manages to create an impression of nature going about her business of making vegetation and foliage come to life.        
	But greens  especially a whole roomful of them  can get to you. One may feel nostalgic about the state of nature, but too much of chlorophyll can put off people born in cities, however polluted.         
	Chaudhuris watercolour paintings on Chinese paper in the format of a scroll are more interesting. The colours cascade like a waterfall or rivulet down the surface of paper.        
	Her prints are quite charming. In these also she brings together impressions of twigs, flowers and foliage. Chaudhuri takes more liberties in this medium, and sometimes reduces a twig to a mere shadow, or a petal to a stroke of lavender.        
	Chaudhuri is a skilled painter but perhaps she should give veggies a break.       SOUMITRA DAS

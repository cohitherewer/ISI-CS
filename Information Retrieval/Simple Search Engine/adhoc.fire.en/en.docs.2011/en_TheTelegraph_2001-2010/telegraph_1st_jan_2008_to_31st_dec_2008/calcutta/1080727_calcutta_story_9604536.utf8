The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | He is 70, going on 17 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       He is 70, going on 17

	Friday evening saw the launch of Woodwinds of Change, the authorised biography of Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, written by Surjit Singh.         
	The maestro, who turned 70 this July, insisted that he isnt 70, but 17. I never look back. Theres still so much to learn. And standing here in front of so many of you makes me nervous, he smiled.         
	Panditjis sense of humour was stressed by the anchor. He chose to play the raag Bhupali when invited to perform at a charity function, she said. When asked why he chose the raag he explained: Bhupali me ma (pronounced muh ) aur ni nahi hote hain. Muh-ni or money is hardly found in the raag Bhupali or charity events.         
	But this launch at The ITC Sonar, with a cocktail party before the recital, was not about charity. The raag chosen was not Bhupali and there was plenty of mah-ni going around. We could have added in the room the women come and go talking of Michaelangelo, only they talked about saris. I am tired of wearing my daughter-in-laws saris, admitted one woman to another. The other sympathised, saying her daughter-in-law too doesnt wear saris  she wastes them. It hurts to see the contents of her cupboard, she added.               
	On Swamijis trail         
	Did you know the couple that Vivekananda stayed with in Chicago? The parties they took him to, where he was deeply uncomfortable?         
	Asim Chaudhuri, an NRI from the US has dug out little known facts from the life of Swami Vivekananda, particularly during his stay in the US.         
	His recent book Swami Vivekananda in America: New Findings was launched in the city at Advaita Ashrama this week.         
	Chaudhuri, a metallurgist by profession, was posted in Chicago in 1993, the centenary year of Swami Vivekanandas address at the Parliament of Religions. He traced Swamijis footprints through Illinois and Indiana and the result was his first book, Swami Vivekananda in Chicago , New Findings.         
	His second and latest book places his research on Swamiji in a broader context of the US . There were certain mysteries associated with Swamiji. The two major ones in America were the Case of the Mystery couple in Chicago and the Mystery of the Twelfth Student at Thousand Island Park (Swamijis twelfth disciple). I have solved both these mysteries and a few more in my two books, claims the author. His next sojourn will be through Europe as he goes on Vivekanandas trail there.

	This may not have a huge impact on the economy, but its rather annoying. Stretches of Salt Lake abound with advertisements of government-organised exhibitions that are long over. One such is the terracotta festival, which was held over May and June at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC). But small hoardings announcing the festival are still mounted on the lamp posts on way to Sector V from Karunamayee. An erstwhile handicrafts exhibition at the same venue is still advertised too. The hoardings light up the night, but wouldnt it be wiser to take them off and spend electricity on a current exhibition?

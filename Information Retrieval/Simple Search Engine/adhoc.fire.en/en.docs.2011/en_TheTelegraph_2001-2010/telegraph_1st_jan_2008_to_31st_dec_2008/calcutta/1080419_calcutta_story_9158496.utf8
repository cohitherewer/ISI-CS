  - Suranjan Das unanimous choice as vice-chancellor          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Suranjan Das: Favoured for the helm. A Telegraph picture                                        
	The Calcutta University senate on Friday unanimously elected Suranjan Das as vice-chancellor (VC).         
	Das, who has been the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of the university for the past six years, will join office once Chancellor Gopalkrishna Gandhi formally approves the appointment.        
	The 54-year-old VC-elect, a teacher of history, did his D.Phil on communal riots in Bengal between 1905 and 1947 from Oxford University.         
	He stood first in both BA and MA and has received 12 international and eight national awards for his contribution to the subject.        
	The name of Das  who, sources said, was a favourite of Anil Biswas and is also close to Jyoti Basu  was proposed by Ashis Ray, a leader of the CPM-backed teachers association.        
	But before that, CPM leaders looking after the recruitment to crucial posts in state-run educational institutions went into a huddle and okayed Dass candidature.        
	The senate meeting began around 3pm, only after Alimuddin Street let its choice known to the university, said a source. There was no word of dissent after Dass name was proposed.        
	Suranjan Das is a renowned historian with a brilliant academic record. He has also proved his mettle as administrator during his tenure as pro vice-chancellor (academic). We cannot have a better candidate for the vice-chancellors post, said Ray.        
	A lot of developments are taking place in the field of education. The university needs an efficient academician like Das at the helm. The senate has taken the right decision, said a former colleague of the VC-elect.        
	Since Das is the unanimous choice of the senate, his appointment now awaits only a formal approval of Governor Gandhi, who is also chancellor of the university.        
	According to the rules, if the senate fails to reach unanimity, it can elect a panel of three candidates for the post. The chancellor, in consultation with the state higher education department, then makes the final choice.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Jadavpur University vice-chancellor has called for stepping up of vigilance following a complaint of ragging.        
	The father of a first-year student of architecture alleged that a group of seniors had ragged his daughter on campus in broad daylight on Wednesday. The authorities refused to disclose the identity of the victim or how she was ragged, but said the student was a resident of Salt Lake.        
	All department heads and members of the universitys anti-ragging committee met vice-chancellor P N. Ghosh on Thursday afternoon and discussed the issue.        
	The university is taking the complaint very seriously. Appropriate action will be taken, in accordance with the norms laid down by the Supreme Court and the state government, if the complaint is found to be true, said Partha Pratim Biswas, a member of the executive council.        
	The university authorities and student unions differ over steps to shield freshers from ragging. One suggestion was to put up freshers in a separate hostel, but student unions are opposed to the proposal.        
	Ragging has long been banned by the Centre and the state government. Students in almost every institution now gives a written undertaking stating that they would not take part in ragging.

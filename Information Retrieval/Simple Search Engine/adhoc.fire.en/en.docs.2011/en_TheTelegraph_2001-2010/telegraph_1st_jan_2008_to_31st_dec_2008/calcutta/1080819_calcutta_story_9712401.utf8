The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hello, high street!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hello, high street!

	Gurusaday Road is set to turn into a high street retail destination with superbrands setting up shop at the newly constructed Atria complex due to open doors before the Pujas.         
	A G+1 concrete and glass structure, Atria, if its promoters are to be believed, will be home to super luxury brands in apparel and lifestyle. There were talks with Gucci and Versace but nothing has been finalised yet was all that promoter Harsh Patodia, the managing director of Heritage Group, would offer.         
	While high street retail is not unknown to the city with Marks and Spencer and Bodyshop outlets on Chowringhee, it will be a first in this part of the city, which saw the first multi-storeyed apartment, the Tivoli Court, come up 50 years ago.         
	On a one-acre campus at 23, Gurusaday Road, the Rs 15-crore cream-and-blue structure designed by J.P. Agarwal was commissioned as a joint venture between The Heritage and the P.S. Group.         
	A condo of luxury apartments called Astral has come up in the backyard of Atria.         
	The residential enclosure with a total of 35 flats has a separate entrance on Ballygunge Circular Road with separate lifts and escalators, while Atria, opposite Mainland China, will stand as a flagship of the residential complex.        
	Gurusaday Road was a predominantly residential area till Mainland China and Barista happened. Keeping in mind the ambience and the potential purchasing power of residents here, the builders of Atria have opted for a two-storey super brand market plaza that will have only eight outlets with floor space not less than 700 sq ft each.         
	We will only have brands with basic signages. The idea is not to encourage window shoppers but serious buyers who will drop in for the specific brands, said Ravi Kumar Dugar, the director of the PS Group.         
	The residential block Astral is G+14 catering to the high income group, each with super-built up area varying between 2,500 and 3,300 sq ft.         
	There is a rush for apartments in the higher storeys as people prefer to avoid pollution and filth, said Dugar. This is because of the levels of pollution, both air and sound, in Calcutta. The closer one lives to the ground, the more one is exposed to it, he added.         
	The entertainment quotient is upped by an air-conditioned community hall on the double-height ground floor with an open-air swimming pool, rest room and table tennis corner on the floor above. While construction is almost complete, work is on in full gear so that Atria and Astral meet the Puja deadline, said Dugar.                                Talat Salahuddin

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Night vigil for rogue cars
                                                                                                               Night vigil for rogue cars

	Calcutta police on Wednesday announced plans to maintain overnight vigil on roads to curb rash driving.        
	From today, officers from police stations will note down the numbers of vehicles that violate traffic rules at night and pass them on to the traffic department, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	Elaborating on what had prompted the move, he said: A study has revealed that one-third of the mishaps take place between 10pm and 6am, when there are no traffic policemen on the road. Reckless driving is behind most of the mishaps.        
	Nearly 150 people in 2006 and 132 people in 2007 were killed in road mishaps at night, when traffic policemen were off duty.        
	As an experiment, policemen monitored 50 intersections in the city on Tuesday night and spotted more than 500 cars flouting traffic signals.        
	On an average, 2,500 vehicles are booked during the day for violating traffic signals. If the corresponding figure at night, when fewer vehicles ply, is 500, then the situation is alarming, said Chakrabarti.        
	In the first phase, the police have planned to be on the lookout for rule violations at 50 major crossings, including Shyambazar, Moulali, Sinthee and Park Circus.         
	The vigil will spread to another 50 crossings shortly, said Chakrabarti.        
	The traffic signals will be kept in automatic mode at the 50 crossings and drivers will have to follow the lights. We have plans to install hidden cameras with a gadget to read the registration numbers of vehicles that violate the lights, added Chakrabarti.        
	The Lalbazar top brass admitted that it would not be possible for the traffic department to keep an eye on rogue motorists throughout the night because of inadequate manpower. We have selected the intersections where police stations have set up kiosks. Additional manpower has been sought for the traffic department from the state government, said an officer.        
	nNew set-up: The police commissioner announced on Wednesday that personnel at the police stations would be divided into two groups  one for investigation, and the other for law-and-order duty.        
	This will speed up the investigation process. The system will initially be implemented in 10 police stations from March 1, he said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          A car has been stolen from the parking zone of Calcutta airports international terminal. A Telegraph picture                                  
	A mystery man named Mr John asked a car rental to send him a big vehicle to the airport to pick up relatives on Sunday and then disappeared.         
	So did the Tata Sumo from the parking lot of Calcutta airports international terminal.        
	The owner of the car, who had lent it to the rental service, registered a complaint with the airport police station on Monday.        
	The only lead so far is Johns cellphone number, but the phone is switched off since the theft.        
	He had called up Vinod Singh, who runs Sengars International, in Bowbazar, around 12.30pm on Sunday. Mr John said he was an officer in a private company with which I have done a lot of business. He wanted a big car to pick up relatives who were to arrive at the international airport around 2pm, said Singh.        
	He wanted to send an Ambassador to the airport, but Mr John insisted on a big car. Singh, therefore, borrowed the Tata Sumo of his neighbour Chittaranjan Barua.        
	Krishna Ram, who has been driving for the company for over a decade, took the car to the airport to pick up the group. He reached around 1.40pm and parked in the international terminal lot.        
	Ram called up John and was told to wait in the arrival lounge with a placard in hand for the passengers, said a senior officer of the police station. The driver locked the car, leaving the parking slip inside, put the keys in the pocket and entered the terminal building.        
	When there was no sign of the passengers after 20 minutes, Ram tried to call up John, only to find that the phone had been switched off. He went to the parking lot to drive back but the car was gone.        
	Bystanders said they had not seen the Sumo being driven away. Ram informed Singh immediately.        
	The investigators suspect a racket is behind the theft.

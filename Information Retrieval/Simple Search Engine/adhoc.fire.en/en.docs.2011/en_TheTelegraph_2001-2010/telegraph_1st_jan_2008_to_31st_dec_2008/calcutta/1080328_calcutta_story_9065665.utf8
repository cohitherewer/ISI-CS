                                                                                                               Friends detained
  - Scent of woman in youth disappearance        A STAFF REPORTER                           Pratik Guptas motorcycle outside his flat. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Sleuths probing Pratik Guptas disappearance a fortnight ago and his return on Wednesday are focussing on some of his friends, who do not have a clean record.        
	An officer said some of the friends have been detained and some houses in Howrah and North 24-Parganas raided. Police also suspect a womans role in the disappearance.        
	Pratiks family had lodged a missing diary with New Market police station on March 10, a day after he went missing. The detective department later started an abduction case.        
	There are several inconsistencies in the youths statements and we are trying to verify them, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	This is a sensitive case and it wont be proper to make premature statements. Our teams have raided various places and have even spoken to a few who might have witnessed the entire episode, he added.        
	The sleuths have also come to know during interrogation that Pratik, who lives with his parents and siblings in an SN Banerjee Road flat, had walked into a debt trap. We are trying to find out whether the disappearance was linked to it, said an officer.        
	Whatever Pratik said was not convincing. It could just be that he went with someone he knew, the officer added.        
	The family members claimed that they had left for Jharkhand on March 8, leaving Pratik behind. When they returned around 11pm the next day, Pratik could not be found. His motorcycle was lying unlocked.        
	Early on Wednesday, the family members opened the apartment door responding to the doorbell and found Pratik lying unconscious.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airport upgrade deferred
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Airport upgrade deferred
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The upgrade of Calcutta airports instrument landing system (ILS) has been delayed because of non-availability of a calibration aircraft that is required to test the equipment.        
	Thought the new ILS has been installed at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport, it needs to be tested before it can be made operational.         
	The testing is done by a special calibration aircraft and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has only one such aircraft that is based in Delhi.        
	The aircraft is not available now and we have no information on when we will get it, said a senior airport official in Calcutta.        
	As soon as we receive information from Delhi about the aircrafts availability, we will close the obsolete ILS and remove it, he added.        
	On October 3, representatives of AAI and different airlines decided at a meeting that the old ILS would be replaced this month. While the new system is calibrated, the airport will have to function without the ILS for about a week.         
	The old ILS was scheduled to be shut down on Friday, but that has now been deferred.        
	Airline officials were apprehensive that the replacement would lead to disruption in flight services in case visibility dropped below 1,300 metres because of bad weather, but had agreed to the proposal since the change was long overdue.        
	We hope the switchover takes place at a time when it causes minimal flight disruptions, an airline official said.        
	The new state-of-the-art ILS equipment has been imported from the US at a cost of Rs 1 crore. The existing ILS was installed in March 1993. It should have been replaced after 10 to 12 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rebate row at mall
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rebate row at mall
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Shoppers clashed with guards and officials of a newly inaugurated mall in Sodepur on Thursday afternoon after the authorities closed it down on orders from the fire brigade.         
	Customers had started queuing up outside Sriniketan, on Station Road, since morning to buy garments at 20 per cent discount, which the mall authorities had announced to celebrate the inauguration.         
	The 40,000 sq ft retail outlet was inaugurated by actress Rituparna Sengupta in the morning, after which fire brigade officers arrived for inspection.         
	The shopping spirit was dampened after the fire services officers  not satisfied with the malls preparedness to fight a blaze  refused to allow the store to be opened.         
	We went to the new shopping complex to check the fire- safety measures as there was a fire-related mishap in an adjacent shop a few months ago. Since the new shop didnt have adequate fire-safety measures, we asked the authorities not to open it, said G. Ghosh, the divisional fire officer of Barrackpore.         
	The department did not want to take chances following the fire at Readymade Centre, barely 15 metres from Sriniketan, that killed 13 people on May 16.         
	When we pulled down the shutters, the customers waiting outside turned violent and tried to force their way in. Our guards had to prevent them from entering, said an official of Sriniketan.         
	According to residents, the guards manhandled the customers, who were patiently waiting outside the store.         
	If we were told that the store would not open because of an objection from the fire department, we would have definitely left the place. But instead, they began pushing us, said Tarun Saha, who came from Madhyamgram for his Puja shopping.        
	Police detained four security guards of the mall after residents complained against them.

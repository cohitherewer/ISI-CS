	Science City threw open a new two-storey gallery on the Earths biodiversity from December 9. Called the Earth Exploration Hall, it will commemorate the International Year of Planet Earth, as declared by the United Nations General Assembly.         
	Inaugurated by Union tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni on December 6, the gallery  built at a cost of Rs 2.6 crores over 15 months  has 48 exhibits, all developed by the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), the umbrella body under which Science City operates.         
	The gallery  which visitors can check out without having to shell out anything extra  has several interactive and bilingual audio-visual terminals around a 25 metre dia-hemispherical globe.         
	The gallery is divided into 30 degree segments corresponding to the Earths latitude. Each segment enumerates the geological phenomena, culture, flora and fauna of the region. For instance, videos from the Northern Hemisphere near the pole include an Inuit building an igloo, deep sea volcanoes and underwater life of the region.         
	Curiosities like globes that play the national anthem of the country when touched or say a recorded line in the national language, are sure to be a hit with children.         
	Today, information is easily available over the Internet. The challenge for our software team was to develop the data retrieval systems that would hook peoples interest and lead them to explore further, said R. Manigandan, the curator of Science City. The USP of the gallery lies models like the 3D world map on a table that can be scrolled by tilting the table and rotating screens that correspond with images in front of it. The screens replace the mouses function in a PC.         
	Models also simulate tornado, earthquake and the Coriolis force explaining the movement of winds.         
	With this gallery we hope to increase our footfall from 14 lakh to 18 lakh a year, said Ingit Mukherjee, the director- general of NCSM.         
	There are plans to have more galleries within the campus as part of a five-year plan, says Mukherjee. In the area to the left of the Earth Exploration Hall, we will have a science exploration area, with three galleries devoted to emerging technologies, including nanotechnology, biotechnology, microelectronics and one dedicated to Indian heritage in science and technology, he said. Construction for the new galleries is underway.

	Lessons on heritage                  The Loreto College campus      
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation may not have taken significant measures to protect the built heritage of the city but there is a growing awareness of the citys past and the need to preserve it.

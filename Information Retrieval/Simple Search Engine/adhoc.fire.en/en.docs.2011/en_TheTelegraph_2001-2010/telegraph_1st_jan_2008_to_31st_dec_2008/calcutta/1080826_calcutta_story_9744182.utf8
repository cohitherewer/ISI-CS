	The womens unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Calcutta branch, in association with The Telegraph in Schools, organised a workshop, Turbulent teens, at the Indian Science Congress Exhibition Hall on August 16. This was part of a series of workshops organised by IMA  the first one on sex education in schools having taken place on July 1.         
	Every teenager faces mental turbulence while growing up. They cant always open up to their parents. Thats where doctors come in. We try to help them solve the problems of adolescence, said Dr Sarbari Dutta, the chairperson of the womens unit. The participants on August 16 included parents, teachers and students from St James School, St Thomas School (Boys and Girls) Kidderpore, Mansur Habibulla Memorial School and Loreto Day School, Sealdah.         
	The high point of the workshop was a discussion  titled Papa dont preach  that saw veteran Congress politician Nirbed Roy, director Ashoke Viswanathan, Sister Cyril, the principal of Loreto Day School, Sealdah and Krishnendu Mukherjee of CMRI Hospital speaking on the role of parents in the growing years of a child. Ashim Jaikrishan of St James School and Trijita Mukherjee of St Thomas (Girls) represented the student community in the discussion.        
	Jaikrishan said that instead of preaching, parents should set an example before their kids. Let teens think for themselves, said the Class XI student.        
	He who can, does; he who cannot, teaches, quoted Viswanathan from George Bernard Shaw to emphasise the futility of empty preaching. Most speakers felt that in order to bridge the communication gap, parents and children should be open to interaction.        
	Following the debate, there was an interactive session. Women achievers Sister Cyril and Dr Mala Chattopadhyay of CMRI were also felicitated.

	Traffic training for children        
	A computer game on the right way to cross roads, puzzles and card games illustrating road safety  these were part of an automobile companys project to educate children in traffic safety. The Toyota Safety Education Programme (TSEP), directed at students of six to 12 years, was launched on the second week of August at St Xaviers Collegiate School. The project was launched in Bangalore last year. It will cover students of Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi this year.         
	A seven-minute animation film on small mistakes leading to big accidents was shown at the launch. It explained the need to follow oft-flouted rules like wearing a helmet, avoiding rash driving and using the zebra crossing. TSEP has identified three kinds of accidents: pedestrian-related, those happening due to road conditions and bad infrastructure facility.         
	Transport secretary Sumantra Choudhury said: Efforts are being made to introduce traffic rules and regulations as a compulsory subject in schools.        
	There will be five-minute instruction sessions during social studies or moral science classes to cover aspects of traffic safety. Traffic booths displaying messages will also be installed in the school premises to ensure active participation of children.

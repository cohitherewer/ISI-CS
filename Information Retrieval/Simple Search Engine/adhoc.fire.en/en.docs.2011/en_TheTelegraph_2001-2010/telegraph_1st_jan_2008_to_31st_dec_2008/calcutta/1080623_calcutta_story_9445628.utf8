                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Research edge for Besu students

	The first batch of students pursuing their masters in robotics at Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) is now attending classes at Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute.        
	The Durgapur institute is one of the three leading research and development organisations across India that the university has tied up with to offer the two-year M.Tech in robotics and mechatronics (mechanics plus electronics). The other two institutes are Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO) in Chandigarh and Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute in Pilani.        
	With funds from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the three institutes pursue industry-oriented research of global standards. The coordinator of the Besu course, Subhasis Bhaumik, believes they are the best such centres in India. The students, currently in their second semester, have been to all three.         
	The university signed an MoU with the research hubs while starting the robotics course last year. The stints at the institutes will familiarise students with the latest equipment. The tie-ups are in keeping with the universitys stress on research and development, said Bhaumik.        
	Tanmoy Kanti Das, one of the students, said: At the institutes, we were exposed to research projects that are not undertaken at the university level. For instance, at CSIO, the principles of robotics are being applied to simulate finger movement in artificial limbs.        
	The students will write their dissertations after spending the third and the fourth semesters at the institutes.        
	The robotics course is the only masters level programme in West Bengal. IIT Kharagpur and Jadavpur University offer special papers on robotics to engineering students. The multi-disciplinary nature of the subject will provide students an edge over their counterparts in conventional streams, said Bhaumik.         
	Entry is open to those with BE and B.Tech degrees. Twenty seats are kept for those who have cleared GATE, 10 for industry-financed candidates and CSIR employees. The fee is Rs 18,000 per semester. There are 18 students in the first batch.        
	The Anandakrishnan Committee had recommended a Rs 10-crore grant to upgrade the departments infrastructure.

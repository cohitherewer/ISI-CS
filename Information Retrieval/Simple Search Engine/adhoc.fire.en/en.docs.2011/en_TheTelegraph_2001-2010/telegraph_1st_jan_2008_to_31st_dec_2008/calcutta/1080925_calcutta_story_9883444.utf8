  - Shells inert, says Army          A STAFF REPORTER                          The chest that triggered panic at Howrah station on Wednesday afternoon. A Telegraph picture                                        
	South Eastern Railway has suspended five employees for dereliction of duty that resulted in a daylong bomb scare at Howrah station on Tuesday.         
	A chest of mortar shells that was supposed to have been offloaded in Balasore made its way to Howrah station and lay abandoned in a luggage compartment, triggering panic.        
	An employee of the parcel department at Balasore, two train examiners and two guards of the train were punished on Wednesday for the oversight.        
	Railway sources said the chest was the only one in a consignment to be left behind. This would not have happened had the guards and the rest of the staff been careful, said a senior official.        
	The chest, meant for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), reached the Santragachhi car shed unnoticed. It was detected at Howrah station after the luggage rake was attached to the Howrah-Bhadrak passenger train. Government Railway Police (GRP) have decided to start a case under the Indian Explosives Act against unknown persons for dereliction of duty.        
	On Tuesday night, officials from the Gun and Shell Factory in Cossipore took away the chest. The shells must be stored safely. We felt the Gun and Shell Factory would be the right place to keep the shells, a senior railway official said.        
	The army didnt take custody of the shells since they were inert and not part of the forces inventory.        
	If the shells were not inert, they would not have been transported in that manner. Our officers checked the shells and certified them as inert, said Group Captain R.K. Das, a defence spokesperson.        
	The chest would finally be sent to Chandipur range but the modalities would be worked out later, added Das.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Market muck poses mishap threat
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Market muck poses mishap threat
          ONTHESPOT - COLLEGE STREET                            (From top) The slushy stretch where Manisha Jaiswal died in a mishap; schoolchildren board a speeding bus. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                          
	Nothing much has changed on College Street a week after 11-year-old Manisha Jaiswal was mowed down by a bus when her fathers motorcycle skidded on the slushy road and threw her to the ground.         
	Mud water from the construction work at College Street market continues to spill over to the thoroughfare, turning it into a death trap.                   
	While Bengal Shelter Housing Development has barricaded the footpath skirting the market, hawkers rule the opposite pavement. With both sides of the road blocked, pedestrians have no choice but to take the peril path along with speeding vehicles.         
	There is no bus-shed on the stretch and often buses just slow down at the College Street-MG Road crossing to pick up commuters. The two-way tram traffic on College Street makes matters worse.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), Calcutta police and Bengal Shelter inspected the killer corridor two days after the accident, but a proper plan is yet to be put in place.         
	Bengal Shelter has been asked to reopen the footpath and ensure that the slush from the construction work doesnt spill over to the main road, said Md. Salahuddin Pervez, the officer-in-charge of Sealdah Traffic Guard which oversees the College Street-MG Road crossing.         
	We will do what the CMC and Calcutta police have asked us to do, assured a spokesperson for Bengal Shelter. We havent been able to reopen the footpath as work is going on underground. The slush is the result of the lack of a proper drainage system in the market, he explained.        
	The police, busy pointing fingers, are yet to get their act together. Seven guardrails and a couple of no-parking boards are dumped near the mishap spot, eating up more roadspace. Further down, Bidhan Sarani looks scarier. Just after the Bata crossing, the vegetable market sprawls over half the road width.        
	Councillorspeak        
	Sudeb Das, the CPM councillor of ward 39, pleads helplessness: I have written to the mayor, municipal commissioner, member mayor-in-council of the drainage department and the market manager to put pressure on Bengal Shelter to stop the slush flow. But none of them has ever called me for a discussion. As a councillor, I have no control over the market.         
	Dass jurisdiction includes College Street and the footpath bordering the market, while Foara Dutta, the councillor of ward 40, oversees the opposite footpath occupied by hawkers.        
	Not only hawkers, big shops are creating trouble too. Many of them stock their goods on the footpath. The shopowners are hand-in-glove with the police. We will start a campaign to raise awareness on this issue. If the shopkeepers dont comply, we will confiscate their goods, warned the RSP councillor.

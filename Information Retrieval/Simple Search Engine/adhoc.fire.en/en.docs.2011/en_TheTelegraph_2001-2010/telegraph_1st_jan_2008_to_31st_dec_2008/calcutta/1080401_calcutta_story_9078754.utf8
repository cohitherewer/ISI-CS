The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Besu call to talks table for normality
                                                                                                               Besu call to talks table for normality
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	As a first tentative step towards normalising the situation at Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea has called a meeting of all stakeholders, including teachers, heads of departments, hostel superintendents and non-academic staff, at 11.30am on Tuesday.         
	The vice-chancellor will also meet the students separately on the same day.         
	This is the first attempt on the part of the authorities to initiate a dialogue with the aggrieved students after the spate in unrest on the campus from March 19.        
	Though efforts have started to ensure normality on campus, the authorities will retain the security cover. In a meeting of the board of management of the university on Monday, it was decided that the police patrol on campus would continue indefinitely.        
	The highest decision-making body of Besu also decided that the FIRs against students involved in campus clashes would not be withdrawn.         
	While SFI supporters on the Besu campus welcomed the developments, a cross-section of students was unhappy with the decisions.        
	These steps will not benefit the university. The board seems to be encouraging students to abandon their studies and do the rounds of courts, said students spokesman Shyamasish Das, adding that they would continue with their movement.         
	The board of management also ratified the state governments decision to appoint a one-man committee of former Besu vice-chancellor Sparshamani Chattopadhyay to probe the unrest on campus.         
	The committee will get three months to submit its findings, said registrar Biman Bandopadhyay.         
	Chattopadhyay was not available for comment.

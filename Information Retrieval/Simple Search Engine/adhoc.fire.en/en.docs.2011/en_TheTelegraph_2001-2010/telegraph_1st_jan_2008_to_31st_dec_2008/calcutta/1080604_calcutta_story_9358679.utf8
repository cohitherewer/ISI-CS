The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dry spell warning for tipplers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dry spell warning for tipplers
  - Excise embargo on IMFL import leaves watering holes parched           ZEESHAN JAWED                                              
	Brace yourself for a drought, Calcutta, and we arent talking about a freak weather phenomenon forcing the monsoon to skip the city.        
	An excise embargo on the import of liquor brewed outside Bengal has left the city high and dry about three months after the order took effect without anybody except distributors and retailers knowing about it.        
	The first signs of the dry spell came on the last day of the IPL, when most of those who had planned a cocktail of T20, Fosters and Bacardi came back from liquor stores either empty-handed or settled for local brands.        
	The embargo on distribution of Indian-Made Foreign Liquor manufactured outside the state was triggered by the excise departments discovery that some companies were allegedly fudging accounts to evade duties.        
	The loss of excise duty runs into several crores of rupees. We have asked the firms to come clean, a superintendent of the departments northern division said.        
	An official of one of the targeted companies claimed that the excise departments move was meant to boost the sales of local brands.        
	For those who love their drink, be it a bottle of whisky, a beer or a pint of Breezer, the unkindest cut of all is the excise departments decision not to lift the embargo until the companies rectify their accounts.        
	So, what if the standoff continues for months?         
	Businessman Ajay Talreja is one of those who would rather not drink. I asked for a carton of Fosters on Sunday and the salesman at the Salt Lake store said there was no supply. He offered me Kalyani Black Label, which I wouldnt buy.        
	The star hotels and discotheques are feeling the pinch, too. I have beer stocks to last only two weekends and not a single bottle of Bacardi Breezer, said the manager of a central Calcutta nightspot.        
	The average monthly consumption of Bacardi Breezer in the city is 20,000 cases and beer nearly five lakh cases. The makers of Kalyani Black Label are already struggling to meet the demand, which increases by almost 40 per cent between March and June.

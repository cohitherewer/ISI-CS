          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the district judge of Alipore court to conduct an inquiry into the functioning of the Kalighat temple and find out whether the temple committee was violating court directives.         
	Justice Girish Gupta asked the district judge, who is ex-officio chairman of the Kali Temple Committee (KTC), to submit a detailed report in the second week of June.         
	The order was passed on a petition by Ashok Haldar, a sebayet of the temple. He alleged that the president and secretary of the KTC were allowing paladars (who offer puja by turns) to sell palas (the right to offer puja) to outsiders against payment of large sums.         
	Haldars counsel Pradip Roy said: Two years ago, the court had framed guidelines on management of daily offerings to the goddess and related temple affairs. But the KTC is not following the guidelines. As a result a chaotic situation is prevailing in the temple.        
	The high court in 2006 had directed the KTC to take all possible steps to stop selling of palas by the sebayets. The sebayets are members of the Haldar family, which once owned the temple.        
	According to a 40-year-old Supreme Court judgment, sebayets are entitled to get the chance to offer puja by turns. The high court had intervened after the majority of the sebayets started selling palas.        
	The court had also directed the KTC to ensure that the bhog was offered to the goddess in time and a record was kept of the offerings by the devotees. Roy alleged that the KTC was not performing the duties.         
	Pandas are still active in the temple compound and thousands of visitors are regularly harassed by them. Some of the sebayets are helping the pandas, said Roy.        
	To stop panda raj in the temple, the high court, in a separate order, had restrained them from entering the sanctum sanctorum.        
	According to Roy, pandas are still entering the inner chamber. The KTC has also failed to maintain the temple and its surrounding buildings, Roy further alleged.

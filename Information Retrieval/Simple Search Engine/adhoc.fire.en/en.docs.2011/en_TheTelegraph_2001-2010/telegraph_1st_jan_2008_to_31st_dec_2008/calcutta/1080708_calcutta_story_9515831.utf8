          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	The state government on Monday announced a string of measures to improve fire fighting in highrise buildings.        
	Pratim Chatterjee, the fire services minister, said in the Assembly that the government had earmarked Rs 30.60 crore  received from the Centres calamity fund  to procure equipment from abroad.        
	In addition to two 54-metre long ladders, we have decided to buy a 70-metre long ladder, for which we have floated a global tender. The ladder will help us to put out flames in large commercial buildings and highrises, said Chatterjee in response to a question by Jane Alam Mian of the RSP. The ladder is expected to cost about Rs 9.5 crore.        
	The minister said the government would also strengthen its vigil on multi-storeyed commercial and residential buildings to ensure that they do not violate the norms.        
	We have made it mandatory for highrise buildings to have a helipad on the roof. For example, the builders of a 40-storeyed hotel in Rajarhat agreed to set up a helipad, said the minister.         
	The government has also floated global tenders for buying heat- and fire-proof proximity suits that will allow firemen to go very close to fires.        
	According to Chatterjee, fire fighting in Nandaram Market was hampered because the firemen could not go up to the affected floors because of the heat. The special suits will allow firemen to go very close to the fire, he added.        
	The government will initially buy 20 seven-layer proximity suits, each costing about Rs 3 lakh. Firemen will be able to walk through the flames wearing these suits.        
	The government will also buy 55 three-layer proximity suits, costing about Rs 1.20 lakh each. These suits will allow firemen to operate from only four feet away from the flames.        
	The upgrade drive also includes setting up of fire service stations in Rajarhat, Salt Lake, Jadavpur University campus and Dankuni.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta University has shown a marked answer script to a student for the first time in its 151-year history, forced to do so by the Right to Information (RTI) Act.        
	Pritam Rooz, a B.Sc Part-II examinee from Presidency College, saw his mathematics Paper V (honours) answer script on May 2 after obtaining an order from Calcutta High Court.        
	The court had observed that the RTI Act empowered a student to see his/her answer scripts after evaluation.        
	The court had ordered the university a month ago to show the script to Pritam. But the authorities obtained leave to move the Supreme Court against the verdict. Later, following discussions with legal experts, we decided to carry out the high court order, said a senior university official.        
	Pritam, however, alleged that he was not given a photocopy of the script as ruled by the court.        
	The university only allowed me to see the paper once, he said.        
	Sambuddha Chakrabarti, in-charge of the legal cell of the university, refused comment.        
	Pritam had scored only 28 in mathematics Paper V. He had applied for a review, after which the marks were increased to 32. The student pleaded with the authorities to show him the paper, but the request was turned down. Pritam then moved the high court, arguing that the university had violated the RTI Act by refusing to show him the script.        
	Citing the ruling, 52 candidates from various universities and boards have moved the court with similar pleas.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Husband blames depression

	 She later changed her statement and accused the landlord of mental torture.        
	Husband Haradhan denied allegations of torture. I am shocked. I have never tortured her. She has been suffering from acute anaemia and some gynaecological problems. She had slipped into depression after shifting to the city from our village in Purulia last year. We came here to try and give our children a decent education, he said.        
	The landlord could not be contacted but Haradhan said there had been some problems regarding small things like consumption of water and electricity between Rimpa and Roy.        
	An officer of Bally police station said: Rimpa Banerjee has not been arrested as no complaint was lodged against her. We have handed over the case to North Port police station.

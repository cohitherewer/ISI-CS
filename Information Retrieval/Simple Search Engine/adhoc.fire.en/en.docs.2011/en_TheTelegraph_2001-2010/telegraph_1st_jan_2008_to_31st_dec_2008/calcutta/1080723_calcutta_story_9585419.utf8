           Wheel of honour: A taxi plies on a city street                             
	The post-retirement plans of many have gone haywire due to the surge in prices of essential commodities (Pension plan goes for a toss). If Himanshu Sekhar Das with his monthly pension of Rs 22,000 finds it difficult to maintain his family, its not difficult to imagine how the majority, who get much lower pension, if at all, are faring. One almost loses sleep thinking about how the days ahead will be.           
	I retired from a private steel company in 2000. It had no pension scheme. Whatever I received by way of Provident Fund, gratuity and leave encashment was deposited in the post office under the monthly income scheme and as term deposits in nationalised banks. With interest rates drastically slashed, my best efforts to cut costs havent helped me live the way I had planned to. Im sure the number of people hit hard in the salaried class is multiplying by the day with prices spiralling out of control. Cant the government subsidise food and other essential commodities to minimise the woes of the retired people?

	Apropos the report Cab drives away with three lakh, June 25, the driver tarnished the reputation of his colleagues, many of whom had set examples by returning valuables left behind by passengers. A moments weakness could have made the driver flee with the money. He should return the amount to Seema Mukherjee not just to maintain his self-respect but also to preserve the reputation of Calcutta taxi drivers.

	Apropos the report Girl killed for seeking food, June 30, it is a shame that 12-year-old Alo Sen had to leave home to work as a maid in Bijay Agarwals house. The Agarwals not only murdered her but also told her parents that she had fled their house after stealing money. Moreover, they dumped the body and tried to mislead police. The family should be awarded the harshest possible punishment. The society robbed Alo of her childhood. The least we can do now is ensure that justice prevails and the murderers do not go scot-free.             
	Kajal Chatterjee,
  Sodepur                   
	Although news of medical malpractice has become mundane in West Bengal, a senior employee of Medical College and Hospital falling victim of medical neglect in his own institution is unique indeed (Slur on docs from within, June 27). There are no checks and balances for doctors in India. Despite horrifying stories of maltreatment at hospitals and nursing homes, hardly any doctor is found guilty of medical negligence.             
	Barring the Delhi medical council, all other state medical councils in India are exclusively formed by doctors. In contrast, the medical councils in the UK and the US are made up of a large number of non-doctor members. Although they do not provide medical opinion, their presence ensures unbiased judgment by the council.           
	Kunal Saha,
  Ohio, US                   
	Apropos the report Man run over, boy has close shave, June 27, mishaps are a regular phenomenon on the airport-bound flank of VIP Road. New traffic rules are regularly introduced to minimise mishaps on the stretch but they are violated at will by drivers. I feel the existing fines will not deter law-breakers. Cancellation of driving licence may be more effective. Fly-overs should be constructed at vulnerable points without delay.             
	Ashis Kumar Bhowmick,
  Kaikhali             
	The report Shield for the aged, June 25, came as a relief since I am a senior citizen. Several aged couples have recently been murdered in the city. The steps taken for the benefit of senior citizens often do no receive publicity. For example, most senior citizens are not aware that there is an ambulance for them at Lalbazar. I would like to appeal to Dignity Foundation and Calcutta police to provide security to the aged residents of north Calcutta as well.             
	B. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park           
	Calcutta police and Dignity Foundation must be congratulated for taking up a very important social issue  security for the aged at a time when criminal activities have peaked because of a boom in land prices. New Alipore has a large number of senior citizens and a programme should be started there to offer them protection.           
	A.S. Mehta, 
  New Alipore                               
	Apropos the Case Diary along with the article Hot tongs on help for wet pants, July 18, the two accused were booked under sections 324/114 of the IPC. Both sections are bailable. Sections 50 and 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, state that in case of a bailable offence, the police shall inform the arrested person of his entitlement to be released on bail. Further, on submission of the requisite sureties, the police shall release the accused on bail. In the case concerned, the exact procedure, as enumerated above, was followed, and accused were accordingly released on bail.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Todi denied bail

	A special bench of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of Ashok Todi, a prime accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	Moments later, Todis lawyers moved the Supreme Court challenging the special benchs order. The apex court is likely to hear the plea on Thursday.        
	The special bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta rejected the bail plea after considering the gravity and nature of the crime and upheld the submissions of the Rahmans that the accused could tamper with evidence and intimidate witnesses if he was out of custody.        
	Justice Sengupta was assigned the case after a division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice P.S. Banerjee had last Monday differed on granting bail to Todi.        
	The same bench on Wednesday refused to hear the bail plea of Ashok Todis brother Pradip on personal grounds and sent the petition back to the chief justice for reassignment.        
	In a related development, Justice Dipankar Dutta of the high court heard a petition filed by former deputy commissioner (detective department) Gyanwant Singh against a state human rights commission order asking him to appear before it.        
	The judge ruled that the rights panel could not ask Singh to appear before it as his plea against the CBI report was pending with a division bench. The Rahmans had moved the panel seeking action against Singh for allegedly trying to break the marriage of Rizwanur and Ashok Todis daughter Priyanka.        
	The CBI had acquitted Singh but recommended departmental proceedings against him for his alleged order to his colleagues to help the Todis break up the marriage.

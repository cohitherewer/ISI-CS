  - Biology not on admit card        A STAFF REPORTER                          SHATTERED DREAM: Debabrata Samaddar. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Debabrata Samaddar, a Class XI student with dreams of becoming a doctor, went missing for two days from his Thakurpukur home after finding that biology was not listed as a subject in his Class XI final examination admit card.        
	A student must study biology at the Plus II level to seek admission in medical courses. Hence, Debabrata felt that the admit card  issued by the Higher Secondary council  had shattered his dream.        
	The teenager left a note to this effect before leaving his Yani Sarani home on Monday. He also wrote: I shall continue my efforts to fulfil my dream from outside.        
	Debabrata was brought back home from Mayapur by a relative on Tuesday night.        
	Debabrata, a student of Barisha Sashibhusan Vidyapith, received the admit card on Friday.         
	He was quite upset since then. He told us that he had mentioned biology as one of his subjects while filling up the form for the examination, said Debabratas uncle Barun.        
	After bifurcation of Higher Secondary last year, the council has been issuing the admit cards for the Class XI final examinations in schools and setting the question papers. The schools evaluate the answer scripts.        
	The boys father Arun said he had contacted the headmaster of the school on Friday and was told that the school had sent the filled-up forms to the council, according to the norms.         
	My wife Tripti saw Debabrata studying till 2am on Monday. We started looking for him after he could not be found in the morning, said Arun, who runs a primary school.         
	Gopa Dutta, the president of the Higher Secondary council, said: We have to find out how this has happened. We have not received any complaint from the school in this regard. But we can examine the matter and take appropriate steps if the boys guardians approach us.        
	Debabrata had scored 82 per cent in Madhyamik, said his relatives. They lodged complaints with Thakurpukur police station and Bhabani Bhavan.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Festival boost for stage

	Theatre group Shohan has shortened its 10-day annual stage fest to six days this year owing to financial constraints, but the event nevertheless will be a shot in the arm for Bijon Theatre, the festival venue.         
	The hall was on the verge of being demolished as it had been lying unused for years. We are trying to improve things. We encourage other groups to stage plays here more often. We are doing shows here every Sunday and may be able to renovate Bijon Theatre very soon. The festival is another way of popularising the hall, says Shohan director Anish Ghosh.         
	The Sixth Annual Shohan Natyamela takes off at Bijon Theatre on December 25, with productions from Calcutta, Cooch Behar, Burdwan, Midnapore, Hooghly, Jharkhand and Bangladesh. One of the top draws is Anya Theatres comedy Jagakhichuri, directed by Bibhas Chakraborty.        
	Day One is dedicated to children  one of the plays will be staged by Shohan, the other by Kalakushali from Jalpaiguri. The spotlight on children stems from Shohans Theatre in Education programme at Giribala Sarkar Balika Vidyalaya, Shyambazar AV School and Bagbazar High School. We try to work as a catalyst, allowing the students to find their own creative strengths, says Ghosh.

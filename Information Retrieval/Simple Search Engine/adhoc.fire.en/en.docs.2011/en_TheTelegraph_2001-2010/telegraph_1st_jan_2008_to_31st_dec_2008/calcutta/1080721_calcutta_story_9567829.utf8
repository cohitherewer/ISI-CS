                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Security cameras for tech hub

	Police will use electronic eyes to keep watch over Sector V.        
	The IT companies there will provide technological guidance in setting up the closed-circuit cameras. In the first phase, to be completed in a month, six cameras will be installed at road intersections and in front of offices. More cameras will be set up in the next six months.        
	A team of policemen has also been handpicked to work in the tech hub. Special inspector general (presidency range) Somen Mitra said the officers are young and smart. They have been specially trained to interact with techies, following allegations of rough behaviour by policemen.        
	Moreover, a high-speed vehicle is being used for a month and a half to maintain vigil in the area, which is home to 200 IT and BPO offices.        
	The IT companies have welcomed the initiative. Sector V is growing rapidly. Precautionary measures like installation of closed-circuit cameras were needed, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris.The feed from the cameras will be monitored round-the-clock at Bidhannagar North police station. If we spot anything suspicious, we will rush to the site, said an officer.        
	According to police, there will be special vigil on the entry and exit points of Sector V, especially the Rajarhat-New Town and EM Bypass routes.         
	Companies and employees want more police outposts and patrolling in Sector V.        
	More outposts are a must. To lodge a snatching complaint we now have to go all the way from Sector V to Bidhannagar North police station, said an employee of IBMs city office.

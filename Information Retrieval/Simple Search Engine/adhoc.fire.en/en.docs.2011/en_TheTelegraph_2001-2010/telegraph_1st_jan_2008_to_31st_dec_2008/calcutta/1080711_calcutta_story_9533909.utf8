The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | RBU in the dock for course
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RBU in the dock for course
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday asked Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) to clarify how it could run its B.Ed course from 1998 to 2001 without the mandatory clearance from the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE).        
	The order followed a petition by Durba Sanyal Bhattacharya, a teacher of Sahanagar High School, who was initially not allowed to sit for the test for appointing headmistresses.        
	The School Service Commission, which conducts the test, denied her the admit card on the ground that her B.Ed certificate from RBU was invalid. Bhattacharya did her B.Ed in 1999.        
	The teacher moved the high court in December last year seeking an order allowing her to sit in the test scheduled for May. The court granted her prayer.        
	When the results were declared in June, the teacher found that the commission had withheld her result on the ground that her B.Ed certificate was invalid.        
	Following another petition by the teacher, Justice Tapen Sen of the high court last week passed an order asking RBU to produce all documents related to its B.Ed course.        
	When the documents were produced on Monday, it was found that the RBU ran its B.Ed course without the mandatory no-objection certificate from 1998 to 2001.

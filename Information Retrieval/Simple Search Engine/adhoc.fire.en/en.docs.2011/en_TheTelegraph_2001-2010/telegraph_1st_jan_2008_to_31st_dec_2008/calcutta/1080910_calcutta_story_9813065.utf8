                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The big fat bridal bazaar
  - Trousseau traditions amp; trends at The Telegraph Weddings           SHRADHA AGARWAL                          Swastika Mukherjee at the inaugural edition of   The Telegraph Weddings in 2007. A Telegraph picture                                              
	A fashion show with grand dame Ritu Kumar leading the line-up and Bollywood darling Manish Malhotra providing the final flourish. An exhibition with over 50 participants fulfilling every conceivable need of a wedding shopper. The Telegraph Weddings is back, bigger and better.        
	The curtains go up on the second edition of the wedding extravaganza  or the one-stop matrimonial solution  at Hyatt Regency with a fashion show titled Marriage N Vogue on the evening of September 11.        
	Life has come full circle and it is a pleasure to be involved with the wedding show in Calcutta because a wedding is a very important rite of passage in life, said Ritu Kumar, who had started off in this city 40 years ago.        
	A wedding is often known by the shopping that precedes it. For that, the three-day bridal bazaar will offer everything from designer clothes to jewellery, planning to skincare, accessories to astrology.                    
	The idea is to bring all wedding-related matters under one roof and so the bouquet extends beyond trousseau shopping.        
	The execution of D-Day is very important. Most bridal shows focus only on the jewellery and clothes but we promise to take the stress out of a wedding and make it all the more memorable, said Vinod Bhandari, the director of Winning Edge, event partner of The Telegraph Weddings.        
	If sari specialist Shaina NC will be sharing her drape tricks at the venue on Friday, the best of bridal jewellery from Jaipur will be shining bright. Sharing space with trousseau traditions will be tech tools like wedding webcast.        
	But before the shopping bags come out on Friday, Thursday nights ramp romp will witness big names and rising stars from the fashion world and also top models from Mumbai and Delhi.        
	The show will be choreographed by Delhi-based duo Meetu and Meenu.        
	The sets are clean so as not to overshadow bright bridal clothes but a bridal show gives us a chance to experiment with many genres of music and ambience, Meetu told Metro from Delhi.         
	Other highlights of the show will be designer Kiran Uttam Ghoshs newspaper print collage, the bridal collection debuts of Dev R Nil and Ekru, sherwanis by Nowme and Manoj Diwan and Suman Nathwanis nightwear.        
	Elita Garden Vista, developed by Singapore-based real estate major Keppel Magus in Rajarhat, is the co-sponsor for the event and Chivas comes on board as the associate sponsor for the Marriage N Vogue show.

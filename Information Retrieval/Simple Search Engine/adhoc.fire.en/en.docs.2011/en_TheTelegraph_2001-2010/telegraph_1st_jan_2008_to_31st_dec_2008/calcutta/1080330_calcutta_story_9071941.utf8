The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Duckling and detective 
                                                                                                               Duckling and detective

	Her Ugly Duckling is about an Indian girl growing up in the West and trying to become a translator; his The Armageddon Mandala is a dig at a private sleuth with no drive or ambition to make it big. Whats common to both is the experience of growing up in a foreign land, something that both Amita and Gopal Mukherjee draw upon in their novels launched at Crossword Bookstore, Elgin Road, on Tuesday.         
	The brother-sister duo  Amita is based in Paris and Gopal now lives in Pune  aims to break a few norms with their self-proclaimed defiant form of writing. Ugly Duckling and The Armageddon Mandala are products of Revenge Ink, the Paris-based publishing house that the siblings launched last year to encourage unconventional writing.        
	Amita and I want to be part of a new breed of Indian writers across the border who dont give a damn about perfect form. Thats the kind of writing were looking forward to from young people, those who are ready to express themselves in a rebellious and energetic way, said Gopal, whose first two novels found few takers.        
	Amita too had authored two books  childrens novels  before putting pen to paper for Ugly Duckling. I worked for 10 years as a translator and interpreter too but most of what Mia (the protagonist in Ugly Duckling) goes through is not based on my life. Thats the freedom Ive used to fictionalise the character, she said, with designer Agnimitra Paul as a special guest by her side.                    MOHUA DAS

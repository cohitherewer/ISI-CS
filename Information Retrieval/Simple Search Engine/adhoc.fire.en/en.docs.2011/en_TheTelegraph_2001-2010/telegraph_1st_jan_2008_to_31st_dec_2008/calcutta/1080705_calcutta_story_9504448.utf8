                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Talkative cousin who is now heard with interest
  - Amar Singhs relatives happy he is a name in politics, but rue lack of access          ZEESHAN JAWED                           Amar Singhs family lived on the third floor of 202 Chittaranjan Avenue. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                         Amar Singh: Look beyond locks                                              
	He may not have stepped inside the lane that houses his familys 500-sq-ft flat at 202 Chittaranjan Avenue for more than 16 years, but residents remain proud of the talkative boy who people are listening to lately with interest.         
	He always wanted to talk and look, hes doing just that, said one of the nine cousins with whom Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh grew up in the narrow lanes of Burrabazar. His return to a role of prominence in national politics is being followed by his cousins as well as other residents of this north Calcutta lane, where Amar bhaiya  long before he reinvented himself as Amitabh Bachchans younger brother  used to be known more for his penchant for films and food than his lofty aspirations.         
	A breakfast of chhoti kachori, sabzi and jalebi from the famous Tiwary Brothers in Burrabazar was a must every morning. He loved samosas and puchkas so much that he has them even now whenever he is in Calcutta. He dabbled in politics since his student days But he was a big film buff and enjoyed good food, recalled a relative, as he browsed through newspapers carrying his elder cousins quotes and snaps.         
	The Dev Anand and Shammi Kapoor fan would watch the first-day-first-show of every film starring his favourite actors. If three films were released on one day, he would watch all of them on the first day itself, said childhood friend Vijay Upadhyay, now the state president of the Samajwadi Party.        
	Amars fascination for showbiz continued even as he focused on furthering his political career. Amar used to be active in politics in his youth, but we did not expect him to move around in the top echelons of power, said Vinod of Vinod Stores, a grocery store on the ground floor of the building where the family still owns a flat.         
	Although Amars rise in politics has made the mohalla proud, relatives complain about lack of access to him. After Amar shifted to Uttar Pradesh and established a base, his immediate family  father Harishchandra, mother Shail Kumari Singh and brother Arvind  followed him there in the early 1990s. Now, when we call him, his secretaries take the call. We have to seek an appointment to meet him, said a cousin, who last met him in February, after Harishchandras demise.         
	Harishchandra used to preside over the familys lock business  they still own the Thunder Locks brand established by Amars grandfather, who had migrated to Calcutta from the small, backward village of Tarwa in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh.         
	Had Amar listened to his father, he would have locked out politics. He then might have been sitting in a small shop at Manohardas Katra in Burrabazar, selling locks, instead of being in the thick of action in Delhi, said one of the cousins.         
	Amitabh, too, would have been bereft of a steadfast younger brother.

   A STAFF REPORTER
        Former Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat visited Nandaram to offer sympathy to the fire-affected traders on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta 
   
	State fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee is in no mood to express regret for the ldquo;humiliation and insult rdquo; he reportedly meted out to a Rajasthani delegation on Monday.
 
	 ldquo;I had an appointment at All India Radio, so I couldn rsquo;t meet the delegation members. They did not have any appointment. Instead of meeting relief minister Mortaza Hossain, they should have come to me first, rdquo; Chatterjee said at Writers rsquo; Buildings on Tuesday.
 
	 ldquo;I got angry when one of the members said he would take up the matter in Parliament. Another addressed me as lsquo;bittu minister (small minister) rsquo;, rdquo; Chatterjee added.
 
	The delegation mdash; comprising seven ministers, MLAs, MPs and officials from the BJP-ruled state mdash; came to town to extend a helping hand to the traders who have lost their source of livelihood in the Nandaram-Kashiram blaze.
 
	Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje on Tuesday called up Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi and expressed concern over Chatterjee rsquo;s alleged snub. The fire services minister, on his part, spoke to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and narrated the ldquo;sequence of events rdquo;.
 
	The BJP state unit demanded Chatterjee rsquo;s removal and an apology from the chief minister for his colleague rsquo;s ldquo;misbehaviour rdquo;.
 
	Amidst the charges and counter-charges, the traders of the razed markets saw their first ray of hope for rehabilitation in industrialist B.K. Birla rsquo;s promise of donating Rs 2 crore.
 
	Birla, along with his wife Sarala, visited the affected areas on Tuesday. The Calcutta Citizen rsquo;s Initiative, a city-based NGO, said the amount would be distributed among the worst-affected traders.
 
	Birla also sought donations for the rehabilitation of the affected traders, but his request to route the money through the Kamal Gandhi-headed Manohardas Katra Coordination Committee has angered a section of the trading community. ldquo;Manohardas Katra was gutted a few years ago and nothing was done after that. We plan to meet the Birlas tomorrow to raise this issue, rdquo; said a trader. 
 
	Narayan Jain, the vice-president of the Calcutta Citizen rsquo;s Initiative, said the Jain Swetambar Terapanthi Sabha has agreed to let the affected traders set up temporary stalls on the 6,000-sq-feet land it owns on Portuguese Church Street. The Sabha will also provide soft loans to the traders.
 
	Mamata threat: Mamata Banerjee has threatened to organise a sit-in near Nandaram if the fire was not doused by 10am on Wednesday.
 
	CPM stand: The ongoing CPM state conference adopted a resolution, blaming ldquo;the huge quantity of inflammable material stored in the buildings rdquo; and the ldquo;dingy lanes rdquo; for the delay in dousing the blaze.

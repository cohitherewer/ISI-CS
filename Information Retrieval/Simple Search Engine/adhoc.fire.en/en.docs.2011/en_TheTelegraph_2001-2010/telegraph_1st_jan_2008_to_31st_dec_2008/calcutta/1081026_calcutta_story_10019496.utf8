The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The art of addresses
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The art of addresses
										      caleidoscope                        The address book with Shuvaprasannas works				                           
	This is a strategy to combat the increasing practice of storing phone numbers and addresses in mobile phones. Gallery Sanskriti is coming up with a special address book, with pictures. As artist Shuvaprasanna displays 38 of his new paintings and six sculptures at the exhibition Beyond the Darkness at the gallery from November 5-29, 11am to 8pm, a special address book with the artists works in it will also be available.         
	Even in this age when we tend to store addresses and phone numbers in our cellphones, we cant do without the big address book at home. Every house has one  tattered, yellowing and scribbled all over with familiar and less familiar names. I felt that address books have an advantage over the usual catalogue or coffee table book that tends to end up in forgotten corners of bookshelves, says the artist.         
	He has designed the address book, which will cost around Rs 500. Printed on super fine imported paper, this 8 inch x 8.5 inch volume has all the exhibits and space to store about 60 names per alphabet. It could be a splendid Diwali or Christmas gift. Very exclusive and arty!        
	The works of Beyond the Darkness, says Shuvada, turn back to explore his older subjects and motifs, such as the crow, the owl, the cat, the metropolis and insects, flowers and all things ephemeral.         
	Lack of design        
	How many young women know how to draw an alpana now? We can see only a few hands raised. Various reasons are heard on Lakshmi puja now. There is work. Not many offices are closed on Lakshmi puja. There is little time. There is lack of knowledge  alpana needs skill.         
	But one young lady came up with a novel excuse this year.         
	Entrusted with drawing the alpana, she ended up making circles of different sizes and mismatched arches. And she had been to drawing school.         
	Then she came up with her excuse: Those who have learnt drawing cannot draw alpana!

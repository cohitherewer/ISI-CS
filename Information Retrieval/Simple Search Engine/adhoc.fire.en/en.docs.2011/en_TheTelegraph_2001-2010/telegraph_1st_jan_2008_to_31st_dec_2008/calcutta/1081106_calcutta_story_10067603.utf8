The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Free to run a course, not name it
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Free to run a course, not name it
  - CU tells Presidency to change nomenclature, recall marksheets          MITA MUKHERJEE                                                  
	Calcutta University (CU) has granted Presidency College the autonomy to run post-graduate courses, but not the authority to name its courses.        
	Two years after Presidency College launched its MA programme in Literature in English, CUs syndicate has asked the college to change the name of the course to English.        
	The college got full autonomy to run an MA programme in English. They will have to change the name of the course, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro-vice chancellor of academic affairs at CU.        
	The autonomous status allows the college to frame syllabi, conduct examinations and award degrees. But the pass certificates of the students still need a CU seal. The discrepancy in course nomenclature was noticed when the pass certificates were sent to CU for the seal of approval.        
	With the syndicate  CUs highest decision-making body  demanding a change in name, the college will have to follow the diktat. This means that the marksheets of 60 students who cleared the MA Part-I and Part-II exams in Literature in English this year must be recalled.         
	This is such a needless complication. I will now have to retrieve the marksheet from my employer and then get it changed, said a student.        
	But the university officials are determined to play out the name game. The college is supposed to follow a certain procedure for changing the name of a course, which was not done, said Chatterjee.        
	Sources in the college said that a workshop, also titled Literature in English, had been organised to decide on the syllabi, pedagogy and examination system after it won autonomous status. Experts had observed that the course should be called Literature in English to widen its scope by incorporating translation from other languages, said an official of Presidency College.        
	After CUs objection to the course nomenclature, the college presented the same argument to the syndicate with a request for approval. Our request has been rejected and so we will have to change the name, said the official.

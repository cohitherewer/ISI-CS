                    A venomous passion                    An adaptation of Girish Karnads original, Nagmandal narrates an enchanting tale of romance centering around the complex nature of man-woman relationships. Rani was very unhappy as she was neglected by her husband Dharmadas. Kana-ma, an occult, gave her a magic potion to make her husband fall in love with her. When Dharmadas was administered the potion, he became unconscious for a while, but it did not have its desired effect. When Kana-ma gave Rani another potion, this time with greater power, she was afraid to try it on her husband once again. She dropped the potion into the lair of a king cobra, who swallowed it. Consequently Vasuki, the cobra, became attracted to Rani. Disguising himself as Dharmadas, Vasuki visited Rani, who was overjoyed with her husbands remarkable change in attitude. Thus, unknown to her, Rani developed a relationship with both Vasuki and Dharmadas, leading to a strange turn of events that resulted in great confusion and dilemma in their lives.

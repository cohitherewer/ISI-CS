          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Motorcycle-borne youths stole 25 cellphones from a shop in Barasat		    
	Six armed youths looted cash and cellphones worth Rs 1.2 lakh from a shop in Barasat on Monday night.         
	The youths, carrying revolvers and daggers, entered the shop at Dakbangla crossing around 10.30pm, while it was being closed, said store-owner Kanchan Saha.        
	Two of the robbers stood guard at the gate of the shop while the others beat up the two employees present and threatened to shoot them if the keys to the cash box were not handed over, Saha stated in the complaint lodged with Barasat police station.        
	The youths stuffed the cash and about 25 cellphones into a leather bag, according to an investigator. They ransacked the shop and broke the windows before fleeing on motorcycles. The men were aged between 22 and 25 years , an employee told the police.        
	The investigators have not ruled out the possibility of an insiders involvement.        
	We have detained some local criminals. The robbers knew when the shop would be closed, which suggests the involvement of local people. We are carrying out raids in the neighbourhood, said an officer of the police station.

          A STAFF REPORTER                           Sachindra Kumar Roy. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Six persons, including a woman, were arrested on Monday in connection with a dacoity at the Rashbehari Avenue residence of barrister Sachindra Kumar Roy on September 30.         
	Though cops recovered a part of the stolen jewellery, they failed to recover the Rs 25,000 cash. The gang had entered Roys flat posing as mobile phone sellers. A woman in her mid 30s had masterminded the operation, police said.         
	We arrested them from various parts of the city and adjoining districts. Shipra Karmakar from Haltu is the mastermind. We picked her up first and then her associates, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.        
	According to the police, Shipra had initially decided to target a resident of Golf Club road, Ram Mukherjee, who is in his 80s. She had worked for Mukherjee and knew that he lived alone. During interrogation, she revealed that she had planned to force Mukherjee to sign on some blank cheques.         
	However, on September 30, her plan failed as Mukherjee was not home. She then decided to target Roy as she had visited his house as a sales representative earlier, said an officer.         
	Shipra had worked as a sales executive for some months and then teamed up with one Prosenjit Chowdhury. Prosenjit has only one arm and the Roys had described such a man, the officer added.         
	Around 12.30pm, the youths entered Roys flat  where he lives with two sisters  pretending to offer mobile phones on exchange and then hit him with the butt of a revolver before leaving with jewellery and Rs 25,000 in cash.         
	Reconstructing the events, cops said that first three youths entered Roys flat and after some time, another accomplice joined them. Shanta, Roys younger sister, ushered him in. Uma, Roys other sister, was in her wheelchair.         
	Around 1.15pm, one of the men took out a gun and asked Roy to hand over the cupboard keys. They then tied Shanta and Roy to two chairs. When Roy tried to break free, he was hit on the forehead.         
	All of them were produced at the Alipore court on Monday and remanded in police custody for a day, said an officer.

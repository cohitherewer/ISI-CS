     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	Traders of the fire-ravaged Nandaram Market were allowed to climb up to the seventh floor on Thursday morning to inspect their shops and godowns.
    
	This was preceded by a joint assessment of the building by representatives of the fire department, police and the civic body.
    
	On Wednesday, after the blaze that had been raging since 1am on Saturday was brought fully under control, the traders were allowed up to the fifth floor.
    
	The traders entered the building praying that at least some of their stocks, cash and documents were intact. Several emerged smiling, holding small packets, possibly containing documents and cash, wrapped in a red cloth decorated with pictures of gods and goddesses.
    
	But several others came out weeping, after having seen their only sources of livelihood reduced to ashes.
    
	Hillol Doshi, who owns a garment shop on the ninth floor, was among the lucky ones. I somehow managed to visit my shop today. Its in a mess, but some of my wares are intact, he said.
    
	Most traders are not sure how much cash the fire had devoured. Only a few of us maintained books. The rest just kept the cash in the shop lockers. Thankfully, my locker has not been damaged, said a trader, who has a wholesale cloth shop on the fifth floor.
    
	As the affected traders of Nandaram-Kashiram-Tirpalpatti are desperately looking for space to relocate temporarily, floor rate in the trade hub is north-bound.
    
	I had visited a few places, including the City Centre on Brabourne Road, but everywhere the price is sky-rocketting. For a 100-sq-ft table space, the monthly rent has shot up from Rs 750 to anything between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000, said Doshi.
    
	Traders of the adjacent markets, who had on Monday cleared out with their wares in panic, have started returning. Some of them have reopened shops. After such a tragedy in the locality, it will take some time for normality to return, said a trader of Tamapatti.

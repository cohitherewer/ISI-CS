                      Life after war                    Written during legendary French existentialist philosopher-author Jean Paul Sartres most creative period just after World War II, The Aftermath of War is a collection of fascinating writings covering post-war America, the social impact of the war in Europe, contemporary philosophy, race and avant garde art. Its essays range across Sartres reflections on collaboration, resistance and liberation in post-war Europe, his thoughts and observations after his extended trip to the US in 1945, an examination of the failings of philosophical materialism, his analysis of the new revolutionary poetry of negritude, and his meditations on the visual arts, with essays on the work of Giacometti and Calder, both of whom Sartre knew well. This evening, Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi will launch Chris Turners translation of the book. To be followed by a dramatised reading of excerpts from it by Jayant Kriplani. Hosted by Seagull Books.

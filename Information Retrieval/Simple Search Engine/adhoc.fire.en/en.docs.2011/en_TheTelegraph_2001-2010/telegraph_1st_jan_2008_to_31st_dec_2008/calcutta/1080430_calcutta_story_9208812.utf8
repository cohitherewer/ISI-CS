           Underground ways: A train enters the Metro platform                             
	The report How fresh is fresh?, March 31, was timely and interesting. Laboratory tests of products sold in the market as fresh would open the Pandoras box.           
	A capsule cannot be a substitute for nutrients in vegetables and fruits, and hence, we remain dependent on the produce from farms and orchards. But the quality, flavour and taste of vegetables and fruits are deteriorating by the day.           
	Traders in roadside markets as well as retail stores apply chemicals to make their ware look fresh. They are not bothered about the health of the customers and even less about the quality of the items as long as they draw enough people.           
	Retail chains understand that a section of consumers do not have the time to track down the best quality vegetables and fruits in the market. They would even pay a premium for stale products as long as they are made available conveniently. The traders thrive on consumers who take claims of freshness at face value. It has become a means to take gullible customers for a ride.

	Apropos the report Stuck underground, March 27, I wonder why the Metro Railway engineers do not inspect the rakes before they leave the car shed. People headed for important appointments and students on their way to examinations get stuck when a train develops glitches in the tunnel. The Metro Railway services have also become like that of the state buses. No one knows when and where they will break down.

	The efforts by Metro Railway authorities to stop suicides at stations have come to a naught (Suicide at Metro station, March 19). Constant surveillance is the only way to prevent suicides. The number of security guards at each station has to be increased manifold. A speed limit can also be imposed on trains as they approach platforms. The footage from the closed-circuit cameras should be monitored to prevent suicide attempts.

	Apropos the report Free trips for AIDS, cancer patients, March 28, it is a laudable initiative by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty to allow AIDS and cancer patients to travel for free in both state government and private buses along with an escort.             
	Sukumar Ghosh, 
  Mukundapur                   
	Apropos the report Legal structure, March 30, I do not pay chamber fees for using a cubicle in BN Basu amp; Co. I was an article clerk under my father and used to sit in the office during my five-year articleship. I am now a partner of BN Basu amp; Co. along with Kamal Kumar Basu and Subrata Kumar Basu.             
	Amal Kumar Sen,
  Old Post Office Street                   
	Apropos the report Drunken dance after murder, April 24, on behalf of South 24-Parganas police, I would like to point out that the killers of Ashoke Ray did not drink and dance around the body after murdering him. It is also not true that the police reached the spot after an hour.             
	Praveen Kumar,
  Superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas           
	Metro replies: The report was based on accounts of the witnesses. Ashoke Rays cousin Pramod Ray told Metro that he saw the killers drinking and dancing around the body. When I tried to go close to the body, one of the gang members broke the liquor bottle by hitting it against a lamp post and stabbed me on the chest, said Pramod. He was treated at National Medical College and Hospital. Pramod and Ashokes father Ram Naresh said that the police reached the spot an hour after they were informed.           
	Apropos the report Library punishes, Delhi pardons, April 23, the allegation of smuggling out of photocopies of rare books and periodicals from National Library in December 2005 is untrue.           
	Ashok Nath,
  assistant library and information officer, National Library           
	Metro replies: We have a copy of the office order no 1159 of 2006-2007 by then director of National Library, Sudhendu Mondal, in which he had mentioned that Ashok Kumar Nath, assistant library and information officer, was accused with three charges described in Articles of charges 1, II and III vide this office memorandum no. ADM/PF/A/83/7557 dated December 29 2005 under Rule 14 of the Central Services (classification, control and appeal) Rules 1965.           
	The said accused officer Ashok Kumar Nath is guilty in respect of the charges brought against him. I, Sudhendu Mondal, director, National Library in exercise of the power vested on me as the disciplinary authority do hereby impose the major penalty as described in Sub-rule (V) of Rule 11 of the CCS Rules 1965 on the said delinquent officer, the order stated.           
	The Telegraph had carried a report in 2005 when he was caught leaving the library premises with photocopies of valuable documents by the library guards. Later an inquiry was ordered by Mondal and R. Ramachandran, director-in-charge, was asked to investigate the matter.           
	It is stated that Nath was caught red-handed by one security staff N. Alam while the said delinquent was found to commit this type of heinous act in taking away xerox copies from this library for his personal purpose on November 14 2005. Naths intention is always to vitiate the congenial atmosphere of the library being an institution of national importance, Mondal had stated.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Beggar worth Rs 20000
  - Money put in account          A STAFF REPORTER                        Part of Lakshmi Dass coin collection. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Retired beggar Lakshmi Das is worth Rs 20,778, according to the bank that counted the 100-odd-kg of coins she had saved over four decades.         
	Officials of the Maniktala branch of Central Bank of India opened a savings account in 60-year-old Lakshmis name last week and deposited the money there.        
	 It took us over 10 days to count the huge quantity of coins, branch manager T.K. Haldar said.        
	The coins were counted in Haldars office chamber in the presence of a constable from Burtolla police station. We have issued the passbook to her and our officials will help her whenever she comes to withdraw money, the manager said.         
	Lakshmi, named after the Hindu goddess of wealth, hasnt been seeking alms for some years now and needs to dig into her savings to meet her daily expenses. But she apparently still doesnt know exactly how much she has scrimped and saved.        
	 Aami jaani na koto taka hoyechhe. Amar bon jaane (I do not how much money I have in the bank. My sister knows about it), Lakshmi, who is physically challenged, said.        
	But life has certainly changed for Lakshmi since her story became public. She now gets curious glances and foreigners who have read about her are offering to contribute to her kitty. A senior Central Bank official confirmed receiving emails from foreigners wanting to help her.         
	If they send money, it will be deposited in her account, he said.        
	Younger sister Asha, who stays nearby, gives Lakshmi regular meals. My sister is taking care of me and brings food for me every day. I cannot walk and she will take me to the bank whenever I need to withdraw money, she said.         
	Lakshmi started begging when she was 16 and used to be a regular at the Hatibagan crossing. She would always save a part of her days earnings for life after retirement.         
	From a one-paisa coin dating back to 1961 to the new Rs 5 coin, her savings went into four buckets. But nobody knew about it until an overly curious teenager playing near her Nandanbagan shack was attracted to something hidden behind some jute bags and chanced upon the treasure.        
	When some local youths entered the shack looking for the coins, Lakshmi raised an alarm and her neighbours informed Burtolla police station.

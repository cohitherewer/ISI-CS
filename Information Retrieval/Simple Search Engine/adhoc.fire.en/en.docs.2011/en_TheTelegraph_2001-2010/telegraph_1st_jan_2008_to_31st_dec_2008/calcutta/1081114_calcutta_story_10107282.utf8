          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An object resembling a cracker exploded on Elliot Road on Thursday afternoon, sparking panic in the crowded locality.        
	Residents said the explosion occurred around 1.30pm while two men were rummaging through a garbage heap near Elliot Road post office, off Park Street.        
	The injured duo  Debu Dey and Badri  have been admitted to National Medical College and Hospital.        
	It was a deafening noise. The garbage went flying and the adjacent buildings shook under the impact, said B.L. Das, a resident.        
	The residents informed Park Street police station and a contingent, including sniffer dogs and bomb detection experts, arrived on the spot. Senior officers, including deputy commissioner (south) Rajesh Subarno, too, rushed to the site. A live cracker was found in the garbage heap, said an officer.        
	Some residents might have dumped a few crackers on the roadside after Diwali, thinking they were no longer live. We are trying to find out who had dumped the crackers, said an officer of Park Street police station.        
	Residents said the explosion could have resulted in a mishap as the locality was crowded and many vehicles were plying on the road. Two motorcycles and a taxi were parked near the spot, said Sheikh Payara, a resident.

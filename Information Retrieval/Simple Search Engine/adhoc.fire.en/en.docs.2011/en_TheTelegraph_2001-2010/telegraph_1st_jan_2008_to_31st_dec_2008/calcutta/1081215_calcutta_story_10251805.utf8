                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Womans body found in township
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of a middle-aged woman was found lying face down beside Kestopur canal, behind Sarat Abasan in Salt Lake, on Sunday morning.        
	Police said there were strangulation marks on the throat of the woman, who was clad in a white sari with a green border. Her lips had turned blue, also suggesting that she had been strangulated. There was, however, no sign of struggle at the site.        
	A black leather bag the woman was carrying contained a diary with some phone numbers. It seems the woman used to work as a nurse in and around Salt Lake. We have asked officials of agencies that supply nurses in the area to try and identify the body, said Sujoy Chanda, the additional superintendent of police, Bidhannagar sub-division.        
	Local councillor Dilip Ghosh said the woman was not a resident of Salt Lake. According to him, she was killed elsewhere, dragged across Kestopur canal and dumped behind the housing estate.         
	I was preparing morning tea when I noticed the woman through my kitchen window. I went down with my husband and found that she had died. We immediately alerted the police, said Tumpa Maiti, a resident SA31.        
	The body has been sent for post-mortem.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bohurupee and a blonde with a desi name
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The long stretch on the banks of the Annapurna Ghat at Barrackpore came alive on Thursday morning to a bustling bazaar teeming with small shops, and coconut and gamchha vendors on bicycle. The left-hand side of the road was lined with a fish market while fruit and vegetable sellers squatted on low benches.        
	The makeshift market was a no-entry zone but there was little curiosity among locals once it became clear that no Bollywood star was shooting there and the leading lady was a foreigner called Radha.        
	The blonde with an Indian name was Radha Mitchell, star of Woody Allens Melinda and Melinda and also Finding Neverland (co-starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet), who has been quietly camping in Calcutta for six weeks to shoot for The Waiting City.        
	The Australian film, being shot entirely in the city, is about a young couples journey to India to collect their adopted child.        
	Its an intimate, complex love story, set against the exhilarating, epic backdrop of Calcutta, a place that Ive filmed in before and have a deep connection with. Its impossible not to be affected by this place, director Claire McCarthy said before embarking on an Indian winter.        
	Led by producer Jamie Hilton, a 25-member team has been shooting in and around Calcutta  from Bagbazar to Barrackpore. With private security guards on constant vigil, the Australian caravan has trundled through Sealdah railway station, old houses in Behala, Sudder Street, Howrah bridge and more.        
	On Thursday morning, a small artificial water tank was set up to replicate the river where Radha in a blue cotton kurta and pedal pushers was to take a holy dip after strolling around the banks watching bohurupees, jugglers and a funeral procession.        
	Radha was joined by co-actors Joel Edgerton and Isabel Lucas. Joel Edgerton is an Australian film and television actor known for his performances in Star Wars Episode II and III while Isabel Lucas will be seen in the sci-fi film, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.        
	The team also boasts talented crew members such as Oscar winner Paul Pattison, the make-up man for Braveheart.        
	The all-Australian team will leave town before Christmas.

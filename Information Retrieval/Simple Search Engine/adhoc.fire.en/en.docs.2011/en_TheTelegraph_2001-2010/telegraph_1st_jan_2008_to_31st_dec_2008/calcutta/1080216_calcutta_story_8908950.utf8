The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hunt for Barrackpore friend
                                                                                                               Hunt for Barrackpore friend
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Detectives probing company secretary Rakesh Guptas murder are looking for a man in Barrackpore whom he might have met after seeing off his mother at the airport on Sunday.        
	Since there was no record of a new caller on Guptas cellphone, police have concluded that the man in Barrackpore was a friend.        
	Gupta had called up wife Babita around 2.30pm on Sunday to inform her that he was going to a friends place. His cellphone call records suggest he was in Barrackpore around 4.30pm.        
	Babita and her mother-in-law Kamala Devi, however, told the police that Gupta had never been to Barrackpore before.        
	His friends also told the investigators that they did not know of any acquaintance of Guptas in Barrackpore.        
	The police believe that once the Barrackpore acquaintance is identified, it would be clear why Gupta had kept his cellphone switched off that afternoon.         
	Kamala Devi told the detectives that soon after reaching Hyderabad  where her daughter lives  she had called up Rakesh but his cellphone was switched off. He would never switch off his phone, said Kamala Devi.        
	The two strands  why Rakesh visited Barrackpore after seeing off his mother and why his cellphone was switched off  are vital to the case, said a senior investigating officer.        
	According to the police, Guptas assassins had taken off two of his rings before dumping his body at Bilkanda, off Sodepur Road.        
	After visiting the spot, officers of the Criminal Investigation Department had opined that Gupta was killed elsewhere and dumped there early on Monday.        
	Those who carried the body knew that night patrol by the police would end at dawn, said an officer.        
	The police are waiting for the viscera report to find out what sedative was used to make Gupta unconscious before he was strangled with a nylon rope.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Through the Chinese lens
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Through the Chinese lens
                                        A viewer at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre (above) and Faye Mok. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta and Aranya Sen                            
	Scattered around three darkened rooms at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre on SP Mukherjee Road are computers showing myriad images  of a man dancing, two men rowing and a forest scene. Put on the headphones attached to the computers and each image tells a story.         
	Video art is not common in Calcutta, but in China, it is now one of the most popular artistic mediums. I wanted to pick videos of the people and society in China and equate them with experiences here, says Faye Mok, a 22-year-old university student from China doing a two-month internship at Seagull under Choice, a project for youth.        
	For the exhibition, she chose works of five young Chinese artists. Fifteen films dealing with the diversity of Chinese society are also being screened.        
	Faye is no novice. Back home, I have a part time job as a curator in a museum and have some experience of arranging an exhibition, she says.        
	Calcutta to her appears less vibrant than Delhi or Mumbai though the interest in art is there.         
	On the art scenario in China and political control, she says: The restrictions have eased in the past 20-25 years. Earlier, a lot of political symbols were used. Artists themselves now shun such symbols and attempt a more subtle representation of the complications of life. They are using metaphors.        
	Films though have to be made under tighter reins. Films have a wider reach. More people watch them. Maybe not so many people would come to museums to view art, Faye explains.         
	Censorship is not the only challenge. The student feels that some Chinese artists have lost their freshness. I guess it is inevitable. They had this edge when they were experimenting 10-15 years back. Now many of the big artists have been exhibiting and selling abroad for some time. So they know whats in demand and keep repeating themselves.         
	And there are few women artists. I dont know why. After the revolution, everything traditional has been shunned. Its not as if women have to struggle against any traditional role they have to perform, she shrugs.

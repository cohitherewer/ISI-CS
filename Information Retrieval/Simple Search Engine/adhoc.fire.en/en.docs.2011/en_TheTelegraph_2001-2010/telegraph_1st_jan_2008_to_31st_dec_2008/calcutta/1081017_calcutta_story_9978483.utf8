                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Suicide by neighbours   Rova Seth
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A college girl and an unemployed youth killed themselves at their homes, within 100 metres of each other, on Hari Ghosh Street on Thursday.        
	Rova Seth, 19, committed suicide by consuming poison, while Chandranath Chakraborty, 29, hanged himself from a ceiling fan after father Anadi Nath refused to give him money.        
	Rova, a first-year student of physiology honours at Vidyasagar College, was found frothing at the mouth when family members broke open the door of her room around 9am.        
	She was clutching two pillows and had vomited blood. A half-empty bottle of pesticide was found beside her bed. She was rushed to Medical College and Hospital, but doctors declared her dead on arrival, said Minati Kar, a neighbour of the Seths.        
	Rova lost her father 12 years ago. She lived with elder brother Souvik, mother Manisha and two other elderly ladies of the family.         
	We are trying to find out what prompted Rova to take her life, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Chandranaths father said his son kept bad company and took drugs.        
	This morning he asked for Rs 2,000. When I refused, he pushed me and my wife out of the room in a fit of rage and slammed the door. As he was was not answering the knocks on the door, we called the police. But my son had already hanged himself by the time the cops arrived around 11.30am, said Anadi Nath, who taught Sanskrit in a city college. The police ruled out any foul play in Chandranaths death.

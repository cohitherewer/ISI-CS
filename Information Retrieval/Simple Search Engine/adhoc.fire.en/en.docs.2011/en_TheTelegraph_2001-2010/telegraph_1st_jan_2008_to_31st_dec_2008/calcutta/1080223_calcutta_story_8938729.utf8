The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Stage set for debut
                                                                                                               Stage set for debut
  - Minerva makeover satisfies veterans          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Minerva theatre has finally been done up to the satisfaction of stage veterans.         
	Theatre personality Bibhas Chakraborty on Friday described the facilities at the 115-year-old Beadon Street address, to be inaugurated by the chief minister on February 28, as excellent after taking a tour with dramatist and actor Manoj Mitra.        
	They were accompanied by the state director of culture, Anup Motilal, consultant architect Dulal Mukherjee and CMDA engineers.        
	The state government spent Rs 5 crore on the renovation, which began in 2001. The launch was put off last November after Chakraborty and Mitra, along with veteran stage personalities Meghnad Bhattacharya, Ashok Mukhopadhyay and Rudraprasad Sengupta, found the near-complete hall unsuitable for performances.        
	I found that most of our suggestions have been accepted and most of the requirements met, said Chakraborty on Friday.        
	The light and sound equipment were found adequate. There are 376 seats now, after several were removed to make way for a central aisle on the ground floor and improve visibility.         
	The seats have also been rearranged. Though neither the balcony nor the pillars could be altered, the view of the stage is total, except from a few seats, where it is 95 per cent, said Mukherjee. Those seats will be used during soirees, he added.        
	On the suggestion of experts, a ground-floor greenroom and quick-change space have been added to the four greenrooms on the first and second floors. The sound console has been shifted and there are more and better-quality curtains. Gleaming marble flooring, wooden staircase and polished woodwork have improved the ambience        
	This will not be a run-of-the-mill government hall: efforts are on to make this a centre for excellence. A board of trustees will be formed to run the hall and maintain it, said Motilal.        
	The hall should be an autonomous organisation, suggested Chakraborty. But an official decision has not been taken. The hall will remain closed after the inauguration till the details are in place, said Motilal.         
	Mitra liked the airconditioned basement, which offers a rehearsal and performance area with 70 seats. The annexe also offers about 4,000 sq ft of additional useable area with a separate lift.

	When it comes to the politics of climate change, Bengal has its own George Bush and Al Gore.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya claimed in a recent councillors meeting that climate change has caused the spurt in dengue and malaria cases in Calcutta.         
	It is an accepted fact that vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria will rise due to global warming but to make it responsible for a short-term increase in diseases is unscientific and opportunistic. The mayor is using environment to hide his incompetence, said an environmentalist.         
	The mayor was not only critical of green activists while trying to bring the Book Fair back to the Maidan but also appeared in court against them, he added.        
	In the US, George Bush had made campaign promises to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant. However, one of the first acts of his presidency was to pull the US off the negotiations for Kyoto Protocol, the first international agreement to fight global warming signed by 141 nations, including all European and other developed industrial nations, except the US and Australia. The White House even questioned the science behind global warming during Bushs rule.        
	Asok Bhattacharya could be Al Gore to Bikashs Bush. While the former American Vice-President directed the documentary An Inconvenient Truth and campaigns extensively against climate change, the state municipal affairs and urban development minister wrote a chapter on the topic in his recently published book on city development.        
	Bhattacharya expressed grave concern about climate change and admitted that policy makers havent made an effort to counter the problem. He did not make an exception for West Bengal. Different political parties, trade unions and other forums should include issues like global warming, climate change and bio-diversity in their discussions, wrote the minister.        
	Bhattacharya, however, pointed out that in the 22nd state party congress, the CPM had expressed extreme concern about global warming.        
	His party colleague, the mayor, chose to show his concern and use the inconvenient truth rather conveniently.                    JAYANTA BASU

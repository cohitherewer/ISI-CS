          Todays question: Are you willing to pay a bit more for autorickshaws running on clean oil? More responses next week

	If paying a bit more will make our environment a little less polluted, I agree to do it. We will not fall ill too soon if clean fuel is used. But is it guaranteed that every auto rickshaw driver would buy the less-polluting fuel? A law should be enacted enforcing use of quality fuel and reducing its price because otherwise it would be beyond the means of auto drivers.

	Of course. But prior to paying a bit more we have to know if autorickshaws are running on clean fuel. Supervision (regular checking of engine as well as clean oil, driving licence, seating arrangement etc.) should be started to justify the enhanced fare. A passenger can certainly compromise on the fare but he would obviously demand security and comfort.

	People are environment- conscious now. They want a green and pollution-free universe. If air pollution can be reduced by avoiding adulterated oil and if autorickshaws can be made to use clean fuel, obviously we will pay a bit more for it.                Amrita Mallik, 
  Salt Lake        
	It is the duty of the autorickshaw drivers to use clean fuel. Why should we have to pay more for that? Instead of wasting money on useless habits like drinking, if they perform their responsibilities sincerely, it will benefit them also. The government must take adequate action against the use of spurious fuel by the autorickshaws to save the lives of many.

	I think it is very obvious that one should be willing to pay more. Even though katatel costs less and allows lower fares, a disease once contracted will prove to be more expensive in terms of treatment.               
	

Tuhin Purkayastha, 
  Parnashree Palli         
	People can pay more if they get proper service. Most people prefer autos as they can travel in greater comfort in less time. Auto fare is almost double of bus fare but still most people can afford that much. I think if the auto drivers follow a few traffic rules and behave properly with their customers then people are ready to bear with the expense. Clean fuel will also help to achieve a pollution- free environment.               
	

H. Roy Chowdhury,
  Ballygunge Station Road        
	The use of adulterated fuel is not only detrimental to the environment but also to the vehicle since it reduces the operating life of the engine. The autorickshaw drivers are still using it because it is extremely cheap. In the absence of a foolproof system preventing the sale of this degraded fuel, it will simply be playing into the hands of the drivers if more fare is paid believing they are using clean fuel. On the contrary, fixing a higher fare for autorickshaws using clean fuel will legalise the parallel use of spurious fuel.

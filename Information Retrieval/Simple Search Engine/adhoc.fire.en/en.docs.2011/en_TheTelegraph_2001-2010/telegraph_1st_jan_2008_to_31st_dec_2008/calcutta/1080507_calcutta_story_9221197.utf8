The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Part I fail to be pain-free
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Part I fail to be pain-free
  - Proposal to allow all students to sit for Part II          MITA MUKHERJEE                                    
	Students who appear for Calcutta Universitys Part I undergraduate examinations from next year are likely to be allowed to sit for Part II even if they fail in all the subjects.        
	A review committee set up by the university to restructure the BA, B.Sc and B.Com examinations under the 1+1+1 pattern is working on a plan to scrap the system of detaining students in Part I.        
	The practice of promoting all students to the second year is not new. Before 2005, students had to appear for Part I only at the end of the second year.        
	Those who fail to clear up to two of the four Part I papers can now appear for supplementary examinations along with their Part II. But those who fail in three or four subjects have to sit for Part I again.        
	The new 1+1+1 pattern is scientific and is followed in universities across the country. It will be more effective if students are not detained in Part I, said Anjan Kumar Sengupta, a member of the universitys syndicate. The no-detention system will be introduced from next year, said university sources.        
	Under the system, examinees will be allowed to clear both Part 1 and Part II after the second year. If they fail to clear either, they will lose a year and appear for the examination again before they can sit for Part III.        
	We are waiting for a review report before making a final announcement, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.         
	According to teachers and principals, many students do not attend Part II classes till Part I results are declared, lowering the academic standard.        
	The second-year classes start in mid-August while the Part I results are declared in November-December. Students will attend classes from the beginning of second year if they know that they are not going to be detained in Part I, said a senior teacher of a south Calcutta college.         
	On the basis of inputs from teachers, officials of the universitys controller of examination department and undergraduate council recently held meetings with college heads. The principals, too, called for abolition of the system to detain students in Part I.        
	The university had scrapped the 2+1 pattern mainly to increase attendance and the number of classes.        
	We had raised the demand that students should not be detained in Part I when the 1+1+1 pattern was introduced, said Biplab Chakrabarti, the general secretary of the West Bengal Council of College Principals.

	Four youths have been arrested for allegedly robbing a Salt Lake house after trussing and gagging an elderly widow and her maid early on Wednesday.
    
	Raju Bhattacharya, alias Baccha Raju, Neera Dolui, Liton Das and Laksman Das have been arrested for robbing AH 325, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.
    
	They have been picked up from Lake Town, Kestopur and Ultadanga. A search is on for two others, Sarkar added.
    
	Two country-made revolvers, two daggers, 1.5 kg of opium and Rs 1,100 were seized from them. The police came to know about the gang after detaining a local youth on Wednesday evening.
    
	The gang could take only Rs 1,800 from the single-storeyed house, where Aparna Bose, 72, lives with her maid Sabita. Her daughters are married and live in Mumbai and the US.
    
	An officer of Bidhannagar (East) police station said Raju had been involved in several criminal activities in Kestopur, Lake Town and Phoolbagan. In Salt Lake, he was allegedly involved in at least six robberies.

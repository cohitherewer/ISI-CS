                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Net-work for car-pool partners
  - Techie puts city on his website for sharing ride, cutting cost          ANIL BUDUR LULLA IN BANGALORE                          Vipul Kasera                                        
	When Vipul Kasera is not in his office workstation developing computer applications, he is helping people get to office and back.        
	No, this Bangalore-based techie does not run a taxi service to make some extra money. Neither does he moonlight as a radio jockey who keeps people updated on roads to take or avoid.        
	Vipuls car-pooling website, commuteeasy.com, has helped create a network of 5,000 people in five cities who share their private vehicles every working day, save on fuel and escape wheel fatigue. Last week, he added Calcutta to the list.         
	 Fatigue at the wheel leads to lower productivity in office. The pooling initiative aims to make daily commuting easier by letting you share rides with those on your route, the 25-year-old, whos now taken a sabbatical to set up car-pooling websites for IT companies in Bangalore, told Metro.        
	Car-pooling helps lower stress levels, decongests traffic and reduces travel costs. The website has more than 5,000 registered daily users in five cities. After a lot of suggestions and feedback, I decided to include Calcutta in the website, he said.        
	After registering, a user can check the map of the city he/she lives in and search for people who commute on the same route. Those using the website will mail you and you can begin car-pooling. This is an absolutely free service and at least 15,000 people trawl the site daily, Vipul said.         
	Kushal Sardana, an IIM Calcutta student who registered out of curiosity, said it was a boon for professionals. I move out of the IIM campus only once a fortnight. But its a good move to introduce car pooling, he said.         
	Another resident, Anil Garg, registered without knowing that he needed to own a car to be able to join. I hadnt understood it fully. I thought I could register and hitch rides, he said.        
	Vipul believes his website will benefit not only IT workers in Sector V, but also other professionals, government officials and businessmen who drive to work. I think the idea will click in this city because people drive at least 12-15 km to reach their workplaces.        
	A member of a car-pooling network is required to take out his/her car once in three or four days, depending on how many of them travel on that route.

                                                                                                               Break the silence

	Eighteen-year-old twins Shakeela and Shanno wanted to learn boxing; their father was dead against the idea. But Banno Begum made sure her girls got what they wanted.         
	Their father was scared they would be hurt and no one would marry them. But I couldnt let my daughters down. And they have made me proud by becoming national champions, beamed Banno Begum, as her daughters put on their boxing gloves to show a punch in the open-mike session, That Takes Ovaries, at American Center on Wednesday evening.         
	Hosted by Thoughtshop Foundation, the global movement became an annual event on the Calcutta calendar since it touched the city in 2002. That Takes Ovaries shares its title with Rivka Solomons book and urges women to break their silence.         
	Women come with a genetic make-up that makes them shy away from voicing their troubles even when abused. Its time we started helping each other to boost our morale, said Mira Kakkar of Thoughtshop Foundation, who set the ball rolling.        
	After stage veteran Punam Singh performed a piece on Mukhtar Mai, the Pakistani woman who survived gang rape and lived to tell her tale, the floor was laid open to others. While Ph.D-holder Manjula spoke of her fight to fund her own education, a young boy from Bihar shared how his elder sister got into prostitution for a better life for her siblings. Girls from Apne Aap Women acted out a play on a journalists fight against trafficking.        
	All those who had a tale to tell were gifted a golden ovary; some scribbled their messages on a white sari spread out in the room.                    MOHUA DAS

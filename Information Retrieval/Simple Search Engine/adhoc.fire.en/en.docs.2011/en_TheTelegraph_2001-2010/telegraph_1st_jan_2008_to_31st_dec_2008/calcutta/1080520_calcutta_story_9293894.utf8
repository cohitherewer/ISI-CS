  - Charges fly after tragedy at Sodepur garment store          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Readymade Centre tragedy has brought to the fore a rift in the family of its owners. A Telegraph picture                                        
	The owners of Readymade Centre are trading charges over the fire in which 13 people died on Friday.         
	A complaint has been filed against Jibon Saha, one of the owners of the Sodepur store, by his nieces husband Dhananjoy Saha.         
	According to Dhananjoy, his wife Ranjana was stifled to death because Jibon instructed some store employees to pull down the shutters on the first floor.        
	The downed shutters prevented employees and customers from leaving the shop, causing the 13 deaths.         
	Jibonkaka fled the store with cash and valuables after the fire broke out. He did not try to save anyone and even misled the rescuers by saying that no one was trapped inside, Dhananjoy told Metro on Monday evening.         
	Other members of the family will also lodge complaints against Jibon, he added.         
	Jibons daughter Rupa refuted the charges, calling them baseless and motivated.        
	My father couldnt have done that. He was busy shifting the cash as he was responsible for maintaining the accounts in the partnership business, said Rupa.         
	P.K. Tripathi, the additional superintendent of Barrackpore police, said Jibon would be interrogated after doctors at the nursing home where he was admitted granted clearance.        
	Jibon, 57, along with his brothers Narayan, 62, and Harilal, 75, started Readymade Centre around 35 years ago. Their children joined the business as it grew.        
	There are serious differences within the family. The partners had even fought over the expansion of the shop and the setting up of a new outlet, said an investigator.         
	The police learnt that Harilal, Ranjanas father, recently withdrew from the business and launched a new store, Amrita Bastralaya, in Sodepur.         
	The cops have already started a case against three members of the family  Jibon, Narayan and his son Sankar. Narayan and Sankar are admitted in an EM Bypass hospital and are said to be in a critical condition.         
	Till now, we have acted only on the basis of the fire departments complaint. We are probing the charges against Jibon, said an officer.         
	The shops around Readymade Centre reopened on Monday with the residents pressing for action against those responsible for the deaths. We want the guilty to be punished, said A.N. Biswas of Railway Park Para Committee, where the Saha family lives.

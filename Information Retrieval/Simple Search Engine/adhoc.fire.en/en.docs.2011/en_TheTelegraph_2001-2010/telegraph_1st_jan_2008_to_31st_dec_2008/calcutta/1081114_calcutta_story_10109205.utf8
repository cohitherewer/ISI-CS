          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Juvenile or Type II diabetes is on the rise but most city schools do not seem to be bothered.        
	The Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India said on Thursday that two studies had been carried out in the city on the prevalence of the disease among adults but none on children.        
	The schools are reluctant to help us conduct the survey, said Subhankar Chowdhury, the head of SSKM Hospitals endocrinology department and secretary of the research societys state branch. Most schools do not allow such studies citing lack of time.        
	The International Diabetes Society has chosen juvenile diabetes as the central theme for this years Diabetes Day on Friday.        
	The list of recommendations the research society had submitted to the state health department to prevent diabetes include banning the sale of fast food and soft drinks in educational and health institutions and work places.        
	The society also wants the government to make it mandatory for educational institutions and offices with more than 100 students or employees to have a gymnasium.        
	There is an alarming rise in the number of diabetic children. Even 10 years back, the disease was confined to people more than 40 years old. But now the situation has changed, said Tirthankar Chowdhury, a consultant (diabetes and endocrinology) at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.        
	According to him, more than 12 per cent of the total diabetic patients in the city are children. A recent survey has shown that more than 11 per cent Calcuttans are diabetic.        
	Diabetes becomes complicated as years pass on. So, it is important to identify the disease among children and control it, Tirthankar Chowdhury said. Apollo Gleneagles Institutional Ethics Committee will launch a study on diabetes in rural and urban areas next year, said Chowdhury.

                      Transparent landscapes                    His self-confessed love for nature and a strong determination to prove his capability in handling watercolours have made Sandip Roy the artist that he is today. Exploring the relationship between man and nature with a delicate use of transparent colours, what distinguishes the young artists work is his ability to translate the indefinable power that draws man, earth and sky into a symbiotic movement. At the ongoing exhibition of his recent works, new forms, ideas and colours flow effortlessly, giving his landscapes a unique simplicity, freshness and flavour. His play with blues, yellows, browns and indigos adds a cerebral touch to sights and scenes visible to the naked eye. Images of an old man walking, children having fun despite a hard life, a sick man on the pavement and a woman selling vegetables, all point to the artists consciousness and inner responses to his time and environment.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Sandip Roy When: Till July 23 (except Sunday); 2 pm - 7 pm Where: Akar Prakar, P238 Hindustan Park

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Battle gear for Lalbazar gherao
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Police vehicles on fire near Charu Market                                  
	Trinamul Youth Congress activists will not be allowed to gherao Lalbazar on Monday in violation of the prohibitory orders clamped around the police headquarters, home secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said on Friday.        
	Police pickets will be set up on all roads leading to Lalbazar, making the headquarters inaccessible.        
	The Trinamul youth wing had announced the Lalbazar abhijan after Mamata Banerjee claimed that those arrested for the violence at Charu Market police station were all party supporters, who she said had been framed.        
	Among the 29 people arrested was Swarup Biswas, brother of Trinamul MLA Arup Biswas, who had allegedly masterminded the attack on October 5.        
	The question of gheraoing Lalbazar does not arise as prohibitory orders are in force around the police headquarters. Those violating the orders would attract punishment under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, Chakrabarti said at Writers Buildings. The police will definitely try to maintain the sanctity of the prohibitory orders during Mondays agitation.        
	Violation of prohibitory orders may attract a jail term of up to one month or a fine of Rs 200, or both.        
	When reminded that 13 Youth Congress workers were killed in police firing on July 21, 1993, during a march to Writers, Chakrabarti said: I was not at Writers then. Police will be put on alert to prevent any untoward incident on Monday.        
	The Trinamul leadership, however, made it clear that the march would be peaceful.        
	But if we are provoked by the police, the government will be responsible for the consequences, Trinamul Youth Congress president Madan Mitra warned.        
	Trinamul sources said truckloads of activists would be brought to the venue from across the city and outside to make Lalbazar abhijana success.        
	The gherao is part of a month-long agitation announced by the Trinamul to press for the release of Swarup and the other accused.

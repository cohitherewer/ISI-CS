                      Lines and expressions                    Few artists are as imaginative and versatile as Partha Pratim Deb. A Million Lines, the ongoing exhibition of his drawings and installations, proves how resourceful and inventive a draughtsman he is. His works have an immediacy and freshness that can be perceived as an authentic, unadulterated impression of his creative vision. Perceptive and funny in the treatment of his subjects, his drawings brim with the fineness and foibles of the human condition. His representation of the comic and the grotesque is more humorous than reproachful. Comforting, soothing and elegant, the installation which anchors this exhibition provides a conceptual environment for his drawings.                  Event: An exhibition of drawings and installation art by Partha Pratim Deb When: Till April 5; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Gallery K2, Supra Court, 35 Lansdowne Terrace

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Threat to Rizwanur judge
          OUR BUREAU                          Rizwanur Rahman                                  
	The magistrate who issued non-bailable arrest warrants against the Todis was threatened on Thursday to quash the case or face the consequences.         
	The office of the seventh metropolitan magistrate, Bibhash Chatterjee, received the handwritten, unsigned threat letter on a day the Todis moved the Supreme Court questioning the legality of the arrest warrants.         
	The letter, written in English, came by post around 4pm. It warned Chatterjee that he would face consequences soon if he did not quash the Rizwanur Rahman case, in which the brothers were accused, and grant them bail.         
	Chatterjee immediately handed over the letter to chief metropolitan magistrate S.S. Anand, who got in touch with us, said an officer of Hare Street police station.         
	The cops soon arranged for the magistrates security and posted a team in front of his Serampore residence.         
	Additional arrangements will be made outside his chamber in the metropolitan magistrates court. An investigation is on to track down the person who sent the letter, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.         
	The Todis and their relative Anil Saraogi have been missing since Chatterjee issued the arrest warrants against them on October 28 for not appearing in court in person.        
	In the Supreme Court, the Todis lawyer, Rana Mukherjee, submitted that the arrest warrants could not be issued as the apex court had stayed the trial in the Rizwanur case. Stay of trial means stay on all related proceedings including issuance of arrest warrants.        
	The apex court had on October 13 stayed the trial till Calcutta High Court disposed of the Todis petition challenging the CBIs decision to file chargesheets against them and Saraogi for allegedly abetting Rizwanurs suicide.         
	Though the appeal is still pending, the metropolitan magistrates court issued summons against all seven accused and later arrest warrants against the Todis and Saraogi.        
	The apex court may take up the petition on Friday, said an official. Lawyers for Rizwanurs family said they would oppose the petition.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cracker cops beaten up
          OUR BUREAU                          Sree Tower, where Diwali revellers turned violent                                  
	Firecrackers and fists of fury made it a Diwali to forget for policemen struggling to lower decibel levels around town.        
	Over 1,000 people were arrested and around 400kg of banned firecrackers were seized as the cops went on a cracker hunt throughout Tuesday night.        
	But revellers at Sree Tower, an apartment off VIP Road near Big Bazaar, exploded on four men in uniform from Baguiati police station late on Tuesday.        
	Paresh Roy, officer-in-charge of Baguiati police station along with three officials, went to the apartment near Big Bazaar around 1am following a complaint that the ban on noisy crackers was being flouted by residents.        
	Two persons were arrested from the roof of the apartment as they were bursting banned firecrackers, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police of North 24 Parganas.        
	Following the arrests, some residents of the apartment started arguing with our officers and an altercation followed. Our officers were manhandled, added Sarkar.         
	In the melee, Roy and his colleagues were allegedly punched and kicked by some residents of Sree Tower, who were protesting the arrest of Arunavo Saha and Tarun Saha. Police later picked up Akhil Chandra Saha and Raju Singh, for assault.        
	All four were produced in Barasat Court on Wednesday and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. Besides slapping them with noise norm violation cases, they have also been booked for assaulting policemen on duty.         
	When Metro visited the apartment on Wednesday, residents were tight-lipped. There was some problem here last night, was all that a middle-aged man, leaving in a Maruti Alto, said.        
	Sree Tower was silenced by the arrests, but highrises across the city were the hub of noise norm violations through Diwali night.        
	Among those arrested for flouting the firecracker ban were Krishna Damani, a senior official of South Point school, and his brother Basant, from a highrise off EM Bypass. They were granted bail on Wednesday.         
	I did not burst any crackers or flout any rule, claimed Krishna Damani.

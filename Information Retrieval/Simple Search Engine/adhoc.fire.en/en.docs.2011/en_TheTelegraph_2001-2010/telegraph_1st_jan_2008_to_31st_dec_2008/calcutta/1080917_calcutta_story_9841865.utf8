                      Heavenly images                    The astral world of stars and planets has been a constant source of curiosity and study since ancient times. Apart from astronomy, which is an accepted branch of science, astrology, too, has an enduring impact on the popular imagination. Navagraha/Rashi/ Nakshatra Mandala, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by H.N. Suresh, presents the planetary family in an artistic, interesting and original dimension. The artist has created the first set of 27+1 configurations by exploring familiar symbols like gender, flora, fauna, precious stones and other motifs, juxtaposing them with the presiding stars. The other set of nine plus paintings is more symbolic in approach. Representing the nine planets referred to as grahas in astrological parlance, it stands out for its spherical representation and remarkable colours that help identify the characteristics of each design. Combining the twin subjects of astronomy and astrology in their scientific and ethereal perspectives, the paintings offer an entirely new variety of art, that is imaginative and informative at the same time.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by H.N. Suresh When: Till September 18; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Abanindranath Tagore Gallery, Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), 2nd floor, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

	A huge exhibition  actually two exhibitions of paintings and sculpture  has opened at Aakriti Art Gallery. The painting exhibition is titled Diversified Fantasy and features the works of veterans like Kartick Pyne, Amal Nath Chakladar and Partha Pratim Deb. Pyne (painting beside) is an artist undeterred by conventions and paints young men and women blooming into krishnachura blossoms, priests from Orissa playing trumpets before a Jagannath image and a giant peacock feather, and human trees growing out of chequered boxes. Pyne breaks all rules and refuses to paint pretty pictures to this day. Success may have come to him very late in life but it has not gone to his head.        
	Partha Pratim Deb paints amazing landscapes with huge cactii sprouting polyps and strange human beings doing their own thing, seemingly oblivious of other humans. Amal Chakladar is the surprise of this exhibition. He paints with consummate skill in the Oriental style but his prehensile birds and equine creatures are stuff that dreams are made of. His most amazing painting is that of a maze-like home whose floors are flooded with water. It has doors that resemble eyes, casting sidelong glances at the viewers.        
	The sculpture section in another room has some good pieces but most of them are in the classical style. Bimal Kundus reclining man and head are good examples of this style, the touch of cubism notwithstanding. Sunil Kr Dass face and couple have the elegance of Japanese toys. In comparison, Manik Talukdars The Lady looks decorative. It lacks the robustness of Shankar Ghoshs woman reading and the woman waiting, Damayanti fashion. So-me of the exhibits are over the top, but Nantu Behari Dass monstrous baby made of broken toys strikes the right note of horror.       SOUMITRA DAS

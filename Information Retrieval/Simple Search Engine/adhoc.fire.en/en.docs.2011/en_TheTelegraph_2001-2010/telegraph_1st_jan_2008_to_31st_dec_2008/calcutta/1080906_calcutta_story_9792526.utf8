          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A city-based trader who had tampered with his passport and paid Rs 6 lakh to his business partner for a Korean visa was arrested at Calcutta airport on Friday.        
	Rakesh Kumar, 24, runs a garments export business with Manohar Singh. When he told Singh that he wanted to shift base to Korea, the partner assured him of arranging for a Korean visa against a payment of Rs 6 lakh.        
	Kumar paid the amount and applied for the visa. But the application was rejected.        
	The partner then advised Kumar to move to Hong Kong, as it is easier to obtain a Korean visa from that country.        
	On Friday morning, Kumar arrived at the airport to catch the Biman Bangladesh flight to Dhaka, from where he planned to fly to Hong Kong.        
	He had tried to tamper with a page in the passport which contained a sticker saying his visa application had been rejected, said an airport official. He was detained and later handed over to police. Officials are looking for Singh.

  - Rs 2 crore changed hands in bail deal, claim sleuths          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	The CBI on Wednesday arrested two more persons in connection with the bribe-for-bail deal involving Dinesh Dalmia, an accused in a multi-crore share scam.        
	On Tuesday, the sleuths had picked up Gautam Shroff, a lawyer on the CBI panel, and city-based businessman K.K. Rungta for allegedly striking a Rs 7-crore deal with Dineshs father K.P. Dalmia.        
	Gautams brother Pankaj and Rungtas accountant Padam Chand Dugar were arrested on Wednesday from their offices on Camac Street and in the BBD Bag area.        
	The four men arrested in the case were produced in an Alipore court on Wednesday and remanded in judicial custody till October 27. Acting chief judicial magistrate Arijit Mukherjee asked the sleuths to produce the quartet in the special CBI court when it opens after the Puja vacation.        
	We had specific information that Pankaj and Dugar had played a key role in the deal that Gautam and Rungta had struck with K.P. Dalmia to secure Dineshs bail, a senior CBI official told Metro.        
	Dugar was in Rungtas office when a CBI team barged in on Tuesday and caught the businessman and the lawyer red-handed accepting a bag containing Rs 1 crore from Dalmia.        
	Officials said Dugar was entrusted with counting the notes.        
	Investigations revealed that the lawyer-businessman duo had collected around Rs 2 crore from Dalmia over the past two months. They had told Dalmia that they would pay Rs 5 crore to CBI officials to ensure that Dineshs bail plea was not challenged; Rs 2 crore would be their fee, said a sleuth.        
	Dinesh has been in custody since his arrest in February 2006 on the charge of misappropriating Rs 594.88 crore, the sale proceeds of 1.3 crore shares of his company DSQ Software.        
	The Supreme Court had rejected his bail plea thrice.        
	CBI sources said K.P. Dalmia had paid Rs 2 crore to Rungta and Gautam on October 4. On October 21, Dalmia had turned up to pay the third instalment, but only after alerting the CBIs anti-corruption wing.        
	Of the Rs 2 crore that Dalmia had paid the duo, the sleuths have recovered Rs 1.1 crore.        
	Officials, meanwhile, ruled out arresting Dalmia, though he had tried to influence the sleuths through illegal gratification.        
	He is the complainant and a witness. His deposition will be key evidence during the trial, explained an official.

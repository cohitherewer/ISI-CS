	A rickshawpuller rescued a stray canine that had been hit by a motorcycle on VIP Road on Monday evening and spent hours tending to it.        
	Pradyut Burman, whom friends call Pagla Ranjit, contacted Ashari, an animal hospital-cum-shelter, which took away the injured animal on Tuesday. The 37-year-old man had by then named her Rani.        
	A motorcycle entering Rajarhat from VIP Road hit Rani in her right hind-leg near Joramandir around 8pm. It was raining heavily at the time. Rani started yelping in pain, but the man rode on, as if nothing had happened, said Burman.        
	He helped the injured canine off the thoroughfare with the help of some passers-by. He later carried her to a shed housing a generator for a billboard. Rani was shivering in the rain. I tried to feed her. She had a little tea and biscuit crumbs, added Burman.        
	He returned to his Rabindrapalli home, where he lives with his wife and two children, at night but was back with the canine by 6.30am. Ranis condition had deteriorated by then and she could not move her hind-legs.        
	Pradyut started asking everybody about where the bitch could be treated. He made just a couple of trips on his rickshaw, said another rickshawpuller Bishu Das.        
	Around 2pm, a resident gave Burman the number of Ashari.         
	The workers there picked up the bitch within an hour.        
	Her condition is critical, said an Ashari spokesperson.

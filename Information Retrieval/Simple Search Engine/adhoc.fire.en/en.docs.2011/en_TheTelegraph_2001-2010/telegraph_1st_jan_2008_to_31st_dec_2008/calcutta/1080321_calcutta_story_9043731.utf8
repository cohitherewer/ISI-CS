The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pay up or face hurt and humiliation
                                                                                                               Pay up or face hurt and humiliation
  - Woman with credit card dues is abused, slapped and assaulted by recovery agent          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	An outstanding credit-card amount cost a customer hurt and humiliation at the hands of a collection agent, who allegedly abused her, slapped her and then tugged at her kameez tearing off a part.        
	Poulami Mukherjee, 28, was attacked by the recovery agent of a nationalised bank despite apex court and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rulings safeguarding customers against such harassment.        
	Around 9.30am on Thursday, the resident of Kasba was about to leave for office when Rajiv Agarwal and an associate turned up at her third-floor flat on RK Ghoshal Road. The duo introduced themselves as agents from the banks credit card division and insisted that she pay her dues at once.        
	Poulami, an assistant manager with a private insurance company, pleaded for time as she was leaving for Bangalore on work. She said she would return on April 7 and pay up. The duo refused to budge and in their bid to teach her a lesson attacked her.        
	Alerted by her cries for help, husband Anirban, mother-in-law Manju and some neighbours rushed out. One of her assailants fled but Agarwal was caught and later handed over to Kasba police.        
	Agarwal claims he is a representative of one of the many collection agents that a nationalised bank has engaged to recover outstanding amounts. He has been arrested, said a senior officer of Kasba police station. He, however, refused to explain why a molestation charge had not been slapped on Agarwal despite Poulami claiming that he had slapped her and tugged at her kameez.        
	Poulami told the police that she had lost her credit card eight months ago. Following a series of negotiations with the bank it was agreed that she would pay the outstanding amount in monthly instalments that would be collected from her by an agent.        
	On Wednesday morning, when an agent arrived for the instalment, Poulamis mother-in-law said she had left for office and asked him to return on Thursday. I tried explaining but Agarwal turned violent. He hurled abuses at me and then slapped me. Before I could resist, he even tugged at my kameez and tore off a part. I was in shock, said Poulami.        
	This comes within seven months of Manabendra Mondal, a transporter in debt, committing suicide at his Belgachhia home, allegedly after being abused and threatened by recovery agents of a nationalised bank.

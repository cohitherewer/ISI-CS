	Its time schoolchildren did their bit for the conservation of the Royal Bengal Tiger. With such an aim in mind, Kids for Tigers  an organisation working for the protection of wildlife  held a workshop on environment at Raj Bhavan on August 6. Seventy-five school students and several environmentalists participated in the event.         
	Students were given presentations on wildlife conservation strategies and the effects of green house gas emissions. An interactive question-answer session pepped up the discussions that covered a variety of topics from snow leopards to urban waste management.         
	Environmentalist Bittu Sahgal said: The Royal Bengal Tiger Bachao campaign should include broader environment-related issues. It is our duty to make the GeNext more conscious of the hazards facing our environment.         
	Environmentalist Subhash Dutta claimed that by using solar energy and economising water usage the common man can reduce power consumption drastically. With Roger Whittakers Born Free playing in the background, students discussed anti-plastic drives, nature walks, tiger conservation and pollution control.        
	Some students suggested that homework should be sent to the teachers via email, as an attempt to save paper. But teachers negated the proposal on the grounds of increased power consumption and cost factor.

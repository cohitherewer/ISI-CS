The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | If only they had taken my son to hospital
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       If only they had taken my son to hospital
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Ashalata Santra in her house in Domjur. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                  
	Seventy-year-old Ashalata still finds it difficult to believe that in three hours not one person took her son to hospital after he collapsed on a pavement in Howrahs Belgachhia on Sunday morning.         
	I was lucky to have a dutiful son like Dilip. I cant believe he is dead, cried Ashalata sitting outside the Santras tiled-roof mud house in Domjur.        
	Dilip had died by the time a doctor attended to him at Howrah district hospital around 10am on Sunday. In between, an officer of Liluah police station had refused to come to the aid of the 40-year-old foundry worker citing jurisdiction.        
	Cops from Bantra police station arrived on the spot two-and-a-half-hours after Dilip collapsed on the road and took him to hospital after another half an hour. Pedestrians, too, had not helped him fearing police harassment.        
	On Monday morning, Ashalata recounted the hardships she had faced to bring up her son and three daughters after her husband Feluram, who worked in Jessop and Company, died 35 years ago.        
	Dilip started working in Howrah factories as a 15-year-old to provide for the family. He was the youngest in the family but he worked the hardest. He helped me marry off my three daughters, said Ashalata.        
	After the untimely death of her son, who used to earn around Rs 3,000 a month, she is staring once again at an uncertain future, along with her daughter-in-law Bhanumati, grandson Amit and granddaughter Moumita.         
	My son discontinued studies after passing Madhyamik this year. He is training to be a motor mechanic in a local garage and hasnt started earning yet. My daughter Moumita is in Class VI in a local school but I dont think she can study further, said 35-year-old Bhanumati.        
	She does zari embroidery at home and earns about Rs 600 per month, not enough to feed even her 16-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter.         
	And help hasnt been forthcoming. The owner of the foundry factory, where Dilip worked for over a decade, had not visited the family yet, Bhanumati said.         
	The policemen who dithered to take her husband to hospital have also not been pulled up yet.        
	The probe is on. We can take action only if an officer is found guilty, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police.

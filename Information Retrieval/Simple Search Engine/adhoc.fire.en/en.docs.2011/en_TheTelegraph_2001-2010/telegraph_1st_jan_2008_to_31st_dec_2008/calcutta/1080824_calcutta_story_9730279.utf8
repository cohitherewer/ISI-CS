										      flashback                        The gate at No.5 Russell Street being reconstructed. Picture by Pradip Sanyal				                           
	Many old buildings in the older sections of the city have truly grand entrances, many surmounted by lions and other emblems of power or at least urns. The arched gateway of No. 5 Russell Street, which used to be the first official residence of bishops in this city, including Bishop Heber, was its most notable feature. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had declared this house a heritage building. Although the building stands in the shadow of the glass box of ITC, it was because of this portal that it was difficult to miss this centuries-old structure.         
	But land sharks, who have been hyperactive in this part of the city for a long time, had their eye on this piece of prime property and it was demolished on the night of August 25-26, 2001, as it provided evidence of the buildings antiquity. Since then a long tussle has ensued to rebuild this gateway the way it should be using original material like chunam or lime and surki or brick dust, both hard to get today.        
	In May 2002, Calcutta High Court admitted a case filed by the Destiny of Calcutta Anglo Indian Association asking for permission to renovate and reconstruct it at its own expense, as the national council of the Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA) in New Delhi, believed to be the owner of the building, was allegedly not responding to pleas to repair the structure.         
	The high court was told that two plaques recording the history of the building had been removed and that they were lying at Shakespeare Sarani police station. And this house has a long history worth repeating and recording. Which is why the CMC in its wisdom included it in the heritage list in terms of Section 425B of the CMC Act, 1980, as SL No. 298. The gateway was, surprisingly, included in the same list as SL No 307.        
	The original house was constructed by Major Mark Wood in 1763 on 12 bighas, the first construction on the street, according to Schalchs map. Before leaving India, the major sold it to Captain John Ulric Collins in 1786 for Rs 61,840. The captain, in turn, sold it to Russick Lal Dutt in 1803. His family was in the business of acquiring and then leasing residential properties to Europeans in Chowringhee. His son, Uday Chand, sold it to James Pattle, a civil servant with the East India Company, on May 14, 1824, for a lakh.        
	Pattle leased it to the Company as the Episcopal Residence at a monthly rent of Rs 600. Bishop Heber, the second bishop of Calcutta, officially took up residence at 5 Russell Street in October 1825. Till the consecration of the new cathedral named after St Paul, No. 5 was home to five bishops. It served as a boarding house for the young men of the Company after the death of Bishop Wilson. His executor, Prince Golam Mohammed, sold it, and in 1890, it was conveyed to the estate of Elias David Joseph Ezra.        
	In 1916, the property was conveyed to YMCA. After the demolition of the gateway, then CMC commissioner D. Som had written on September 7, 2001, to the National Council of YMCAs of India, in New Delhi, requesting it to reconstruct and restore the gateway to its original shape and character in consultation with the conservation architect without delay and complete within a period of six months from the date of issuance of the letter.        
	Nothing came of the case filed by the Destiny of Calcutta Anglo Indian Association at the high court. The gate lay untouched for quite some time.         
	A couple of months ago, an attempt was made to reconstruct it under instructions from CMC. But that was stopped because cement was being used. Now it has been reconstructed at long last under the supervision of architect Anjan Mitra. At first, it was thought that only traditional material was being used but unfortunately cement has not been debarred altogether.        
	The natmandir of Sovabazar Rajbati has also been solidified with concrete shattering all norms of restoration. If this is accepted as the norm, sad days are ahead for built heritage of Calcutta.

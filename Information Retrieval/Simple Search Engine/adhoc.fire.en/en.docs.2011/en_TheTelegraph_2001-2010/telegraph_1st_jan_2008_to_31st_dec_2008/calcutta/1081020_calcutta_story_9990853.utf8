          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 33-year-old man, facing arrest on charges of torture and theft, committed suicide by drinking liquor laced with poison in a BB Ganguly Street hotel late on Saturday.        
	Police said a Durgapur court had issued an arrest warrant against Subrata Ray a fortnight ago following a torture complaint by his wife. Four days ago, Rays employer lodged a complaint with Tollygunge police station, accusing him of stealing his credit card.        
	The Durgapur resident, who worked in a Tollygunge-based detective agency, had been living in Kudghat over the past year. Ray killed himself seeing no way out, said Tapas Basu, the officer-in-charge of Muchipara police station.        
	Subrata had checked in at the hotel around 7.10pm on Saturday. Since he was not answering knocks on the door on Sunday morning, hotel staff broke into the room and found him lying unconscious. Ray was taken to NRS Hospital, where he was declared dead.        
	Empty bottles of alcohol and pesticide were found in the room. We suspect Ray had drunk the liquor after mixing it with pesticide, said an officer.

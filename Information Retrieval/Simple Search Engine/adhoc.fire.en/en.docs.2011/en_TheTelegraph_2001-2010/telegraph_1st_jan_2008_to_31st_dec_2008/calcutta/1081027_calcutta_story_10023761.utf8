                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cracker haul before Diwali
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Fireworks weighing 6,450 kg have been seized and 35 people arrested in the pre-Diwali police crackdown in the city and its outskirts.         
	Twenty-eight specific cases were lodged against those arrested under the drive, which was started on October 15 to prevent noise pollution during Diwali. Officers of the Anti-Rowdy Squad also seized 131 kg of sulphur, which was being transported illegally for manufacturing crackers.        
	Deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim said most of the seizures were made near the entry points to the city.         
	We are seizing fireworks that generate sound above 90 decibel. A couple of days ago, we found that some of the crackers being sold at Bazi Bazar on the Maidan were violating norms laid down by the pollution control board. We included those on the list of banned fireworks, added Shamim.        
	According to police, banned crackers are being transported to the city from the districts, including Bankura, Birbhum and North and South 24-Paraganas. We also seized a large consignment from Gaya. It was being transported in a private bus to a trader near Mohammad Ali Park. We stopped the bus near Chitpur, said an officer.        
	Vineet Kumar Goyal, the deputy commissioner (headquarters), said there would be nearly 8,000 policemen on the streets to handle crowd and traffic during Diwali.         
	Over 2,000 pujas are being organised in the city. We will deploy policemen in front of all major puja pandals and intersections. Officers from the detective department will also be deployed to keep a watch on rowdies, said Goyal.        
	North 24-Parganas district administration issued a circular stating that all Kali idols would have to be immersed by October 31. Puja organisers in Barasat had sought permission to keep the idols for one more day. Police, however, said goods vehicle will not be allowed to enter Barasat from 5pm to 6am during the puja days.

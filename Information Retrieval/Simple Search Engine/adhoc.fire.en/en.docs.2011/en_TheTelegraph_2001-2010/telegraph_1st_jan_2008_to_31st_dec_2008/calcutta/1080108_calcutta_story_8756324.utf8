	NIIT MindChampions Academy held their East Zone Chess Championship on December 16. Winners from the state-level contests in Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Nagaland, Meghalaya and Tripura took part in the event, a joint venture of NIIT and grandmaster Viswanathan Anand.
 
	Started in 2002-03, the academy now records a participation of over 100,000 students from private and government schools. The championship was introduced in the eastern zone in 2004. 
 
	 ldquo;Including students from all backgrounds makes participation itself praiseworthy, rdquo; said chief guest Ashok Maity, joint director of school education, West Bengal. The academy has fostered nearly 5,280 clubs and offers coaching in chess in both the online and offline formats. To reach the zonal finals, students have to play at the intra-school, inter-school, inter-district and inter-state level.

	Nishi Iyer, Bidita Shenoy and Tapajit Das, all Class V students of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park were declared the winners. ldquo;We have a chess club in school where practice sessions are held fortnightly. The response to this game has been overwhelming, rdquo; informed their teacher, Nupur Jain. 
 
	The winners were too exhausted after the tournament to speak. ldquo;We have been training intensely for this tournament, rdquo; was all Tapajit could say. Abhinav Kumar, Vikash Kumar and Mukul Kumar of GD Mother International School, Bihar were the runners-up of the zonal finals.
 
	Said Abhinav: ldquo;My father has been my biggest source of inspiration. At school we are also actively involved in other sports. rdquo; Their teacher Raman rued: ldquo;We do not get enough time to practise as the students are always burdened with assignments. rdquo; However, with the introduction of online chess, the game has gained popularity amongst youngsters.

	ALSOC debate
 
	The fourth edition of ALSOC (Alumnorum Societas, St Xavier rsquo;s Old Boys rsquo; Association) Challenge Debate was held at GD Birla Sabhagar on January 4 in association with The Telegraph. The topic for the evening was ldquo;This house believes that we have to pay for our human rights rdquo;. 
 
	The event started off with a speech by Noomi Mehta, secretary of ALSOC, where he emphasised the importance of debating about the scope of human rights in the corrupt global scenario. ldquo;Assurance of having rights since birth does not mean there is no political, social or environmental restraint on them, rdquo; felt speaker Dr Sandip Chatterjee, a neurosurgeon. 
 
	But can something as fundamental as birthright be taken away from an individual? ldquo;Every human being should have the right to live. If it is taken away, does it not mean we have to pay for those rights, rdquo; asked speaker Suman Mukherjee, the director of JD Birla Institute. 
 
	Today rsquo;s imperfect world divides human rights into positive and negative ones. ldquo;Every human being has the right to free speech. However, it cannot be exercised to the extent that it hurts the sentiment of a particular sect or community, rdquo; said Deborshi Barat, a fifth-year NUJS student. The restriction of human rights is an integral part of living in a democratic society, he added. 
 
	Kalyan Kumar Mitra, a high court advocate, drew a line between rights and duties. ldquo;We live in a world of double standards, with pre-defined civil and human rights. We buy our duties, but the rights are inherent, rdquo; he added. 
 
	The next couple of minutes saw speakers holding forth on gender inequality, displacement of tribes, racial discrimination and day-to-day survival strategies. Puns on civil society, right to life, Nandigram issue and self-ownership flew back and forth. Finally, the audience voted that we have to pay for our human rights. 
 
	Rudrangshu Mukherjee of The Telegraph, the moderator of the debate, called into question the delineating factor of ldquo;we rdquo; and ldquo;our rdquo;. After all, it is one world and we need to decide where to draw the line.

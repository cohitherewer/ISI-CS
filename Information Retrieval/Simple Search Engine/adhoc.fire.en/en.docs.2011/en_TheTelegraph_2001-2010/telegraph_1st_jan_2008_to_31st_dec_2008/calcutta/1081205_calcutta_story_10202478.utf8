                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Security scurry for M-team
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	The M-factor is driving security forces to despair in the countdown to an action-packed weekend.        
	With Lalbazar going loco over arrangements for Manmohan, Maradona and Masjid on December 6, officers could not be blamed if they were itching to dial M for M, James Bonds boss.        
	A meeting chaired by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and attended by home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and police bosses was held at Writers Buildings on Thursday to review the security arrangements for December 6.        
	The hand of god is at play, grimaced a senior police official. For a city on alert following the terror attacks in Mumbai, this is a triple whammy on the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition.        
	In terms of priority, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of course tops the list with a contingent of around 1,500 cops set to take up position from Saturday afternoon for the touchdown at the RCTC ground.        
	When Singh arrives from Bolpur and goes to Raj Bhavan, Union minister for external affairs Pranab Mukherjee  yes, another M is likely to be present.        
	Both the Prime Minister and the external affairs minister are under Z-plus security cover, said an officer. And we will be taking similar measures for Maradona.        
	The Argentine soccer legend will be touching down late on Friday and keeping the security forces on their toes throughout December 6 with deft moves by air and road from the Bypass hotel to Mahestala and then later to the Salt Lake stadium.        
	Officers have been reviewing security arrangements at every venue  from the hotels helipad to the stadium where a 50,000-strong crowd is expected on Saturday evening.        
	We have asked the hotel to provide details of their layout before working out the police deployment plan, said an officer. There will be extra security cover at the stadium and along the Bypass.        
	All this while the man himself is most bothered about his diet  a special request for a low-spice pasta, fish, vegetables and soup menu, rounded off with rosogolla has reached the hotel  during his two-day stay in town.        
	If Manmohan and Maradona were not enough  no, there has been no talk of a good M and a bad M in Lalbazar  the rallies lined up to mark the Babri Masjid demolition have left the police jittery.        
	There is a special alert at airports and other vital installations. Intensive checking is being carried out on the streets of the city. At such a time, playing host to VVIPs will be a real challenge, said a Special Branch officer.        
	P.S: Cops are keeping their fingers crossed that the local M  Mamata Banerjee  spends a somnolent weekend.

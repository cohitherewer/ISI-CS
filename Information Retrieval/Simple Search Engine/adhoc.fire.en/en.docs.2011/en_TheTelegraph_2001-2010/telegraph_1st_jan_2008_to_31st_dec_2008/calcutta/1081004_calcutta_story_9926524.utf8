                A portion of the roof of a four-storeyed mall under construction off VIP Road near Baguiati caved in around 7.20pm on Friday, trapping nine workers. The fire brigade, police, BSF jawans from Madhyamgram and RAF personnel took part in the rescue operation, dragging out all nine by 10.10pm. Sniffer dogs were pressed into service to check if there were any more trapped workers. The workers have been admitted to nursing home with multiple injuries, but none of them is critical, said Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality. He said there were no complaints against the mall, but added that the building looks unstable, as it does not have too many pillars.     For the first time, CESC will place three heavy-duty generators at strategic locations in the city to ensure uninterrupted power supply at puja pandals in the event of a major electrical fault. Three 500 KV generators will be placed in north, south and central Calcutta as standby. In case there is any major electrical fault at any pandal, the puja lights can be connected to a generator. A major fault takes six to eight hours to repair, said Dilip Sen, the executive director of CESC.     A passenger was held at Calcutta airport by immigration authorities on Friday as there was a look out circular against him. Sauvik Karak, 33, an IT professional and resident of New Alipore, arrived in the city on Friday morning from London on an Air India flight. Officials said he got married three years back and his wife had filed a complaint of torture against him in Pune under Section 498. He was later handed over to airport police, officials said.    A 45-year-old man was found unconscious on the footpath near Kar Bagan in Ultadanga on Friday and taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead. Bhagirath Goswami was a resident of Jharkhand and worked in a private firm, a police officer said. There were no external injuries on his body, he added.    A mob damaged several trucks and a tanker at the civic central garage in Moulali after a conservancy truck rammed into a car on Convent Road on Friday afternoon. A 70 -year-old passenger in the car was injured. Chief engineer (conservancy) Arun Sarkar said the car was coming towards Moulali along Convent Road. The conservancy truck emerged suddenly on the road at high speed and before the driver could stop the vehicle, it collided with the car.

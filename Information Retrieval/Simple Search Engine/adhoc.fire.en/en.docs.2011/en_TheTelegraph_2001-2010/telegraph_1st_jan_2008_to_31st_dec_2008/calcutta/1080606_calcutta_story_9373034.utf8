	Comrades may force a shutdown but they are not entirely devoid of compassion.        
	Passengers stranded at Howrah station on Thursday morning will vouch for it, as around 1,500 of them were ferried to their destinations by CPM cadres, led by Lagan Deo Singh. The fare was a flat Rs 10.        
	Its a rare sight  bandh-backers arranging for vehicles, said Subhro Banerjee. The Salt Lake resident had boarded the Down Hatia Express at Ranchi and reached Howrah around 6am.        
	As he emerged from the station, empty bus and taxi stands greeted him and he resigned himself to the fate of being confined in the station till 6pm.        
	But around 8am, he learnt that some special buses  with Citu flags fluttering from the windows  would ply on various routes.                
	Singh had arranged for 18 buses, 10 of them private, to ferry the commuters to various city destinations, including Kidderpore, Panihati, Jadavpur and Salt Lake.        
	With his supporters in tow, Singh had reached Howrah station before the crack of the dawn to ensure a total shutdown. But we were moved by the plight of the stranded passengers Many had boarded the trains without knowing about the bandh. So, we decided to help them out, Singh told Metro.        
	Party leaders were spoken to, buses arranged and the drivers and conductors summoned. By 8am, the vehicles were ready to roll. Some cadres even travelled on the buses to ensure that they were not targetted on the way by fellow comrades.        
	Serampore resident Gaurav Bhattacharya was full of praise for Singh and his men. Bhattacharya had gone to Vellore for the treatment of his 12-year-old daughter, Sampurna, who has been suffering from cardiac ailments. He had boarded the Yeshvantpur Express at 12.35am on June 4, hours before the CPM called the bandh.        
	We reached Howrah at 5.30am but there no taxis outside the station. I approached Singh and he arranged for a car, said Bhattacharya.         
	Passengers at Sealdah station, however, were not so lucky. Most preferred to spend the bandh hours on the platforms.         
	Some hired ambulances, though they were charging exorbitant rates. An ambulance driver demanded Rs 500 for a trip to Garia. I backed out but another family hired it, said Paritosh Majhi.

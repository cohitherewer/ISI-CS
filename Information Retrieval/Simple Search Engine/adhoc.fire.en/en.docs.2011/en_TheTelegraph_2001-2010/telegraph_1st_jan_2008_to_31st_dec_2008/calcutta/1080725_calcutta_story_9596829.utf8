The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | War cry after JU bosses rescue
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       War cry after JU bosses rescue
          OUR BUREAU                           Jadavpur University students picket outside the room where the vice-chancellor and the pro vice-chancellor were held captive for 27 hours. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhayaya                                  
	A team of teachers and guards entered the Jadavpur University arts building on Thursday afternoon and freed the vice-chancellor and pro vice-chancellor from the room in which agitating students had held them captive overnight.        
	The rescue team met with resistance from students on the way out, but there was no violence except for some jostling. Vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh and pro vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta, who was allegedly assaulted on Wednesday, had been confined for over 27 hours.        
	It was a terrible experienceWe were made to sit on chairs through the night. They (the students) shouted filthy slogans whenever we stepped out of the room to use the toilet. They were not bothered about our health condition, said Ghosh, 60, after stepping out of the building around 4.30pm.        
	The siege had begun at 2pm on Wednesday, an hour before the executive council was to meet to discuss three proposals that the student unions wanted the authorities to reject straightaway.         
	The first of them is to segregate first-year boarders to save them from ragging, another is to make it mandatory for students with less than 70 per cent attendance to take special permission for semester examinations and the third is to advance semesters by a month.         
	Student leaders said they would intensify the agitation on Friday.         
	We will organise rallies and demonstrations on the campus because the authorities are not listening to our demands, said Lokeshwari Dasgupta, the general secretary of the Faculty of Arts Students.        
	The union put up a roadblock outside the campus for an hour on Thursday.        
	Members of all three unions, including the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu) and We the Independents, met in the evening to discuss their next course of action.         
	The decisions (the university says they are only proposals) were taken arbitrarily and we oppose them We also want the authorities to set up a full-fledged placement cell, said Anujit Chakraborty, the Fetsu vice-president.        
	The unions claimed that trouble would not have erupted had the authorities not decided to adjourn the fortnightly executive council meeting. But members of the council said students actually prevented them from holding the meeting by assaulting the pro vice-chancellor and the deputy registrar just when they were proceeding towards the main administrative block.        
	The meeting was to be held in the arts building, but the venue was ostensibly changed because a large group of students had gathered there to pressure the council to reject all the proposals.        
	 We want them to give us in writing that they will not introduce these new measures (including reduction of Puja holidays) But they are refusing to do it and so we will carry on with our agitation, said Abhishek Chakraborty, the general secretary of Fetsu.        
	Ghosh and Duttas rescue was planned during a meeting of the Jadavpur University Teachers Association. When some members of the association reached the arts building along with guards, it took the students there by surprise. Before they could react, the vice-chancellor and the pro vice-chancellor had been escorted out of the building.         
	The two sides later accused each other of using strong-arm tactics.         
	There was no reason for the students to act in this way. We have not finalised any of the proposals that the students are opposing, Ghosh said.

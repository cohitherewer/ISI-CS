     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	Seven men with choppers and improvised guns looted nearly Rs 50,000 in cash and jewellery from a house in Sonarpur early on Tuesday. The dacoits attacked the landlord when he tried to resist them.
    
	The gang laid siege to Tapen Chatterjees house in Dakshin Noapara around 3.30pm. The men made their way in by sawing the grille in the kitchen. Chatterjee, who works in a private firm, woke up to find the dacoits trying to open an almirah.
    
	He said the seven, who appeared to be in their 30s, had their faces covered. They were speaking in Bengali.
    
	Chatterjee was hit on the head with an iron rod by one of the dacoits when he tried to raise an alarm. He was admitted to Ruby General Hospital with a head injury. The seven left on motorcycles with the loot.
    
	The incident was the latest in a series of dacoities in the area. On Monday night, six armed men looted a petrol pump at Malancha, in Sonarpur, and took away nearly Rs 1 lakh. The dacoits came in a car and held the employees of the pump, who were closing it, at gunpoint while taking away the money.
    
	Earlier this month, seven shops in Sonarpur market were looted. The dacoits made off with nearly Rs 2.5 lakh. In December, two houses on NSC Bose Road were robbed by a gang. Some of its members were arrested and a portion of the loot was recovered, but the kingpin is absconding.

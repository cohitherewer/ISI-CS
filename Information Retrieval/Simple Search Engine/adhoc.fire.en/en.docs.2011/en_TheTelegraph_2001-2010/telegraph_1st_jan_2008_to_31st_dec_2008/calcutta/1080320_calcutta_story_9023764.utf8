The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU teaching posts vacant
                                                                                                               JU teaching posts vacant
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Twenty-three teaching posts in Jadavpur University are lying vacant because the authorities are yet to decide when to call an adjourned meeting of the executive council.        
	Officials said the lists of selected candidates for all 23 posts, in at least 10 departments, are ready.        
	They were placed before the executive council on February 8 but the meeting had to be adjourned following a difference of opinion among the teacher-members, said an official.        
	There is no deadline for calling an adjourned meeting of the executive council. But we are going to announce the date soon, said vice-chancellor P.N.Ghosh.        
	The university rules state that the list of shortlisted candidates, prepared by the selection committee of a department, will have to be placed before the executive council for approval.        
	The February 8 meeting saw a group of teachers question the procedure followed in shortlisting the candidates and another group express doubt over the academic qualifications of a candidate for a physics teachers post.        
	The meeting dragged on for four hours without reaching a consensus, prompting the vice-chancellor to adjourn the meeting, said a source.        
	University sources said this is the first time in the past many years that the authorities are taking so long to call an adjourned meeting of the executive council.        
	Normally, the council meets every two-three weeks. More than six weeks have passed since the meeting was adjourned but the authorities are yet to announce the date for the new meeting. The authorities should have been more prompt as the 23 posts have been lying vacant for months, said a council member who preferred not to be named.        
	We are the worst-hit, said a student of the physics department. If the posts are not filled up immediately, the syllabus cannot be completed. Among the other affected departments are construction engineering, bio-mechanics, architecture and mathematics.

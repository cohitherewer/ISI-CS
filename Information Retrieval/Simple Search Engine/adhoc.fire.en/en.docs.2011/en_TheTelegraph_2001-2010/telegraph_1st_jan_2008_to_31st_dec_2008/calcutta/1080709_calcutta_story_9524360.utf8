                Sipra Banerjee, whose decomposed body was found in her Alipore Road flat on Tuesday, was not murdered, the preliminary finding of the post-mortem suggests. The 60-year-old might have died because of severe bleeding from an intestinal ulcer, aggravated by heavy intake of painkillers. The woman died on Saturday afternoon. Her son Dipankar, who seems to be lacking in maturity, has nothing to do with her death. Soon after Sipra died, he locked the flat and left for his grandmothers house in Howrahs Kadamtala, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.     Some robbers broke into the flat of a police officer and made off with ornaments and cash worth Rs 12,000 on Tuesday. The incident took place at the police quarters in Ultadanga when Suprabhat Sarkar was out and his mother had taken his son to school. She found the lock on the main door broken after returning at 1pm. After stepping inside, she found two gold chains of Suprabhats wife missing along with Rs 4,000 in cash.     CPM MP Mohammad Selims bag was picked up mistakenly from the conveyor belt by the protocol officer of a former state governor at Calcutta airport on Tuesday afternoon. The MP was returning home from Mumbai on a Jet Airways flight. According to an airport official, the officer thought that Selim would accompany the former governor and so took his bag to the car. It was returned to Selim.    Presidency College authorities have postponed counselling and admission to botany, zoology, physiology, economics and statistics honours courses from July 10 to July 11.

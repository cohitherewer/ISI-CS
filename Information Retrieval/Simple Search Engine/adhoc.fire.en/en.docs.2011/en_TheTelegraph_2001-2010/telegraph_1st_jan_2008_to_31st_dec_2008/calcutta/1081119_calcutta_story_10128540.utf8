          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A middle-aged patient suffering from memory loss after a head injury has been missing since he walked out of the state government-run ESI Hospital in Maniktala on Saturday.        
	Deepak Jash, a resident of Karangapara in Durgapur, was hit by a truck on October 31 on his way to the Indian Oil Corporation bottling plant, where he worked. He was admitted to ESI Hospital, Durgapur, with head injury.        
	Jash was shifted to Bankura Medical College and Hospital and then to the city hospital after his condition became critical.         
	He recovered at ESI, Maniktala, but started suffering from bouts of memory loss. At times, he could not recognise even his sons, said Bijoy Kesh, Jashs son-in-law.        
	Jash was last seen in the hospital around 3.30pm on Saturday. The authorities have lodged a missing diary with Maniktala police station.        
	As soon as visiting hours started on Saturday, Jash told an attendant that he was going to the toilet. When he did not return, the attendant searched for him everywhere but could not find him, said Ashok Bhattacharya, the deputy medical superintendent of the hospital.        
	We got a phone call from the hospital. The officials said they had informed the police and there was nothing else they could do, said Abhijeet, 22, the elder of Jashs two sons.        
	We searched for him at railway stations and other places, Abhijeet added.        
	The hospital officials allegedly told the family members that it was not their job to ensure that a patient did not go out.        
	According to hospital officials, Jash was in the habit of venturing out. Attendants had brought him back on earlier occasions, said Bhattacharya.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cards with cab details 
                                                                                                               Cards with cab details 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Taxis may soon carry cards with particulars of the owner                                   
	The Bengal Taxi Association is trying to ensure that passengers get back articles left behind in a taxi.         
	Cards bearing the name of the owner, his contact number, the drivers name, the vehicles registration number and the associations phone number will be kept in taxis, said Bimal Guha, the secretary of the association. We will request passengers to pick up a card every time they hire a taxi. If someone leaves an article behind, he can then contact the taxi-owner or inform the police.        
	The card can be utilised in other ways too. If a passenger likes a driver, he can contact the owner to send the same taxi over to his house. Similarly, passengers who collect the cards can easily lodge complaints with the association. We will take action against the driver, stated Guha.         
	A fare chart issued by the state transport department, will be pasted on the back of the drivers seat. The fare charts being carried by drivers now may not be authentic.        
	The association has requested the transport department to make it mandatory for taxis to carry the card and fare chart.        
	More than 35,000 taxis affiliated with the association are set to implement the measures from next month.

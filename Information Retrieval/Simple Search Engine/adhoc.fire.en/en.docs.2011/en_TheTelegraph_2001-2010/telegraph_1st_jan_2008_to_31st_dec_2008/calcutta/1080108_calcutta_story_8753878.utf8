	Three days after a daylight dacoity at a sharebrokers apartment in Burrabazar, sleuths tracked down five youths who had gone on a looting spree.
    
	The police recovered part of the loot  a fancy mobile phone, three wristwatches, gold jewellery worth Rs 4 lakh  and seized four firearms from the gang.
    
	Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department, said three of the youths were rounded up from Jehanabad in Bihar late on Sunday.
    
	They disclosed that two others, Arvind and Shravan, both Matador drivers in Burrabazar, were involved in the dacoity on January 3. We arrested the duo around noon on Monday, said Shamim.
    
	All the five accused have been remanded in police custody till January 21.
    
	Around 9.15am on January 3, the five youths raided the NS Bose Road apartment of Indra Rajmal Lodha, a sharebroker. They hit Lodha on the head with a revolver butt before snatching the keys of the almirahs. They held Lodha, his grandmother and their domestic helps at gun point, and escaped with cash and jewellery.
    
	Shravan used to park his Matador near Lodhas house and had insider information about the apartment block. He shared this with Arvind, said Abhranta Bandhu Majumdar, the officer-in-charge of the detective departments anti-dacoity wing.
    
	Arvind went to his in-laws in Jehanabad a few weeks ago and got in touch with three goons  Chhotu, Ajay and Baba  to raid the Lodha flat, explained Majumdar.
    
	The trio from Bihar reached the city two days before the operation.
    
	The booty was recovered from the house of Arvinds relative in Liluah. Another goon from Bihar, identified as Pintu, is absconding.

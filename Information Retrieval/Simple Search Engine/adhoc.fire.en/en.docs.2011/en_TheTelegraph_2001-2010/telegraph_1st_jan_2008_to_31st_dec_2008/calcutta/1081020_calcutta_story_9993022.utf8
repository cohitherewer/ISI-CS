  - Busy in celebration, examiners fail to meet deadline for evaluation of Part I amp; II answer scripts          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Around 1.7 lakh undergraduate students of Calcutta University are being kept waiting for their Part I and II examination results because the authorities are unable to get a section of examiners out of festive mode.        
	We will be in a position to fix a date for the announcement of the BA and B.Sc Part I and II (honours and general) results after Kali puja, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of Calcutta University.        
	Sources in the examination department of the university blamed the delay  examinations were held in July-August and the results were to be declared before Puja  on a handful of examiners who had become incommunicado.        
	Most examiners have completed evaluating the answer scripts they were given but some havent. We are trying to contact them over phone and asking them to send the marks. It will be easier to get in touch with them when the colleges where they teach reopen after Kali puja, an official said. We will try our best to declare the results by the second week of November.        
	The students had been told that their results would be declared before the start of the festive season. On missing the pre-Puja deadline, the university assured them that the results of both examinations would be announced when the academic session resumed after the holidays.        
	Almost a week has passed since Calcutta Universitys administrative offices reopened after the Puja holidays. But we still have no idea when the results will be declared, said a computer science student of a north Calcutta college.        
	There has been no official statement on whether action would be taken against those college teachers who had not met the deadline for evaluating answer scripts and sending these back to the university.        
	The results of last years BA and B.Sc Part I and II examinations (under the 1+1+1 system) had been delayed, too. The examinations had been held in June-July and the results declared in the third week of November.        
	Criticised for the delay, the university decided to decentralise the evaluation process this year. The idea was to set up several centres for tabulation of marks and involve colleges in the process of collecting answer scripts from the examiners.         
	The examination department is working overtime to announce the results as early as possible. It will be easier for us to complete the process when all colleges reopen after Kali puja, said Debashis Biswas, the deputy controller of examinations.

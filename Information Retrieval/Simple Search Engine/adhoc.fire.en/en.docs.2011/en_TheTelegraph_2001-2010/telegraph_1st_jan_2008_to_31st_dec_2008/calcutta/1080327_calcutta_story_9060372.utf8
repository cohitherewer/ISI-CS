The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop form sought in Riz case
                                                                                                               Cop form sought in Riz case
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Wednesday asked the state government to submit a form filled up by police after Rizwanur Rahmans body was found on the railway tracks in Patipukur on September 21.        
	Form 48, the document sought by Justice Dipankar Dutta, was not attached with the affidavit that the state had placed before the court.        
	According to Section 174 of the CrPC and Rule 299 of the Police Regulation of Bengal, in case of an unnatural death, the officer-in-charge of the local police station is supposed to fill up Form 48, mentioning the name and age of the deceased. The name and address of the person who has informed the police about the body and the apparent cause of death should also be mentioned. The judge has asked the government to produce the form, said advocate Sailendu Rakshit.        
	The Rahmans had stated in an affidavit filed before the court recently that the inquest report and the FIR that the police recorded after examining the body mentioned the age of the deceased as 55.        
	They also claimed that no one from the family had identified Rizwanurs body before the post-mortem.        
	The judge also directed the government to file an affidavit mentioning the exact statement the then Calcutta police chief, Prasun Mukherjee, had made at a press conference on September 26.

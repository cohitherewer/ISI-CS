                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Playtime after school

	When school gets over, Class VIII student Ankita Biswas and some of her friends stay back on the campus a couple of hours more on Saturdays. They drop in at school on Sunday mornings too. Pushing away the benches, the students of Giribala Sircar Balika Vidyalaya, on Shyampukur Street, make room in their third-floor classroom for a theatre session.         
	The girls are working on a scene from Munshi Premchands Biddhangsha under the guidance of Shyambazar-based theatre group Shohan. There are about 40 students of classes VII and VIII of Giribala Sircar Balika Vidyalaya who have signed up for the free theatre coaching classes.         
	We want to encourage the children to think, and help them channelise their creativity, said Anish Ghosh, the director of the 16-year-old theatre group, which has come forward to give schoolkids a chance to explore their potential on the lines of Nandikars theatre-for-children project.        
	Apart from Giribala Sircar Balika Vidyalaya, Shohan has tied up with Shyambazar AV School and Bagbazar High School to train a total of 130 girls and boys of classes VII to XII. We have done the preliminary training in the other two schools. We will start full-fledged sessions by next week, added Ghosh.         
	The sessions will continue till September, after which each school will put up a 40-minute production.         
	Shohan members are helping the children grasp the concept of theatre and are guiding them in scriptwriting, body movements, voice modulation and pronunciation.        
	We can express different kinds of emotions when we are doing theatre. At times I portray a person who I am not and yet I have to be true to character. I find it very exciting, said Ankita.        
	I always participate in cultural programmes like song and dance but we dont have drama classes in our school. So I didnt want to miss out on the opportunity of doing theatre, said Class VIII student Paromita Singh.        
	The authorities of Giribala Sircar Balika Vidyalaya are happy with the results. The students are learning teamwork and how to improvise. Its apparent that they are enjoying the sessions. About 15 to 20 per cent of students in our school are from underprivileged families, so this sort of activity is entertaining as well as educative for them, said headmistress Madhabi Basu.        
	Buoyed by the success, Shohan is planning big. We are trying to host a theatre festival in October, where the children will showcase their plays, said Ghosh.

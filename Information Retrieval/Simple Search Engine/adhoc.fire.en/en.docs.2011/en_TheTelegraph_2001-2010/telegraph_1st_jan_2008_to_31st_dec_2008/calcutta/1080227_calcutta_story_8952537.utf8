	A youth charged with theft fled from the lock-up of Taltala police station hours after his arrest on Friday. Efforts to trace him have drawn a blank.
    
	Police had kept Mohammad Sabirs escape  in front of two constables  under wraps for the past four days.
    
	Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Vineet Goyal refused to comment, but assistant commissioner (central) Haraprasad Ghosh confirmed the news. Raids are on to arrest him. He was held in connection with a theft in the Ripon Street area, Ghosh said.
    
	An officer of Taltala police station said Sabir fled around 9pm on Friday, when a constable opened the lock-up gate to serve diner to the accused.
    
	Sabir asked the constable for water. As soon as the cop returned with a bottle, Sabir pounced on him. The constable fell on one of his colleagues standing behind. Before both could collect themselves, Sabir ran out of the lock-up and the police station, the officer.
    
	It was too late by the time the constable duo raised an alarm. A team chased Sabir till Taltala Bazar Lane and then lost track of him, the officer added.
    
	The failure of the police to track down Sabir has enraged local residents, who claim to have helped the cops nab him. We tipped them off about Sabirs hideout... How would the police protect us from goons when there is no security inside the police station? asked Akbar Ali, a trader and a local resident.
    
	The incident has left senior officers in Lalbazar red-faced. Its shocking to learn that an accused has fled from a police station lock-up. An investigation has been ordered, said a senior officer.
    
	Sabir was involved in several theft cases in the Ripon Street-Taltala area. He is part of a bigger gang, said an officer.

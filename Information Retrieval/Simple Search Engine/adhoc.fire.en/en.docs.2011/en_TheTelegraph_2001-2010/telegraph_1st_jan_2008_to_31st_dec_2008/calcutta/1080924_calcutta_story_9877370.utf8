	A copy of Rizwanur Rahmans suicide note in which he forgave his father-in-law Ashok Todi has been appended to the CBIs chargesheet against the seven accused in the case, sources in the investigating agency said.         
	The chargesheet was submitted to a special CBI court on the Bankshal court premises late on Monday. CBI joint director Arun Kumar refused comment on the matter.        
	We live in this so-called secular country! In the past 20 days I saw the true face of our administration which runs on money. There is no law for the protection of commoners. So I have decided to take my life. I forgive my father-in-law Ashok Todi because he is a father after all, a source quoted Rizwanur as having written in the note.        
	It was kept in a folder named Rizwan-Priyanka created on September 20 last year in his computer at the institute where he taught. The next day, his body was found beside rail tracks in Patipukur. The folder, allegedly deleted by his relatives, was retrieved by experts in Hyderabad.        
	I know there are still good people left in our country. I want them to know the love story of me and my wife Priyanka whose dreams were killed.... May God forgive me for the pain I am giving to my loved ones. To them I would just say my world stopped after Priyanka was taken from me, read the note, according to a source.        
	Besides Ashok Todi, his brother Pradeep, their family friend Anil Saraogi, former deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar, assistant commissioner (detective department) Sukanti Chakraborty, sub-inspector Krishnendu Das and Rahmans family friend Pappu have been charged with abetting Rizwanurs suicide.

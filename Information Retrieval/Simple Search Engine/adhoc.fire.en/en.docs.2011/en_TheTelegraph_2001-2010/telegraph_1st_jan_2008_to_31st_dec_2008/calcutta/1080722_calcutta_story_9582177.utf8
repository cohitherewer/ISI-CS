                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Partial eclipse on Aug 1
  - Sun-sational treat for city          A STAFF REPORTER                          A partial solar eclipse in progress                                        
	Sky gazers in Calcutta are in for a celestial treat on August 1, when a partial solar eclipse will be prominently visible from the eastern and the north-eastern parts of the country.         
	In Calcutta, the eclipse will start at 4.18pm and end around 6.02pm, 15 minutes before sunset. According to experts, the moon will cover 50 per cent of the suns disc as seen from Calcutta around 5.12pm.         
	The maximum obscuration of the sun will be visible in Sibsagar, Assam, where the magnitude of eclipse will be around 0.8. This means the moon will cover almost 80 per cent of the suns disc.        
	Debiprosad Duari, the director (research and academics) of MP Birla Planetarium, cautioned against staring at the sun without protection.         
	Looking at the sun even for a short duration can be dangerous for the eyes. Hence, one should use a proper solar filter to see the partially eclipsed sun, he said.         
	A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon doesnt fully conceal the sun but covers it by different degrees as seen from different geographical locations. Geometrically, it can be seen as a linear arrangement of the moon, sun and earth, with the moon in between.        
	Since the eclipse will occur late in the afternoon, one should stand in a place from where the western horizon can be viewed properly. At the point of maximum phase of the eclipse, the sun will be visible quite low in the sky, only 17 degrees above the western horizon, Duari said.        
	The last partial solar eclipse occurred on March 19, 2007. After August 1, the next one will occur on January 26, 2009, but it will not be prominently visible from eastern and southern India.

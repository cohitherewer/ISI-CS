          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 26-year-old software engineer from Teghoria drowned in the Cauvery Falls in Coorg, Karnataka, on Saturday.        
	Gautam Mandal, posted in IT major CapGeminis Mumbai office, and some of his colleagues had gone to Bangalore last week on work.        
	After they were through with their assignment, Gautam and five of his friends went to Coorg, 350 km from Bangalore.        
	On Saturday, the group had gone to visit the waterfall before lunch. Gautam decided to take a dip.         
	Moments later, his friends noticed he was being carried away by the current. They said they could not jump to his rescue as they could not swim, said Gautams brother, Uttam, who had gone to Coorg to bring the body back.        
	The family had suspected foul play but later buried the thought as the autopsy did not reveal anything suspicious, said Uttam. The body was brought back on Tuesday.

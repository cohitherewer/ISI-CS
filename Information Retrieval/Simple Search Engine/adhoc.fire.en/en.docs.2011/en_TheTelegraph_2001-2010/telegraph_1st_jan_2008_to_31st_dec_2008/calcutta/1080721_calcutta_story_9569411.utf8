                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rail acts on bridge plea
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The recast No. 3 bridge stands above the road surface. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The railway authorities have finally agreed to take corrective measures to make No. 3 Bridge in Entally, which was recast three months ago, motorable again.        
	The railway ministry will cough up around Rs 2 crore for the project.        
	We had a meeting with Eastern Railway chief engineer K. Prasad, who assured us that the railway authorities would realign Covent Road on both sides of the bridge so that vehicular movement could resume on the stretch, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Friday. The meeting was also attended by police representatives.        
	The bridge over railway tracks was not high enough to allow free passage of trains. At times, the pantographs of EMU or goods trains got stuck in the structure. To overcome the problem, the railway authorities decided to overcast the bridge and raise its height by two feet.        
	Post-revamp, the bridge juts above the road surface, making it impossible for vehicles to mount it.        
	The railways, when told about the problem, said realigning the road was the civic bodys responsibility. But they finally agreed to do the needful following a plea from the civic body, said an official.        
	Municipal commissioner Bandyopadhyay said the police had been insisting on early restoration of the road, as the non-functioning No. 3 bridge was causing snarls at Moulali and Sealdah.        
	Apart from Prasad, the railway side was represented by deputy chief engineer A.K. Roy. The civic body was represented by chief engineer (civil) Debasish Chakraborty and deputy chief engineer (civil) Soumitra Bhattacharyya.

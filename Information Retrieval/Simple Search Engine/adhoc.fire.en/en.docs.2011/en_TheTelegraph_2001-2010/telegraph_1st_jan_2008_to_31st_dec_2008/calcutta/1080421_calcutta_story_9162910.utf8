The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ashram death charge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ashram death charge
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A former monk of Akhanda Mandali has accused members of the ruling coterie of engineering the murder of sect head Samhita Devi, Mamoni to her followers.        
	Asim Brahmachari, who brought the charges on Sunday, is among the four held responsible by the ruling group for the murder.        
	Those who brought the charge against me plotted Mamonis murder themselves. They wanted to grab the ashrams property, said Asim Brahmachari, who has set up an organisation of his own in Kolaghat.        
	Kalipada Das, a former monk of the order, had stabbed Mamoni and another member to death, before being fatally beaten himself, at the sects Gurudham temple in Kankurgachhi on Wednesday night.        
	I had never met Kalidas or heard his name before, said Asim Brahmachari.        
	I came in touch with the organisation when I was 12 years old. Later, I took diksha from the sects founder, Swami Swarupananda Paramhansa Deva. There was a conspiracy to throw me out after the founders death in 1984, as a section within the organisation wanted me to succeed him, the monk added.        
	He, however, admitted that there was a power tussle within the Mandali. The heads of the Siliguri, Tripura and Bangladesh units had approached me to lead their group, but I did not accept their proposal, said Asim Brahmachari.

	Ever wondered where the smart, spotless uniforms worn by policemen during the Republic Day Parade come from?
    
	Meet Sabed Ali Mondal, Mintu Khan and Bablu Sarkar  in crushed shirts and trousers, they toil for months in their cramped shops to ensure that the parade consignment is stitched on time.
    
	Mondal, 65, has been at it for the past 30 years. He opened his tailoring shop, Durga Enterprise, in Khanberia in 1978, after bagging a tender to prepare uniforms for Calcutta police.
    
	I have been stitching uniforms for the Red Road parade since then. It fills me with pride knowing that my creation is being watched  perhaps appreciated  by a clutch of VVIPs, including the governor and the chief minister, said Mondal.
    
	Tailoring the uniforms is no easy task. We have to take the measurements of each and every policeman and sew accordingly, added Mondal, who has prepared the uniforms of around 190 police personnel this year.
    
	Matching Mondal in sartorial perfection is 30-year-old Mintu Khan.
    
	With five years experience of tailoring, Khan has readied around 250 uniforms, mostly for the personnel of the Rapid Action Force and the Calcutta police band.
    
	He and his sister had worked 14 hours a day for the past month in their two shops in Mahestala to deliver the order in time. I saw the parade once. It was a different feeling to see the men marching in uniforms we had stitched, said Khan, the owner of Swadhin Dresses.
    
	Star Tailors, opposite Rabindra Bharati University, is another shop to leave its imprint on the pride of the parade. The shop was opened in 1985 and from 1988, we started receiving orders from cops to make their uniforms, said the owner, 43-year-old Bablu Sarkar.
    
	Impressed with their work, the authorities started placing orders for parade uniforms with them since 2006.
    
	This Republic Day, the personnel of the traffic departments mechanised unit will sport uniforms prepared in the 125-sq-ft shop off BT Road.

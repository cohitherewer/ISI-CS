                      View of visual arts                    The social and political history of modern Bengal has had a significant impact on its art scene. At the same time, artists in Bengal have also displayed a will to develop distinctive, individual idioms based on their personal experiences. The deceptively familiar look on the surface of the works of new generation artists is merely the result of their being created within the sphere of common visual traditions. Though their semantics appear vaguely similar, their syntactics ensure that there is a totally new dimension to each new work. To be launched this evening by Ashok Vajpeyi, Art Now - A Glimpse; Collectors Series 1, an exposition of the works of 10 artists, presents a mind-boggling variety of visual appearances of the art of contemporary Bengal. The release will be followed by an exhibition of paintings by the 10 artists featured in the book. It will continue till May 7 (except Sundays); 11 am - 7 pm. Featured artists include Aditya Basak, Chandra Bhattacharya (a painting by him appears above), Jayashree Chakravorty, Partha Pratim Deb, Sekhar Roy and Tapas Konar.

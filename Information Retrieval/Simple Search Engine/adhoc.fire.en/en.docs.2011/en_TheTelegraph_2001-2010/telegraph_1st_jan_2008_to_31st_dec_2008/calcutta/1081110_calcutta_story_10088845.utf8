	Vector-borne diseases are suspected to have claimed three more lives in the city since Saturday evening. Another malaria case has also been detected in Salt Lake.        
	Sandhya Patra, 42, and Sukanta Das, 50, both residents of Behala, died of an unknown fever. The death certificate of 52-year-old Ratan Sarkar, the Kasba block president of Trinamul Congress, mentioned renal failure as the cause. His family members and Trinamul supporters, however, claimed he died of dengue.        
	The number of deaths from vector-borne diseases this season has crossed 25. Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said on Saturday the situation could worsen as winter might arrive late.         
	Sandhya Patra, who lived on SN Roy Road in Behala, had fever with body ache since last Tuesday. She was admitted to Vidyasagar State General Hospital on Friday and transferred to the CMRI the same evening. She had high fever and was suffering from severe respiratory distress. Sandhya died around 5am on Sunday.        
	Her blood test was conducted at Vidyasagar Hospital. She died before the results were available but a doctor had said that it was a case of malaria, said Shyamal Patra, her father-in-law.        
	Ratan Sarkar, a resident of Bediadanga, was suffering from fever since Thursday. He was admitted to SSKM Hospital on Friday with very high fever after he tested negative for malaria at a CMC clinic. He died on Sunday morning.        
	The doctors at the clinic gave him malaria medicines even before the test results were available, said Sarkars relative Mihir Ghosh.        
	On Saturday evening, trader Sukanta Das, a resident of Chanditala Branch Road, died after suffering from fever since Friday morning.         
	He was admitted to Bangur Hospital on Friday evening and put on drip. Doctors suspected he had malaria. Das died around 5.25pm on Saturday. His death certificate stated acute coronary syndrome with septicaemia.        
	Ratna Mandal, a 34-year-old homemaker at Nabapally in Salt Lake, was diagnosed with malaria on Sunday.

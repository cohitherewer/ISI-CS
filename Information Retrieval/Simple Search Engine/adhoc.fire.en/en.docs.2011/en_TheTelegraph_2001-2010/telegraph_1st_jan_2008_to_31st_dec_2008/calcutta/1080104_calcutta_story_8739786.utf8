     Todays question: After the violence of November 21, do you feel safe in Calcutta?

	 I am sure all Calcuttans must be heartbroken after the violence of November 21. The City of Joy, which we were so proud of, is slowly being swallowed by terror and bloodshed. I think the government should take immediate steps to maintain law and order which it miserably failed to do that day. Exemplary punishment should be handed out to the culprits behind Wednesdays riot. We can only hope and pray that peace will soon prevail in the city.

	 After the violence that we saw on the streets of Calcutta, I hardly feel safe anymore. Cars were burned, people threw stones, children got trapped while returning from schools  all these reminded me of the mayhem in Iraq.

	 No place in the world is terror-proof. Wednesdays violence in Calcutta was shocking, but we still love the city. The misdeeds of some antisocial elements cant shatter the spirit of the City of Joy. Let the government do what it feels, we Calcuttans will try every possible means to maintain peace in our locality.

	 It gets a little harder to keep believing something once you are hurt. But our city has been an example of communal harmony for years, and the reputation cannot be spoilt by the violent activities of some unruly people. I still feel safe in Calcutta.

nOur Calcutta does remains a safe place despite the hooliganism on November 21. Just as one swallow does not make summer, a handful of notorious elements cannot destroy the ambience of brotherhood in Calcutta. We are strong enough to rise above such issues and move ahead.

 n The sporadic incidents of violence that erupted on November 21 do indicate that the man on the street is not safe. The image of Calcutta as a safe place can take a beating if the intelligence networks continue to hibernate, resulting in the police getting caught unawares. Though the city is considered the hub of intelligentsia, the aggressive postures and pronouncements by political leaders on debatable issues charge peoples emotions. Thus, they are misled into venting their ire by resorting to violence. Such tendencies are alarmingly on the rise and may help terrorists. It is high time that restraint is imposed on the behaviour of politicians.

	We have always known Calcutta as a secular and liberal metropolitan city. People had the space to express their opinions without being scared of any opposition. The incident of November 21 changed nothing. It only created panic among people. The government should take steps to prevent such violent disruptions. The leaders should be more responsible to their followers. Otherwise, Calcutta will cease to be a secular city.

nIt is quite clear that most Calcuttans are peace-loving. A negligible section is causing the violence to fulfil vested interests. These people should be identified and brought to book, to ensure the safety and security of others.

	The photographs published in The Telegraph makes one want to ask the agitators Who is Taslima Nasreen? Why is her writing considered objectionable? Where is Nandigram? Why is it in the news? The protesters most probably will not be able to answer a single question since most of them are only looking for a chance to create mayhem. The leaders should first increase their knowledge and then educate the supporters about the aim of the protest. Although a lot of unwanted incidents took place that day it is my strong belief that our beloved city is still safe and will remain so until the death of humanity of Calcuttans.

nCalcutta is safer than other cities but the Nandigram issue has made it a risky place. The violence and riots have made it still more dangerous. But we should be brave and continue living here as danger is inevitable.

	Wednesdays violence was an expression of anger sponsored by the All India Minority Forum. It may be recalled that this is the second major attempt by anti-socials to create mayhem in Calcutta after the anti-Sikh riots following the brutal assassination of Indira Gandhi in 1984. The police, this time, also made an all-out effort to prevent communal conflagration from engulfing the city without bloodshed despite the provocation by the rioters. There must have been some intelligence gap in anticipating the evil designs of the conspirators. The chief minister had handled the situation tactfully by keeping the army at hand for patrolling the disturbed areas. It would be facile to think that Calcuttans will no longer feel safe in the city that has stood up against the ugly plots by hoodlums to tarnish its image.

 nThe violence of November 21 had turned the City of Joy into a city of fury. A religious leader instigated illiterate, unemployed youths to protest against controversial author Taslima Nasreen and asked her to leave Calcutta. People felt unsafe as phone lines got jammed and everyone was in a rush to reach home. Though the situation was brought under control, the fear remained in the hearts of the citizens. Only God knows what the consequences will be if such a situation occurs in future.

	Calcuttans have always been peace-loving and adventurous. Whatever happened on November 21 is really shameful but its a matter of serious concern too. I think freedom of expression doesnt mean licence to write or say anything against any religion or community. By supporting Taslima, the government is simply playing politics. India is a multi-religious country so any kind of blasphemy will not be accepted against any religion. In my view, the writer-in-exile must not be allowed to stay here any more for the well-being of the country.

	Our city is now being targetted by terrorists. So people are not safe in Calcutta anymore. It is vital for administrators to be careful in tracking terrorists movements because at any time they may spread violence in the city using any issue raised by any party.

	Calcutta is safer than most places. It is the City of Joy and will remain so. People pay for the games politicians play. Freedom of expression is good but abusing it is not. All religions should be respected. It is the city of Rabindranath Tagore, Satyajit Ray and others who are respected by all communities in society. It means they were instructive and not destructive.

nThe leaders of the states political parties should be careful regarding hooligans who create trouble. They should take a break from their political infighting and focus on maintaining peace and harmony.

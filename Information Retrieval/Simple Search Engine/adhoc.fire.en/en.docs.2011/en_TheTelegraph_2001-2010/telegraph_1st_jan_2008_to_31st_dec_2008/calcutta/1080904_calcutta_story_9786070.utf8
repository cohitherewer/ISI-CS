          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                        
	The state public works and irrigation departments and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) have decided to hand over about 150 km of city roads to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).        
	The CMC is always blamed for the poor condition of roads though it does not maintain many of them. We always wanted these roads to be handed over to us. I took up the matter with the state government, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.         
	Out of the 2,705 km of roads in the city, the CMC owns and maintains about 2,100 km. About 275 km of roads in Kidderpore, Garden Reach and along the Hooghly are owned by Calcutta Port Trust. It is supposed to provide conservancy services and arrange for street lights and repairs on the roads.        
	The PWD owns about 200 km of roads while the CMDA maintains over 130 km of roads that it constructed.        
	The CMC will take up the responsibility of maintaining 150 km of roads in the first phase. The departments and the CMDA will hand over more roads to the civic body in future.         
	The list of roads taken over by the CMC include EM Bypass, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Canal East Road and Canal West Road.         
	The CMC will start regular conservancy services on the stretches from the last week of September. We will later take up maintenance of the roads and the lights, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.         
	The chief engineer (conservancy) of the civic body, Arun Sarkar, met officials of his department on Wednesday to assign responsibility of maintaining the roads that will be handed over.        
	Red Road, Cathedral Road and the stretches in front of Curzon Park, Netaji Indoor Stadium, Assembly and Victoria Memorial are some of the roads still under the control of the PWD.        
	According to civic officials, Calcutta Port Trust had turned down appeals by the CMC to hand over Circular Garden Reach Road, Taratala Road, Transport Depot Road and Strand Bank Road.

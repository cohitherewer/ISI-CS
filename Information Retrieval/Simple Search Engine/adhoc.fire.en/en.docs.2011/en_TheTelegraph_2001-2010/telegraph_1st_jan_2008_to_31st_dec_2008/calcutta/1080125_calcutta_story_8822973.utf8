	The CID on Thursday submitted a chargesheet against Sutapa Bag, accusing her of killing her nine-year-old daughter Tiyasha and abetting the suicide of husband Jayanta Bag.
    
	Both Sutapa and Jayanta, a quack, were party to the murder of Tiyasha at their Jagacha home in Howrah. Sutapa strangled the girl while Bag was slashing the veins in her hands and legs, said a sleuth.
    
	The woman then did nothing to stop her husbands suicide attempt. So, we have charged her with abetment to suicide, said P. Neerajnayan, the special inspector-general (CID). She has also been charged with involvement in a conspiracy and attempted suicide.
    
	Early on April 4 last year, the Bags were taken to hospital in a critical condition by their relatives and the police. Jayanta and Tiyasha were declared dead on arrival, while Sutapa survived the wounds. 
    
	A probe revealed that the couple had killed their daughter and then attempted suicide after a group of local youths raided their house. The youths reportedly went on the rampage after learning that Jayanta had performed an abortion on a girl and video-recorded the procedure on his cellphone.
    
	Four youths  Ujjwal Biswas, Raju Roy, Ashish Koley and Biswajit Pal  have been charged with abetment to suicide.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Robbers decamped with cash and jewellery from a traders home and a yoga centre on Thursday.         
	Six armed men assaulted Prosenjit Sarkar and his wife Soma and took away cash and jewellery worth Rs 1 lakh from their home at Kulti, in Calcutta Leather Complex, in the afternoon. The couple were admitted to a nursing home.        
	The robbers entered the house around 2.30am and held Prosenjit and Soma at gunpoint. When Soma refused to hand over the keys to the almirah, the men hit her on the head. They then broke open the almirah and took away the valuables.        
	Later in the morning, two armed youths forced themselves into a yoga centre in a second-floor flat of a three-storeyed building in South End Park, in the Lake police station area, tied up the manager and fled with Rs 9,000.        
	Padma Khastagir, a former chief justice of Calcutta High Court, owned the building.

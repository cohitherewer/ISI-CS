The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pause button pushed in rush for star rooms
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pause button pushed in rush for star rooms
          SUBHRO SAHA      
	We are 1,000, going on 3,000  the star hotel room anthem at the start of the year.        
	We are 1,000, wed rather be 500  the star hotel room anthem at the end of the year.        
	Calcuttas king-sized hospitality dream  2,000 new keys in five years  has shrunk dramatically, with winter occupancy plummeting and hotel projects being consigned to the back burner.        
	Hotels and retail are low priority in these troubled times. We have to somehow complete the residential projects committed to the customer, admitted a top official of a national realty major on condition of anonymity.        
	So, the citys poor five-star room count  barely a fifth of Delhi  will not grow as long as downturn and demand blues rule.        
	The market meltdown, a struggling tourism industry, corporate curbs on travelling and the Mumbai siege have pegged back the hospitality industry. Most of the hotel projects will incur a delay of 12 to 24 months, said Pradeep Sureka, the president of realtors body Credai Bengal.        
	The two zones to be hit the hardest by the go-slow are the Bypass corridor along ITC Sonar and New Town.        
	DLF, which had promised Calcutta three hotels with a combined investment of Rs 1,000 crore, including a 600-room showpiece Bypass address with Hilton, is yet to break ground two years after the land transaction.        
	Emaar-MGF, which made real estate history by quoting a record Rs 213 crore for a 6.24-acre plot on the Bypass, has only just commenced work on its double-header there  a JW Marriott and a Holiday Inn  with no visible progress on RCTCs Russell Street premises. Our hospitality plans for the Calcutta market are on track and work is in progress at all the hospitality projects in the city, claimed an Emaar-MGF official.        
	Industry watchers, however, confirmed that the projects are way behind schedule.        
	Bengal Unitech Universal, committed to add three properties in Rajarhat with 500-plus rooms, has only completed the foundation for the Marriott Courtyard in its IT park. The two proposed hotels in its 100-acre convention centre are still in the planning stage.        
	The hotel industry is taking a huge hit due to cuts in travel and entertainment by India Inc, said Abhijit Das, the managing director of international property consultants Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj (Calcutta).        
	As far as occupancy at the existing star addresses in town goes, the figures are looking bad now but they could look ugly by the end of the crucial November-January period.        
	Anirban Simlai, the executive manager of The Park, Calcutta, said: The real impact would be clearer by the quarter ending March, 09.        
	According to industry veterans, occupancy across the city has slumped 20 to 30 per cent this December compared with last year. A new entrant now will get killed; the existing players are surviving by leveraging long-term relationships, said one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Next weekend you can be at ...   Gurashey
                                                                                                               Next weekend you can be at ...   Gurashey
                                                
	Surrounded by slopes of silver fir, hemlock and magnolia, Gurashey stands brooding. A pall of gloom seems to hang over the township for most of the year, like the veil of clouds that obscures the Kanchenjunga and other snow-capped titans in the distance. In spring, though, the sparkle of rhododendrons lights up the region.        
	Gurashey, near Sukhia Pokhri, is one of the new attractions on the misty heights of the Eastern Himalayas. The entire Kanchenjunga range can be viewed from the township. At dawn and dusk, the mountains bathed in gold present an unforgettable sight.        
	There are two routes to Sukhia Pokhri. The first is up Hill Cart Road to Ghoom. The serpentine 70-km road intertwines with the rail tracks from Siliguri. Tourists generally take this route to Darjeeling. Besides buses and cars, toy train is an option till Ghoom. Batasia Loop, through which the train winds its way up, is a feat of engineering.        
	The other route to Sukhia Pokhri is via Mirik. Buses ply between Mirik and Darjeeling via Ghoom. Hired jeeps or cars offer a more reliable option. It also allows the journey through the green tea estates to be savoured.        
	Sukhia Pokhri is on the road to Manebhanjan from Ghoom. Gurashey Forest Resort, an eco-tourism project, is a five-minute walk from the main market of Sukhia Pokhri. The trail ends on the bank of the Rangit.         
	At 2,250 metres, Gurashey is a tapestry of nature and people, done up with ferns and orchids. The cottages rest comfortably on the lap of nature, with windows overlooking the mountains. The balconies provide a captivating view of Mim Tea Estate.         
	The chirping of birds heralds the dawn and the orchestra of crickets welcomes the evening in the town. During the day, hundreds of butterflies flutter in the cool breeze that blows from the forests of grand oaks, stately cedars and fragrant pines.        
	Jore Pokhri, 3 km from Gurashey, is another developing tourist spot. It is on the way to Simana village, a dreamland in undulating greens, near the border with Nepal.         
	Lepcha Jagat, on the way to Ghoom, is worth a visit. For those on the lookout for foreign goods, a trip to Pashupati Market is a must.  
	Going   
	There rsquo;s a motorable road from Siliguri via Kurseong. Buses and taxis are available to Ghoom. Jeeps and cars on hire go up to Sukhia Pokhri. The journey takes about five hours. The other route is through Mirik. Nearest broad-gauge railway station is New Jalpaiguri. The nearest airport is Bagdogra. Darjeeling is only 22 km from Gurashey and can be reached in half an hour.

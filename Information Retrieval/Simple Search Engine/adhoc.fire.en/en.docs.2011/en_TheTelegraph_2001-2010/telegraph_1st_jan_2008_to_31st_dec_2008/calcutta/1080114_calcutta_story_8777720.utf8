             Firemen were hamstrung by several factors in their battle with the Nandaram blaze  not to mention faulty and ineffective equipment. Their only ladder refused to open and didnt even reach the upper floors. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya
                 
	Somesh Chandra Das had just dozed off in his room around 1am when the CR Avenue fire station reverberated with the sound of a siren. It was a signal, for him and his colleagues to rush.
    
	Das, and hundreds of others, battled the Nandaram blaze till 1pm on Saturday and reported back to work at 5am the next day. Ki korbo bolun? How can I ask my superior to relieve me in such a crisis? asked Das.
    
	There was no dearth of manpower, but lack of water emerged as the main hurdle in battling the blaze. 
    
	The men in yellow hats were taking turns in entering the building. The smoke is making it difficult for us to stay inside for more than 10 minutes. But we are trying to stay put a little longer to give relief to our colleagues on the previous shift, said Shyamal Guha. 
    
	Fireman Achinta Chatterjee fainted on the ninth floor while trying to make his way through the thick smoke. He was rushed to hospital.
    
	The building did not have any fire-fighting measure, said Bikash Modak, one of the officers supervising the operation. It is also proving difficult for the fire-fighters to make their way through narrow, dark, zig-zag corridors. At times, we walked towards a dead end. Several of our men tripped, Modak added.
    
	Even the stairs are so narrow that two people can hardly move side-by-side. To make matters worse, there is only one staircase in the Kashiram block and no emergency exit, a fireman pointed out.
    
	The narrow corridors are also slowing down the personnel engaged in cutting the shutters of the shops and godowns in the complex. Its taking double the usual time to cut a shutter, said a fireman.
    
	The men in khaki are braving boiling water inside the towering inferno. I was spraying water from a hose-pipe when a splash of hot water fell on me. I would have been scalded if I had not poured cold water over myself from the hose-pipe immediately, said the fire-fighter. The water being sprayed into the rooms is instantly reaching boiling temperature and leaking through the floors, he explained.
    
	Despite the obstacles, the firemen could reach a few rooms on the second floor on Sunday afternoon and spray water from there to the rear of Tirpalpatti.

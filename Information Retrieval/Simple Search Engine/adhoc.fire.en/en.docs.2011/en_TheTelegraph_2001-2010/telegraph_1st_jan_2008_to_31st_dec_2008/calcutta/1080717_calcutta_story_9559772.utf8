The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | They do, but wont say it!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       They do, but wont say it!
  - Konkona, Ranvir act coy about admitting they are engaged          A STAFF REPORTER                            Konkona and (above) Ranvir                                       
	She texts us: No more comments on my personal life!        
	He tells us: I do not discuss my personal life.        
	And you still doubt they are made for each other?        
	Konkona Sensharma and Ranvir Shorey are learnt to have got engaged. The two have been an item (going around in Bollywood parlance) for over two years now. But both have remained mum on the matter, neither confirming nor denying their romance.        
	It was a little different on Friday afternoon when The Telegraph texted Konkona and called Ranvir. While he was polite but firm in his refusal to discuss his personal life, she was slightly less guarded.        
	I am not married yet! was the first cheery SMS from Konkona, before she parroted Ranvirs dour line (were they together and chuckling about the ring on her finger?) about no comments on her personal life.         
	But Konkona did round off the text exchange with a Thanks! followed by a smiley.        
	Those who have known Aparna Sens daughter since her childhood confirm she has a lot to smile about  Koko is doing good work; shes happy and comfortable with Ranvir.        
	Konkona and Ranvir are very good friends. We would often ask her when they would get married and she would say Ki jani, dekhi, said Jayasree Dasgupta, a singer and a close friend of Aparnas.        
	The mother was far less forthcoming about her daughters supposed engagement. Her stern SMS read: They neither deny nor confirm this rumour. They feel their personal lives are no ones business except themselves and their family and close friends        
	A close friend of Ranvir explained why Bollywood was so cool about this engagement talk. Ranvir and Konkona have always been at ease with each other and never bothered about what others might be thinking of them. And because they are so cool about the whole thing, there is no gossip buzz around them in Mumbai, said the actor, on condition of anonymity.                          
	Konkona and Ranvir have been turning up for movie premieres and fashion shows together for over a year now. In the past couple of weeks, they have been spotted at the Hancock premiere at Fame Adlabs in Andheri (West) and at a late-night show of The Orphanage at Fun Republic, also in Andheri (West).        
	Konkona, 28, started out in Tollywood with Subrata Sens Ek Je Achhe Kanya in 2000, shot into national limelight with Aparna Sens Mr amp; Mrs Iyer and achieved Bollywood stardom with Madhur Bhandarkars Page 3, playing a journalist (something she had always seen as her second career choice). She has worked with some of the best and the biggest in the business in 15 Park Avenue, Dosar, Omkara, Life in a... Metro, Laaga Chunari Mein Daag and Aaja Nachle.        
	Ranvir, 34, started out with bit roles on the big screen (after making a mark as a VJ on Channel V) a couple of years after Konkona did but has now emerged as an unlikely leading man in Bollywood. After the success of Mithya, he now awaits the release of Ugly Aur Pagli opposite Mallika Sherawat.        
	 quot;They are two compatible individuals who also bring a similar cinematic sensibility to the table, quot; says a film-maker waiting to cast them together.        
	Konkona and Ranvir have shared screen space before in Madhur Bhandarkars Traffic Signal and Rajat Kapoors Mixed Doubles. But something tells they would use neither when they get down to matching their kundalis. In Traffic Signal he was a drug addict and she a streetwalker. In Mixed Doubles they did play man and wife, but in a tale of wife-swapping.

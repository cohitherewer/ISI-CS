	State transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Monday said the government would consider reducing bus fares if the Centre cut diesel price by Rs 2.        
	The Union government reduced the price of petrol by Rs 5 but diesel price was brought down only by Rs 2. There is still room for lowering the price of diesel. If diesel price is further reduced by Rs 2, we would consider bringing down bus fares, said the minister.        
	Chakraborty also stressed that two-stroke autorickshaws would have to go off the road by December 31 and four-stroke three-wheelers would have to convert to LPG, complying with a high court order.        
	The state government has no choice but to abide by the court order. Autorickshaw drivers will resist moves to implement the order but we have to ensure that passengers are not harassed, said the minister.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The upgrade of Besu  though delayed  is on track, with the human resource development ministry setting up a committee to assess the process.        
	The committee will assess all financial and administrative implications of the takeover of Besu and Cochin University of Science and Technology, a human resource development ministry order, dated May 27, said.        
	The order was issued by Seema Raj, the technical section director of the ministrys higher education department.        
	Besu and the Cochin university (Cusat) were among the five institutes identified by the Anandakrishnan Committee for upgrade to Indian institutes of engineering, science and technology (IIEST).        
	The assessment committee will be headed by N.K. Sinha, a joint secretary in the ministry, and the vice-chancellors of both universities will be among the members.        
	The order, a copy of which is with Metro, said: A proposal to upgrade Besu and Cusat into a system of IIESTs is under the consideration of the ministry.        
	The upgrade proposal is now pending with the ministrys expenditure finance committee which, officials said, will meet this month.        
	In another letter to state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, Sinha wrote: Since the process of upgrade is time-consuming and certain procedural formalities are to be complied with... the proposed upgrade cannot be effected for the time being....

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A man in his mid-20s, suspected to be a thief, was dragged out of the pond he was hiding in and beaten to death by members of a resistance group in Liluah on Sunday morning.        
	Members of the night patrol group, which has permission from police, saw four men sitting under a water reservoir on Q Road around 1am on Sunday. When the night guards chased them, three ran away while Rabidas Das, a Jagachha resident, jumped into the pond.        
	About 15 resistance group members stood guard around the water body till daybreak. After they spotted Dass head amid water hyacinth, they dragged him out and beat him with bricks and sticks for over two hours. Residents of the area were mute spectators to the thrashing.        
	The police reached the spot two hours after the incident. Das was dead by then. No one was arrested.        
	The guards smashed the thiefs head with a brick and then pounced on him with sticks they had collected from a house under construction, said a resident.        
	Howrah police superintendent Niraj Singh said Das had been arrested earlier in connection with several thefts.

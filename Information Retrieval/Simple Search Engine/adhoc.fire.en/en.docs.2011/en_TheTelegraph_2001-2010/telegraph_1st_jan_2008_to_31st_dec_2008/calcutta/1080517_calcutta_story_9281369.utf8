          A STAFF REPORTER                          Leela Devi Chandak                                  
	A 67-year-old woman headed for a temple was fatally injured at the Park Street-JL Nehru Road crossing, possibly on being hit by a vehicle, on Friday morning.        
	Leela Devi Chandak was taken to SSKM Hospital, where she was declared dead.        
	There were no witnesses to the 6am mishap but the nature of the injuries suggested that Chandak had been knocked down by a vehicle.        
	The vehicle is yet to be identified. No one has been arrested, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	Chandak, who lived with her younger son Rajkumar in a JL Nehru Road apartment, around 100 metres from the mishap site, was going to a temple in Burrabazar.        
	My mother visited the temple daily. Since our drivers do not arrive so early, she used to go to Burrabazar by bus or taxi, said Chandaks eldest son Ashok, who lives in Durgapur.        
	Minutes after she left the apartment, the liftman of the building informed Rajkumars family that Chandak was lying injured at the Park Street crossing.        
	The family called Rajkumar, who was out on his constitutional. He returned shortly and took his mother to SSKM Hospital.        
	The family alleged that vehicles ply recklessly along JL Nehru Road early in the morning as there are no policemen around.

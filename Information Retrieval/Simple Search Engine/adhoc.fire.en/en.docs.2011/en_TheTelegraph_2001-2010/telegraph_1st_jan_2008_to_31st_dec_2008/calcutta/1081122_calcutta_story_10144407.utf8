The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court seeks malaria report
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Court seeks malaria report
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to state in writing within two weeks the steps it had taken to control malaria.        
	The civic body is saying that it has organised public awareness campaigns to check the disease but we want to know how aware the CMC itself is about the process of malaria prevention, observed the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice S. Banerjee.        
	The CMC will have to mention in its report the annual budgetary allocation for controlling the disease and how it spent the money. The civic body will also have to inform the court whether it has the expertise to combat the disease and why it had not started the proposed malaria hospital on Kalighat Road.        
	The order was passed on a PIL moved in 2004 by advocate Pradip Roy. The civic body had not taken steps to control malaria in the city despite repeated orders from the court, Roy said on Friday.        
	Theres a malaria death almost every day. But the CMC is claiming that the situation is much better than previous years and the media is creating a panic by publishing the news of malaria deaths, he added.        
	CMC counsel Anindya Mitra and Alok Ghosh claimed the situation was not alarming. The civic body has undertaken adequate programmes to tackle the disease. Warning the public about the disease is the first task of the CMC. The disease will be automatically controlled when the common people become cautious, said Mitra.

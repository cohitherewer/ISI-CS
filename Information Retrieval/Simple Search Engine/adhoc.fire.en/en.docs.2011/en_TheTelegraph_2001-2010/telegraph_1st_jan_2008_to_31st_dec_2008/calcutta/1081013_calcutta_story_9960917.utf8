The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land row resolved, more space for fairs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Land row resolved, more space for fairs
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                            
	A land dispute between the Calcutta Stock Exchange Association and the civic body has been settled out of court, paving the way for a bigger Book Fair ground on the Bypass than on the Maidan.        
	The breakthrough arrived at a meeting between the association and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC)  held in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industry minister Nirupam Sen  at Writers Buildings on October 3.        
	The CMC got back the 10 acres beside ITC Sonar Bangla, on the Bypass, that it had been claiming from the association over the past five years. The dispute was pending in the high court. The civic body paid the association Rs 4.4 crore as price for five acres.        
	The rest will be put on auction and 75 per cent of the sale proceeds will go to the associations kitty.        
	Shortly after the deal was sealed, the civic body handed over five acres from the plot to the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation (WBTPO) for the extension of the permanent fair ground, Milon Mela.        
	With the addition of five acres, Milon Mela will measure 23.18 acres or 71 bighas. The Book Fair premises on the Maidan was spread across 57 bighas.        
	One of the reasons for the organisers reluctance to hold the Book Fair at Milon Mela is that the Bypass spot is smaller than the one on the Maidan.        
	An official said the civic body had leased the 10-acre plot to the stock exchange association 12 years ago for Rs 8.8 crore. The association had sought the land to shift its trading hub from Lyons Range, in the central business district.        
	But the idea was later dropped and the plot has been lying vacant.        
	In 2004, then municipal commissioner Debasis Som had written to the association asking it to return the land. The association went to court against the commissioners order.

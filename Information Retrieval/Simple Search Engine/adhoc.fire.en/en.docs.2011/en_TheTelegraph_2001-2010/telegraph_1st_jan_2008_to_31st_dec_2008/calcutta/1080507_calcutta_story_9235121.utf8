          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sunil Let lying outside SSKM Hospital on Monday.   A Telegraph picture                                        
	The two youths who were forced to lie in the open in the SSKM Hospital compound for hours on Monday have finally received treatment.        
	Sunil Let has been admitted to the New Casualty Block and Hemanta Lodh to the New Emergency Block.        
	The two were turned out of the emergency ward of SSKM on Monday as no beds were vacant. The authorities could not risk putting them on the floor  nothing unusual at SSKM  as a Medical Council of India (MCI) team was visiting the hospital.        
	The hospital took them in around 1pm on Monday after a group of Trinamul Congress supporters organised a protest at the hospital and TV channels picked up the story.        
	The MCI team visited the hospital again on Tuesday but did not speak to the two patients.        
	I had a horrid time yesterday, but now I am much better, said Sunil, lying on his bed at the New Casualty Block. He was administered painkillers and antibiotics, and the wounds were bandaged. X-rays revealed there were no fractures.        
	Hemanta, however, was found to have suffered multiple fractures in his left leg, which has been put in a cast. He will need a surgery after a few days, a doctor said. The pain has subsided and I had liquid food today. A team of doctors examined me twice, said Hemanta.        
	Their third friend, Anirban Majumdar, is recovering at Medical College and Hospital. The trio had met with an accident while travelling on a motorcycle in Birbhum on Sunday night. They were taken to the sub-divisional hospital in Rampurhat, from where they were referred to Calcutta hospitals.        
	On Tuesday, the MCI team inspected the morgue and the laboratories at SSKM. The Centre will decide on granting permanent sanction to the hospitals medical course after going through the report.        
	On Monday, the team had expressed dissatisfaction over the air-conditioning system at the main operating theatre complex and the condition of the students hostel.

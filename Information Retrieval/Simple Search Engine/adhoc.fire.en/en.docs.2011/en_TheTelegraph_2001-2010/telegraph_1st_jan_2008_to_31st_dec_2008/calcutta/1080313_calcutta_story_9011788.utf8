The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Doctor held for molest
                                                                                                               Doctor held for molest
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sandip Das, a doctor with a private nursing home on New Town Road, off VIP Road, was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly molesting a woman patient.         
	The doctor was later granted bail by Barasat court.         
	The woman, a resident of Duke Garden apartments in Teghoria, was taken to the nursing home on Sunday with respiratory problems.        
	She was sharing a cabin with another patient and appeared to be quite well when I saw her on Monday evening. I repeatedly rang up the nursing home at night but they did not put me through to my wifes cabin, said Amlan Biswas, the womans husband.        
	When he visited her the next morning, she started crying. She was trembling. She couldnt even speak properly and kept on weeping and groaning. I gave her a sheet of paper and she wrote on it that she had been molested by a doctor who had visited the cabin the night before to examine her, stated Biswas.        
	The doctor claimed that a nurse had been with him while he was examining the patient, but the nurses who were on duty that night negated the claim. We also received other clues that point to misconduct by Das, said an officer of Baguiati police station.        
	We arrested the doctor on the basis of the complaint by the patients husband, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	The nursing home authorities said that they would take action against the doctor if the court found him guilty. We will wait for the court order before taking a decision, said K. Biswas, a spokesperson for the nursing home.        
	Some other officials of the nursing home said on condition of anonymity that similar complaints had been lodged against Das earlier.        
	A group of Forward Bloc supporters demonstrated in front of the nursing home on Wednesday, demanding the doctors ouster.

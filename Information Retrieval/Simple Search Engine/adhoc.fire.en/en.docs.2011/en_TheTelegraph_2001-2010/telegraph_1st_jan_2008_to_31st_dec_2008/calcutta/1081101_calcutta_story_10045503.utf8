The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bids opened for Ring Road
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bids opened for Ring Road

	Financial bids for the 42-km elevated Ring Road project were opened on Friday. This is the final step before the work is allotted to a developer.        
	The road, which will touch the airport, VIP Road, EM Bypass, Garia, Tollygunge, Diamond Harbour Road, Howrah bridge and Vidyasagar Setu, is scheduled to be built by 2015.        
	Government sources told Metro that the contract would be awarded in a couple of weeks.        
	The transport minister wants to complete the formalities by November 10, said a source.         
	The companies shortlisted are Navyug Construction, ITD of Thailand and a consortium of Srei Infrastructure Finance, Simplex Infrastructure and Sadhbav Engineering. The consortium is likely to bag the project, according to the source.        
	Additional chief secretary Sumantra Chowdhury and joint secretary Ranajit Maity, the government officials in charge of the project, could not be reached for comment.        
	The transport ministry conceived the project early last year and floated a global tender. The shortlist of three was drawn up after the technical bids were opened on September 2.        
	The developer will enjoy the right to collect toll on every vehicle passing the stretch for the next 35 years. The government had pegged the daily toll at Rs 50 per vehicle.        
	The four-lane road, with an exclusive bus lane, will have 11 intersections.        
	The consortium has estimated the project cost at Rs 6586.05 crore and sought government assistance to the tune of Rs 3,369.05 crore.        
	The Thai company also proposed to collect toll. Navyug did not specify how it would recover the cost.

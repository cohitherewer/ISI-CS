     OUR LEGAL REPORTER
               
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has informed the high court that it will immediately enforce its hawker policy. 
    
	The civic body has asked police to make a list of major roads and crossings as a primary step to enforce the policy.
    
	The CMC stated its intention in an affidavit it had submitted to the court on Friday. The matter is likely to come up for hearing this week, CMC lawyer Alok Ghosh said.
    
	Acting on a court order, a committee was formed with representatives of the CMC, hawkers association and the police to find a solution to the problem. The panel met on December 27  in the presence of the police and civic commissioners  and resolved to take steps to enforce the policy at the earliest.
    
	In the first phase of the drive, the police have been asked to remove hawkers from the carriageways and pavements of important roads, including Strand Road, Brabourne Road, KK Tagore Street, Rabindra Sarani, Netaji Subhas Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road and AJC Bose Road.
    
	Hawkers will also be removed from the front of government offices, heritage buildings, landmarks like Birla Planetarium, Indian Museum and Victoria Memorial, and the vicinity of the CMC headquarters.
    
	Hawking will not be allowed within 50 feet of major crossings. On the sidewalks where vending will be allowed, two-thirds space will be left open for pedestrians.

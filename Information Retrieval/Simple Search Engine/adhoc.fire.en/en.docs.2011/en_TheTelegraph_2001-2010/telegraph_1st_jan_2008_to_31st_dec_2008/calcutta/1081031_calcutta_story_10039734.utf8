          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A shallow fog at Calcutta airport hit flight services for the second consecutive day on Thursday.         
	Airport officials said around 10 flights were delayed by nearly two hours, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. The Category-II Instrument Landing System was of no help as visibility dropped below 350 metres.        
	The recent cyclone that grazed Bengal has left a lot of moisture in the air which is turning into fog because of the drop in the early morning temperature, said G.C. Debnath, the director of weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.         
	There is a possibility of mist on Friday as well, he added.        
	Air Indias Calcutta-Port Blair flight was the first to leave after visibility improved. It took off at 7.10am, a hour and a half behind schedule.        
	Kingfishers Bhubaneswar flight was delayed by two hours and Delhi flight by more than one-and-a-half hours.

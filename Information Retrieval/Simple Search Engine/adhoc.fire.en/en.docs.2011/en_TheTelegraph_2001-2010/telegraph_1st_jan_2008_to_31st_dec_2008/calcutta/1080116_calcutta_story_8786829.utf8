     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	The 33rd Calcutta Book Fair will be inaugurated by American author Paul Theroux on January 29 on Park Circus Maidan  the third venue in three years for the worlds largest non-trade book fair. The US is the theme country for the 2008 edition of the fair, which closes on February 10.
    
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya will be present at the inauguration.
    
	The fair will be open to the public from the next day. The timings are 2pm to 8pm on weekdays and noon to 9pm on holidays and weekends.
    
	Entry tickets will be available at Metro Railway stations and shops in various parts of the city, especially those in Park Circus. 
    
	The Publishers and Booksellers Guild, which organises the fair, has requested Eastern Railway to sell tickets from 10 railway station counters, including Howrah, Sealdah and Park Circus.
    
	We have also requested Eastern Railway to ensure that the trains that pass through Park Circus stop there on the fair days, Tridib Chatterjee, the general secretary of the guild, told Metro. 
    
	He stated that the guild had not approached educational institutions in the area to alter timings for the duration of the fair. Our representatives had visited schools only to invite them to the fair.
    
	Chatterjee dismissed the possibility of the fair being held at Milon Mela, off the Bypass, next year and said the guild would press for the venue to be shifted back to the Maidan.

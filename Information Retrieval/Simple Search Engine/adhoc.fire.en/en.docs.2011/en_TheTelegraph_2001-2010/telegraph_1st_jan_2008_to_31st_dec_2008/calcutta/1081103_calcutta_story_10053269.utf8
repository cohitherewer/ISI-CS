          A STAFF REPORTER                          Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Soumitra Chatterjee at Nandan on Saturday                                  
	Closed-circuit television cameras at Nandan, a fleet of bullet-proof cars and personal guards for VIPs will be part of the security arrangements for the 14th Kolkata Film Festival, to be held from November 10 to November 17.         
	Last weeks blasts in Assam, Sundays landmine explosion in West Midnapore and the possibility of political protests near the main venue have prompted the security boost.        
	The situation is tense this time. We have major security concerns and there are fears of political protests near the venue. We dont want to take chances, said a senior officer of Calcutta police.         
	Over 2,000 cops will be deployed at Nandan, where 20 CCTVs have been installed. Bullet-proof cars will ferry dignitaries and personal security guards will be assigned to VIPs.         
	A proposal to install CCTVs at Nandan was pending. We went ahead and installed 20, each costing Rs 6 lakh. Special teams from police stations will carry out security checks across the nine theatres where films will be screened daily, added the officer.         
	Each VIP will be provided with a personal security officer, who will double as a liaison officer, said another officer.         
	According to him, a special team has been constituted to create a ring around invitees from the world of entertainment and business.        
	For the first time, intelligence agencies and the special branch have been asked to track developments across the state and make an assessment of the political fallout. The findings will be shared with the special protection section of the special branch, which will oversee security arrangements of the festival.        
	There were protest rallies around Nandan on the Nandigram issue during last years festival.

  - MoUs inked to boost ties in education and trade          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Italy is eyeing tie-ups with various universities in West Bengal in its bid to strengthen its relationship with the state.        
	Italian consul-general Bruno Campria will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on behalf of the vice-chancellors of 13 Italian universities with their counterparts in Calcutta, Jadavpur, Burdwan and Rabindra Bharati for a wider and more structured cooperation between them.        
	Calcutta and Jadavpur universities are among the state institutions that have already launched programmes in association with colleges in Italy.        
	Students and teachers of Calcutta University (CU)s social science departments (including history and economics) and science departments (including information technology and biology) went to Italy this year to attend various academic programmes.        
	Calcutta University has signed MoUs with some Italian universities, under which many of our students and teachers have visited Italy. A number of teachers and postgraduate students from Italian institutions came here in the past few months to attend seminars and workshops, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	Jadavpur University, too, is conducting various academic programmes with Italian institutes. We have signed MoUs with universities in Italy. We are now running some joint programmes, one of which I attended in Rome this year, said registrar Rajat Banerjee.        
	As for Rabindra Bharati University, the Italian institutes are especially interested in tie-ups with the departments of dance, theatre, art and music.        
	The Italian government has sanctioned Euro 3.5 million for Roop Kala Kendra, an autonomous body attached to the state information and culture department. The money will be invested to buy equipment and boost training activities.        
	Apart from education, Italy is looking at a host of other fields to take its Bengal ties forward.        
	The Italian trade commission, operational since January, will set up a unit to provide technical consultancy to entrepreneurs in Bengal interested in mechanisation of agro-food processing and vegetables business.        
	Italians have the knowledge and expertise and they would like to create joint ventures with Indians for new markets in the Saarc and Asean countries as well as in Europe, Campria said.        
	The Italian consulate-general in Calcutta is helping set up a high-profile leather and hide training centre in Bantala, which will start operating by September. On the Italian side, the investment is Euro 1.2 million.        
	The Italian ministry of foreign affairs has sanctioned Euro 25 million in soft loans plus Euro 1 million in grant for a water supply and solid waste management project in 16 municipalities of West Bengal.

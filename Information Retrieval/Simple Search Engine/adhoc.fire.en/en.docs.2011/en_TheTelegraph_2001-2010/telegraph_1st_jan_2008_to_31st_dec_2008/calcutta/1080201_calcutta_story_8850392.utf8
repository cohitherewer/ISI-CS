	Two-year-old Sandeep Yadav, afflicted with polio, came to Calcutta from Darbhanga, Bihar, on December 11. Within days, his parents discovered he could not stand on his own.
    
	The Yadavs took him to BC Roy Polio Clinic and Hospital for Crippled Children. On January 25, lab tests confirmed the presence of Wild P3 virus in his stool sample.
    
	Sandeep, who learnt to walk a little early, was running a temperature quite frequently. But it didnt seem anything serious. It was only recently that he had a problem in his left leg, said mother Sunita, who used to stay in Calcutta but had gone back to Darbhanga before Sandeeps birth.
    
	The family claimed, without producing any document, that Sandeep had been given five vaccinations in Bihar, including four doses of pulse polio.
    
	Sunita, who has been staying with her son in the hospital, said: The doctor comes every morning. He has said my son will get well.
    
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said a comprehensive check in the Vivekananda Road area, where the child lived, yielded no other polio cases.
    
	The boys father, Babulal, is a taxi driver. He has two other sons  Deepak, 9, who studies in Class IV at a school near Chaltabagan, and Pradeep, 5.
    
	The family had to get a blood test and a CT Scan done from two nursing homes at a cost of over Rs 1,000.
    
	M.K. Chatterjee, the medical superintendent of the hospital, told Metro: The child had been admitted to hospital with paralysis in his left leg, but his condition has improved over the past month.
    
	A report submitted by the civic body to the state government on Thursday said transmigration between Calcutta and polio-affected areas like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh puts the city at a risk. 
    
	The view has been echoed by WHO.

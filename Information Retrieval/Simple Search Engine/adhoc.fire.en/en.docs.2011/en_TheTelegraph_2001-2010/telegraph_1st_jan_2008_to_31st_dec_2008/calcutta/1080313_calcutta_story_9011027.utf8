The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tease-tag tutor gets probe clean chit
                                                                                                               Tease-tag tutor gets probe clean chit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A one-woman inquiry commission has given a clean chit to a teacher of Viharilal College of Home and Social Sciences, who stands accused of molesting a postgraduate student.        
	The report of the commission, set up by Calcutta University to probe the complaint against Indubhusan Mondal, was placed before the syndicate on Tuesday.        
	The commission has not found any evidence that can substantiate the molestation charges, said vice-chancellor Ashis Kumar Banerjee.        
	We are trying to explain to the agitating students that they will have to abide by the report. They must understand that we cannot take action against the teacher on the basis of an allegation, he added. Banerjee, however, hinted that the authorities might consider ordering a second probe into the allegation.        
	The announcement only added fuel to the fire on the south Calcutta campus, where the students decided to continue boycotting classes till the university takes action against Mondal, who is a leader of the CPM-controlled Calcutta University Teachers Association.         
	The panel tried to shield Mondal because of his links with the ruling party. Our movement will continue till the truth is out, said an agitating student.        
	The commission says it has not come across any evidence of molestation, which isnt surprising because it has not spoken to the students and teachers, said another student of the college.        
	Sources in the university said the syndicate members held a prolonged meeting on the probe report on Tuesday. Some senior pro-CPM teachers, including a woman, spoke in favour of Mondal at the meeting, said a syndicate member.        
	The complaint against Mondal was lodged in December by the alleged victim, her parents and some women teachers of the college.        
	The girl had alleged that Mondal, a Bengali teacher, had offered to train her in operating a computer after class. Not suspecting his motive, she had accompanied Mondal to the laboratory, where the teacher had molested her.        
	With the university reportedly sitting on the complaint, the girls parents met the teachers of the college and urged them to take up the matter.

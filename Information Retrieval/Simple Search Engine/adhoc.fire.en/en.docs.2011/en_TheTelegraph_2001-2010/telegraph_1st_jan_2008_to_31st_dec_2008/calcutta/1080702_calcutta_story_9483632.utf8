	The civic authorities have decided to renovate two of the citys oldest temples, neglected for decades, at Boral burning ghat in Garia.         
	The heritage conservation wing of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), which owns the temples, will undertake the work.        
	The temples  one of Shiva and the other of Kali  were built more than 350 years ago on the banks of the Adi Ganga. The plaster has long peeled off the structures, exposing the bricks that have started withering away. Trees have grown out of both structures that were declared unsafe in the late 80s.        
	The ownership of the temples passed on to the CMC following the merger of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur with the city proper in 1984.        
	The CMC has decided to preserve both temples, along with a mosque in north Calcutta, which are the oldest religious structures of the city, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.         
	Bhosri Shah mosque that the commissioner referred to is at the confluence of the Hooghly and Bagbazar canal.         
	The temples were constructed following traditional aatchala architecture of Bengal, said the director-general of the CMCs project management unit, Anindya Karforma, who looks after the preservation of heritage structures. Unlike the Tripureswary temple in Boral, the original architecture of these two temples will be preserved during the renovation.        
	The Tripureswary temple was restored privately.        
	The director-general (town planning), Dipankar Sinha, said the Adi Ganga once flowed beside the Boral burning ghat. After the channel lost its navigability due to deposition of silt, Colonel Tolly in 1710 excavated a 27.36-km canal along the Adi Ganga, connecting the Hooghly with the Vidyadhari.         
	But the colonel had to deviate from the Adi Ganga course in places. At Boral, Tollys Nullah is half a kilometre from the Adi Ganga.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Zoo not to give another giraffe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zoo not to give another giraffe
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Alipore zoo will not give Nandankanan a replacement for Sundar, the 11-year-old giraffe that died while being transported to Orissa.        
	We have decided not to give another giraffe to Nandankanan, not after knowing that callousness led to Sundars death, forest minister Ananta Roy said on Monday.        
	The minister said the team from Nandankanan did not adhere to basic safety norms while transporting the giraffe to Orissa from Alipore zoo as part of an exchange programme.        
	The escorts were solely responsible for the animals safe transit after it was handed over to them. They did not adhere to basic safety norms, he said.        
	The first post-mortem report has revealed that a high-voltage electric shock killed Sundar after he came in contact with an overhead wire.        
	The report revealed burn injuries in one of its ears. Its neck apparently came in contact with the wire. Such was the shock that Sundar sat down in an awkward position and its left hip was dislocated in the process, the director of Alipore zoo, S. Chowdhury, said.        
	The 11-year-old giraffes histopathology (study of tissues) report is expected to confirm what the post-mortem report states.        
	The director of Nandankanan, A.K. Patnaik, said he was ready to institute an inquiry into the accident.         
	We have yet to receive the post-mortem report. We will order a probe if there is any mention of negligence by the officials who were in charge of transporting the animal.        
	The accident occurred at Bagnan, a two-hour drive from the zoo, early on Thursday. By the time Sundar was brought back to Alipore for treatment, around 12 hours had been lost. Zoo officials said they could have saved the giraffe had the escort team brought him back immediately after the accident.

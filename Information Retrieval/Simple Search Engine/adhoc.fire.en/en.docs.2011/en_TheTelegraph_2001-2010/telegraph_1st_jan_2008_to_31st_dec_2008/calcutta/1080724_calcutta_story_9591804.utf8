The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Assault on   JU officials
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Assault on   JU officials
  - Edgy over proposals, students target staff before crucial meeting        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pro vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta                                            
	Students assaulted the pro vice-chancellor and deputy registrar of Jadavpur University on a day when the institutions executive council was to discuss contentious proposals like segregating first-year boarders to stop ragging.        
	After the assault, the students put the injured pro vice-chancellor, Siddhartha Dutta, vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh and other officials under house arrest and did not let them leave the arts building until late in the night.         
	Another group waylaid four more members of the executive council, including dean of engineering Manoj Mitra, on the road between the science and arts blocks and kept them there till 9pm. The fortnightly meeting, slated for 3pm, never took place.         
	As we were proceeding from the arts building to the main meeting room in the administrative block, I noticed some students attempting to attack the vice-chancellor. I immediately tried to block them. That is when some of the agitators targeted me and I was injured, Dutta said.        
	But leaders of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union and the Faculty of Arts Students claimed that it was the administrations decision to adjourn the meeting that led to the fracas.        
	Apart from the proposal to have separate hostels for freshers, the executive council was to decide whether to make it mandatory for students with less than 70 per cent attendance to take special permission to sit for semester examinations. The third proposal on the agenda was to advance semesters by a month.                  Members of Jadavpur University rsquo;s executive council being gheraoed by students on campus.

	Trouble started around 2pm, when a large group of students assembled in front of the Anita Banerjee Memorial Hall in the arts block to pressure the executive council to reject the proposals.        
	We were holding a peaceful demonstration. We were suddenly told that the executive council meeting would be adjourned. We earnestly requested the members not to adjourn the meeting. The issues are important to us and we wanted them resolved on Wednesday itself, said student leader Anujit Chakraborty.        
	Registrar Rajat Banerjee, deputy registrar Partha Pratim Lahiri and dean of arts Biswajit Chatterjee were in the team of officials held hostage.        
	We are shocked at the way students manhandled some senior council members. They must understand that anti-ragging measures like isolating freshers are being proposed on the basis of a directive from the Supreme Court, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the executive council.

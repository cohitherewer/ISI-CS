                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dacoit trail leads to killer
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A youth arrested in Jadavpur on suspicion of being a dacoit turned out to be a contract killer from Delhi.        
	Mohammed Naushad, 24, fled Delhi after killing a moneylender on February 10 and took refuge in Baruipur, deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim said on Friday.        
	Naushad has admitted to the crime. He said he had been hired by the girlfriend of the moneylender, Chandravan, Shamim added.        
	Naushad and eight others were arrested on April 10 when they had assembled near the 8B bus stand in Jadavpur allegedly to commit a dacoity.        
	The detective department wanted to interrogate the youths to find out whether they had looted a jewellery shop in Entally in March.        
	It was during the grilling that we came to know about Naushads Delhi past, said an investigating officer.        
	The youth allegedly told the police that he had killed Chandravan at the behest of his girlfriend Bobby.         
	Chandravan, who was married, had an affair with Bobby. She was also his business partner, said an officer who grilled Naushad.        
	But their relationship turned sour after Chandravans family members came to know about the affair. The moneylender decided to snap all his links, business and personal, with Bobby, but she refused to part ways.        
	Bobby then got in touch with Naushad to bump off Chandravan. The two went to Etawa and bought two firearms and 10 rounds of cartridges. Bobby even deposited Rs 50,000 in Naushads bank account.        
	On February 10 evening, Bobby took Chandravan to a park in Okhla, where Naushad shot him dead. Bobby was arrested soon thereafter.        
	A team from Delhi police will reach Calcutta soon to take custody of Naushad, said Shamim.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Flight-miss torment 
          SANJAY MANDAL                          Sarita Kedia                                  
	A Calcutta-based businessman who was stranded at Chennai airport with his physically challenged wife after their flight took off without them an hour in advance has approached the consumers forum for redress.        
	Sharad Kedia and his wife Sarita alleged that Air India had not informed them about the changed schedule. The airline officials did not help them either once they had missed the flight, they said.        
	Kedia last week sought a compensation of Rs 2 lakh from Air India at the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Calcutta Unit II.        
	Sarita suffers from myopathy, a muscular disease that has confined her to a wheelchair. On December 21, she was going to Kozhikode with her husband for treatment. The couple reached Chennai on a private airlines flight around 11am. Since their flight to Kozhikode was at 6.40pm, the two left the airport for lunch.        
	We returned to the airport at 5.40pm and were shocked to find that our flight had taken off 10 minutes earlier, said Sarita. The airline told the couple that the flight was rescheduled because of problems with the Kozhikode airport runway.         
	The officials had our cellphone and landline numbers but they did not bother to contact us. When we approached them for help, they were rude to us, said Kedia.        
	The officials booked the Kedias on the next days flight after much persuasion but refused to arrange a night accommodation for them. They told us to get in touch with an agent for hotel reservations.        
	Kedia found a room in a hotel but it did not have a special mattress Sarita needs to sleep on. She was also left without her 24-hour attendant, who had reached Kozhikode by then.        
	When the couple reached the airport after a sleepless night, the airline allegedly did not provide a wheelchair to Sarita for nearly an hour.         
	The airline denied the allegations. Three attempts were made by our call centres to inform you about the rescheduling. On all occasions the cellphone was switched off and (the) landline phone was not reachable, an Air India official wrote to Kedia.        
	The businessman said he had call records to prove that his phones were accessible when the airline was trying to call him.

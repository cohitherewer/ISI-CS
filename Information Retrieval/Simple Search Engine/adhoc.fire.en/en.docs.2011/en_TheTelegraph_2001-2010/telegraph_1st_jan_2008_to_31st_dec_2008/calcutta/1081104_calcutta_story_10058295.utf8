          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Monday passed an interim order vacating the status quo on airlines stopping the payment of commission to travel agents.        
	A travel agent had challenged the airlines decision not to pay commission from November 1. On the basis of the petition, Justice Nadira Patheriya had issued an interim status quo. The judge vacated the status quo on Monday.         
	A few weeks ago, travel agents and airlines had discussed the possibility of introducing a transaction fee on the ticket price once the commission system is scrapped.         
	The airline representatives had said they would charge the transaction fee only till December 31, 2009. Our members have not agreed to the proposal, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI).         
	On Monday, travel agents charged different transaction fees from passengers.         
	Jet Airways has started collecting the fee at its city counters and airport office. Air India has started charging the fee on its website, too. Among international carriers, Singapore Airlines is charging the fee at its counter.

                A 65-year-old patient, requiring immediate medical attention, had to wait two hours before doctors could attend to him as there was no lift in operation at NRS Medical College and Hospital on Wednesday morning. Relatives of Madhusudan Ghosh, a resident of Beleghata, said he had suffered a stroke and was brought to the hospital around 4.30am. Doctors in the emergency ward asked them to take him to the medicine ward on the fourth floor, but there were no operator for any of the four lifts in the building. After a two-hour wait, an operator arrived and Ghosh was admitted. An official said his condition was serious and a probe was launched to find out why the lifts were unmanned.    A private bus (WB19 1661) on route L238 knocked down a pedestrian, identified as Bimal Kar, 72, of Ward Institution Street, at the Maniktala intersection around 1.10pm on Wednesday. Kar was rushed to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he was admitted and later discharged. The driver was arrested for rash driving and the bus impounded.    The body of Buddhadeb Sharma, 20, alias Buddhu, was found in a vat in Kalibabur Bazaar, in the Shibpur police station area of Howrah.

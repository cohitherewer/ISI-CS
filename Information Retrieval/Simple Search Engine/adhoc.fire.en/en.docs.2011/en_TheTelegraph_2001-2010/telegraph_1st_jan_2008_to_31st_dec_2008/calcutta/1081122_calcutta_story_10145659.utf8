The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rail pole strikes again
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rail pole strikes again
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 20-year-old commuter hanging out of the overcrowded Bangaon local crashed against an electricity post near Dum Dum Cantonment station on Friday but was lucky the train hadnt picked up speed.        
	Prasenjit Sarkar lost his grip on the door handle after ramming his shoulder into the post and fell a little away from the rail track. He escaped with a gash on his forehead and some bruises, unlike the two young men who died instantly after hitting a defunct transformer pole while hanging out of the Naihati-Sealdah local on Wednesday.        
	The deputy superintendent of Government Railway Police, P.K. Bose, said Prasenjit had boarded the train at Dum Dum at 5.45pm.         
	Co-passenger Gautam Bose said he saw Prasenjit, a resident of Gobardanga, hanging precariously from the left door of the compartment. He survived the accident only because the train was moving slowly.        
	As soon as Prasenjit fell, someone pulled the chain. Once the train came to a halt, several passengers got off to help him back on his feet. The youth was taken to the municipal hospital in Dum Dum, from where he was shifted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.        
	We let him go after stitching up the wound on his forehead and confirming that there was no major injury, a hospital official said.        
	The accident that occurred on Wednesday was caused by the train tilting towards the defunct transformer pole while taking a turn near Belgharia station. Six persons hanging from the door of the first compartment were flung out. Two of them died.

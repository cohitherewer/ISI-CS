                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cold-blooded couple in body bag murders

	Bula Saha was hit thrice on her head with a blunt object before being strangulated with a nylon rope, police said on Wednesday. Bulas brother-in-law Satya and his wife Nandita then killed her year-old baby Indrajit.        
	The cold-blooded double murder by the couple on Sunday morning was the fallout of a family feud.        
	Nandita, arrested on Tuesday, has been remanded in police custody for a week. Satya is absconding.        
	Sleuths claimed to have reconstructed Sundays sequence of events on the basis of Nanditas statements.        
	Around 7.15 am, Satya and Nandita had an altercation with Bula over a property matter. Satya hit Bula with a blunt weapon and then strangulated her with a nylon rope. After she slumped to the floor, Satya killed the baby boy, said an investigating officer.        
	Nandita said Indrajit had been gagged by a piece of cloth. But the post-mortem report suggests the baby had died of head injuries. Before gagging him, the couple might have hit the boy with the weapon that they had used to kill his mother, the officer added.        
	Arati, Bulas mother-in-law, was not at home during the killings. Bulas husband Bidyut was in Sealdah, where he has a vegetable stall.        
	The only other person in the 63 Suren Sarkar Road house in Beleghata was Indrajits elder brother Subhojit. The cops have learnt that the two-year-old, deaf and mute, was in another room.        
	By the time Arati returned around 8.15am, Satya had dumped Indrajits body on Canal East Road. Satya covered the babys face with a gamchha and stuffed the body into a shopping bag, which he carried to the canal on his motorcycle, an officer said.        
	He returned home and finished breakfast with Nandita and Arati, while Bulas body was on the bed in her room. Around 9.20am, Satya took Nandita, Arati and Subhojit to a relatives house in Beleghata in his white Ambassador.        
	After dropping the three, he returned home, stuffed Bulas body into two gunny bags and carried it to the car parked near his house. He then drove to Dankuni and dumped the body off Durgapur Expressway, the officer said.        
	Satya drove back to the relatives house and returned home with his wife, mother and Subhojit around 4pm. He spent the night at home, before fleeing on Monday morning.        
	The Ambassador and the two-wheeler were seized on Wednesday.

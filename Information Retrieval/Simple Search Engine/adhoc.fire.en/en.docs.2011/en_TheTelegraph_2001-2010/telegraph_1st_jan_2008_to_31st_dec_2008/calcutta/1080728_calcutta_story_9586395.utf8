The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Beware of cratered stretch on Bypass
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Beware of cratered stretch on Bypass
                                          
	The 3-km south-bound flank of the Bypass from Ruby to Mukundapur is where one can practise moonwalking. The cratered road is used daily by thousands living in housing estates on either side, as well as the residents of Santoshpur and Garia. For patients bound for private hospitals dotting the stretch, the potholes can be death traps. With wholesale hub Metro Cash amp; Carry set to open off Singhabari in a couple of months, the vehicle count is bound to rise manifold. Metro runs a check              
	Pothole peril        
	Drivers approaching the first crater unprepared have to slam brakes and switch lanes without warning. No wonder accidents are frequent here  glass shards often seen strewn on the flank bear testimony to the fact.        
	Small vehicles face a greater risk. The craters are so deep that our vehicles almost topple, said Gautam Pal, who drives a two-wheeler on the Ruby-Bagha Jatin route.              
	Loose top loophole        
	Along with craters, stone chips are strewn on the way. Bikes tend to skid on the loose surface, especially when it rains, said Rabin Pramanik, a biker on his way home to Singhabari.        
	Commuters questioned the quality of road repair material. This is an annual ritual. The situation is back to square one within weeks of repairs. Either the technology is flawed or there is foul play, said Kanak Roy, a college student.              
	Tardy rotary reduction        
	Commuters are also peeved at the slow pace of the reduction of Ruby island, which will ease the traffic bottleneck in the area. It is illogical to have a rotary and traffic lights at the same crossing, say experts.        
	Once the diameter of the rotary is reduced, the traffic lights may not be required.         
	Slow moving vehicles        
	Cycle-rickshaws and vans, which are not supposed to be allowed on a speedway like the Bypass, enjoy a free run on the Ruby-Mukundapur stretch.        
	Without a separate lane for them, the slow-movers often create bottlenecks on the busy stretch.        
	They are a major problem on the Bypass, said a traffic sergeant at the Ruby intersection.              
	Official version        
	Officials of the CMDA, which maintains the stretch, say the repair plans had been hit hard following a bitumen crisis. Bitumen, procured from Indian Oil, has been in short supply. Repair plans were ready by February 2008 and had there been enough raw material, work would have been over before monsoon, said Ananda Ganguly, the chief engineer (traffic and transportation), CMDA. Work on the Ruby-Bagha Jatin stretch is on and should be over soon. We plan to draw up a revamp plan for the entire Bypass after the Puja.              
	Commuters voice        
	Driving down the stretch with patients is a nightmare, said Riaz Khan, who drives an ambulance for a Baruipur drugstore. An accident victim I was taking to SSKM Hospital on Monday started bleeding from his wounds due to the jerking.        
	Pradip Parbat, who drives a bus for Panchasar Shishu O Shikshaniketan, said: One has to swerve to the left or the right constantly to avoid the potholes. Yesterday, a kid slid off the seat and fell, hurting himself.        
	Manasi Mukherjee, escorting her daughter back home from South Point School, said: It is impossible to see the craters on the road after dusk, especially if it rains, as the holes are filled with water. Illumination on the stretch is poor. The authorities should immediately look into it.

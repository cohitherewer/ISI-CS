                Cops from the detective department on Wednesday raided a godown owned by Indrajit Chatterjee on Fern Road and recovered ball bearings, worth around Rs 1 crore. Indrajit was arrested a few days ago for duping a clutch of nationalised banks of Rs 8 crore. He was also a supplier of engineering goods to the railways. Police have decided to ask the railways to stop all payment to Chatterjee. Sleuths have started a probe into the details of the film-producing unit floated jointly by him and his wife Rasika.    Officers of Jorasanko police station arrested Mohammad Farhanuddin, 25, alias Chintu, the kingpin of a cellphone-snatching racket, near Ram Mandir on Chittaranjan Avenue on Wednesday evening. Chintu was netted while trying to flee after snatching the cellphone of a hawker. Bystanders chased him and handed him over to the police. Chintu, a resident of Mullickpur, in Baruipur, has been in the racket for the past few years.    Six persons were injured when the taxi they were travelling in was dashed by a private bus (WB73A 544) at the intersection of New Road and Mayo Road, in the Maidan police station area, around 5.30am on Wednesday. The five passengers in the taxi were identified as Ansul Dhanuka, 18, Rohit Shah, 19, Pratik Agarwal, 18, Aditya Agarwal, 18, and Pratik Manpuria, 18, all residents of Golabari, in Howrah. Along with the driver, Lalan Roy, they were rushed to SSKM Hospital. The bus driver fled. Both vehicles were impounded.    An 84-year-old Calcutta Municipal Corporation sweeper, Parsuram Basfar, committed suicide by immolating himself in the CMC Quarters on Judges Court Road, in Alipore, early on Wednesday. Neighbours rushed him to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. No suicide note was found, but preliminary investigations revealed that Basfar was suffering from depression due to old age.    A traffic police constable, Subhash Chandra Roy, was injured after being hit by a speeding autorickshaw (WB04C 6116) at the intersection of Orient Row and New Park Street, in the Beniapukur police station area, around 9.40am on Wednesday. The auto sped off after the accident, police said. Roy was taken to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, where he was treated.     A 40-year-old man, Akshay Kumar Dey, is feared to have drowned in the Hooghly after he went into the water at Prannath Ghat, in Khardah, on Wednesday afternoon. Police said Akshay went to perform some funeral rites of a relative when a high tide in the river swept him away. Divers from river traffic police failed to locate the body.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday pleaded with the high court for immediate cancellation of bail granted to three senior police officers in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	Since the officers hold important posts and are influential, they can tamper with evidence if they remain out on bail, CBI counsel Ranjan Roy submitted before the vacation bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice S.P. Mitra.        
	Roy also expressed fear that the trio  Ajoy Kumar (IPS), Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das  might threaten witnesses to give false deposition if they are not remanded back in custody.        
	Roy made the submission while a petition moved by Rizwanurs family demanding cancellation of the bail to the accused officers came up for hearing.        
	The petition was moved on October 14 and the hearing was scheduled for October 16. The bench, meanwhile, had asked the petitioners lawyer, Kalyan Banerjee, to serve copies of the affidavits to the officers.        
	Banerjee informed the bench during the day that he had served notices to the respondent officers, but, surprisingly, none is present today.        
	Banerjee, too, pleaded for the cancellation of bail. But the judges said they would like to hear both parties before deciding on the petition and asked Banerjee to serve fresh notices to the respondents. The next hearing has been scheduled for October 27.

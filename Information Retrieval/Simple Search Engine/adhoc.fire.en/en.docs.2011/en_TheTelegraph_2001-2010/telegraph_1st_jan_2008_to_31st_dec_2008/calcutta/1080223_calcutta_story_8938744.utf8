The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Service road to free clog
                                                                                                               Service road to free clog
  - Two-lane link off Science City for smooth passage to Park Circus        A STAFF REPORTER                                                   
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is planning to recast a service road along EM Bypass to ease the traffic clog at the Parama island crossing.         
	The Rs 1.17-crore project will take about three-and-a-half-months to complete. The service road beside Ambedkar bridge, if used properly, can improve traffic flow in the area, said Debdas Bhattacharya, the chief engineer of CMDAs traffic and transportation department.        
	Weve planned to extend the service road to the water body adjoining Science City on the Park Circus connector from the Bypass. This will cut down the time the vehicles from the south have to wait to move towards Park Circus from the Bypass, he added.        
	According to the plan, the extended portion of the service road will be 7.2-metre wide and have two lanes. It will merge with the Park Circus connector. The project will be executed keeping in mind the sewage system. The flow of the canal below the Ambedkar bridge will not be hampered. A 300-metre culvert will be built for the purpose.        
	The project will allow vehicles from the south along EM Bypass, as well as those coming from Basanti Road, to reach Park Circus connector without any problem. The Parama rotary is being made smaller. Once both projects are completed, there will be no traffic chaos at the junction, said a CMDA engineer.        
	The vegetation on the spot where the service road will meet the Park Circus connector will be removed. The taxi stand in front of Science City will be shifted.        
	It is a good initiative. Since this is a high-speed zone, the engineers should find a way to ensure that vehicles reaching the Park Circus connector through the service road do not collide with those coming from the Parama rotary, said a senior officer.

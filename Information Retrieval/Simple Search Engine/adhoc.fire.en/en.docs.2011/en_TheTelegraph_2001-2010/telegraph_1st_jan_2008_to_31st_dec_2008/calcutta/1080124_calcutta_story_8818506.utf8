     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Burglar Buddha and an associate were arrested in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees backyard on Wednesday afternoon.
    
	Two constables intercepted Buddha and Bapi Hati, who were involved in a few burglaries in Park Circus, while they were loitering around in the VVIP Palm Avenue neighbourhood, said an officer of Karaya police station. They must have been on a recce before targeting a house.
    
	Buddha and Bapi are from Midnapore but have been staying in a slum in North Range, Park Circus, for the past year. We raided their shanties but did not find anything suspicious. The duo belong to a big group that operates in south Calcutta and the fringes, the officer added.
    
	The chief ministers neighbourhood had witnessed a number of burglaries in the past couple of years. The police had identified two gangs  led by Salim and Ashraf, both Bangladeshi nationals  that were reportedly behind most burglaries.
    
	Sleuths suspect the gang-members are hiding in Ghutiari Sharif and Canning, in South 24-Parganas.
    
	A preliminary probe has revealed that Buddha and Bapi are members of one of the gangs, another officer said.
    
	A section of officers has attributed the spurt in crime in the Palm Avenue neighbourhood to some political leaders who shield criminals. Last year, two groups allegedly owing allegiance to the CPM and the Trinamul Congress had fought over the possession of a vacant plot. 
    
	The police have identified Gullu (alias Raja), Mona, Aslam (alias Pappu) and Rabiul Naskar as the masterminds of criminal activities in the area. All of them enjoy the patronage of one political party or another, said a senior officer.
    
	Gullu and Mona are allegedly backed by the CPM, while Aslam and Rabiul are said to be loyal to the Trinamul. Most criminals have entered the real estate business, the officer added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fewer flights for lower footfall
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fewer flights for lower footfall
  - Three airlines rationalise routes in winter schedule          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The aviation quake has hit Calcutta airport, with some flights from the city being withdrawn and some schedules being reworked with reduced frequency.        
	The decisions were all announced on Sunday, signalling the start of the winter schedule for most airlines.        
	Kingfisher withdrew several flights, including two operated by its low-cost subsidiary Kingfisher Red (earlier known as Deccan) and Air India discontinued its only direct flight to London. Lufthansa reduced the frequency of its Frankfurt service from seven to three flights a week.        
	Among the Kingfisher flights to be withdrawn are two each to Bangalore and Port Blair, and one each to Bagdogra and Vizag. Now, Kingfisher and Kingfisher Red will have only one daily flight each to Bangalore (via Hyderabad).         
	A sharp decline in the flier count has forced us to curtail services on various routes, said a Kingfisher official. Sources pointed out the airline had registered a 50 per cent drop in passenger load over the past few months.        
	Though Kingfisher insisted that its recent strategic alliance with Jet Airways had nothing to do with the downsizing, aviation sources said the tie-up could lead to further withdrawal of flights on various sectors.         
	The aviation sector is passing through a bad phase. The drastic decline in passenger load coincides with a steep rise in the price of air turbine fuel and the fear of an economic meltdown. There is bound to be some negative impact on the industry, said a source.        
	Air Indias Calcutta-London flight touched down at the city airport for the last time this season on Sunday afternoon, with 129 passengers on board. The service has been withdrawn for the time being as part of our route rationalisation drive, said an Air India spokesperson. There is little chance of the flight being reinstated in the near future, sources said.        
	Lufthansa German Airlines decision to slash its Frankfurt service from the city is linked to the recent economic slump. Warner Heesen, the airlines South Asia director, said: Lufthansa avoids creating over-capacity in the market. This winter there will be three flights a week.

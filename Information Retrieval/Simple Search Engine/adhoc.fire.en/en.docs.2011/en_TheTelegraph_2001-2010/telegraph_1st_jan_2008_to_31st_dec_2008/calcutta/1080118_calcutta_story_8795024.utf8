	Calcutta University (CU) on Thursday urged a visiting parliamentary panel to ensure the Centre issue a guideline on spending the Rs 100-crore grant it had sanctioned in 2006.
    
	The fund will not be spent until we get a clear instruction from the Centre, said a university official, who had interacted with the 21-member parliamentary standing committee attached to the human resource development ministry.
    
	Of the Rs 30-crore first instalment, Rs 10 crore reached the university recently. But the money is lying unspent.
    
	The Centre had sanctioned the grant on the occasion of the universitys 150th anniversary. The money has to be spent by 2009, on studies and research in nanoscience, nanotechnology and biomedical nanotechnology.
    
	The CU authorities requested the panel to ensure that the guideline reaches them in time to meet the deadline.
    
	Officials said they have submitted a detailed project report on the utilisation of the first instalment of Rs 30 crore, but the Centre is yet to state its stand.
    
	We are doing the needful. The committee discussed the universitys proposed plan of action. We hope the deadline will be met, said Meinyathoke Chom, the chairman of the parliamentary panel, which included a member from Bengal, Basudeb Burman.
    
	The committee has promised necessary help, said university registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay.
    
	The team expressed satisfaction with CUs Salt Lake campus infrastructure, where a nanoscience and nanotechnology centre will be set up.

	Calcutta is set to get its first dedicated sports science centre to offer athletes of the city fully customised, comprehensive training programmes. The aim is to hone more Souravs, Leanders and Bhaichungs.        
	Sportspersons will be trained physically, emotionally and mentally for optimum performance. They will have access to sports psychologists, personal trainers and nutritionists, all under one roof, said city-based golfer Indrajit Bhalotia, who is leading the initiative.        
	The team of experts at the centre has started working with international golfer Rahil Gangjee, Ranji Trophy cricketer Safi Ahmad and under-15 squash champion Ramit Tandon.        
	We should be able to formally open the doors of the centre, at 1B Circus Row, in October, said Anwar Wahhab, who will look after the strength and conditioning division. Outdoor fitness classes will be conducted at Calcutta Ladies Golf Club on the Maidan and in the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium.        
	The centre will be run by sports management firm Protouch, said Bhalotia, the director of Protouch. He will look after the sports psychology wing with psychologist Priyanka Bhattacharyya Bhoopal.         
	The division for treating sports specific injuries with monitored rehabilitation will be an important one, said Bhalotia. The athletes will be taught to play close to their potential through yoga, sports psychology classes and customised fitness training.        
	Orthopaedic surgeon Ronen Roy and his team will be on the panel of medical consultants to guide the athletes on injuries and rehabilitation. We are working out training programmes to suit the needs of specific sports and individuals, Wahhab said.        
	Ahmad can already feel the change. The specific muscle drills have increased my bat speed and given me the strength to play big shots, he said.        
	The team has worked with S.S.P. Chowrasia, the Indian junior golf team and the national ladies golf team.         
	Our session with the Protouch centres experts at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club helped the girls work on the mental aspect of the game, said Sonia Malhotra, the chairperson of the Indian Golf Union ladies section.

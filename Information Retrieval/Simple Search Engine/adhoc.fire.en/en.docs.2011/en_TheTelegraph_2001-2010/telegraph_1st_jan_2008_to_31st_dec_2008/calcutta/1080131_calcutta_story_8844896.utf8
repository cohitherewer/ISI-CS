	Two-year-old Sandeep Yadav had contracted polio in Bihar and was diagnosed with the disease in Calcutta, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared. The UN body has warned of the disease spreading in the city. 
    
	The child is being treated at BC Roy Polio Hospital. He has been put under maximum surveillance.
    
	Sandeep came to Calcutta on December 11 last year and lived on Vivekananda Road (ward 28) with his father. He started showing symptoms of polio from December 22. His stool samples were taken on December 24 and 27. The disease was confirmed on January 25, said Dipankar Mukherjee, the regional team leader of the National Polio Surveillance Project, a WHO initiative in collaboration with the Union government.
    
	We are certain that Sandeep was infected in Bihar. Our records show that the disease had spread in Darbhanga, Bihar, from where Sandeep hails, added Mukherjee.
    
	A senior WHO official said 61 polio cases were detected in Darbhanga in 2007. Ten cases were detected around the time Sandeep contracted the disease. One of the patients was infected with the P3 strain of the virus, which had also infected Sandeep, and lives nine km away from his home.
    
	This proves that the virus is circulating there. Since there is an huge migratory population from Bihar in Calcutta, the city runs the risk of severe propagation of the disease, warned the WHO official.
    
	Chief civic health officer Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay said: We sent a team to the hospital on Wednesday and submitted an inspection report to the mayor and the municipal commissioner.
    
	The state health department is not taking a chance. We are in talks with the WHO and the CMC. A special polio vaccination drive may be carried out in the area where the boy stayed, said Sanchita Bakshi, the director of health services.

  Rain bane of housing estate          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Shilpi Bhadra grimaces at the thought of stepping out of home and it is not because of the rain on Monday night.        
	Subhasree Apartments, in which the lecturer stays, has been under knee-deep water since June 6. Moreover, there is no respite in sight for either her family or the 36 other families that stay in the estate on Dharmatala Road, near Bosepukur.        
	I have to wade through water every day on my way to the college and back, said Shilpi.        
	For over five years, waterlogging has been a regular feature in the estate during monsoon. But it has never been as bad as this year.        
	The water usually recedes after three days. Since a canal is being dredged nearby, that outlet has got blocked this year, said Chandreyee Kumar, a resident.        
	The garages of all the four buildings in the estate are under water. Most of the residents have left their cars in office.        
	The water pumps are almost submerged. Residents fear that another spell of rain will raise the accumulated water to the level of the electricity meters on the ground floor, leaving them without water and power.        
	The water level rose by about five inches after yesterdays rain, said resident Rajiv Shome, a businessman.        
	The families foresee a problem in persuading doctors to visit the estate if an elderly member falls ill.         
	The stagnant water has started to smell and has become a breeding ground of mosquitoes. Parents are hesitant to send children to school through the water.        
	Talking to the promoters of the estate has been of no help. They admitted to the small mistake of making the estate lower than the surrounding area.

                      Character of a city                    Calcutta has always figured prominently in the works of Shuvaprasanna. He has depicted varying moods of the city, its people, places and all the facets that make it distinctive. Beyond the Dark, the ongoing solo exhibition of his recent works, features mixed media paintings and sculptures that expand upon his past work and portray the changes that have taken place in the city. In this show, the artist goes beyond his subject matter to investigate style and method. Though he depicts life in the city, on another level he also deals with universal issues of suffering and ways of overcoming hardship. Crows, cats and dogs abound in his compositions; these creatures, according to him, are also citizens of Calcutta and survive here with their own wit and guile, very much like humans. His powerful black outlines clearly depict the agility of the cat, the alertness of the dog or the selfishness of the crow, capturing the mood and character of the animals through their posture, bone structure and body language. Distorted forms of tall buildings, juxtaposed against surrounding low rooftops and slums, are also a recurrent theme in his works, emphasising the contrast in lifestyle of the people of the city.                    Event: An exhibition of recent works by Shuvaprasanna When: Till November 29 (except Sundays); 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Sanskriti, 5C Alipore Park Road, / 24497931

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Arrest stay eludes Todis
  - CBI pleads for proclaimed offender tag on Riz accused          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	The city sessions court on Monday refused to stay the execution of the non-bailable arrest warrants against the Todi brothers and Anil Saraogi. The matter will be heard again on November 12.         
	The Calcutta metropolitan magistrate (CMM)s court had on October 27 asked the CBI to arrest the Todis and Saraogi, accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case, by November 3 after they failed to appear in person. The trio, missing since then, moved the sessions court on Friday for a stay on their arrests.        
	Also on Monday, the CBI filed a plea in the CMM court praying for an order declaring Ashok and Pradip Todi and their relative Saraogi proclaimed offenders.         
	The CMM court will hear the matter on November 10.         
	The lawyers for the Todis and Saraogi pleaded with the chief judge of the sessions court, Murari Mohan Ghosh, to stay the arrest at least till the disposal of the case.        
	The summons issued to our clients had given them the liberty to be represented by their lawyers. They had exercised their right but the magistrate issued non-bailable arrest warrants against them, the lawyers said.         
	Opposing the plea, CBI lawyer Partha Tapaswi said the sleuths had tried for the past week to trace the trio, but they are absconding. He requested the judge to reject the trios petition.         
	After hearing the submission of both sides, the judge refused to pass an order and scheduled the next hearing for November 12.         
	The lawyers for the trio said they were planning to move the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the arrest.        
	In the CMM court, Tapaswi pleaded that the Todis and Saraogi be declared proclaimed offenders so that their properties could be attached.        
	He told the magistrate that the trio, though elusive, had moved a petition before the sessions court, seeking an order restraining the CBI from arresting them.         
	Learning about the case in the sessions court, the CMM court deferred the hearing on the CBI plea till November 10.         
	The three accused police officers in the case  Ajoy Kumar, Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das  came to the CMM court and informed the magistrate that the high court would hear a plea challenging their bail on November 5. The magistrate then scheduled the hearing of their case for November 10.

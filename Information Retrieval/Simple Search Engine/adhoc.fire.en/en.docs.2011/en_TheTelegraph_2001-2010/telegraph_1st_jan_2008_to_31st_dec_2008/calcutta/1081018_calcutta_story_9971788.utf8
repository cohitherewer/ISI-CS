          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Trouble is again brewing at the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) with a number of teachers protesting the decision to set up a committee to review appointment and promotion of faculty members and officials since 2000.        
	The teachers are demanding immediate withdrawal of the ridiculous decision, which they claim has tarnished the image of the institution.        
	Selection committees set up by the university decide on appointment and promotion of teachers and officials. Its ridiculous that the authorities are now finding fault with the decisions of these committees, said a teacher.        
	The review will be carried out by a three-member panel, to be headed by Amit Kiran Chakraborty, a former controller of examinations at Calcutta University. The names of the other two members are yet to be announced.        
	The Besu Teachers Association alleged that the decision was an act of revenge against its recent move to send a legal notice to the authorities challenging the appointment of registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay.        
	The notice alleged that Bandyopadhyays appointment was in violation of Besu and UGC rules. Bandyopadhyay had quit after receiving the notice but the Besu board of management did not accept his resignation.        
	The teachers association feels that if the authorities are keen on probing the appointments and promotions, they should ensure transparency in selecting the inquiry panel members.         
	The members were chosen by the authorities. The university should not have a say in the selection of the members if they want the probe to be fair and transparent, said Manas Heera, the general secretary of the teachers association, which has decided to take up the matter with the state government.        
	Vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea was not available for comment. Registrar Bandyopadhyay said from Delhi that going by rules, the university cannot ask an outside agency or the government to set up a panel to probe an internal matter of the institution.

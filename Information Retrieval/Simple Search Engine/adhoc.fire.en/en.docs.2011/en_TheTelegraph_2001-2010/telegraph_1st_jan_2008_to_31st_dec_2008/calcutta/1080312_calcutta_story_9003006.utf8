                      A sensitive perspective                    Driven by an intense obsession in the art of photography, legendary octogenarian business baron Basant Kumar Birla has shot countless flickering moments of beauty through his lens. The ongoing exhibition, featuring a selection of portraits and landscapes, bears witness to his passion for creative composition and a desire to see more than what meets the eye. Beauty and friendship form the keynotes of his portrayal of individuals, with whom he shares close personal and emotional ties. His nature studies provide an endless interplay of reflection and reality, precisely and minutely capturing the larger, spiritual implications of an apparently ordinary scene.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Basant Kumar Birla When: Till March 16; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 1st floor

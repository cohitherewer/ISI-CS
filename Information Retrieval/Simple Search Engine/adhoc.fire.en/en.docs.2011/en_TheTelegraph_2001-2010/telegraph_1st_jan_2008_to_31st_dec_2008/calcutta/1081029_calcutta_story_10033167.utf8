                      Colour power                    Featuring the works of two talented young painters who have recently begun to exhibit their creations, the ongoing art exhibition presents large canvases that meld figurative imagery with abstract passages, refined colour with textural applications and iconography with personal expression. The large-scale diptych paintings of Basist Kumar (Santiniketan) pair a human portrait with an abstract element which has some reference to nature. Painstakingly detailed and aggressively confrontational, his paintings give the impression of science fiction with their other-worldly feel and silvery skin tones. Trained as a printmaker, the paintings of Rao Kadonda (Baroda; a painting by him appears here) exploit highly-charged colours in unusual combinations with a fluid application technique. His subjects include figures, still life and genre scenes, but his landscapes stand out for their observation of the human condition. In all of Kadondas works, blocks of saturated colour melt and fold into one another, coalescing into readable forms, only to dissolve and dissipate again into pure pigment.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Basist Kumar and Rao Kadonda When: Till November 1; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Bose Pacia, Stephen Court, 18 Park Street

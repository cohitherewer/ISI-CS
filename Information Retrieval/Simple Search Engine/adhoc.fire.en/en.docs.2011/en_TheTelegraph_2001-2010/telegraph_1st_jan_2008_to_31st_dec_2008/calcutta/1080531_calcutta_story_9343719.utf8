                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dankuni killer caught
          OUR BUREAU                          Nakari Chatterjee: In the net. Picture by Krishna Chandra Mishra                                  
	The motive behind the murder of college student Abhijit Dutta was cloaked in mystery even after police arrested the killer on Friday from a relatives house in Burdwan.         
	Nakari Chatterjee, the Dankuni youth who had been on the run since Abhijit was found with a fatal stab wound in his chest on Wednesday evening, was asleep on the porch of his relatives house when a police team came calling around 3.30am.        
	He neither tried to flee nor denied having killed Abhijit, but the police couldnt get him to admit that the murder was the fallout of rivalry in love.         
	One of the theories suggested by the investigation team on Thursday was that Abhijit, who died shortly after he was seen strolling with his teenaged girlfriend near Dankuni railway station, had a fight with Nakari over the girl. There was also speculation about Abhijits allegedly jealous former girlfriend, with whom he had broken off two years ago, playing a role in the episode.        
	The police quoted Nakari as saying that Abhijit and his friends used to assault him over trivial issues and that he was looking for an opportunity to settle scores. Nobody helped him in the revenge act, he said.        
	On being asked to cite specific incidents when he was targeted by Abhijit and his friends, Nakari failed to give a satisfactory answer, the police said.         
	We still suspect the murder was the fallout of rivalry between the two in wooing the girl Abhijit was seen with, said the additional superintendent of police (headquarters), Debasish Boral.        
	The knife with which Nakari said he stabbed Abhijit has yet to be found. The police said the youth threw it into a canal and headed for Baruipara railway station, from where he took a local train to Burdwan. He later boarded an express train and got down at Kankrajhor railway station, on the Bengal-Jharkhand border.         
	He was carrying his cellphone and came to know from one of his friends that the police were looking for him, Boral said.

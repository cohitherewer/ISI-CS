          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A frame from the heritage photo project exhibition to be mounted at CIMA Gallery                                  
	Electronic club music from Cologne and eloquent frames of Calcuttas crumbling heritage edifices, revisiting the anti-authoritarian campus protests of 1968, a theatre collage and a surprise football film to greet Oliver Kahn and the boys from Bayern        
	Calcuttans can savour a myriad mix of cultural treats from Germany in April and May with the Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB) promising to carry forward the connect through best-practice inputs towards heritage conservation in the city.        
	We are delighted to bring to Calcutta the highly acclaimed photo exhibition  Chitpur Road Neighbourhoods (CIMA Gallery, April 16-May 3), shot by 21 photography students from the University of Arts Bremen, said MMB director Reimar Volker.         
	The German students had clicked heritage sites in Chitpur over four weeks in November, with help and support from conservation architect Manish Chakraborti and his team. The exhibition was mounted in leading Berlin and Frankfurt galleries.        
	Volker is also keen to start a dialogue between Germany and Calcuttas restoration architects and urban designers to search for a common idiom to conserve. Berlin is a global tourist magnet thanks to sensitive heritage conservation and urban design. We can look to share the experience from the Berlin model here, he said.        
	In keeping with MMBs thrust on contemporary Germany, electronic music group Schaeben amp; Voss will perform at The Princeton Club on April 25, while Ralph Christoph, the programme director and talent scout for the C/O POP fest in Cologne, will give a lecture-demonstration on History and impact of European electronic music and pop culture at MMB on May 8.        
	A workshop will explore the various facets of arts inspired by the restlessness of 1968.        
	We shall also screen a surprise film (May 26) on the occasion of Kahns retirement, added Volker. The iconic German goalie will play his last match as a professional for his beloved Bayern Munich in Calcutta against Mohun Bagan the following day.        
	Another exhibition on architecture photography will be mounted at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre (June 5-19).

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Robbers broke into a house in Salt Lakes FD block on Saturday evening and decamped with cash and valuables worth about Rs 40,000.        
	Later, burglars sneaked into two flats in Muchipara and stole cash and jewellery worth over Rs 50,000.         
	Bijon Pal and his wife, who live in Salt Lakes FD 118, are holidaying in Kerala. The help of the middle-aged couple had gone shopping around 6pm. She returned around 7.30pm and found the front door open, said police.         
	The locks on the front door and the almirah were broken. We can ascertain the amount looted only after Pal returns. The help claimed that the amount robbed was nearly Rs 40,000, said an officer of Bidhannagar (North) police station.         
	The elder daughter of the Pals lives in Shyambazar. She said she had informed her parents about the robbery and they will return to the city on Sunday night.         
	In Muchipara, the burglars made their way into two first-floor flats in different buildings by jumping from one rooftop to another.        
	From the first house, the burglars took away a suitcase containing gold jewellery worth about Rs 45,000 and Rs 12,000 in cash. From the other house, they took away three bags containing documents.        
	The police said the thieves knew the neighbourhood well. It could have been the work of local drug addicts, said Anil Jana, the officer-in-charge of Muchipara police station. They used the rooftops of seven houses on Rajchandra Sen Lane to commit the burglaries, he added.        
	The burglars entered the house of Dipak Adhikary by cutting the net on a window. The briefcase was kept in the room they accessed. From Jayanta Dass house, the burglars could only take away the bags.        
	Local resident Manoj Das said he was awakened by the sound of burglars entering his house around 3am but they escaped before he could catch them.

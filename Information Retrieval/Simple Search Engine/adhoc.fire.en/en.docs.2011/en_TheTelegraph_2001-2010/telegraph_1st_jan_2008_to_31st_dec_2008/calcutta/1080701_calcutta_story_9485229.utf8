          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Rasika Chatterjee, wanted for allegedly defrauding banks of about Rs 8 crore along with her husband, was arrested at Sealdah station on Monday.         
	The 38-year-old was about to board Kanchenjungha Express. She had planned to get off at New Jalpaiguri and enter Nepal, said an officer of the detective department.        
	According to him, she wanted to settle in her ancestral place in the Balajiu Bamati area of Kathmandu following her husband Indrajits arrest a week ago.         
	The couple had allegedly duped a string of banks in 2006-07, setting the CBI and the police on their trail. When Indrajit was arrested, Rasika was in Bhubaneswar. The next day, she reached Kharagpur in a car and put up in a budget hotel. On Sunday morning, she travelled to Calcutta and moved around in a car. She did not stay in a hotel, fearing arrest, said a senior officer.         
	A team of officers was tracking her two cellphone handsets, whose SIM cards she kept changing. On Monday, women constables in plainclothes, posing as passengers, took position in different compartments of the train. Rasika was arrested as she was about to board the train.        
	A student of Kendriya Vidyalaya on Ballygunge Circular Road, she passed her Class X in 1988. The next year, she married Dhannapati Sharma. After their divorce in 1997, she became close to Indrajit, who was then known as chicken Chatterjee, courtesy his flourishing chicken trade.        
	Rasika and Indrajit had allegedly used the defrauded money to produce Greftaar, starring Prosenjit and Swastika.

	CBI officials spent hours at Victoria Memorial Hall on Wednesday, investigating the alleged misappropriation of funds by a section of employees. The officials spoke with curator Chittaranjan Panda for over four hours.        
	We will have to go through the Memorials financial records in the past four years, said an official.        
	According to sources, the economic offence wing of the agency conducted the raid after receiving a complaint from a group of employees.        
	We learnt that the Memorial received Rs 4 crore from abroad in 2004 for purchasing paintings and antiques, said a CBI official. Nearly Rs 2.75 crore of the money has allegedly been siphoned off.        
	The authorities said there was no record of where the money went. Our job is to find out how the misappropriation took place, said another official.        
	The CBI team of four questioned an official and a peon of the Memorials accounts section on Wednesday, said a source.        
	The missing money was supposedly used to buy paintings and antiques. However, the authorities said the items purchased cannot be found in the Memorial, added the CBI official.        
	The agency team has asked the duo who were interrogated to trace the articles that were bought with the foreign grant.         
	If they manage to produce the items, we will get in touch with the sellers, said an investigator.

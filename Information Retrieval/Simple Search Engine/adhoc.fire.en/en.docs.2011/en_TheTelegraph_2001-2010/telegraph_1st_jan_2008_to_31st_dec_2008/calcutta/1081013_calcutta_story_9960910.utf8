The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protests stall housing estate makeover
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Protests stall housing estate makeover

	The brand of disruptive politics that forced the shift of the Nano factory from Singur has stalled the re-development of a 17.2-acre plot closer home in Bonhooghly.        
	A high court order in early August has failed to facilitate the demolition of the dilapidated buildings in the Bonhooghly tenement scheme and construction of new ones in their place. The rest of the plot will have 25 buildings, 16 of which will be 16-storey towers.         
	The project, named Eden Lakeside, is a joint venture of the Calcutta-based Eden City group, London-based REIT Asset Management and the state government. The re-development was to start last year, when the 750 tenants were served notices to vacate their flats.        
	The delay has come as a blow for the 125 residents who complied. Biplab Chakraborty, 39, and his aged mother, for example, had been counting days to move into their new 645-sq ft flat with modern amenities ever since they shifted from their 248-sq ft flat.        
	What now stands between them and their dream home is the agitation by the Trinamul-led Bonhooghly Tenement Bashosthan Rakkha Committee, which is determined to not let the re-development project commence.        
	Most of us are willing to grab this wonderful opportunity. But even if 10 people refuse to vacate their flats, the project cannot start. The local Trinamul leadership has been doing everything to not let the project happen, said Chakaborty, who has been living in a rented flat in the area with his mother.        
	The developers should build the flats where the residents will be rehabilitated first and then start work on the rest of the project. That way nobody will have to move to an alternative accommodation. The government has vested interests and we will not succumb to its pressure, said a local Trinamul leader.        
	A team of experts conducted a study on behalf of the developers and concluded that the project cannot be executed in parts. The dilapidated buildings, at the centre of the plot, must be razed for the reconstruction to begin.         
	The high court, too, dismissed a petition by 50 tenants who demanded that the state provide them alternative accommodation till the re-development work is completed.        
	The developers will pay each displaced tenant Rs 2,000 per month towards rent till their new flats are ready, the tentative time frame for which is two years.         
	The tenants will get well-appointed flats that are twice the size of their current ones free. Plus the developers will pay their rent while the construction is in progress. What more can anybody ask for? said Binay Krishna Biswas, the minister of state for refugee relief and rehabilitation.        
	We do not trust the government or the private developers. It is difficult to find accommodation nearby and I cant move from Bonhooghly, said Rabi Roy, a petitioner.        
	Amitava Nandy, the Lok Sabha MP from the area, said the matter could not resolved at three all-party meetings, attended by Bengals leader of the Opposition, Partha Chatterjee.        
	The Bonhooghly flats, built in the 1960s for refugees, were tagged unsafe by the civic body in the late-1980s.        
	The Rs 400-crore project is being held to ransom for political gain. The costs are increasing rapidly, Sachchidananda Rai, the managing director of the Eden City Group, told Metro.

                                                                                                               Teenager crushed by bus
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A teenager was killed and a boy, a middle-aged man and an elderly woman were injured in two mishaps in Howrah and Calcutta on Sunday.        
	Prasanta Mandal, 19, and Ashok Maji, 8, were hit by a private bus that jumped a red light on National Highway 6 near Alampur around 10am. They were taken to a nursing home, where Prasanta was declared dead on arrival.        
	The other boy, who studies in Class V in New Korala High School, has been admitted to the nursing home with serious injuries.        
	Prasanta was crossing the road holding a bicycle in one hand and Ashoks hand in the other, when the bus jumped a red light, made a sudden U-turn and hit them. It then sped away towards Howrah.        
	Local resident Gora Bhowmik, who employed Prasanta and is related to Ashok, witnessed the mishap. He said: The district magistrate was to inaugurate a nursing home nearby, so nearly 50 policemen were standing close to the accident spot. They made no attempt to chase the bus. They merely sent the two boys to the nursing home and washed away the blood on the road.        
	Earlier, Bibharani Sarkar, 70, and her son-in-law Bimal Dutta, 45, were injured when the rickshaw they were travelling in was hit by a state bus at the Bagha Jatin intersection. Bibharani was admitted to National Medical College and Hospital. The driver of the bus was beaten up by a mob.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minority schools join hands for rights
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Minority schools join hands for rights
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Educational institutions run by minority communities are setting up a forum to jointly fight discriminatory policies of the state government.        
	Representatives of various minority groups  including Christians, Muslims, Sikhs and Buddhists  met on Tuesday and unanimously decided to set up the forum, which will be formally launched on November 1.        
	The minority groups have so far been protesting the state policies separately. Now, we will tackle our problems together, said Herod Mullick, the general secretary of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba and convener of the new forum.        
	The state policies the groups are opposing include one requiring the educational institutions to renew their minority status every three years.        
	There are around 3,000 unaided schools run by Muslim organisations, apart from 500-odd state-aided and recognised madarsas. The unaided schools comprise both madarsas and the ones that follow the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary curricula. It is not possible for these institutions to renew their minority status every three years, said Habibur Rahman, the organisation secretary of the Madarsa Students Union.        
	He pointed out that the minority status certificate, once issued, should remain valid forever.        
	Kanchan Bikas Chakma, representing Buddhist missionary schools, stressed the need for cooperation with the government for smooth running of the institutions.        
	Buddhist groups run a number of schools across the state. The schools admit students from all communities. Without the governments help it will be difficult for us to run them smoothly. The forum, by addressing issues affecting us, will hopefully lead to closer coordination with the government, said Chakma, also the organisation secretary of a CBSE school in Rajarhat run by a Buddhist group.        
	Another issue rankling the minority groups is the governments plan to formulate an act to regulate all private schools, including those run by minority communities. The forum will also demand exemption from the governments reservation rules related to appointment of teachers and prompt issuance of no-objection certificates for setting up of schools.        
	Mullick, of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, an umbrella organisation of Christian bodies, said the minority schools would find it difficult to fill up the vacant posts if they are forced to abide by the governments reservation rules.

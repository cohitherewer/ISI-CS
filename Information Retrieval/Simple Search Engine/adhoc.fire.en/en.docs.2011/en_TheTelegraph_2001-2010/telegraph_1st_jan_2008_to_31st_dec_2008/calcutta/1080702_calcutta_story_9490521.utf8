                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mob on the rampage in hospital
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A mob of about 50 ransacked the medical superintendents office and a kiosk in Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday afternoon.        
	A policeman and a hospital security guard were injured as supporters of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital Employees and Public Health Security and Safety Samonnay Committee wielded sticks and threw stones inside the administrative block of the hospital for more than half an hour.        
	A large contingent of police brought the situation under control and arrested 21 people.        
	Around 1.30pm, members of the organisation visited the medical superintendents office to submit a charter of demands. These pertained to illegal kiosks in the compound, severe power cuts, water shortage, lack of treatment facilities and patients being turned away at the emergency department.        
	Last month, we had submitted a list of demands to the medical superintendent and he had promised to take action by the end of the month. But nothing has been done, alleged Piyal Chowdhury, the joint convener of the committee.         
	Anup Roy, the medical superintendent, was not in his office on Tuesday afternoon. An inquiry committee was holding a meeting inside.        
	A group of about 50 men forcibly entered the room and started abusing us. They then ransacked the room, said Kumar Krishna Mal, the assistant superintendent of the hospital.        
	The glass panes of the windows were broken by the mob. Brijbehari Ram, a security guard, was beaten up when he tried to resist the attack.        
	Ashok Kumar Biswas of Bowbazar police station was also injured in the left eye when he tried to stop the agitators. A tea stall near the emergency department was ransacked.        
	According to hospital sources, there are five tea stalls on the premises that were set up by an NGO. The money earned from these stalls was to be donated for the treatment of cancer patients of the hospital.        
	They had approached us for handing over the money but we could not take it because we did not know how to show the amount in the accounts book, said A.N. Biswas, the deputy medical superintendent of the hospital. The government had not issued permits to the stalls. So it was decided, they would be removed, he added.

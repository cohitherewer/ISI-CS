	This Diwali, Monty Pal, son of acclaimed Kumartuli craftsman Sunil Pal, will have something other than a Kali idol to showcase  a horror house at the Rosevalley Park coming up in Barasat.         
	Monty, in fact, hasnt made idols of Durga, Lakshmi and Kali in a long time. Most of the time, he is busy meeting deadlines for orders of fibreglass models.         
	The orders pour in from various parts of India and abroad. The 12-ft high fibreglass seated Buddha, for one. The image, an accurate replica of an ancient Korean Buddha, is currently on display at an exhibition in Brussels.         
	Another recent assignment was making seven fibreglass pieces for an installation by artist Praneet Soi in Amsterdam.         
	Monty is also the architect behind the Horror Cave in Alasa Leisure Land in Dubai, a river-cave ride for Southport and many pseudo Greek garden sculptures for hotels in and around the city.         
	But right now Monty is busy with Morgue No. 13, which will be displayed in Barasat, and Lal Kuthi, to be showcased in Digha. Both have been commissioned by Nicco Park, which already has the Scareey House in its Salt Lake property, made by Monty four years ago.        
	Working for Nicco over a long period has resulted in the formation of a team. While Masood Huq does the basic drawings and layout, Jaladhar Mandal does the animation and Nicco officials record the eerie sound effects and train actors who are part of the show, explains Monty, overseeing a craftsman working on a large head that will be part of the facade in the Barasat park. On an average, he earns Rs 2-4 lakh per project.         
	This is what I enjoy doing and what has proved profitable, says Monty. He has learnt the art of fibreglass modelling in Delhi.         
	Morgue No. 13 will be a two-storeyed house with rooms and balconies, all crammed with fibreglass dead bodies and body parts, some of which will be animated.         
	The facade will be a brick wall with the face of a horned animal that is half bull and half lion, and a network of thick creepers. The structure will be 25 ft high, while the rest of the house will cover 40 sq ft.         
	There will be actors wearing masks and costumes, and some imported animation gadgets, adds Monty.         
	Though he has a studio in Kumartuli, Monty has eight craftsmen working under him at a makeshift workshop in Nicco Park.                     SEBANTI SARKAR

            The cover of the book on Shuvaprasanna				 
             
	Last year, Shuvaprasannas 60th birthday was held at a five-star hospitality address, where a lavish party was thrown on his behalf. The artist has become a much-sought-after mascot for every occasion, and was in the thick of the Nandigram protest last year. Amid much fanfare, he was arrested in the Nandan complex along with other celebrities, much to the delight of the electronic media.
    
	Now he will not let us forget that he has become a senior citizen. A book has actually been brought out to commemorate the occasion by compiling the birthday wishes he had received in writing from the great and the good of the world, interspersed with art work by the artist himself.
    
	With his solemn demeanour and halo of an almost white beard, Shuvaprasanna always looked older than his years. With encomiums and congratulations pouring in from tycoons, fellow artists and authors, including Gnter Grass, and with a book to prove that they actually did so, we are never left in any doubt of his ability to endear himself to these worthies.
    
	Rock refuge 
         
	Shillong is becoming the refuge of Calcuttas growing tribe of rockers. Be it bands like Cassinis Division, which played in Shillong for one-off shows in 2005 and 2006, or little-known bands like Nova Sanctum (nova, or a star about to explode, signifying the bands explosive music, and sanctum, or retreat, is what the people turn to them for), the citys rockers seem to be making a beeline for the hill-town. And why not? Most seem to agree that the crowd in Shillong is more receptive and open-minded than their counterparts in Calcutta.
    
	Though we play all kinds of music we like playing genres like progressive rock more. Not too many people listen to this genre though and it has a very niche audience. But the Shillong crowd seemed much more appreciative, says Srinjay Ray, who plays the keyboards for Nova Sanctum.
    
	The band, which is about six months old, played at the Shillong Carnival (picture above) on December 31 to a 20,000-strong audience. It was superb playing to such a large audience, says Srinjay. 
    
	Happy donation 
         
	The other day, College Street Coffee House (picture left) organised a huge blood donation camp, with celebs and singers on display. But what was mystifying was the banner: it greeted one and all to a happy blood donation. Noble yes, but happy?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Main runway is too busy for repairs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Main runway is too busy for repairs

	Calcutta airports main runway is making do with patchwork instead of the mandatory 24 hours of maintenance a month because the departments supposed to keep it in shape do not co-ordinate well.        
	Better co-ordination is required to resolve the issue. If runway maintenance is not being done properly, there will be safety issues, H.N. Mishra, the regional controller of air safety in eastern India, said.        
	The runway was kept free for maintenance for only 11 hours in July, which aviation safety experts said was inadequate for an airport handling so much traffic.         
	When a crater was detected near taxiway C last week, Air Traffic Control (ATC) allegedly did not stop operations immediately. By the time the runway was closed for an hour and repaired, several aircraft had passed through the stretch where a large chunk of concrete had come off.         
	The crater was spotted in the morning and ATC officials were asked to use the secondary runway. But they refused to immediately hand over the runway for maintenance, a senior official of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said on Sunday.         
	The ATC had cited bad weather and low visibility as the reason for not using the secondary runway, which does not have an instrument landing system.        
	On the secondary runway, flights can operate during the day when the minimum visibility is 3,600 metres. But visibility is much less during the monsoon. We had no option but to continue using the main runway, an ATC official said.         
	A meeting of officials of various departments has been convened to improve co-ordination between the ATC and the apron control unit, which looks after the runway.         
	An official of the air safety wing said the runway should be closed for at least 24 hours over four weeks to enable workers to repair or strengthen the surface, mark the taxiways and check the runway lights. It takes at least four hours for any damage to the surface to be properly repaired. But the runway is seldom free for that period.        
	The last time the main runway was completely relaid was in 2003-04. With the secondary runway still not capable of handling large aircraft, the main one continues to be used by most planes. An AAI official said an instrument landing system would soon be installed for the secondary runway.

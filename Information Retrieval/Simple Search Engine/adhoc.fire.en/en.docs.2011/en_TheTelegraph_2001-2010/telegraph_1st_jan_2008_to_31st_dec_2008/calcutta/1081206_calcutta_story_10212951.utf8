	A team from the Special Protection Group on Friday reviewed security arrangements for the Prime Ministers visit on Saturday.        
	The team held meetings with the Calcutta police brass. In the afternoon, the cops carried out a dummy security run from the RCTC grounds to Raj Bhavan, where Manmohan Singh is scheduled to spend the night after returning from Santiniketan.        
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti later conducted a meeting at Lalbazar to give final touches to the security plan.        
	Officers of Calcutta police and their counterparts in North 24-Parganas were busy with the security arrangements for Diego Maradona, who is slated to visit the Mohun Bagan ground, Mother House, Salt Lake stadium and the residence of Jyoti Basu.        
	A file marked PM and Maradona visit, containing specific instructions, were handed over to senior officers.        
	We need to be extra careful because the minister for external affairs, Pranab Mukherjee, is likely to accompany the Prime Minister to Bolpur and back, said a senior officer.        
	The visits by Manmohan Singh and Maradona have prompted a security beef-up at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	A van carrying policemen armed with sophisticated weapons is patrolling the airport. Two new checkpoints have been set up at the entrance to the airport.        
	It has also been decided that sky marshals  National Security Guard commandos trained to prevent hijacking  will soon be on most of the flights to and from Calcutta.        
	The number of sky marshals has been increased to enhance security in air. The marshals will criss-cross various airports, said a senior civil aviation ministry official in Delhi.        
	All airlines have been informed by the security agencies about the increase in the number of commandos.

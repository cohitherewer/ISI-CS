                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       9-yr-old dies of dengue
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Dengue has claimed the life of a nine-year-old girl in the Jodhpur Park area, the fourth victim in the city this season.        
	Piu Adhikari, of Rahim Ostagar Lane, died of the disease at a south Calcutta hospital on Tuesday evening. This pushes up the death toll from vector-borne diseases to 12 in seven weeks.        
	The Class IV student had been suffering from high fever and body ache since last Thursday. She was also vomiting and had developed rashes all over the body.        
	Pius uncle Asit Adhikari said a neighbourhood doctor had prescribed some painkillers and advised blood tests for malaria and dengue. The tests confirmed dengue. As her condition deteriorated on Monday, Piu was admitted to RK Mission Seva Pratishthan.        
	Doctors said the disease had affected her liver, kidney and finally the heart. Pius condition kept worsening and she died at 6.52pm, said Adhikari.        
	Blood slide order        
	City hospitals, both state-run and private, will have to preserve the blood slide of patients succumbing to malignant malaria.        
	The state health department took the decision on Tuesday following a plea from the civic authorities, who are often at a loss to confirm the cause of death of patients suffering from malignant malaria.        
	We have come across death certificates that mention malignant malaria as the cause of death, but there is no way we can confirm it as blood slides are not preserved, said chief municipal health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay.        
	Some certificates mention malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax as the cause of death. But vivax is not the killer strain of the virus. Malignant malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, Chattopadhyay added. There will be no scope for confusion if the blood slides are preserved, said a civic health official.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation took up the matter with the health department as the move for the preservation of blood slides calls for a state directive to all health care units, both public and private, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who finalised the arrangement with principal secretary (health) Samar Ghosh during the day.

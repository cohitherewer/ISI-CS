The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plot probe amp; parry
                                                                                                               Plot probe amp; parry
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Lolita Lekha nee Majumdar is still waiting to meet Mamata Banerjee and seek redress.        
	The 62-year-old NRI is being denied access to her seven-cottah plot in Ranikuthi by a Trinamul Congress-backed local club.        
	Mamata had on Wednesday told The Telegraph that she was willing to meet Lolita. If she approaches me, I will try my best to address her problems, she had said.        
	For Lolitas lawyer Dolla Adhikari, it was sixth time unlucky on Thursday. I called up Mamatas secretary Manik Majumdar on Thursday afternoon but, just like the previous five times that I had tried, he failed to give us an appointment. He asked me to call him back later, alleged Dolla.        
	There was, however, some movement on the administrative front, with South 24-Parganas police kicking off an inquiry into the land-grab case.        
	Mahmood Akhtar, the deputy superintendent of police (town), said: I have started the inquiry on an order from the superintendent. We are going through the documents related to the vacant land.        
	The officer-in-charge of Jadavpur police station, Ananda Sarkar, is to submit an action taken report to Alipore court by April 18. The court had directed the officer-in-charge on March 18 to ensure that no breach of peace took place and that the opponents were restrained from any wrongful act at the time of lawful construction of a boundary wall around the property.        
	We will carry out the court order after the inquiry report is ready. The report will also be submitted to the court, as local politicians are involved in the matter, said an officer of Jadavpur police station.         
	Our officers have spoken to Lolitas lawyer and if need be, we will call her and speak to her. Members of the local club, led by the local Trinamul Congress MLA, have grabbed the land lying vacant for several years, the officer added.        
	The MLA in question, Arup Biswas, was less belligerent on Thursday about the land grab.        
	Local clubs are involved and they dont want to give up the plot. Being the local MLA, I must look into all aspects of the case. But we will surely comply with whatever the party leadership asks us to do, said Biswas.

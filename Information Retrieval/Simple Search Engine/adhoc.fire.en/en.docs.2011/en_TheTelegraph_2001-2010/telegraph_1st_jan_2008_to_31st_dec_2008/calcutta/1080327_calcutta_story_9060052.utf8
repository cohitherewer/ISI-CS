The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Silence on campus
                                                                                                               Silence on campus
  - Presidency College goes soundproof        TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          Presidency College, Calcuttas first college to go soundproof, has set off a clamour by adjoining schools on College Street for the same facility. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Presidency College will be the first college in Calcutta to get soundproof classrooms and auditoriums. And schools in the College Street area want to follow suit.        
	The work to soundproof some rooms in the 190-year-old main building of the college has started. The building houses the English, philosophy, history, geography and mathematics departments, in addition to the principals office, bursars office, accounts section, grievance cell, library and common rooms.        
	The state public works department (PWD) provided the funds. On the instruction of the education department, we sanctioned Rs 34 lakh for providing some classrooms and auditoriums in Presidency with soundproof glass doors and windows. We hope to complete the work in four months, said Manohar Tirkey, the minister of state for PWD.        
	The noise level on the campus prompted the project. I have seen teachers practically screaming to make themselves heard above the commotion outside. The students also seem to lose their concentration easily. The noise cannot be cut out even by shutting all the doors and windows. We took up the matter with the PWD officials, who felt that soundproofing is the only solution, said principal Sanjib Ghosh.        
	We find it difficult to hear the lectures and often miss important points, said Mayuri Bhattacharya, a second-year philosophy (honours) student.        
	Hindu, Hare and Sanskrit Collegiate School, which are near Presidency, followed the colleges lead and sought government aid last month for soundproofing classrooms.        
	We havent received an order from the education department to soundproof classrooms in the schools, said Tirkey.        
	One has to attend a class to realise how loudly the teachers have to speak. Some of them have damaged their voice by shouting constantly, said Hare Krishna Bhattacharya, the headmaster of Hare School.        
	The schools are suffering due to acute sound pollution. School students lose concentration more easily than college students, and deserve soundproof classrooms, said Dipak Das, the secretary of the West Bengal Government School Teachers Association.        
	The average noise level in the area was 95 dbspl (decibel sound pressure level). Almost 70 per cent students in the area suffer from mild hearing problems and lack of concentration, said audiologist Somenath Mukherjee, who recently took part in a two-year study along with researchers from Indian Statistical Institute in the College Street-Sealdah area.

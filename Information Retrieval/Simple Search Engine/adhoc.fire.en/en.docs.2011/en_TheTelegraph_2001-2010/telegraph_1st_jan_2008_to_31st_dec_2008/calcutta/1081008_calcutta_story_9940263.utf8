                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Youth killed over gambling row
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An altercation over a game of cards left a youth murdered and another critically injured in a vacant flat in Belur Government Housing Estate early on Tuesday.        
	Anil Razak, 19, was found dead with multiple injuries caused by a sharp weapon on the stomach, chest and head. Bhutto, who suffered several stab wounds, has been admitted in Uttarpara State General Hospital.        
	Since he is not in a position to talk, we have not been able to identify the others who were present in the flat, said an investigating officer.        
	A preliminary probe has revealed that a group of six youths had gathered in the flat, which has been lying vacant for the past two-and-a-half months  late on Monday for a drinking session and gambling over a game of cards.        
	Around 1.10am, an altercation broke out among the youths over money that was being put on stake. One of the members then asked Anil to leave.        
	From the little we have been able to gather, it seems one of the gang members pulled out a bhojali and stabbed Anil during the altercation. Bhutto must have been attacked while he tried to save Anil, the officer said.        
	There were several injury marks on Anils stomach, chest and head, suggesting that he was overpowered while being stabbed. We are waiting for a detailed post-mortem report, said a senior officer of the Bally police station.        
	Residents alleged that with many apartments in the housing estate, situated off Chandpara in Belur, lying vacant, some local youths often turn up at night for gambling and other criminal activities.        
	Anil is a leader of one of the local gangs. A year ago, he had been arrested in connection with the murder of a local youth, Bijoy Krishna Dutta, alias Biju. He was later released on bail. Bhutto was one of his accomplices, said an officer.

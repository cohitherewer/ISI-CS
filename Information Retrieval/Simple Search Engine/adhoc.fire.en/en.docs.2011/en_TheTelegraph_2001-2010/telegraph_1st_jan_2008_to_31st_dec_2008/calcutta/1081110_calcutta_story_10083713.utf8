          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Academic activities are unlikely to resume at violence-scarred Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) this week.        
	Officials were too busy on the weekend with a 14-member team from the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) to discuss the possibilities of reopening the boys hostels and resuming academic activities on the Shibpur campus.        
	The institutes board of management may take up the issue at its November 13 meeting. We will be in a position to announce the probable date of resumption of classes only after that, said registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay.        
	The authorities had on Thursday closed down the institute for an indefinite period, called in police and asked all boys in undergraduate courses to vacate hostels and leave the campus.         
	The trouble started last Tuesday night when two students belonging to the Independent Consolidation were allegedly beaten up by SFI members near Wolfenden Hall. The second round of clashes broke out on Wednesday evening, prompting the authorities to call in the police and clamp night curfew on campus.        
	A section of teachers is planning to launch a movement to protest the authorities decision to allow the police to enter classrooms on Thursday and interrogate senior teachers.        
	The Besu Teachers Association alleged that the policemen had forcibly entered classrooms and insulted teachers, including those aged more than 65 years, and threatened to take them to court.        
	Never in the past had the police entered classrooms and insulted senior teachers who are held in high esteem for their contribution to engineering education. We participated in the NBA inspection and are eager to bring back normalcy on campus but will protest the decision to hand over the campus to the police, said Manas Heera, of the teachers association.        
	The students were getting violent. The police had to enter the electrical engineering and IT classrooms as the clashes were reported from those departments, said a senior Besu official.        
	Members of the civil society on Sunday condemned the discriminatory role of the police in tackling the crisis. The police brought bailable charges against three students who support a major political party and non-bailable sections against the rest, read a statement signed by Sankha Ghosh, Kaushik Sen and others.

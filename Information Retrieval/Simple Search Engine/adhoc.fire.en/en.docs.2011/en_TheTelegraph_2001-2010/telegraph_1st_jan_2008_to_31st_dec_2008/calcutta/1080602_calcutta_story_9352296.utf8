                      Forgotten figures of Bengal art                    Apart from stalwarts like Abanindranath Tagore and Nandalal Bose, the development of modern art in Bengal was due to the cumulative efforts of a large number of artists who, with their unique style and technique, lend a totally new dimension to contemporary artistic expression. A closer look at the art of Bengal in the last 100 years will, however, reveal the extent of our ignorance about their contribution. Exploring the Unexplored  Artists of 20th Century Bengal, the ongoing exhibition of paintings, attempts to pay tribute to those forgotten artists who have collectively taken forward the movement of art in Bengal but have not received any recognition. The works on show reflect an intense love for freedom of expression, while remaining faithful to the pictorial ideals of the Bengal School. Artists whose paintings are on display include Dwarakanath Chattopadhyay, Gopal Sanyal, Sishu Ranjan Das, Ranadacharan Ukil, Chanchal Kumar Bandyopadhyay, Annada Munsi, Sudhir Ranjan Khastagir, Sunayani Devi and Chandramohan Dawn.

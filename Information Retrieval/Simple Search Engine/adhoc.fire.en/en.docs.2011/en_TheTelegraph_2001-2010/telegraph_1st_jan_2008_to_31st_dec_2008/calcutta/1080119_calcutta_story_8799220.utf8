     OUR LEGAL REPORTER
               
	Three petitions challenging the choice of Park Circus Maidan as the venue for Book Fair 2008 were filed in the high court on Friday.
    
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Pinaki Ghosh will hear the matter on January 21. The fair starts on January 29.
    
	Darga Road Citizens Forum filed the first petition in the court. If the book fair cannot be allowed on the Maidan because of environmental concerns, it should not be held at Park Circus Maidan, too, argued lawyer Ashoke Dey, on behalf of the forum. 
    
	Two other lawyers moved separate but similar petitions.
    
	According to the petitioners, holding the fair at Park Circus Maidan would cause chaos in an area where there are five educational institutions and a hospital. Moreover, Park Circus Maidan is a playground. Fairs cannot be allowed to hold up games, stated Dey. 
    
	The petitioners alleged that the authorities did not conduct any research before deciding on Park Circus Maidan as the fair venue and prayed for an order restraining the organisers from holding it there.
    
	Environment activist Subhas Dutta said: Holding the fair on Park Circus Maidan will definitely cause problems in the area. However, I have not looked into the matter and wouldnt like to comment.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Salt Lake hit-and-run boy dies
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Namit Kumar		    
	Namit Kumar, the Class III student who was knocked down by a Tata Sumo outside his Salt Lake school on November 19, succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday morning.        
	His condition had been critical since the night he was brought in. We operated to remove clots and swellings in his brain. But he never really recovered in these six days. He was put on a ventilator and his condition only deteriorated, said B.K. Singhania, one of the doctors who treated Namit at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. The boy died around 6am.        
	On November 19, Namit was escorted out of Kendriya Vidyalaya I in Laboni by the help of a private bus that ferried him to and from school. The nine-year-old became restless waiting for other students to board the bus, which was parked in a lane near the school. He got off and was playing on the main road with a couple of friends when the car hit him.         
	Namit, the only child of HMV employee Ramesh Ram, was rushed to NRS Medical College and Hospital. He was transferred to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals that evening.        
	The mother of another student had noted down a part of the cars registration number but police have not been able to track it down.         
	We have summoned the owners of white Tata Sumos with similar numbers and hope to find the vehicle soon, said an officer of Bidhannagar North police station.        
	The mishap prompted guardians of Kendriya Vidyalaya I students to set up a forum to voice demands regarding their wards safety in and around the school compound.

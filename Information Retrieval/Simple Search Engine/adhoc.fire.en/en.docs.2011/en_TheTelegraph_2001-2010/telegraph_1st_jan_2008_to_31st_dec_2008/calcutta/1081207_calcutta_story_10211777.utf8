The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | India buzz on Thanksgiving
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       India buzz on Thanksgiving
										      Made in Manhattan      The Mumbai tragedy matters, not the Wests perception                                    
	The Mumbai tragedy matters, not the Wests perception        
	It is personal. Every time I answer an American colleague or friends question about Indias politics or culture, or when I manage to provoke their curiosity and dispel a stereotype they hold, or when I convince one of them to explore India on their next vacation, I think of it as a personal victory. Over the years, like many Indians who live far away from the homeland, I have unconsciously become an ambassador for India, defending her policies, celebrating her achievements and valiantly trying to change every wrong perception of the country.        
	Equally personal was the news that hit the American airwaves last week, the day before Thanksgiving  the four-day holiday weekend  and continued to play out incessantly, minute-by-minute on television. The hostage crisis, the shootings on Mumbai streets, the escape of the Jewish child (in AFP picture above), and the deaths all around the city held centrestage throughout the weekend, contrasting in a sinister fashion with the celebrations and family gatherings that mark American Thanksgiving.         
	I have family in Mumbai, and with it varied memories of the city  whether its of taking a train from the Chhatrapati Shivaji station many summers back, buying glittery bags from the pavements of Colaba Causeway, or having a cup of coffee at the Oberoi on my last trip. But was it only the personal connections that made me feel vulnerable, angry and sad as I watched the horrific attacks? Or was I doubly disturbed because I was seeing it through semi-American eyes?        
	It is easy to see things as black and white, especially when it is the unknown and I have often felt that is how many see India. Americans are a varied lot, surprising you often with their knowledge of India  many have travelled to the country as bohemian youth, know the difference between Hindi and Tamil, and even scaled the mountains of Rishikesh. But for most others, impressions about India are a blur of anecdotes and fleeting media stories, which capture very little of the reality. The tonalities of grey within the Kashmir stalemate, the history that surrounds Hindu-Muslim politics, or the complexities of the love-hate relationship with Pakistan is often lost. From selective media reports, it is much simpler for them to believe that India is a nation that is polarised by religion, where Hindu-Muslim riots happen every day, in every part of the country.        
	It is not often that India holds centrestage in the world, for the right or the wrong reasons. It is not often that every major TV network scrambles to get their journalist into the country and rushes them to do a piece-to camera from the streets of Mumbai. It is not often that we see former CIA agents converge at media tables and analyse the security dilemmas and the Indian governments response, or the lack thereof, on every American channel, newspaper and radio show. But media attention is fleeting and soon the people of the world will move on to the next big thing.         
	However, just like New York in 2001, the Mumbai attacks are bound to have a long-lasting impact on many, whether it is on Mumbaikars who live and love the city, or the foreign tourists who will now think twice about visiting the bustling metropolis. But it will also be a prism through which the world will continue to see India.         
	While Mumbai will work hard to heal and move forward, I wonder what will be the final takeway of the horrific attacks for the West? Will it be defined by the Indian intelligence services that ignored the warnings regarding the attacks, and the delays and inefficiencies on the ground? Or will it be the determination of the hotel staff to save lives ignoring their own personal safety, and the resilience and strength of Mumbai and the Indian people to bounce back after such a heinous crime?         
	But when something as horrific as this happens, does perception and what the West thinks really matter? Perhaps the real takeaway will be if we realise that every tragedy is also an opportunity, a real chance to rethink, regroup and ensure that such a tragedy is never allowed to repeat itself.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A newborn boy found abandoned near Sealdah bus stand on Tuesday was taken to hospital, where he was declared dead.         
	Police said the baby, found wrapped in a polythene bag, was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital.         
	Doctors said the baby was a day old. Someone had dumped him in a corner of the garbage vat, said an officer of Entally police station.         
	Around 1.30pm some passengers noticed the baby near the garbage vat and raised an alarm. A crowd gathered and the cops were informed, who took him to NRS.         
	We think the baby was alive when it was first noticed. But he died because of the delay in taking him to hospital, said a hawker who had informed the police along with some residents of the area.         
	We have started a case but its very difficult to trace the person who dumped the baby. We questioned some pavement-dwellers but didnt get any leads, Sarkar said.         
	Its strange that the person managed to escape unnoticed after dumping the baby in such a crowded place, said a pedestrian.

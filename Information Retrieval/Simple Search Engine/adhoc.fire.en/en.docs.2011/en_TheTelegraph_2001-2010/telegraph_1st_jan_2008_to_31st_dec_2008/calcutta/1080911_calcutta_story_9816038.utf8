                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Scan on cop for not helping youth 
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                              
	A college student who was allegedly shooed away by a constable he had approached for help after being threatened by a taxi driver has lodged a complaint against the cop. The youth also provided police the number of the taxi (WB 11A 2281) and lodged a complaint against the driver.         
	Aveek Das, a resident of Bowbazar, boarded the taxi with his sister and his friend near the Chittaranjan Avenue-Ganesh Chandra Avenue crossing around 4.10pm on Wednesday. When I asked the driver to take us to Prinsep Ghat, he demanded Rs 40 extra. After I refused, we got into an argument. The driver suddenly pulled out an iron rod and threatened to hit me.         
	The three immediately got off the taxi. The driver, too, came out of the vehicle, iron rod in hand. People standing at the crossing saw the driver was about to hit me and rushed to my aid. I ran towards constable N. Aich, who was standing nearby, for help, added Das.         
	The middle-aged policeman, belonging to the headquarters traffic guard, was not interested in taking any action against the driver. He did not even write down the number of the taxi, said Imtiyaz Ali, who witnessed the incident.        
	The people who had gathered exhorted the constable to take action against the driver, who had got back into the taxi and was trying to drive away. Aich allegedly asked Das to leave the spot and allowed the taxi to get away.        
	This angered those who had gathered and about 50 of them gheraoed the constable demanding an explanation. Traffic flow was disrupted.        
	A sergeant arrived on the spot. He gave me a complaint card and asked me to fill it up. Some pedestrians also complained against the constable, said Das.         
	We will take action against the constable if he is found guilty, said deputy commissioner (traffic) D. Banerjee.

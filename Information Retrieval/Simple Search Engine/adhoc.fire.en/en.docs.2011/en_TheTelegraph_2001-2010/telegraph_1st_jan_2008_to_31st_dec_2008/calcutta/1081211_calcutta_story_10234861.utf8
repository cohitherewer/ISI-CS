The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Wanted: more cops for Metro
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Wanted: more cops for Metro
          KINSUK BASU                               
	Police want the number of personnel guarding the Metro Railway to be increased from 150 to 500.        
	Lalbazar has sent a letter to Writers Buildings  a copy of which has been forwarded to the railway ministry  seeking immediate approval to raise the staff strength of the Metro Railway Police, which functions under the city police.        
	The police brass wants the Centre to bear half the cost of maintaining the proposed 500-strong force. The rest will be borne by the state.        
	We have tried to impress upon the state and the central governments the need for proper protection of the Metro, said Sudhir Mishra, the special additional commissioner of police (organisation).        
	The Metro Railway, which runs 16.45km along the north-south axis of the city, caters to around 4.5 lakh commuters every day. The 150 personnel, the authorities feel, are too few to keep the vital installation safe.        
	The best option is to hand over the responsibility to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), as the New Delhi Metro has done. Our second choice is the Railway Protection Force (RPF), said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	Even for CISF or RPF, we had suggested a 50:50 cost-sharing formula. But there are apparently a few hitches in that. The New Delhi Metro can afford CISF security as it is a corporation, the officer added.        
	Till a central force steps in to monitor Metro Railway security, the police want the number of personnel covering the link to be raised from 150 to 500.        
	The police have also asked the Metro Railway to arrange for the deployment of armed RPF men, now posted at night, also during the day.        
	According to the proposal, at least 150 RPF men should be deployed in two shifts to guard all 17 stations.        
	The cops have also decided to restrict entry-exit at some of the stations to facilitate passenger frisking and baggage scan.

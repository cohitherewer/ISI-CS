                                                                                                               Molest cry nets doctor
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A doctor was arrested for allegedly molesting a 32-year-old woman in his chamber in Bansdroni on Monday afternoon.        
	As news spread, Umashankar Mondal was assaulted by local residents and admitted to MR Bangur Hospital.        
	He was arrested following a complaint by the victims husband.        
	We will interrogate the doctor after he is released from hospital. We will also talk to the couple. The victim may be sent for a medical examination, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.        
	The woman, a resident of KM Naskar Road, in the Regent Park area, had gone to Mondal, a general physician, for a check-up in the afternoon.        
	My wife told me that the doctor behaved indecently with her behind closed doors. She panicked and ran out, a police officer quoted the husband as having said.        
	The husband, along with a few neighbours, then went to meet Mondal in his chamber.        
	The doctor denied the allegation and refused to talk to them. Sarkar and his neighbours then barged into the chamber, said an officer.         
	An altercation continued for half an hour. Local residents gathered on the spot and on hearing from the victims neighbours what had happened, started abusing the doctor.        
	When Mondal denied the molestation charge for a second time, the mob ransacked his chamber and beat him up. Witnesses said the doctor slumped to the ground after the assault.        
	Some local residents called Jadavpur police station, from where a team soon arrived and took the doctor to the hospital.

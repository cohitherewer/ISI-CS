                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Extortion bid leads to clash
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two gangs involved in the construction business clashed for half an hour, hurling bombs at each other, in Phoolbagan on Sunday afternoon. No one was injured.        
	We have started a suo motu case as no complaint has been lodged. No one has been arrested, said an officer of Phoolbagan police station.         
	A preliminary probe revealed that some local youths raided a construction site in SK Das Lane around 12.15pm and demanded money from the promoter as Durga puja subscription.        
	The promoter refused to pay, saying work was yet to start. This angered the youths, who threatened not to allow construction unless the promoter coughed up the money, said an officer working on the case. But the promoter, a central Calcutta resident, refused to budge.        
	The youths then told him to buy construction material from them or leave the locality.         
	This time, too, the promoter did not pay heed to their threats and asked the youths to mind their own business, the officer added.        
	The heated exchange turned into a clash, with each side hurling bombs at the other, after the promoter called his aides. Residents panicked and informed the police station.        
	The groups fled after hurling four to five bombs at each other. They fought for nearly half an hour. No one was injured, the officer said.        
	According to him, the youths had told the promoter three months ago to buy building material from them. Or else, they threatened, they would not allow the structure to come up.        
	Residents said Sundays clash was not an isolated incident. The realty boom has resulted in a vicious turf war between promoters, which often leave innocent people injured, said a resident.

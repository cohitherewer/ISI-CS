The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Spotlight on ignored art 
                                                                                                               Spotlight on ignored art

	Dwindling audiences at theatre shows sparked off a discussion among a bunch of young and veteran stage artistes on the eve of World Theatre Day (March 27).         
	Actor-directors Koushik Sen, Jayoti Bose, Santanu Bose and Ramanjit Kaur, Seemabaddha hero Barun Chanda and theatre critic Ananda Lal gathered at Oxford Bookstore on Wednesday evening to debate if theatre was an ignored art.        
	Patrons may be available if there are T20 versions of longer plays. A collection of five-minute plays stand a better chance of attracting both audience and sponsors, remarked actor Chanda, while Swapnasandhani director Koushik Sen stressed one could do good theatre despite funds crunch. If you can involve your local community there will always be people to support you, said Sen, who stages all his plays at the south Calcutta theatre stop Sujata Sadan.        
	Jayoti Bose shifted the spotlight on how childrens theatre can be made commercially viable. Theres a demand for childrens theatre like GRIPS. I think theres never a dearth of audience for good theatre, said Bose, who has directed plays for the young like Care Korina and Akash Mati Hawa Jol.        
	Ananda Lal said people would probably return to the theatres once the spell of the small screen wears out. Corporate houses such as those abroad who consider it a matter of pride to be associated with artistic ventures will also grow in India with time, he added.         
	But Ramanjit Kaur said that theatre practitioners should not hope for financial assistance and full houses when they dont care to train themselves physically or mentally.         
	Theatre people shouldnt expect funds when they dont care to train themselves and put up a quality production, said Ramanjit Kaur, the director of The Creative Arts.         
	The chat was part of a five-day programme sponsored by Rotaract Club of Kalighat to raise awareness about theatre. Rota Acts 2008: A Stage Gala saw a string of workshops on acting, scriptwriting, direction, sets, lighting and marketing at various spots across the city from March 22.

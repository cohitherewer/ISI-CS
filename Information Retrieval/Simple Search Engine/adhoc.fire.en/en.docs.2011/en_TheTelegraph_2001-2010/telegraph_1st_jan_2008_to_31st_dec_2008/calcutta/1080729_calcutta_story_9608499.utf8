The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | MBA students in biz venture
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       MBA students in biz venture
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	In business, its the early bird that rakes in the moolah. Taking cue from the age-old proverb, two MBA students have turned entrepreneurs even before graduating.        
	H.R. Sampreet and Saurav Dhiman, second-year students of the Vinod Gupta School of Management at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, have launched their own company, Enfount Business Solutions. Their maiden venture is Bulkdeals.co.in, a Bangalore-based online retail window specialising in institutional and organisational buying of laptops, desktops and other electronic items.        
	Across campuses, students form groups to buy computers so retailers give them a discount, said Sampreet. But this happens locally and in an unorganised manner, he explained.        
	The duo saw a business opportunity in this campus trend and created an online platform that is a one-stop-shop for bulk deals of laptops and desktops of all brands.        
	Here, students can register and get great deals directly from the brands, Sampreet said. We estimate this to be a Rs 200-400 crore market. The brands, too, were looking for a single window to reach out to the student community. We had the business model and wanted to hit the market early, so we started even before graduating, he added.        
	The company is partnering with almost all top brands such as Dell, LG, Hewlett Packard, Lenovo and HCL.        
	The website had over 1,000 visitors in the first three days of its launch and already has more than 300 members and over 20 registered colleges, including all the IITs.        
	When asked how they plan to balance studies with running a business, Saurav said: It is all about time management. Our business requires just two or three hours a day, which we can easily put in.

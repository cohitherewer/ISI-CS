          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Subrata Bayen being produced in court.   A Telegraph picture    
	Subrata Bayen, an alleged Bangladeshi criminal, was arrested from a house in Palm Avenue, barely 800 metres from the chief ministers residence, on Monday arrested.        
	Subrata, also known as alias Bipul and Abdul Ali, figures on the Interpols Most Wanted list. Several cases of murder, extortion and gun-running are pending against the 39-year-old in Bangladesh.        
	Subrata has been living in Calcutta for the past few years and managed to get a PAN card, an Indian passport and a ration card in his name, said Rajeev Kumar, the joint commissioner of police.        
	He bought a house in Palm Avenue where he lived with his family. Later, he sent his family back to Bangladesh and kept moving across the world. He had gone to Dubai, Nepal and China.        
	A few days ago, he had returned from Nepal.        
	The police came to know from their contacts that Subrata had been living somewhere in south Calcutta. After being tipped off about the exact hideout, the Special Task Force of Calcutta police descended on 5G Palm Avenue around 11.40am and arrested him.         
	He was later produced in court and remanded in police custody till October 27.         
	Preliminary investigations revealed that Subrata was using the city as a safe haven after being hounded out of Bangladesh. He had invested in real estate in and around Calcutta and in Karimpur in Nadia. He had business interests in China, too, said a police officer.        
	In 1991, Subrata jumped bail in Bangladesh and entered India. He ran an extortion racket in his home country from here. We have recovered a 9-mm pistol from him and booked him under the Foreigners Act, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).

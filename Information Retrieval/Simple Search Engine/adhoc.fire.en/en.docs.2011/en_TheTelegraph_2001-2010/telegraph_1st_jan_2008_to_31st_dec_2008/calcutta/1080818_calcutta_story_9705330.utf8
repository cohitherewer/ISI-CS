                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cabbie returns bag with cash
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A taxi driver returned a bag containing Rs 60,000 and travel documents which a US national had left behind in his vehicle by mistake on Sunday morning.        
	With help from police, the bag was handed over to the US national.        
	As on other days, Ashok Dube pulled up his taxi at the prepaid booth of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in the morning. Minutes later, the taxi was hired by Earl Jackson, a computer professional who had arrived from South Korea, via Hyderabad.        
	It was around 12.30pm when Jacksonsaab hired my car and asked me to take him to Gariahat. I took him to a guest house in Gariahat, recalled the 30-year-old taxi driver.        
	Jackson was accompanied by Somnath Chakrabarty, an employee of a software firm for which Jackson came as consultant. After entering the guest house, they realised that they had left behind the bag containing the money and travel documents in the taxi.        
	After Chakrabarty contacted us, we asked the taxi union and the officials in the prepaid booth to trace the vehicle that Jackson had hired, said an officer of airport police station.        
	Shortly after the duo got off, Dube noticed that a medium-sized leather bag was lying below the rear seat. I always check my vehicle after dropping passengers. Most drivers do so as we take passengers from a high-security zone, said Dube, a Dum Dum resident.        
	He opened the bag and found money and some documents inside. Seeing Jacksons photographs on one of the documents, he realised who the bag belonged to.        
	He went straight to the airport and handed over the bag to the officials manning the prepaid booth. Later, Jackson was contacted and the bag was returned to him.        
	He wanted to give me some money but I refused. Whatever I did was my duty. I cannot take money for that, said Dube.

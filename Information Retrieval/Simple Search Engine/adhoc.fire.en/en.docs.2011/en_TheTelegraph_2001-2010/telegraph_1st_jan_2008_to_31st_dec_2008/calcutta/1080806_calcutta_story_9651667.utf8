          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta will train Indian accountants in global accounting standards.        
	IIM has tied up with consultant major PricewaterhouseCoopers to run training programmes on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which has been adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).        
	India has committed to adopt IFRS from the accounting period beginning on or after April 1, 2011. But since Indian accounting standards are different from IFRS, we need to train the professionals, said Saibal Chattopadhyay, the dean (programme initiative) of IIM Calcutta.        
	The course module has been jointly developed by IIM Calcutta and PwC. Experts from the Joka institute and PwC will take the classes, starting November. Chartered accountants and cost accountants can join the programme. The classes will be held on the IIM campus.

                      Christmas melodies                    Based on Christian lyrics, carols relate to the Nativity of baby Jesus. Introduced into church services by St Francis of Assisi in the 12th century, carol originally meant to dance around in a circle. Eventually, it came to include music and lyrics as well. The joyous themes for many traditional Christmas carols were banned in England by the staunch Protestant Oliver Cromwell and many of the earliest carols and songs were subsequently lost for all time. Christmas carols were only fully popularised again during the Victorian era when they again expressed joyful and merry themes in their lyrics as opposed to the normal, more sombre, Christian lyrics found in hymns. Today, Christmas songs and carols are a part of popular tradition the world over, not only among Christians but among other communities as well. This evening, The Carolzzingers, the Western choir of Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan, present a programme of carols to ring in the festive season. To be conducted by Sumit Roy and Sumita Bhattacharya.

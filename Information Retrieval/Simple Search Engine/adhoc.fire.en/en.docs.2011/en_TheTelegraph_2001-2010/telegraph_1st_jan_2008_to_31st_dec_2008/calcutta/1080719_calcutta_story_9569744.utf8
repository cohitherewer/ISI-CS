	A family headed for a relatives place in their new car nearly drowned when the vehicle fell into a pond at Sarsuna Satellite Township on Friday afternoon.         
	Papia Roy, her two-year-old son Ankush and her 60-year-old mother Sabita Roy Chowdhury started from their home in the township for Bhattacharjeepara Road around 11.30am. Amalendu Koley was driving the Maruti 800, bought a month back.        
	My husband, an electrical engineer, is out of town for a week. So I was taking my mother to her house. I was on the front seat and my mother and child were at the back, said Papia.        
	The journey was smooth till the car mounted a culvert near our house. There was a jolt and before we could figure out what was happening, we were in water. I started screaming for someone to save my son. My mother and Ankush were also crying, she added.         
	Some residents taking their mid-day bath in the pond saw the car go under water and immediately sprung to the familys rescue. Koley, who managed to get out of the car, was also trying to save the trio.        
	Papia said Sabita managed to break the rear windshield and the driver pulled her out through the gap. Papia and Ankush, too, came out of the car the same way and were pulled to the ground by the residents.         
	 None of the four was seriously injured. They returned home after first aid. We also pulled the car out of the pond, said Khokan Dalui, one of the residents.         
	Police took the car to Sarsuna police station and questioned the driver. He told us that the mishap occurred because the brakes failed. He did not slow down while mounting the culvert. We will call a mechanic to check the car, said an officer.

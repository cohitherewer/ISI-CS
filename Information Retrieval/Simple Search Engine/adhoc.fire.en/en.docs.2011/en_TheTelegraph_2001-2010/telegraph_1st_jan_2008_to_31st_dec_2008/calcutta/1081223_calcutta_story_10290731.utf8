The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cave-in risk at civic schools
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cave-in risk at civic schools

	A dilapidated building near MG Road has put the lives of about 60 schoolchildren at risk, leaving the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in a Catch-22 situation.         
	The CMC runs two primary schools from the rented premises, 16 Nur Mohammed Lane, off MG Road. The three-storeyed yellow building  the civic authorities couldnt say how old it is  is currently in a shambles.         
	But the civic body can only wait and watch, as neither can it carry out repair work without the landlords consent nor does it want to let go of the property.         
	We are increasing the number of primary schools and so we dont want to lose any property that we are currently functioning from. We do face problems in carrying out repairs on a rented building because the landlord often doesnt allow repair work. So, we want to either acquire or buy the property at 16 Nur Mohammed Lane. It also involves legal hassles, said Kalyani Mitra, the mayoral council member (education).         
	While the CMC dutifully pays the house rent for 16 Nur Mohammed Lane, the landlorrd owes the civic body property tax dues of Rs 77,475.        
	The CMC has recently slapped a notice stating that it would acquire the property if the landlord fails to clear the dues soon, said Mitra.         
	The tax amount is huge in comparison to the rent we pay. So we do have a point in acquiring the building, she stressed.        
	Its the schoolchildren, mostly pavement-dwellers of Beniatola, College Street, MG Road and Sealdah, who are caught in the middle.        
	The ground floor, where the students gather for their midday meals, has developed cracks in the walls. The plaster is peeling off in places. The roof is crumbling too.         
	The second-floor classrooms have been closed. We have locked the second floor as its very risky for anyone to step inside. The ceiling may cave in any moment. An accident is just waiting to happen, said Debdas Chakraborty, a teacher in one of the schools.        
	The terrace is overrun by weeds and plants, which are adding to the problem.         
	The school building is in a pathetic condition and the roof can collapse any time. I had brought the matter to the borough offices notice several times but nothing has been done. The CMC has ruled out any major reconstruction work but the situation is so dangerous for the students, complained Aparajita Dasgupta, the Congress councillor of ward No. 49.                          JHINUK MAZUMDAR

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                
	Eight colleges under Calcutta University (CU) will soon be upgraded to centres of excellence.        
	The University Grants Commission (UGC) had recently written to CU expressing its willingness to upgrade eight colleges affiliated to it.         
	The universitys syndicate set up a committee on Tuesday to study the facilities available in each of the 137 colleges affiliated to CU. The committee will then shortlist undergraduate institutions that can qualify for the upgrade.        
	The colleges need to fulfil certain criteria to get the status of centre of excellence, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro-vice chancellor (academic affairs).        
	The UGC criteria include quality infrastructure, adequate facilities for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in emerging areas, proper student-teacher ratio in each subject and well-stocked libraries and laboratories, said a senior official of the university.         
	The selected institutions are expected to get the centre of excellence honour within a year, a syndicate member said.        
	Presidency College is the first to be given the honour in 2004, when the UGC launched the scheme of upgrading undergraduate colleges to centres of excellence.         
	In 2006, St Xaviers College, Scottish Church College and Loreto College got the tag.         
	Sources in the university said Lady Brabourne College, Bethune College, Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandir, Belur, and Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, are among the front-runners.        
	An autonomous college that has been accredited by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) is given Rs 1 crore if it is declared a centre of excellence.        
	Colleges with only NAAC accreditation are given a maximum of Rs 65 lakh each. Those that are neither autonomous nor accredited get Rs 35 lakh each.        
	Among the favourites, only the Ramakrishna Mission college in Narendrapur is autonomous and has been accredited by NAAC.        
	There are now three autonomous colleges under CU  St Xaviers College, Ramakrishna Mission Residential College in Narendrapur, and Ramakrishna Mission Sikshamandir in Belur.

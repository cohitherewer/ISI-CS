The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Warning: diversion chaos ahead
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Warning: diversion chaos ahead
          KINSUK BASU                                             
	If you live anywhere along VIP Road and are used to reaching EM Bypass through the slip bridge to skirt the traffic chaos in Ultadanga, the choice for the next six months is between the route you avoided so far and one much longer.         
	Beginning July 7, the CMDA will close the slip bridge to all medium and heavy traffic, allowing only light motor vehicles to pass till the left turn to Salt Lake.         
	This will be done to construct pillars for a proposed flyover originating at the point where traffic from the Ultadanga side, Salt Lake and VIP Road converge. The flyover will lead to VIP Road.        
	What it means is that anyone headed for the Bypass through VIP Road has to either drive in the opposite direction  through the Rajarhat expressway  or take the Ultadanga-Hudco crossing, which could be even more crowded because of the diversion.        
	A third option would be to take the slip bridge, enter Salt Lake and head for the Bypass via Karunamoyee. But that could land you in more trouble because peak-hour traffic in Karunamoyee is just as heavy as at the Ultadanga crossing.        
	Traffic near Karunamoyee is terrible during office hours. If more vehicles come in, reaching the Beleghata crossing through Salt Lake in the evening will be difficult, said Rajsekhar Majumder, the manager of a private bank.        
	Admitting the possibility of more traffic congestion because of the diversion  the restrictions will be on till December-end  officials of the CMDA have suggested that all south-bound vehicles from the airport take the Rajarhat road to reach the Bypass.        
	This is a stop-gap arrangement till end-December. A part of the Bypass from where the flyover will take off has already been widened so that vehicles headed south dont face any problem, said Debdas Bhattacharya, the managing director of the traffic transportation wing of the CMDA. We hope commuters will bear with us.        
	The 1,290-metre flyover will have four lanes. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 70 crore and it will take around two years for the flyover to be ready for traffic.        
	Police officials said the closure of the slip bridge could trigger traffic trouble further down the Bypass, too.         
	If all south-bound cars from VIP Road take the Rajarhat expressway, the Chingrihata intersection will be in a mess. We have proposed that the road space at this intersection be increased and converted into four lanes. The small triangular park at this intersection should be done away with, said a senior official of the Beleghata Traffic Guard.         
	Policemen deployed at the Hudco intersection and in Salt Lake are just as worried. The Ultadanga crossing already has an estimated vehicle count of around 19,000 per hour. Handling more will be a big test, one of them said.

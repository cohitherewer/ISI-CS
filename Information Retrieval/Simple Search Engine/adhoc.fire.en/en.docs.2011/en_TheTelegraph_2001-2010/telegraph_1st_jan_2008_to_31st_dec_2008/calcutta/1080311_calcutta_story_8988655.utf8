The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Theatre hub lies in limbo
                                                                                                               Theatre hub lies in limbo
  - Teething trouble          SEBANTI SARKAR                          DRAMA, INTERRUPTED: The Paschim Banga Natya Akademi Bhavan, on AJC Bose Road. Picture by Pabitra Das                                        
	There is no sign of the promised drama archive and library.        
	A year after its inauguration on March 6, 2007, the Paschim Banga Natya Akademi Bhavan, at 1/1AJC Bose Road, is still to become the theatre hub it was meant to be.        
	Built at a cost of Rs 1.08 crore, the three-storeyed building was to offer a hall for workshops and productions, guest rooms, conference rooms, offices and rooms to store Akademi publications and archival material.        
	But the guest room with nine beds and the large dormitory space were lying unused even as district troupes at the just-concluded Seventh Natya Mela were being put up at Moulali Yuva Kendra. The sole group from beyond the state was put up at EZCC, Salt Lake. The Tripti Mitra Sabhaghar was under lock and key, with all seminars and play readings being held at Bangla Akademi and screenings at Nandan II.        
	The Natya Akademi chairman, Kumar Roy, admitted that things hadnt gone the way he had expected. But these are teething problems.... We hope to complete the archive and library in the next financial year.        
	Sukanto Roy, the member-secretary of the Akademi, said: We have enough books for the library, but not the infrastructure. Where do we keep the books? Where will the readers sit? We need so many other things, like computers....        
	Anup Motilal, the state director of culture, however, said: I am unaware of any funds crunch. We are ready to meet all needs of Natya Akademi.

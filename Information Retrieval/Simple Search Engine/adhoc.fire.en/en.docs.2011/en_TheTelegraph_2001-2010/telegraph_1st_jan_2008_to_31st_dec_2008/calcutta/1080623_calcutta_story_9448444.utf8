                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Groups clash   over booty
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Tension gripped Tollygunge after two groups of rowdies fought a pitched battle on Satish Mukherjee Road on Sunday afternoon. Four persons were injured in the clash.        
	Police said the clash was the fallout of rivalry between two extortionist gangs fighting for control of Masjidbari, which has been witnessing frenetic realty development.        
	Trouble began when members of the rival gangs came face to face at the end of a show at Basusree cinema, on SP Mukherjee Road. They did not clash immediately, but there were indications of what was to follow.        
	They abused each other and left the place, an officer at Tollygunge police station said.        
	Members of one of the gangs went to Satish Mukherjee Road a little later to continue the confrontation with their rivals, who had by then assembled there in full force.        
	They first started attacking each other with stones. Within minutes, they collected lathis and iron rods. The clash continued for over half-an-hour, the police officer said.        
	On seeing the groups fighting, pedestrians ran for cover. Some took refuge in roadside houses or shops.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that the two groups  one allegedly backed by the Congress and the other by the CPM  were targeting the same realtors for extortion and demanding contracts for supply of building materials.        
	Earlier, they would only extort money from local traders. But they have changed their style, said an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad.

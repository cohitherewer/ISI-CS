The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mixed mood on maidan 
                                                                                                            Mixed mood on maidan 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Park Circus Maidan on Monday, minutes after a court order stopped Book Fair work. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Ramesh Shaw was shouting instructions to labourers putting up the Sage Publications stall on Park Circus Maidan when his cellphone rang. After a minute, he again barked out instructions to the labourers, this time to undo whatever they had done.        
	As soon as the news of the verdict reached Park Circus Maidan, shoulders drooped and faces became grim.        
	The judgment has shattered us. And it came a day before the fair was to start. We had made the preparations and were expecting the verdict to go in our favour, said N.K. Chaudhury, the regional sales manager of Sage Publications.         
	But the Park Circus residents were in a mood to celebrate. They had opposed the choice of Park Circus Maidan as the venue for the Book Fair on the grounds of congestion and pollution.        
	We are not against the Book Fair; our only grievance was the location. Had the fair been held here, the entire area would have been badly affected by traffic snarls and air and noise pollution. We asked the administration to address our problems but they did not. Moving the court was our last resort, said Kalyan Saha, the secretary of the Darga Road Citizens Committee.         
	The schools in Park Circus were apprehending traffic congestion for the duration of the fair. I am a book lover and want the Book Fair to be held. But Park Circus Maidan was the wrong choice of venue. Lakhs of people would have suffered if the fair was held here, said Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls High School.        
	The residents are also happy that the court has ordered the Guild to restore the ground to its original condition within 10 days.        
	Most of the stalls were near completion. The electricity and water network had been set up. Restoring the ground to its original condition within the deadline may not be possible, said a contractor.        
	Police, too, breathed a sigh of relief. If the Book Fair had been held on Park Circus Maidan, we would have got eight to 12 hours to plan traffic control. The situation would have been nightmarish, said a senior police officer.

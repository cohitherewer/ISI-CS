The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Todis plead for stay on warrant
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Todis plead for stay on warrant
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                Ashok Todi      
	The elusive Todi brothers and Anil Saraogi moved the sessions court on Friday seeking a stay on the execution of non-bailable arrest warrants against them.        
	The trios lawyers filed the plea in the court of chief judge Murari Mohan Ghosh who scheduled the hearing for November 3, which is also the deadline for the execution of the warrants.        
	A magistrate court had on October 27 ordered the CBI to arrest Ashok and Pradip Todi and their relative Saraogi, all accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case, for not appearing in person. They are to be produced before the magistrate on November 3.        
	The summons sent to my clients gave them the option to be represented by their lawyers. They only exercised that right. Fridays appeal seeks to challenge the basis on which the arrest warrants were issued, said a lawyer for the Todis.        
	He, however, refused to comment on the whereabouts of the missing trio.        
	Officers of the CBIs special crime branch in Calcutta, entrusted with executing the warrants, claimed that the appeal would not come in the way of the trios arrest.        
	Legal experts, however, doubted if the plea in the sessions court would allow the magistrates court to take up the case related to the Todis and Saraogi on November 3.        
	Usually, a subordinate court doesnt resume proceedings if any part of its order in the case is challenged before a higher court. Its unlikely that the magistrates court would be in a position to hear the trios case on November 3, said Sailendu Rakshit, a senior lawyer of the high court.        
	Hours after the appeal was filed, CBI officers went into a huddle with their lawyers to discuss their course of action.        
	We are confused. If the hearing of the appeal is scheduled for November 3 and the lower court is not in a position to hear the original case, whats the point in arresting the trio within the deadline? We wont be able to produce them before the magistrates court as ordered, said a CBI official.        
	Pappu plea: Pappu, one of the accused in the Rizwanur case, moved a bail plea in the sessions court on Friday. It will be heard on November 4.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The Mumbai nightmare
                                                                                                            The Mumbai nightmare
										      eyewitness                        Two works by Sudhir Patwardhan on show at Galerie 88				                                 
	The underbelly of Indian cities lies exposed in Sudhir Patwardhans wide-angle paintings and unsettling drawings being exhibited at Galerie 88, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.        
	The city of Bombay has been the stimulus for the works of Patwardhan, who till two years ago had been a practising radiologist based in Thane, ever since he moved there from Pune in the 1970s. Earlier, he expressed his fascination for the city that always seemed to be on the boil through his representations of its seething crowds, the individuals with a secret life of their own who stood out from the masses, and its built environment, which seemed to grow with a frenetic energy that was difficult to control.        
	Patwardhan looked at the vulnerability of and tensions in human relationships in his sensitive drawings. Although these were not representational works he got every gesture right through drawing indefatigably. Before he began to build up an archive of images taken with his camera, he used his notepad to make impromptu sketches to be used later.        
	This time the canker of violence is the stimulus, and what was earlier an element embedded in his work has come to the fore, permeating the entire body of work on show. Patwardhan, who was in town for the opening on Friday evening, said: Earlier, I instinctively limited the depiction of violence. My experience fell short of actual reality. The images could not in a sense match up to the horror of the moment.         
	After 1992, I was trying to find a way I could enter my subject. I thought maybe I should enter it through fears. Maybe it was not on the same scale as the 1992 riots, but after we came in Bombay there was the fear of walking a road, of not being able to protect yourself or you wife. Such incidents will expose you and your self-image, said Patwardhan, who has time and again, exhibited at major international expositions. Violence has become so much a part of the urban scene that it could not be ignored or suppressed any longer. It is a nightmare that has become a part of our waking hours.        
	In his larger canvases, Patwardhan builds up the urban sprawl with an eye to detail befitting a miniature painter. His use of photographs for reference is quite clear but this is not photographic reality. He presents different slices of life concurrently but the emphasis is on presenting the mishmash of architecture  ancient chawls cohabiting with jhopadpattis, mosques, highrises, flyovers and pylons. Creeks stagnate in areas shunned even by the lowliest. Each neighbourhood has a character of its own.        
	The denizens of this built environment jostle for space on his canvases with the vehicles they move in  police jeeps, autorickshaws and scooters. But the working girls, passers-by, beggars, burkha-clad women, unperturbed policemen are suddenly elbowed aside by thugs with brutish faces who turn a victim into pulp. They are creatures of the night, almost comical figures like Thurber cartoons, but their very lack of individuality and featureless mask-like faces has a chilling, numbing effect.        
	The power and immediacy of these paintings is amazing. Patwardhan can conjure up the aftermath of a death on a street by exploiting his uncanny power of observation. It must have needed this self-taught artist years of practice to depict accurately the commanding gesture of the working class man in a singlet.        
	Yet in his paintings at least, the overall impression is of great placidity. He applies paint painstakingly and unhurriedly, a pace that is quite at variance with the undertow of violence and feeling of disruption in his current works, even in the ones where it is not apparent. This is not unexpected of an artist with Patwardhans breadth of vision that is almost epical.       SOUMITRA DAS

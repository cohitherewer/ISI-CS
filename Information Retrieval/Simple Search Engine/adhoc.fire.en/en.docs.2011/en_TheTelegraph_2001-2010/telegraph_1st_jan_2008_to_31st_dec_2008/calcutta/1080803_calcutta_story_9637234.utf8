	Most people head for the hills as the mercury starts to climb, but last summer we chose lush green Lulung in Orissa over north Bengal and loved every minute of our stay.        
	Lulung is one of the entry points to Simlipal National Park and is located on its eastern fringes. The other entrance is at Joshipur.        
	A pleasant four-hour train journey to Baleswar and an hour and a half by road took us to Lulung. We put up at the Orissa Tourism Development Corporation (OTDC)s guest house, Aranya Nivas. It has gardens, lawns, a lounge, a terrace and a dining hall on the outer part. Inside, concrete cottages stand on mounds.        
	The climate at Lulung, located at an altitude of 300 metres, is wonderful. The view of the hillocks in the distance is just as nice.         
	We reached in the late afternoon. Soon, the sun turned a shade of vermilion that matched the reddish soil of the forest. The trees cast their long shadows on the ground and the sound of homing birds filled the air. In an hour, the dark wings of the night had enveloped the forest.        
	All the rooms in the guest house have a private balcony. We sat in our balcony in the dark and tried to experience the forest through our ears. The shrill cry of a hill bird would occasionally rise above the soft gurgle of a nearby rivulet. Ripe fruits fell off the trees landing on the leafy forest floor with thuds.        
	Solar panels provide power to the cottages at night. After a sumptuous dinner, we turned in.        
	We left the guest house at dawn to collect mangoes that had fallen off the trees at night. We also gathered large ripe papayas and wood apples (bel). The fruits made for a wonderful breakfast.        
	We then set out to explore the jungle around Aranya Nivas. Our first stop was the streamlet. We also explored some of the tracks that lead to nearby villages.        
	We then walked 3 km to the milky white waterfall at Kalipahar before returning to the guest house.  
	Going   
	A four-hour journey by train to Baleswar, followed by a 90-minute bus/ hired car ride. Or take NH6 till Bangriposi (230km), which itself is worth a visit. Lulung is 20km from there.

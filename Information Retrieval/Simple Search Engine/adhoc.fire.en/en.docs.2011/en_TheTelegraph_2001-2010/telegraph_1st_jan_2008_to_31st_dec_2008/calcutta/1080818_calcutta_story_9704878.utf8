The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lakhs wasted on dummy constables
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lakhs wasted on dummy constables
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta police spent between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 6 lakh on 13 constables who fielded dummy candidates to join the force.        
	Six of the 13 were arrested on Saturday by officers of the detective department. All the constables were undergoing training at Police Training School (PTS).        
	Each constable gets a salary of over Rs 5,000 per month during the six-month training at the PTS. They are also provided uniforms and free accommodation in the heart of the city, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.         
	Besides, the police have to pay trainers, law instructors, supervisors and an officer of the rank of assistant commissioner for the training. The money spent on constables who adopted unfair means has gone down the drain, he added.        
	According to him, some of those who got in fraudulently are still undergoing training. The racket is deep-rooted. Its not clear how many of the 329 constables being trained got the job by dubious means. The city police spends between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh on training each constable before they are commissioned.        
	The current batchs training ends in October.         
	 The detective department cracked down on the racket in April and arrested five trainees who were inducted into the force after a recruitment drive in Konnagar, Hooghly, in January.The racket came to light after one of the recruits, Debasis Manna, went to Lalbazar police headquarters to collect his appointment letter from the central reserve force. Officers noticed a stark difference between his appearance and the picture he had provided while applying.         
	We have instructed our officers to verify the credentials of all recruits before they complete the training and are posted elsewhere, said additional commissioner S.N. Sarkar.         
	According to a trainer at the PTS, the recent arrests have affected the morale of the trainees, some of whom are graduates and postgraduates. There is panic every time officers from Lalbazar enter the premises, he said.

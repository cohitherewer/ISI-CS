          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday granted green activist Subhash Duttas plea to be added as a party to a case over a parking lot involving Tata Steel and the army.        
	The company had gone to court challenging an army notification disallowing parking of vehicles by its employees in front of Elliot Park.        
	Dutta supported the armys stand on the ground that the parking space was part of the Maidan. The Tatas, he claimed, had violated environment norms by converting an open space into a parking lot.        
	The judge asked the army, Tata Steel, civic body and the police to file affidavits on Duttas deposition. On September 24, Tata Steel had moved the court challenging the armys order on the ground that the civic body had allowed it to park vehicles on the plot.        
	Tata Steel had said the civic body had allowed it to use the space as a parking lot for 15 years against an annual fee of Rs 2.15 lakh. The custodian of the Maidan, however, is the army.

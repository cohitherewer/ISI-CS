                      Diary of an artist                    A master at narrating intimate stories through images, Subrata Chowdhury is an artist whose works can be seen and read like the diary of a man obsessed with his surroundings. Looking Around and at Myself, the ongoing second solo exhibition of his recent paintings, marks a sudden, sharp deviation from the serenity and mellowness of tone that characterised his earlier canvases. Combining daily realities with distant legends, whether ancient Hindu, Egyptian or turn-of-the-century European, they are often split to fit in a story with an anachronistic symbol, being held together only by a strange, unexplainable chemistry. The works on show unfold personal thoughts and episodes related to the heart; the artist himself figuring in his creations as a commentator of the discourse laid out over the entire spectrum of images. The paintings thus become a feast of philosophical conjectures, reflecting questions that we sometimes secretly ask ourselves.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Subrata Chowdhury When: Till May 3; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, 108 Southern Avenue

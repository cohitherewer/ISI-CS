                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Besu elections
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Student union elections were held on the troubled campus of the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) after three years on Tuesday.        
	Voting went off without a hitch, much to the relief of the university authorities. A police contingent led by senior officers, including additional police superintendent Sukesh Kumar Jain, kept vigil on the campus throughout the day. Niraj Kumar Singh, the Howrah superintendent of police, oversaw the security arrangements.        
	Besu registrar Biman Bandopadhyay put the voter turnout at 70 per cent. We have successfully conducted elections to 53 posts in the undergraduate union and 45 in the postgraduate union. The ballot boxes have been sealed and kept in the strongroom, he said.        
	Independent Consolidation, which had won 27 of the 40 seats at stake in the undergraduate union in the 2005 elections, said it would improve its performance this year. We are confident of getting a two-thirds majority, Rajarshi Dutta, a spokesperson for the union, said.        
	But Russel Aziz of the SFI claimed voting wasnt free and fair. We have already won five seats uncontested. Most of the undergraduate students are our supporters but Independent Consolidation members intimidated first-year students to vote for them. They turned the election into a farce.

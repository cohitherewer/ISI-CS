          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Shyam Das, aged two-and-a-half years, was refused treatment by a state-run hospital on Wednesday. After he died on Thursday, another state-run hospital refused to issue a death certificate.        
	Shyam, who was suffering from hepatitis, dehydration and malnutrition, was admitted to Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, at the Hazra crossing, on June 28.        
	His condition started deteriorating on Wednesday morning and the doctors referred him to NRS Medical College and Hospitals paediatric department.         
	The doctors at NRS refused to admit him even though he was almost unconscious. They said beds were not available, alleged Shyams father Shankar, who polishes shoes in front of Chittaranjan Seva Sadan.         
	The doctors gave him medicine and Shankar brought Shyam home on the footpath opposite Seva Sadan. His condition started deteriorating since Wednesday night and he was in severe pain, said Shankar.         
	Shyam had been suffering from hepatitis for more than a month. His condition was critical for the past week, his father said. We have no money to buy medicines. We approached the doctors at Seva Sadan when his condition was deteriorating, he said.        
	Around 9.30am the next day, Das was taken back to Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, where he was declared dead. They refused to issue a death certificate in spite of my pleadings, said the father.        
	SSKM Hospital issued the death certificate on Thursday afternoon after Shankar sought help from Bhowanipore police station.        
	The child was already dead when he was brought in and we could not give him any treatment. It was not possible to issue a death certificate, said an official at Chittaranjan Seva Sadan.        
	The authorities at NRS said they are investigating why the child was denied admission.

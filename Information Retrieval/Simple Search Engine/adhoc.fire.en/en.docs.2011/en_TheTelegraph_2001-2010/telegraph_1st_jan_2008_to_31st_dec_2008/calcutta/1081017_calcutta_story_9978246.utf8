          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A wannabe airhostess biding time as a ground operations employee at Calcutta airport died in a road accident while returning home from duty in an official pool car early on Thursday.        
	Madhumita Mallick, 23, was in a Tata Sumo along with five of her colleagues from Global Airport and Ground Handling Co. when the vehicle collided with a Matador at the crossing of Sarat Bose Road and Rashbehari Avenue around 2.25am.        
	A police team on night duty at a traffic kiosk took Madhumita and the other injured passengers to the nearby RK Mission Sevapratishthan, where she died a couple of hours later. Doctors said her colleagues were out of danger.        
	A ground employee of Deccan (now Kingfisher), Saheli Roy, had died following a similar accident on the EM Bypass on the night of June 14. But unlike in Madhumitas case, the policemen who were at the site had taken her to NRS Medical College and Hospital, 6km away, instead of Apollo Gleneagles, a minutes drive from there.        
	Madhumita, from Baripada in Orissa, had trained to be an airhostess but decided to work for the ground handling company until she got a break as a member of an airline cabin crew.         
	She had joined Global Airport and Ground Handling Co, which handles some operations for Air India, in November last year and stayed in a house in Garia as a paying guest.        
	Her brother Sudipto, who arrived from Orissa on Thursday evening to claim his sisters body, said their parents didnt know of her death. How will I convey the news to my parents? They have been told that Madhumita is in hospital after a minor accident.         
	Sudipto said Madhumita had always dreamt of becoming an airhostess. My father spent most of his savings on her training. Although she hadnt got the job she wanted, she was optimistic.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Vineet Goyel, said the driver of the Matador involved in the accident had been arrested and the vehicle impounded. Madhumita was seated behind the driver in the middle seat. The Matador crashed into the right door and she was the one who bore the brunt of the collision.        
	Sub-inspector Pijush Kundu and his team pulled out the passengers. There was a deep gash beside her right eye and bruises all over her face, an officer at Tollygunge police station said.

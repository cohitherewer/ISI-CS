	There is buoyancy in the air in India which is hard to miss for any visitor. From the little to the big, progress is evident. Living in the US your friends are of many nationalities, some who are American or others, who, while living in the country, still owe their identity to another. And they all want to know about India, the people, the changes, the sameness, et al. Pakistanis are amongst them. Given our common histories, many adda sessions are dedicated to discussing the politics and economies of India and Pakistan. One recurring theme that emerges is for Pakistan to progress, it has to stop looking at itself through the prism of India, to stop judging every step they take and compare if they are doing it better than India. And as I look around during this current visit to the homeland, I believe my Pakistani friends are right. 
    
	India is on the move, and its upwards. On a recent flight on one of the new domestic carriers, I was pleasantly surprised by the efficiency of the service and staff. In sharp contrast to the domestic airlines in America  where getting a tiny packet of peanuts and a smile from the stewardess on a four-hour flight is a miracle  these young women, barely out of their teens, were handling passengers with maturity, courtesy and professionalism. With the opening up of Indian skies, many private carriers are obviously providing opportunities to many smart, educated youngsters, who in turn do not shy away from hard work or long hours. It seems, for the Indian youth, employment opportunities have opened up unlike even 10 years back. From BPO and technology-driven work for America IT companies to careers in fashion-designing, NGOs and media, opportunities to excel are plenty. 
    
	The air of optimism is hard to miss. From advertising slogans on hoardings announcing creating a new India and investing in booming Asian economies, to Lead India programming on television, new flyovers and wi-fi enabled coffee shops, changes are all around. With rising incomes, what was unimaginable only a few years back, is no longer so. Friends are taking vacations to New Zealand and the UK and not just with their lives savings as they head towards retirement, but right in the middle of their work lives. Unlike my fathers generation, young executives are buying houses, cars and flat-screen TVs early into their careers, just like their Western counterparts. From American-style gyms with pumping club music to shopping in large departmental-cum-grocery stores, everyday life in India is changing rapidly and moving closer to lives in the West. 
    
	In spite of the glitter of progress in the cities, it is hard to ignore that growth is uneven. Are the changes purely cosmetic and yet to benefit Indias villages? Has development really reached them? Are more people educated, healthcare more accessible and more jobs available to fulfill ambitions of the rural poor? 
    
	But what remains unchanged is the Indian attitude. Despite poverty, apathetic governance, corrupt politicians and daily hardships  some overcome, while others remain  people remain positive. Power cuts, traffic snags, erratic water supply, long commutes to work, gaswallah wants extra payment to deliver the cylinder  the common man remains unflappable and no challenge is insurmountable. Work continues, Bollywood dance shows entertain, and guests are still welcome with open arms and full-hearted hospitality. The determination to live well and make the best of the circumstances remains constant. 
    
	With nuclear power, booming economy, a large work force and self-reliance the motto, has India finally arrived on the global scene? But then why does yet another thing remain unchanged  our attitude to constantly seek approval of the West? From Bollywood to the discovery of a lost handloom industry by an American designer, are we good enough only when the West gives the nod? Why is it that an American film like The Last Legion starring Aishwarya Rai that sank like a stone in the box-office in America is touted in India as Ms Rai taking over Hollywood? Why does driving an American-style SUV on cramped Indian roads mean comfort rather than discomfort? Why are we perpetually making tenuous connections to people with Indian-sounding names who frankly have very little to do with India, such as Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana Governor, just so that we can revel in some false pride-by-association? Why do actors who barely get a nod at home in spite of their strong body of work, need success in a foreign TV show such as the Oscars or Big Brother to become the talk of the town? 
    
	Isnt it time to stop looking at India through the prism of America? Maybe then we will really arrive.

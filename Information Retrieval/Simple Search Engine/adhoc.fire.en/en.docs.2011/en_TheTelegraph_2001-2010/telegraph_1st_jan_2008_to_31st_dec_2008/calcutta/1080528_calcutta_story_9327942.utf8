           Burning bright: Raj Bhavan looms in darkness against an illuminated skyline                           
	Over one lakh residents of Canal East Road are dependant on NGOs for basic medical services as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) refuses to do its duty (NGOs step in for shut civic clinic, April 26). It seems that the civic clinic in the area has a signboard proclaiming it so and nothing else.           
	The real shame is that work on the clinic began almost two decades back and has not been completed because of internal bickering in the civic body. A grant of over Rs 1 crore has been spent on removing the hurdles and not on infrastructure. How can the civic body justify the expenditure?           
	Residents of the area may well think that the civic body is ignoring them as they are poor. The local councillor owes them an answer. The CMC should seek help from the state government to make the clinic functional as soon as possible.           
	The infrastructure of the functioning civic clinics also need improvement. They are currently ill-equipped to deal with outbreak of common diseases.           
	Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
  Behala                       
	Apropos the report Charter for a Buddha and Gandhi, May 8, Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis decision to observe a two-hour power cut at Raj Bhavan to express solidarity with the average Calcuttan is a warm-hearted gesture. He is obviously disturbed by the prevailing political situation. The state administration must do something to stop the daily bloodletting over panchayat polls.             
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                               
	Apropos the report Raid nets cache of pirated text books, April 30, book piracy is only one of the many types of fraud carried out in West Bengal under the nose of the administration. Police can root out book piracy if it wants to but does not bother. Policemen make money out of such rackets. They conduct eyewash raids from time to time so that they are not questioned for the rest of the year.             
	Rathin Chatterjee, 
  Dum Dum                               
	Apropos the report Civic work cripples fire brigade hub, May 7, it is unbelievable that work on sewer lines has been going on in Mirza Ghalib Street for three months. The project should have been completed on a war footing. How could senior police officers and the mayor allow the work to drag? Hundreds of people can die because fire tenders at the fire services headquarters cannot rush to the site of a blaze.             
	Govinda Bakshi,
  Budge Budge                   
	Child abuse has cropped up as a serious problem (Suicide after child abuse slur, May 7). The charges levelled against the rector of the school were serious and his reaction to the allegation was tragic. The matter must be investigated seriously.             
	Aditi Barman, 
  Mahestala                   
	I carefully went through the letter of the assistant library and information officer of National Library, Ashok Nath, in the letters column on April 30. It was formal and evasive. Metro replies, on the contrary, appeared to be comprehensive. Nath should consider a bit of soul searching.             
	Metro replies to the letter by South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar on the same day seemed another suitable rebuff.           
	Nishith Mitra,
  Malancha, Mahinagar                   
	The report Book store boom in the offing, April 23, should be music to the ears of all book lovers in the city. Calcutta has a rich tradition of reading. Growth in the number of stores will make a wider variety of books accessible.             
	Sudipta Sur,
  Ramgarh                   
	Apropos the report Fair deal for ex-IAF staff, April 30, after my retirement from the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 1964, I landed a job as technical supervisor in HAL Kanpur. The organisation used to provide employment to a large number of Senior NCOs from the IAF after retirement. I am delighted to know that IAF employees will be provided air traffic control, engineering, flight navigation, finance, logistics management and security jobs. I can vouch for the intensive training the IAF provides to ground technicians, pilots, navigators and technical, finance and logistics officers.             
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park                   
	There is no need to install closed-circuit cameras at crossings to find out who violates traffic rules. Police know very well that autorickshaws, cycles and cycle vans are to blame in most cases. These never stop before the stop line, violate the red light and cause several mishaps. But no one takes any action against them.             
	Rajesh Bhurat,
  Salt Lake                   
	Apropos the report No dowry clause in admission rules, April 26, the drive by Rammohan Mission to root out dowry must be appreciated. This social evil reduces marriage to a financial contract between a man and a woman. It is no better than slavery. All educational institutions in the country should consider taking similar steps.             
	Anushri Mondal,

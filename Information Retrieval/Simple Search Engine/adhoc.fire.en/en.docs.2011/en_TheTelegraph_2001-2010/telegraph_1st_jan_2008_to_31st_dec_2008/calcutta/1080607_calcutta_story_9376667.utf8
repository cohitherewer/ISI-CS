                Pramita Mallick        Devout offering                    Tagores appeal to the Bengali psyche is an enduring one. His music and poetry, with their message of love, compassion and tolerance, continue to hold sway over our hearts even to this day. Hosted by Bhavna Records and Cassettes, this evenings programme presents a harmonious collage of music, reading and dance based on Tagores poem Pujarini. Based on a story in The Sanskrit Buddhist Literature of Nepal, compiled by Rajendralal Mitra, it tells a simple tale of unconditional love, devotion and sacrifice. Adorning the story with dramatic and emotional embellishments, Tagore has elevated the poem to heights of exceptional lyrical eloquence. Participants: Pramita Mallick (reading and songs) and Priti Patel (dance). The programme will be preceded by a solo recital of Tagore songs (on Puja, Prem and Prakriti) by Pramita Mallick.                    Event: Programme of reading, song and dance based on Tagores Pujarini

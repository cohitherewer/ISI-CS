                                                                                                               Landlord accused of theft
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Cash and jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh were burgled from the rented flat of a businessman in New Alipore on Saturday night.         
	Murarilal Saraogi, the businessman, has accused his landlord of plotting the burglary, and trying to kill him and his family members.         
	Saraogi stated in his police complaint that he and his family members returned home from a relatives house around 10.30pm to find the main door open. The valuables missing from two almirahs.        
	The businessman claimed that the LPG pipe from the cylinder had been pulled out of the stove. It was an attempt to kill us because we refused to vacate the flat, said Saraogi.         
	Sachin Pal, the landlord, said the allegations were baseless. I live on the top-floor of the four-storey building, while Saraogis apartment is on the second floor. A fire in their flat may also kill me, my wife and our three daughters.        
	Saraogi said he has been living in the flat for 27 years. I was asked to vacate the flat 20 years ago. I filed a case and now pay rent to the court.        
	Police are probing the case.

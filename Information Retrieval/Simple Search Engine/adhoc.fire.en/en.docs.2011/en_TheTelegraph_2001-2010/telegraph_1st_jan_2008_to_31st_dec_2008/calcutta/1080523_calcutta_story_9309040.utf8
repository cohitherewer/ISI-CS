                      Through the lens, passionately                    The fight to certify photography as a fine art has been among the mediums dominant philosophical preoccupations since its inception. Photographys legitimacy as an art form was challenged by artists and critics, who seized upon the mechanical and chemical aspects of the photographic process as proof that photography was, at best, a craft. Perhaps because so many painters came to rely so heavily on the photograph as a source of imagery, they insisted that photography could only be a handmaiden to the arts. To prove that photography was indeed an art, photographers at first imitated the painting of the time. Enormous popularity was achieved by such photographers as O. J. Rejlander and Henry Peach Robinson, who created sentimental genre scenes by printing from multiple negatives. Julia Margaret Cameron blurred her images to achieve a painterly softness of line, creating a series of remarkably powerful soft-focus portraits of her celebrated friends. P.H. Emerson was the first to recognise the importance of the work of Alfred Stieglitz, who battled for photographys place among the arts during the first part of the 20th century. Since then, there has been no looking back for lensmen who re-interpret the visual world in a pictorial manner. The current exhibition features a group of enthusiastic and talented art pictorialist whose works demand attention for their aesthetic quality as well as high degree of technical finesse.

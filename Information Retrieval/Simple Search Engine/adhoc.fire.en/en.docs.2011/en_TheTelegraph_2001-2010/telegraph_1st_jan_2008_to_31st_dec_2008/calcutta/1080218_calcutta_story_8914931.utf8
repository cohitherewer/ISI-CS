                                                                                                               Theres a scare over Salt Lake
  - Blame game dominates citizen-administration interface in township          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Thirteen robberies in 47 days.        
	Salt Lakes alarming crime count in 2008 prompted an interface on Sunday between those residing in the township and those responsible for their safekeeping. On the table were the prime problem points.        
	Hours after a gang of robbers broke into FD 118 on Saturday evening and looted cash and jewellery, over 300 members of Salt Lake block associations arrived at the Poura Bhavan auditorium to attend a citizens convention chaired by Bidhannagar municipal chairman Biswajiban Majumdar.        
	From lack of cop cover at exit-entry points to mushrooming of unauthorised constructions, from dark lanes to paucity of police patrol  the scare over Salt Lake was palpable throughout the two-hour-long meeting. As was the failure of the municipal authorities and the police to safeguard the township.        
	In a township of 300,000 residents, there are only 600 police personnel, out of whom 200 are busy with VIP security. How can crime in Salt Lake be curbed? demanded U.K. Basak of BJ Block.        
	Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police of North 24 Parganas, all but lobbed the security ball into the residents court, stressing the need for greater citizen participation in policing. We have issued an information and suggestion form, along with a list of things to do (see box). Information from residents and meetings with block associations are a must, he said.        
	The blame game dominated the co-ordination meeting. Basab Aich, the secretary of Bidhannagar Salt Lake Welfare Association, summed up the mood of residents at the receiving end of security lapses: It is time the police looked at their own faults and tried to rectify them before telling us what to do.        
	Block associations pointed at the crime graph  27 cases in October, 19 in November, 13 in December  to highlight the breakdown of law and order.

  - Institute dedicates digital art expo to its former graphics design teacher          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Some of the digital art work and the Rizwanur photographs that will be on display at the exposition. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Far removed from the sordid saga of crime and punishment unfolding in interrogation chambers and courts, some classrooms are coming alive to the sights and sounds of To Sir With Love.        
	For the students of Rizwanur Rahman at Arena Multimedias Chowringhee centre are paying a tribute to their beloved graphics design teacher by dedicating the institutes sixth annual digital art exposition to his unfinished work.        
	The annual expo, FX 2008, will be held on March 1 and 2 at the Indian Museum Asutosh Birth Centenary Hall and will display the digital art works of 89 students, alongside a special section dedicated to Rizwan Sir. A collage of his photographs will be on display in the Rizwan Corner, along with four of his favourite projects that he worked on.        
	Rizwanur was the one who had booked the premises for FX 2008 last summer and started preparations well in advance. After his death on September 21, his students and colleagues decided to dedicate FX 2008 to his memory.        
	Dedicating this expo is the best salute we could give to Sir for the way he had influenced us all, said Sayanti Ghosh, 23, who was taught by Rizwanur for four months before the tragedy.  
	For Arindam Dutta, 25, FX 2008 will be an emotional affair.  
	 ldquo;Last year, I was a student of Rizwan Sir and this year I have had to step into his shoes as an instructor. I miss him every step of the way.... He taught us how to manage things with a cool head even in the toughest of situations. I will always be grateful to him for that valuable lesson in life, rdquo; he said on the eve of the exhibition.  
	 From works of abstract art to pictures of Ganesha made by the students will be up for sale. The proceeds will go to the Ananda Niketan Home in south Calcutta. Only Rizwanur rsquo;s works will not be for sale.  
	 ldquo;Rizwanur was deeply involved in the whole process of the annual expo ever since he joined the institute in 2004. In his absence we decided to dedicate the expo, which had always been his pet project, to his memory, rdquo; said Sujoy Ghosh, a colleague of Rizwan at the 60A Chowringhee Road institute.  
	 ldquo;He was involved in every aspect of the expo mdash; right from booking of the venue to guiding students to resizing, framing and arranging the display, rdquo; added Ghosh.  
	 While Rizwanur rsquo;s mother Kishwar Jahan and brother Rukbanur are expected to visit the expo on Sunday, no invite has been sent out to Arena ex-student Priyanka Todi.

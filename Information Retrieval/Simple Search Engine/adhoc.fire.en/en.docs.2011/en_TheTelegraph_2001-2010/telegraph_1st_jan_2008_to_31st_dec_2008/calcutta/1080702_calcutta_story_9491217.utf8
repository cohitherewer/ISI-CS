                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cabs make a killing in fare date mix-up
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Hundreds of taxi passengers on Tuesday paid their fares according to the new rate, though it comes into effect on July 11.         
	Not all the taxi drivers who charged the enhanced rate were taking advantage of the situation  the government announced on June 23 that the hike would be implemented on July 1. Many were unaware that the date was pushed back on Monday.         
	Passengers, too, were caught off guard. Like Kanishka Chakrabarty, a senior executive in a market research firm who took a taxi from the Hazra crossing to Gangulybagan.        
	The meter showed Rs 44 but the driver demanded Rs 90. At the current rate, the fare should have been Rs 81.20. He, however, told me that the fare had gone up from today, said Chakrabarty.         
	The driver even produced a revised rate card and insisted he be paid the extra amount.         
	I didnt know that the date had been pushed back. I even bought a new fare chart yesterday. I learnt about the new date from some passengers, said another taxi driver, who stopped charging extra halfway through the day.         
	The government is to be blamed for the confusion, said Manab Mukerjee, a 57-year-old resident of Phoolbagan, who knew that the hike would come into effect on July 11 but had to give in to a taxi drivers demand for payment according to the new rate.         
	The transport department sees no cause for confusion. Any attempt to charge the new fare before July 11 is illegal, stated transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.         
	Bimal Guha, the president of the Bengal Taxi Association, also ruled out the possibility of confusion and put the blame on rogue taxi drivers.         
	The drivers charging extra are thieves and I am ashamed of their behaviour. We have not issued the new fare chart. They are using fudged charts, which are sold at traffic lights for Rs 5. Police must take action against them, said Guha.         
	Deputy commissioner (traffic) Manoj Verma said drivers could be fined if passengers complained. If someone is in a hurry, he or she can call our helpline or email a complaint.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta University (CU) is exploring ways to prune its list of affiliated colleges further and focus on improving the quality of education and research.         
	The university will host a meeting of more than 30 vice-chancellors and pro vice-chancellors from the eastern states on October 31 to discuss reforms. The most important point on the agenda is the proposal to restrict the number of colleges affiliated to a university.        
	Based on the University Grants Commission (UGC)s recommendation that the number of colleges affiliated to universities be cut down, the state government set up West Bengal State University in North 24-Parganas this year to reduce the pressure on CU. The affiliation of 57 colleges on the northern fringes of Calcutta were transferred from CU to the new university.        
	The UGC recently held a meeting in Delhi where vice-chancellors stressed the need to gradually reduce the size of all universities and create non-affiliating universities.        
	The CU authorities had objected to the drastic reduction in the number of its affiliated colleges and urged the UGC to organise meetings among university heads to discuss the issue in detail.        
	This prompted the UGC to direct CU to organise the October 31 meeting. The CU authorities will submit a report on it to the UGC.        
	We will explore ways to improve the quality of education offered by universities with affiliated colleges, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das about the meeting.        
	Universities should be hubs of research. If we have to focus on research, we will have to reduce our workload by lowering the number of colleges, said a senior CU official.        
	But in order to ensure growth of the gross enrolment ratio in higher education without diluting the academic standard, universities like Calcutta University must have affiliated colleges, added the official.        
	We need to examine whether small universities and autonomous colleges can enable us to increase the gross enrolment ratio, said a senior teacher in a Calcutta college.         
	The Centres target is to increase the national-level gross enrolment ratio in higher education from 10 to 15 per cent by 2015. In Bengal, the ratio is currently around seven per cent.

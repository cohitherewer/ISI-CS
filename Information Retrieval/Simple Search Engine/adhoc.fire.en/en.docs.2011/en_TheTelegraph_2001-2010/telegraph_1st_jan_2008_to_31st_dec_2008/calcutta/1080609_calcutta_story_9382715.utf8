	Supporters of Matangini Mahila Samity on Sunday lodged a complaint against the policemen who tried to raid its office without a warrant and three members of the CPMs womens wing in the locality.         
	The five women, who were in the Friends Row room when the police turned up on Saturday morning in search of Maoists, were accompanied to East Jadavpur police station by 200 students of Jadavpur University (JU).        
	The women  two of whom live in the rented room  said in their complaint that the police not only tried to force their way into room but also kept them confined for over four hours and harassed them.        
	Debolina Chakraborty, the secretary of the Samity, said Asima Pal, Khana Saha and Sutapa Bhattacharya of the CPMs local mahila committee also threatened them and kept them confined. The three have been named in the complaint.         
	The students held a street-corner meeting in the locality to protest against harassment by CPM cadres before lodging the complaint. The landlady of the house also accompanied the five girls, one of whom studies at JU, while another is an alumnus.        
	The Samity was formed by students of Jadavpur University and Presidency College after March 14 shooting in Nandigram to protect women from CPM atrocities in the trouble-torn area. The organisation is also active in Singur. Though the organisation is not affiliated to CPI (Maoists), it is known to be sympathetic to the Naxalite outfit.        
	We wanted to search the room because we had information that anti-national documents were kept there. The warrant reached us too late. They may have shifted the documents by then, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar.

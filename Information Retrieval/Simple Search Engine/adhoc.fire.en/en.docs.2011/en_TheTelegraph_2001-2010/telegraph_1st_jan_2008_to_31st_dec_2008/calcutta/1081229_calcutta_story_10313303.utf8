          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 26-year-old man who was allegedly beaten up by a mob after being caught trying to steal a rickshaw in Howrahs Belgachhia on Saturday night died in police custody on Sunday morning.        
	An assistant sub-inspector and a constable were suspended for not arranging for Biswanath Dass treatment in the Liluah police station lock-up. The additional superintendent of police (town), Howrah, will probe the incident.        
	Residents denied that Das, who lived in Kunjapara, was beaten up. They claimed that he was handed over to the police after being slapped a few times.        
	Dass sister Anjana James, 23, said: My brother was a thief. We were unhappy with him. But we never thought he would be killed by the police.        
	The family members have not claimed the body.        
	Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police, said: Biswanath Das was caught stealing from a factory. We have information that a mob beat him up. He was handed over to the police around 4.30am. Assistant sub-inspector Biswanath Das Bairagya and constable Siddheswar Ghosh have been suspended for dereliction of duty.        
	He added: I have asked the additional superintendent (town) to conduct an inquiry into the death and submit a report to me.        
	An officer of the police station said Das was seriously injured when he was handed over to the cops. Around 8am, his condition deteriorated. We took him to TL Jaiswal Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	A resident of the area said Das was beaten up but not to the extent of causing death. We suspect that he died because of police torture in the lock-up. The cops are now trying to pass the buck by blaming us.        
	A magisterial inquest was held into the death on Sunday afternoon. The post-mortem on Monday will be videographed.

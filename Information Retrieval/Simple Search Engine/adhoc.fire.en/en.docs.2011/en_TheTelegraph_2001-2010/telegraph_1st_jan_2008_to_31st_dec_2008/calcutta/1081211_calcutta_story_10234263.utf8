The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Panel for fatal accident charge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Panel for fatal accident charge

	A seven-member panel will be set up to decide whether drivers responsible for fatal mishaps should be charged with a non-bailable offence punishable with life imprisonment, home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said on Wednesday.        
	The announcement came on a day private buses and minibuses stayed off the road to protest the governments decision to book killer drivers under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). Such drivers were earlier booked under Section 304A (causing death due to negligence), which is bailable.        
	On Wednesday, Chakrabarti met leaders of the Citu-backed West Bengal Road Transport Workers Federation, which had called the day-long strike.         
	The leaders claimed that drivers were not always responsible for accidents. Bad roads and other factors, too, are to be blamed.        
	I told the leaders that a panel would be set up to look into the matter. After the assurance, they promised to withdraw the strike, the home secretary said.        
	Federation leader Rajdeo Goala said: We want to see how the committee works.        
	The panel will be headed by a special secretary in the home department and will comprise representatives of the judiciary, transport department, police, bus owners and the West Bengal Road Transport Workers Federation. The report will be submitted in eight weeks.        
	On Wednesday, office-goers suffered the most, crowding into state buses and hanging from the doors. Autorickshaws and taxi drivers charged more than the usual fare on busy routes.         
	Metro Railway saw a 23 per cent rise in footfall, with ticket queues reaching the top of the staircase at some stations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rail disruptions snap patients southern lifeline 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rail disruptions snap patients southern lifeline 
  - Some trains restored but many people forced to reschedule appointments or fly to destinations          SANJAY MANDAL                                                   
	Patients headed south for treatment are missing appointments with their doctors because trains that were cancelled after floods last month are still off the rail roster or irregular.         
	Cancer sufferer Jyotirmoy Mukherjee (name changed on request) was supposed to see an oncologist at Christian Medical College in Vellore last week, but could not go because the Shalimar-Trivandram Express was cancelled. Although the train was restored on Sunday, Mukherjee has yet to get a confirmed berth.        
	Trains bound for Kanyakumari, Trivandrum, Trichi and Nagercoil from Shalimar and Howrah were restored, too, but tickets are hard to come by.        
	The spate of cancellations began on June 17, when floods breached tracks at several places between Kharagpur and Bhadrak in Orissa. A bridge over the Keleghai, between Bhakrabad and Narayangarh stations in South Eastern Railways Kharagpur section, was washed away.        
	Since then, patients like Mukherjee have suffered the most. Until two weeks ago, the number of patients coming to our hospital from Bengal was 20 per cent less than normal, said Lionel Gnanaraj, the medical superintendent of Christian Medical College.         
	Of the 4,500 patients who consult doctors in the institutions outpatient department every day, as many as 1,000 are from Bengal. The preferred rail route to Vellore is through Bangalore, Chennai or Trivandrum. Rail communication has improved in the past couple of weeks but there are still problems, Gnanaraj said.        
	The Howrah-Yeshwantpur Express and the Howrah-Hyderabad Falaknama Express are being diverted, resulting in the trains being delayed by four to six hours. Another Howrah-Hyderabad train, the East Coast Express, is being terminated in Bhadrak.        
	Cardiac surgeon Devi Shetty, whose Narayana Hrudalaya in Bangalore receives hundreds of patients from the state every week, said he knew people who could not afford to buy air tickets being forced to do so because they required emergency medical attention. Many have had to sell land to buy air tickets.         
	Soumitra Majumdar, South Eastern Railways deputy chief commercial manager of customer interaction, said Rs 2 crore was being spent on a temporary bridge to restore normality. But sources said it would take another three months for all south-bound trains to run normally.

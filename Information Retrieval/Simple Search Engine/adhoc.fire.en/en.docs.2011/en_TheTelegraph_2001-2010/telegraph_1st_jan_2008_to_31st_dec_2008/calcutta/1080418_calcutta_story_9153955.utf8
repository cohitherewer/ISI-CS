                      Paradox of Indian society                          Johann Rousselot discovered India when he was doing press reportages. Fascinated by the country, he prolonged his stay, immersing himself in searching, analysing and comprehending the obvious, distinct and distressing disparities between the much-hyped sophisticated, new image of the country and its real state. Riding his motorbike  a magnificent black Royal Enfield Bullet  this sharp and dauntless observer travelled smoothly from the chic nightclubs of Colaba, through the building sites of the new towns, to the territories of the Adivasi in Chhatisgarh. India Shining, India Crying  A Tale of Contemporary India, the ongoing exhibition of his photographs, assembles a collection of precise and well-composed images from his long, painstaking exploration of the different urban, rural and social landscapes of Indian society. Generosity of spirit, engagement and derision frequently vie for pride of place in these frank, forthright and often, candid images, clearly bringing out the conflicts and imbalances in the standards of life of the citizens of this country. Hosted by The French Embassy in India, Alliance Franaise du Bengale and Bose Pacia, Calcutta.

                                                                                                               Tortured girl takes pesticide
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 22-year-old girl attempted suicide on Monday night, allegedly after being tortured by her brother and his wife.        
	The Kalikapur resident consumed pesticide and was found unconscious on the road by neighbours.         
	She was taken to Ruby General Hospital, where doctors pumped out the poison and put her on oxygen.        
	She will take a few days to recover, said S.B. Purkayastha, the chief executive officer of the hospital.        
	After regaining her consciousness, the employee of Kasba Industrial Estate said: A senior colleague used to escort me home every day after some local youths passed lewd comments at me while I was returning from work. But my brother did not like it.        
	She alleged that the couple often assaulted her for bringing along the colleague.        
	On Monday evening, they threw me out of the house after assaulting me. When I tried to enter the house, my brother kept beating me till I lost consciousness, the girl recalled. She later tried to kill herself.         
	The hospital authorities alleged Tiljala police station was informed about the suicide bid but no step has been taken to identify the family members.         
	When we went to the hospital on Monday night, the girl was not in a position to speak. We will speak to her on Wednesday and identify the family members, said an officer.

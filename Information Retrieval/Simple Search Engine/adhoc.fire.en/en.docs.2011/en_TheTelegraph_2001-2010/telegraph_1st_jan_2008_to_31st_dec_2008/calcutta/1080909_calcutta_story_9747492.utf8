The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bumpy ride to Buddha pride 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bumpy ride to Buddha pride 
          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA AND TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                            
	The road to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees showpiece tech town is not an easy one. Pockmarked with craters and muddy with puddles, a drive to office and back in Sector V is often more tedious than the days work. After a 30-minute bumpy ride in and around Sector V, Metro picked out four stretches that are most in need of repairs         
	Nicco Park to Wipro        
	What: The 1.5 km stretch between Nicco Park and Wipro is the worst affected, with nearly two-thirds of the road blocked by the construction of a flyover. The space left  hardly four metres  is unable to handle the 7,500 cars that ply daily. It is also heavily damaged because of the ongoing construction and the rains.         
	There are deep craters after every few steps. On the rest of the road, the bitumen has come off, making the surface uneven.        
	Motorists woes: Its a torment going through the stretch before I turn left from the Wipro crossing to reach my workplace. The roads in and around Sector V have deteriorated steadily over the last few months, said Kalyan Basu, an employee of a multinational bank who drives daily to his office near Karunamoyee.        
	Wipro crossing to College More        
	What: Rain has eroded the surface layer of a one-and-half km stretch here. Stone chips are scattered all over, making it difficult for motorists to keep control over their vehicles. At many places potholes and craters have developed on the road. A number of important buildings like the Millennium City, IBM and Videocon Park are situated off this stretch.         
	Motorists woes: In the last few weeks, my motorcycle skidded off the road twice while I was trying to dodge loose stone chips and puddles, said Paramjeet Sahni, an employee of Desconsoft.        
	Between Infinity building and Technopolis        
	What: Huge craters line both lanes of the road, especially in front of Technopolis, PTI building, Webel crossing and the Institute of Engineering and Management.         
	Certain portions of the road that had been dug up have not been filled up properly, making the surface uneven.         
	Peoples woes: Recently I was travelling in a rickshaw near Technopolis when it hit a big pothole and overturned. I injured my elbow and knees, said Shobita Saha, a TCS employee.         
	In front of SDF Building        
	What: It is difficult to find even one smooth stretch of road in front of SDF building. Some of the potholes here are as deep as half feet. These craters turn into puddles after every shower. Vehicles plying on this road have to keep swerving to avoid getting stuck in the numerous potholes.         
	According to those working in SDF building, no repair work has been carried out on this stretch in the last four years, though many complaints have been lodged with the Nabadiganta Industrial Authority.        
	Pedestrians woes: I tripped and almost fell on my face behind the Infinity building on Monday. I take these roads everyday and I can tell you from experience, pedestrians can get seriously hurt because of the damaged roads in Sector V, said Samrat Dutta, a student of business management.               
	Official version: The rains have just got over. Everyone knows the rains cause substantial damage to roads every year. Many buildings are being constructed in Sector V. Large-scale construction necessitates the movement of heavy carriers, which is bound to add to the damage. Moreover, the construction of a flyover at the Wipro intersection is also damaging the roads. We have been carrying out repairs almost every night for the last few months, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority.

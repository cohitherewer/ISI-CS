                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sleuth wealth crore-plus
        A STAFF REPORTER                                                      CBI sleuth Partha Sarathi Bose		    
	The CBI officer arrested on bribery charge had amassed over Rs 1 crore in property and investments during his 22 years in service, the agency said on Monday.        
	The search of Partha Sarathi Boses house revealed that his assets were disproportionate to his known sources of income. He failed to explain how he came to own so much property, a CBI official said on Monday.        
	A deputy superintendent who was awarded the police medal in 2006 for meritorious service, Bose was arrested in Ultadanga on Sunday afternoon while he was allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000 from a Guwahati-based transport operator.        
	According to the agency, Bose had threatened to implicate the operator, Avtar Singh, in a murder case if he did not pay up.        
	Bose was produced in Barasat court on Monday and was given a days transit remand for the CBI to take him to Delhi.        
	The officer has been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. If found guilty, he will have to spend at least five years in jail, said a CBI official.        
	Sleuths claimed to have seized Rs 13.79 lakh from Boses Ultadanga flat that they valued at Rs 10.5 lakh. He has also deposited Rs 33.18 lakh to monthly income scheme accounts in 12 post offices and invested around Rs 35.36 lakh in fixed deposits with various banks, said an officer who is investigating the case.        
	He has a locker in the Phoolbagan branch of a nationalised bank, where he has kept the jewellery. We are yet to ascertain the value of the jewellery. Going by the market rate of the ornaments, it seems his assets are worth more than Rs 1 crore, the official added.        
	Bose had probed several high-profile cases, such as the rape and murder of Singur girl Tapasi Malik in 2006 and the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medallion from Visva-Bharati university in 2004.        
	Following his arrest, the Visva-Bharati authorities are demanding a fresh probe into the medallion theft case.        
	The officer assigned with the probe was corrupt. The CBI should re-investigate the case, said university registrar Moni Mukut.        
	The arrest has also provided an opportunity to the CPM to voice doubts about the probe in the Tapasi case, that led to the conviction of one of its leaders, Surhid Dutta.        
	Given his record of moral integrity, its clear what kind of investigation he had conducted, said party state secretary Biman Bose.

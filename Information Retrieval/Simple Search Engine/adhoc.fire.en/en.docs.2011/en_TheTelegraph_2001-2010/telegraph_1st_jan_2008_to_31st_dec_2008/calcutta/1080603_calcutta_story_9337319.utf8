                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Spate of enquiries puts school on growth path
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The students of the American School in the city                                  
	The American School Kolkata, flagged off on the US consulate premises last August, hopes to reach a critical mass of students soon, prompting a shift to a bigger campus.        
	We started small, with just five children in elementary school, but a flood of enquiries from parents since has given us the belief that we could look at expanding and setting up a middle school on a leased property, the outgoing US consul-general in Calcutta, Henry Jardine, tells Metro.        
	For the time being, our one-hall premises at 5/1 Ho Chi Minh Sarani suffices for the kids, but once we take in more students and look at rolling out a middle school, we would obviously need a larger campus, points out head teacher Kathleen Dickinson Jardine, the consul-generals wife.        
	The school offers an American curriculum programme for the elementary grades  kindergarten to sixth grade  for American and international students temporarily living in India.        
	Jardine said the enrolment is likely to go up with more American business coming to town (the number of members of the American Chamber of Commerce is up from seven to 35 in two years) and more staff joining the US consulate.        
	Kathleen sees another reason for the projected rise in the student count. Calcuttans focussed on sending their children to the US for higher education will opt for The American School, she said.        
	Kathleen will hand over charge to Laura Miller as head teacher for the 2008-09 session.         
	While the temporary plan is to relocate to a rented place, the American School management is keen to acquire land and set up its own campus. The campus will incorporate a swimming pool, indoor and outdoor sports facilities, gymnasium, library, science and computer labs.        
	In Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, the American School started small like here, but while Mumbai is now looking for a second campus with 700-plus students, Chennai has close to 400 students already, says Jardine.        
	The American School was set up with the support of the US state departments office of overseas schools, the US embassy in New Delhi and the American Embassy School, Delhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Speed guns in fast lanes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Speed guns in fast lanes
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Cops will now be armed with speed guns to curb rash driving on the city outskirts. Four speed guns will soon be handed over to the police in Howrah and North and South 24-Parganas.        
	The electronic eyes, which capture pictures of the number plates of speeding vehicles, will be used on four accident-prone stretches  Kona Expressway, VIP Road, Diamond Harbour Road and EM Bypass.        
	We will begin checking the speed of vehicles in a couple of months, said D.P. Tarenia, the inspector-general of police (traffic). The quantum of penalty is yet to be decided.        
	We have no way of restricting speed and booking reckless drivers, Tarenia said. Cops feel speed guns will help them take action against motorists flouting traffic rules.         
	According to police, Kona Expressway and VIP Road are the most mishap-prone stretches. The arteries have witnessed a series of mishaps in the past few months. The North 24-Parganas police fixed a speed limit of 40 km per hour but they dont have the means to identify offending vehicles, said Tarenia.        
	The police will also keep an eye on the EM Bypass stretch between Science City and Kamalgaji. People have a tendency to drive fast on this stretch, leading to mishaps. We will fix a speed limit and then crack down on over-speeding vehicles, said an officer of the traffic department.        
	To rein in rogue drivers, Tarenia is also planning to ask the police superintendents of Howrah, North and South 24-Parganas to take stern action against errant drivers. The driving licences will be suspended for six months for injuring a person and cancelled if a person is killed, he said.

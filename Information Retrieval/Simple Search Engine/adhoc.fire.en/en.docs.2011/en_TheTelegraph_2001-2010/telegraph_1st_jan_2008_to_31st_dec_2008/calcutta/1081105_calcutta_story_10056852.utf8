                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1000 more seats in masters courses
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The site of the proposed campus of West Bengal State University                                  
	West Bengal State University, North 24-Parganas, is set to introduce masters courses in 32 subjects next year, increasing the number of postgraduate seats by about 1,000.        
	We have set a target of launching 32 postgraduate courses, spanning arts, science and commerce streams, by January 15, said Ashoke Ranjan Thakur, the vice-chancellor of West Bengal State University. The campus of the new university is being built in Barasat.        
	Students of the 57 colleges on the northern fringes of the city whose affiliations were transferred from Calcutta University (CU) to our university will benefit from the launch of the courses. Addition of the 1,000-odd postgraduate seats will also help students graduating from CU colleges, he added.        
	College teachers in the city feel the extra seats will allow students who just about scored first division or high second division marks to pursue postgraduation.         
	The number of postgraduate seats in CU, particularly in the science subjects, is inadequate considering the number of students who graduate. In several subjects, postgraduate seats are taken only by those who score first class, said a teacher in a south Calcutta college.        
	There are nearly 5,550 seats in MA, M.Sc and M.Com courses in CU. Nearly 39,000 students cleared the undergraduate examinations this year. About 4,000 of them scored first class.        
	The student allotted the last seat in CUs M.Sc pure chemistry course this year had scored more than 65 per cent in B.Sc. In Botany, too, 65 per cent was the cut-off for the M.Sc course in CU.        
	According to Thakur, more than 4,500 candidates have applied for the 161 full-time teaching posts for the postgraduate courses at West Bengal State University. The selection process will start soon.        
	The first phase of construction of the university building in Nilgunj, off Barasat-Barrackpore Road, is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year.         
	The university is currently functioning out of a temporary office on the Barasat Government College premises.

          A STAFF REPORTER      
	The parents of a two-and-a-half-years-old thalassaemic boy complained to police on Monday that they were assaulted by doctors and nurses of National College and Hospital.         
	Sanjay Das, a resident of Garden Reach, and his wife Rupa took their son Rimo to the hospital for blood transfusion. Some junior doctors allegedly could not find a vein to draw blood from the boy despite repeated attempts. When I protested, the doctors abused me verbally, said Sanjay.        
	When the couple took Rimo to the paediatric ward for admission, doctors and nurses there first told them there was no bed and then offered one that had no fan, light or table to keep food or medicine.        
	After Sanjay demanded that his son be admitted in one of the two beds that were about to be vacated, he was threatened and manhandled.        
	S.K. Saha, the medical superintendent of the hospital, denied the allegations.        
	The deputy commissioner of police (south division), Rajesh Subarna, said the couples complaint was being investigated.

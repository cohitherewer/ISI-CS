										      ONTHESPOT - VIP MARKET, KANKURGACHHI                            (Top) The building got a fresh coat of paint this year; most shops have closed down in VIP Market, Kankurgachhi. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta                                
	The commercial hub of Kankurgachhi  a short stretch of CIT Road  is a study in contrast. While the brightly lit Pantaloons sees a steady stream of customers strolling out with loaded bags, VIP Market, located across the road, is in a deep slumber. Very few people walk into this shabby market, where downed shutters outnumber open shops.         
	About 200 of the 279 shops have shut down since the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) opened the commercial complex back in the 1980s. A fresh coat of paint applied on the facade by the CMC this year has been unable to lift the gloom.        
	The shops that lost the battle for survival bore the brunt of civic callousness and lack of interest.        
	When people see closed shops, they dont feel like walking into the market. So, few people reach my store which is at one end of the building. They also feel that the empty market may not be safe, said Barun Dey, who runs a garment shop in the basement.        
	Most of the basement shops have been turned into offices of courier companies and travel agents. The rest are closed.         
	The CMC had opened the VIP Market  hailing it as the Maniktala Kankurgachhi Commercial Complex  with the intention of catering to the adjoining areas of Salt Lake, VIP Road, Maniktala and Beleghata. The ambitious plan comprised a market complex, a cinema hall, an auditorium, office spaces, a restaurant and lodging facilities, spread across a three-storey building with a basement and a separate block of 11 floors.         
	But the CMC built only the basement and the ground and first floors and gave the go-ahead for the commercial complex (consisting of garment, shoe, jewellery, furnishings and electronic gadget shops).        
	Twenty years on, the project lies unfinished and the shopkeepers feel cheated.         
	We had bid for shop space at VIP Market after the CMC showed us the project plan. We thought it would be a very profitable venture. The civic body had planned elevators, chilled water and central air-conditioning, but nothing has been done, rued shopkeeper Dinesh Swaika.         
	The CMC is now renovating an unused room on the second floor to open its citizen service centre.        
	The revamp holds out little hope for the shopkeepers. We have requested the CMC several times to finish the project but to no avail. Now they are developing a portion of the market for their own use, alleged Rabindranath Koley, the secretary of VIP Market Association.         
	Though Pantaloons and City Centre have lured away a chunk of their customers, the shopkeepers feel that the dark and dank look of the market has contributed to the decrease in footfall in the past few years.         
	The corridors are stained with spit, toilets stink, railings have rusted and the window panes are broken. Even the lighting is insufficient.         
	The CMC charges a maintenance fee but does little for the markets upkeep apart from sweeping the floors once a day, said Koley.

	I know that the market is in a bad shape and I have brought the matter to the notice of the CMC but they are not bothered. Besides, the shopkeepers havent taken any initiative to sit with me for discussions, said Sunanda Guha, the Congress councillor of ward No. 31.

	We are renovating the building to open the citizen service centre for the benefit of the people. All that could not be completed in the first phase of the project, like the cinema hall and the restaurant, have been incorporated in the second phase. Its in the process and will happen, said Faiyaz Ahmad Khan, the mayoral council member (information and public relations).

                Tushar Kanti Biswas, 55, a motor mechanic from Bagula, in Nadia, died on the way to hospital after suffering a heart attack on Monday evening. The victim was being rushed to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital by his colleagues from a garage on BT Road, where he worked. The taxi they hired, however, got caught in a traffic jam during the storm and Biswas died around 10pm. The garage employees panicked on seeing policemen on the road ahead, since they had a body in the car. They decided to leave the body in front of a nursing home and fetch garage-owner Gurdeep Singh. The body was found 15 minutes later. Police informed the relatives of the deceased. No one was arrested since no complaint was lodged.

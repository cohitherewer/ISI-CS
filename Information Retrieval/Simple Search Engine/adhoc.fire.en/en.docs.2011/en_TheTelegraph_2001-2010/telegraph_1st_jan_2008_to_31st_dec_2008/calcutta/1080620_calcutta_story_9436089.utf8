	Four youths were arrested in Belgachhia on Thursday on charges of committing robberies in Lake Town and Dakshindari over the past three months.        
	Gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 2 lakh, some expensive electronic gadgets, four cellphones and Rs 25,000 in cash were seized from them.        
	The four  Tapas Dey, Rajesh Shaw, Animesh Sardar and Dipankar Mullick  admitted that they were involved in at least five robberies in Lake Town and Dakshindari. Tapas was the kingpin, said Ashoke Biswas, the additional superintendent of police (Bidhannagar).        
	The cops, however, are yet to find out whether the five, all in their late 20s, were involved in the two back-to-back robberies in Dakshindari last week.        
	Following the series of robberies, the police had formed a team, comprising inspectors Ashish Dolui, Sumit Mondal and Saswata Banerjee, to track down the culprits.        
	The probe pointed at some youths staying in the railway quarters in Dakshindari and Belgachhia. Our contacts said they were living a lavish lifestyle, said an officer working on the case.        
	Tapas was a general order supplier while Animesh was a bus conductor. Rajesh and Dipankar worked as plumbers.         
	Tapas was having an extramarital affair with a woman called Soma, who lives near Girish Park. He was detained on Thursday morning when he turned up at Girish Park to visit Somas house.         
	During interrogation, he broke down and told the police about his involvement, and of his friends, in the robberies, said an officer.

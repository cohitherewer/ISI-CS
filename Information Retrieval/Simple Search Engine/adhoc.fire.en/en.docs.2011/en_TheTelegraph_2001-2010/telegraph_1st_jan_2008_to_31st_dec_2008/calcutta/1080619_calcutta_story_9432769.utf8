										                                    Tirthanu (extreme left) poses with selector Anoushka Manchanda and other participants of The Big Pop Star Dream.               
	Imagine getting so bored in the summer holidays that you do something a bit out of the ordinary. And before you know, that little something earns you a ticket to fame.         
	That is how life has panned out for Tirthanu Ghosh. I had nothing to do. So I called up a phone number telecast on Disney Channel and recorded a song. The next thing I knew I was being called to an audition, the 13-year-old says.         
	Two auditions and as many songs later, he is in the national finals of Disneys The Big Pop Star Dream as the zonal champion. And if he wins, he gets to fly to the US and meet teenaged pop star Hannah Montana in person.        
	But the student of DPS Megacity considers himself no great shakes as a singer. I am part of the school choir but I have never sung solo in front of an audience. The only time when I did so was as a six-year-old at a local Durga puja show, says the Class IX student. Boredom can make people do many things. Why did he choose to sign up for a contest?         
	I was watching Abhijeet Sawant and Ishmeet Singh in Jo Jeeta Wohi Superstars. If they can sing, so can I, he replies confidently.                   Hannah Montana      
	Anoushka Manchanda, formerly of girl band Viva, must have thought so too. It was she who selected Tirthanu to sing at the city auditions after the screening over the phone. For most of the 2,000 children who auditioned at Birla High School alongside Tirthanu, Hannah Montana was the magnet.         
	I sang I Miss You before the judge. I have heard that Hannah had sung the song after her grandfather passed away. I too miss my grandma who left us last year, said Rajyashree Das, a Class VI student of Modern High School, on her way out of the audition booth.         
	Tirthanu cannot choose which the bigger thrill is  going to the US or meeting Hannah.         
	It is very important that kids be allowed to follow their dream. The story of Hannah Montana, who lives the life of an ordinary girl by day and turns into a star singer at night, is something every child wants to identify with, said Antoine Villeneuve, senior vice-president and managing director, Walt Disney Company (India), during his trip to Calcutta.         
	The songs of the finalists will go on air for audience votes from June 23 to July 2 and the winner will be announced by July 12.

	Not a childs play                  A scene from Hetomgore Hoichoi.     
	Rain or no rain, Academy of Fine Arts was bursting with young theatre enthusiasts on June 15. The eighth Childrens Theatre Festival organised by Indian Mime Theatre was on its third and final lap. Young actors Sonu Shah, Jaswan Singh, Suresh Sao, Bikas Singh, Roni Singh Rai and Tamal Maity who had staged a mine show on the inaugural day, were back to present another play, this time with dialogue, music and action.         
	The first play of the evening was not part of the festival. Hattamala, a professional troupe presented their newest play for children  Hetomgore Hoichoi. It had a tiger romping about the stage along with a flying Hanuman, skeletons and a magical egg. Director Gurudas Bandopadhyay said their group specialises in fairytales.         
	Thief Pochha Barui (played by Abhishek Banerjee) and his wife Khanta (Anindita Das) live in the jungles of Hetamgar along with ghosts Dol Gobindo (Utpal Mukherjee) and Nayantara (Mamata Banerjee), two bumbling policemen Bodon Daroga (Gurudas Banerjee) and Sankhachur (Mohit Das) and a dacoit (Utsav Chatterjee) who thinks he is Gabbar Singh junior. The tiger Halum (Suvankar Banik) is a circus animal who cannot fit into the jungle life. News of a buried treasure soon has most of them scrambling for it.        
	Though the play had everyone in splits, it also had a serious message  man must help himself and others around him instead of expecting gods, ghosts and magic to bail him out.         
	A similar message  attacking astrologers and superstitions  was conveyed by Purnima Di, a play by Kamala Girls School. Sreya Biswas managed to impress everyone with her portrayal of the illiterate maid Paddo. The play Sharthopar Daitya by Prabir Ray of Prompter Natyagoshti seemed to stretch too long. Adapted from Oscar Wildes short story The Selfish Giant, it was, however, a moving play supported by good music and some fine acting.         
	The giant was scary, but the flowers and the squirrel were nice, said Somdatta Thakurta of Carmel Primary School as she left the hall.         
	Nakal Gar was presented by participants of a workshop conducted by Indian Mime Theatre and Hridaya Akash (a social help wing of the Indian Mime Theatre).         
	The workshop had 50 underprivileged children participating in it. The play had no sets, very little costume and even the music was created live on stage.

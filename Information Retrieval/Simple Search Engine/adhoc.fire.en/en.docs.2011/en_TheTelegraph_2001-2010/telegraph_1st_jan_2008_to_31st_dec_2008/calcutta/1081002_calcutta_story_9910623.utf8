	The nationwide ban on smoking in public places came into effect from midnight, but the Bengal government remains hazy about implementing it and the puff brigade seems reluctant to stub it out. Metro reads the smoke signals...        
	Is buying cigarettes banned?        
	No.              
	Does the regulation apply to other tobacco products?        
	The ban is on tobacco products that produce smoke.               
	Where can you smoke?        
	In open spaces like parks and pavements. But dont walk past a bus stop with a lit cigarette  that is a public place.              
	What is the fine for smoking in a public place?        
	Rs 200 for every offence.              
	Who can implement the fine?        
	In public places: tax inspectors, health directors, administrative heads, anti-tobacco nodal officers, police officers of the rank of sub-inspector and above.        
	Railway stations: station masters.        
	Government offices: gazetted officers.        
	Hospitals, nursing homes: directors, superintendents, administrative heads.        
	Post offices: Postmasters.        
	Private offices: Managers, administrative heads.        
	Educational institutions: principals, teachers.        
	Libraries: Library heads, librarians, assistants.         
	Airports: managers.                  
	Can the law-enforcing authority confiscate cigarettes?        
	No.               
	How does a violator pay?        
	In cash, against a printed challan. Those who do not pay the spot fine could face detention. There is no mechanism to detect repeat offenders and slap a higher fine.               
	How is Bengal going slow?        
	No challans are ready. A task force of officials, headed by the principal secretary of the health and family welfare department, was set up on Tuesday. Challans will gradually be rolled out at the end of the festive month.        
	No challan, no fine?        
	A hand-written challan in the original format with a police rubber stamp will do, the cops say.              
	What will restaurants, pubs and discs do?        
	Smoking zones to be segregated with floor-to-ceiling walls. Food and drinks cant be served in the smoking zone. Boards of a stipulated size will read: No Smoking Area: Smoking here is an offence. There will be no ashtrays on tables.

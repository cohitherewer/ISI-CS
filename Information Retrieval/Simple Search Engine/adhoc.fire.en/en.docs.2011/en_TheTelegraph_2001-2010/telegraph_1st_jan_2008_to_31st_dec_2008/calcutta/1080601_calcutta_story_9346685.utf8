Uttarey
                                                
	Sikkim is a jewel embedded in the snow-clad eastern Himalayas. Adventure, history and culture join hands in this serene land, where one dreamy day blends into the next.        
	On the western part of the state, bordered by Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and West Bengal, Uttarey is a scenic village on the gentle northern slope of the Singalila range. It is slowly growing into a satellite township. The mountains around the settlement soar to over 8,500 metres.        
	About 140 km from Gangtok and 150 km from Siliguri, Uttarey with its cool weather and wonderful scenery is the perfect setting for a summer holiday.        
	There is plenty of greenery in and around the hamlet. The undulating, deep, dark Himalayan forests abound in orchids among other local flora. The variety in foliage in the village is matched by the hospitality of the residents.        
	An old monastery overlooks the sleepy village, which is the venue for a pageant once every year.         
	The courtyard of the colourful monastery and its beautifully laid out flower garden offer a panoramic view of the settlement. Several peace and prayer flags flutter along its walls.        
	The surrounding blue-green mountains echo every sound that breaks the eerie silence.        
	Each year, thousands of tourists visit Pelling, drawn by the wonderful view of the Kanchenjunga it offers. Sightseeing tours conducted from Pelling usually covers Singshore Bridge which is 6 km from Uttarey.        
	Transport is available from Pelling to Uttarey. Theres a regular jeep service from Gyalzing or Geyzing, about 8 km from Pelling.        
	While Pelling is under pressure to accommodate a growing number of visitors, Uttarey is still a virgin spot and is ideal for those who want to avoid crowds.                   
	There was only a single lodge in Uttarey only a couple of years back. But now more accommodation is available apart from the Uttarey Tourists Centre.         
	Visit Changey Falls, which cascades down from a height of at least 500 ft and disappears into a dense forest of silver fir and pine.        
	Singshore Bridge, the second highest gorge bridge in Asia, is a marvel in engineering. A stone dropped from the bridge takes nearly 10 seconds to hit the riverbed.        
	Since Uttarey is close to the Nepal border, men in uniform, especially those belonging to Sikkim Armed Police, over run the place.        
	Eco-tourism is big in Sikkim and Uttarey is no exception. A portion of the green valley has been earmarked for developing an artificial lake to attract more tourists.         
	A stroll towards Chitrey will take you to the trout cultivation centre run by the fisheries department of the state government. Inside the large covered compound, several types of trouts are bred in tanks of various sizes.         
	Those into adventure sports can try short treks through forests towards Varshey and then to Hilley.        
	A car service is available to Jorethang.         
	There is a steeper and harder trek, to the top of the Singalila via Chitrey and Chiyabhanjan. Crossing Singalila, one can reach Phalut in West Bengal.        
	Dzonri may also be reached from Chiyabhanjan, crossing Dudh Pokhri and Lakhim Pokhri. The trek can be completed at Yaksum.  
	Going   
	The nearest airport is Bagdogra, which is 160 km from Uttarey. The nearest railway station is New Jalpaiguri. There rsquo;s a metalled road to the village from Pelling and Geyzing via Dentam. Cars are available for hire. Cars and buses also ply from Gangtok and Siliguri.  
	Staying   
	Singalila Resort is one of the options. There are plenty of private hotels, like Devika, Lerena, Pravesh and Singshore. The tariff starts from Rs 200 per person per night                      (METRO ON SUNDAY THANKS READER PARAG BANERJEE FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

                The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Tuesday issued an appeal seeking information about Manish Agarwal, the CA final-year student found murdered off EM Bypass on February 28. Sleuths working on the case admitted that they had not got any lead so far to ascertain the reason behind the murder or clues to track down the killers. Agarwal went missing on February 21 after leaving a private firms office on Shakespeare Sarani. His decomposed body was found seven days later. The post-mortem report confirmed that Agarwal was strangled, but there were other injury marks on his body. The CID will not disclose the identity of the person who will pass on information and he or she will be awarded if the information helps police crack the case.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 22-year-old woman was rescued after she jumped into the Hooghly from Howrah bridge with her sisters husband early on Tuesday.         
	The woman has been admitted to Medical College and Hospital, but her brother-in-law, Pramod Kumar, 20, is yet to be traced. Doctors said the womans condition was critical.        
	We are investigating what led the duo to attempt suicide. Primarily it appears they were having an affair and their families got to know of it, said a senior officer of North Port police station.        
	According to witnesses, the couple reached the approach to Howrah bridge in a taxi at 1.30am on Tuesday. They walked down the pavement and reached the middle of the bridge.         
	Even before bystanders realised what was happening, the two jumped into the river, said an officer. The passers-by immediately informed policemen on patrol. Two boatmen spotted the woman struggling to stay afloat and rescued her. But there was no trace of Pramod, the officer said.        
	A preliminary probe revealed the woman is a resident of Ashoknagar in Naihati, while Pramod lived on Maharshi Devendralal Road, near Burrabazar. He was married to the womans sister a few years back. For the past few months, Pramod had been keeping to himself following troubles in his family over the alleged affair, the officer said.        
	On Monday, the couple had left their respective homes on the pretext of visiting pandals. They met at Sealdah and reached Howrah bridge well past midnight.         
	We have informed the police stations covering the ghats along the Hooghly about Pramod, another police officer added.        
	Three injured: Priyoj Dey, 21, of Belghoria was seriously injured after he fell off his bike on BT Road while trying to skirt two pedestrians near Chiria More early on Tuesday. Police said Dey tried to avoid hitting Monoj Das, 21, and his sister, Kakoli. After his bike hit the duo, it overturned. The three were taken to hospital.

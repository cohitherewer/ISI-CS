          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Brace yourself for a traffic mess in the heart of the city as the construction of a ramp of the AJC Bose Road flyover begins on Thursday.         
	The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) is building a ramp that would take off from the AJC Bose Road-Theatre Road crossing and meet the flyover near the AJC Bose Road-Ballygunge Circular Road crossing.        
	To facilitate the construction, this stretch will become out of bounds for buses and minibuses from Thursday.        
	The ramp  to be built on single pillars  will increase the accessibility of the flyover, the longest in the city.        
	We have given HRBC 160 days to complete the job. The diversions will primarily be for buses and minibuses. We will try to accommodate cars on the route. If we find that cars are unable to move, even they would be diverted, said Dilip Banerjee, the deputy commissioner (traffic).        
	Before starting construction, engineers will test the underground utilities and do a soil test.        
	From Thursday, the stretch of AJC Bose Road between Loudon Street and Theatre Road will be closed to buses and minibuses.

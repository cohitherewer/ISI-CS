                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Next weekend you can be at ... Labhpur
                                          
	Labhpur is a little-known getaway near Bolpur-Santiniketan in Birbhum district.         
	The first thing we noticed about the place is its virgin natural beauty. The quaint little railway station of Labhpur transported us to a bygone era and won our hearts.         
	Adjacent to the station is a beautiful temple of Fullora Mata, where myths and legends abound.         
	The temple is almost a hundred years old and believed to be one of the 51 piths of Goddess Sati. Legend has it that the lips of the Goddess fell at the site of the temple.         
	We were intrigued to know that the temple, however, does not have a deity.         
	A 10-day fair is held at the Fullora temple every year during Magh purnima.        
	The temple is surrounded by dense foliage, giving the place a mysterious look. A huge pond nearby enhances the beauty of the destination.         
	According to legend, the ancient sage Durbasas ashram stood just three kilometres from this spot, at Gopalpur.        
	A short walk from the Fullora temple through winding village roads brought us to the ancestral house of the famous Bengali writer Tarasankar Bandyopadhyay.         
	Many of his masterpieces were written in this house. It has now been converted into a museum, which houses several of his belongings. Particularly impressive is a collection of wood carvings, said to be crafted by the village artisans.         
	Labhpur village is covered in greenery, but is quite developed. The red lateritic soil of Birbhum adds a special flavour to its traditional set-up.         
	The Kanuri river flows nearby, winding its way through lush green fields and red soil.         
	The picturesque settings make Labhpur an ideal weekend destination, far from the hustle and bustle of city life, yet so close to home.         
	Going         
	Labhpur is about 50km from Bolpur. Buses are frequent and it takes about two hours. Alternatively, go to Ahmadpur junction either by train or bus. Labhpur is on the Ahmadpur-Katwa section. Trains take about 30 minutes, but are infrequent        
	Staying         
	You can stay at the Labhpur guesthouse, especially if you intend to visit the annual fair at the temple. You can also stay at Bolpur, which offers several options in terms of hotels and guesthouses                (METRO ON SUNDAY THANKS READER CHIRASREE BANERJEE FOR THIS CONTRIBUTION.

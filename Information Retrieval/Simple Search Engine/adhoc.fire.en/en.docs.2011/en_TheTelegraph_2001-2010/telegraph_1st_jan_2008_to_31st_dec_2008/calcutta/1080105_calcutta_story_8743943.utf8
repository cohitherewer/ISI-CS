                                                                                                            Landlord to furnish bond
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Ashrafilal Sahu and his sons will have to furnish a bond in court, pledging that they will not misbehave with their tenant Bindu Upadhyay.        
	The 28-year-old homemaker lives with her three children in the terrace flat of Sahus four-storeyed house at 28 Sanatan Mistry Lane, in Howrah. On December 29, the landlord, his sons Manoj and Rajkumar and their relative Sona Raut allegedly beat up Bindu for refusing them access to the terrace for a late-night drinking binge.        
	Bindu, whose husband Pradip is an electrical technician in Mumbai, complained to Golabari police station the same night but the officers told her to settle the matter.        
	The next day, Ashrafilal allegedly beat her up again. Bindu filed another complaint at the police station on December 31.         
	On Thursday night, the police questioned Ashrafilal and his sons at their home. The officers also met Bindu and asked her to submit a written complaint against her landlord and his relatives.        
	Howrah police superintendent N.K. Singh said: We have found out that Ashrafilal and his sons misbehaved with Bindu Upadhyay. We moved the sub-divisional magistrates court against them under Section 107 of the CrPC. The court asked the accused to furnish a bond promising not to misbehave with the woman in future. The notice will soon be served to the accused by Golabari police station.

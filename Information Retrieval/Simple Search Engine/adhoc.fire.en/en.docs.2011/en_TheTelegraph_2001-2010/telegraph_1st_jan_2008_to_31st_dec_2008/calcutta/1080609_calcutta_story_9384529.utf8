          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The bodies of a father and a son who had been missing since Wednesday were found floating in the Hooghly on Saturday afternoon.        
	The victims, Anil Beto, 52, and son Bittu, 25, were reported missing after stepping out of their Titagarh residence together. Bathers spotted Anils body first near Chandernagore Ghat. His sons body was fished out from the river in Bhadreswar.        
	Police have arrested Barrackpore resident Ratan Chowdhury, who had allegedly duped Anil of Rs 2.16 lakh. The family said Chowdhury refused to return the cash to Anil, a retired jute mill employee, after failing to keep his promise of arranging two autorickshaw permits on the Dunlop-Barrackpore route.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bull run in the gallery
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bull run in the gallery
										      Eyewitness                      A sculpture by Shyam Kanu Borthakur and (below) a painting by Rini Dhumal				                                 
	Shyam Kanu Borthakur is from Assam and was subsequently trained at the Indian College of Arts and Draftsmanship. He has been holding exhibitions in Calcutta for a while but this exhibition at Chitrakoot Art Gallery proves that his style has matured over the years and what is more important, his fluent drawings are leavened with wit.         
	Borthakur has created a series of sculpture both big and small of wild boars and goats using bronze, and in one instance, using wood and leather. The goats with horns larger than their heads and stomachs have a sparkle in their eyes. Like the bulls, some of them are aggressive and ready to butt somebody with their horns.         
	The bulls with humps as large as mountains are raring to go like the fierce boars with their cruel tusks and fire in their beady eyes.         
	Borthakurs drawings with charcoal and soft pastel are quite as expressive. His steaming kettles like fat ladies and lugubrious boars are delightful caricatures. It is wonderful how an artist can look at both sides of the picture.              
	Rini Dhumal is a senior artist from Delhi originally from Rangpur district in what is now Bangladesh. In her exhibition titled Of Mortal, Mythic and Divine at Gallery Sanskriti she goes back to the divinities she must have been familiar with in her childhood.         
	Her divinities are more or less on the lines of folk art with wings and nose-to-ear eyes. They have a primitive look with broad noses and fleshy mouths. Many of the divinities are quite clearly from Bengal but Dhumal often uses motifs from south India like the hamsa and also the lion from Orissa temples. Her lines are strong but at times one feels there is too much of the heavenly host.              
	Painters Orchestra held its 40th annual exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts last week. It was started in 1968 and has held exhibitions in Mumbai, Delhi and Santiniketan, besides Calcutta. The exhibition had some interesting entries. Indira Puri Mistry, who had graduated from Baroda, presented a drawing with acrylic on paper. The blue finlike shape reared its head against a sepia backdrop. Manasi Mitras Still Life was a jigsaw puzzle of angles and whorls of paint. Partha Pratim Debs fish with a bulbous mouth and a dazed look was quite expectedly quirky.        
	Some of the exhibits were below par. Jahar Das Guptas Nano and the grieving human beings was unnecessarily theatrical. Biraj Kumar Pauls Victim was characterless  it could have been done by anybody. So is Dibyendu Basus Beast. This is the problem with group shows. There is no question of choice.       SOUMITRA DAS

                                                                                                                Burglary rerun in Jadavpur
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Somsukla Sarkar points to the open almirahs from which burglars made off with cash and jewellery worth Rs 1.5 lakh. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                              
	A first-floor flat in Regent Place, Jadavpur, was burgled on Wednesday, a week after an apartment opposite it was cleaned out.        
	Both households have lost cash and jewellery worth Rs 1.5 lakh. Police have failed to make a headway in either case.        
	Priyam Sarkar and wife Somsukla returned to their flat, in a four-storeyed building, around 5.45pm on Wednesday and found the door lock broken.        
	I sensed something wrong, seeing the door ajar. We switched on the light of the dining hall and saw the bedroom door open. The almirahs, too, were open and the items inside were strewn on the floor, recalled Somsukla.        
	A quick search revealed that the burglars had taken away Rs 1 lakh, kept in the locker of a steel almirah, and ornaments worth around Rs 50,000.        
	I had withdrawn the money from bank as I was scheduled to fly to Mumbai on Thursday on urgent work, said Priyam, a senior official of a private insurance company.        
	The Sarkars called Jadavpur police station, from where a team came for an inquiry. Fingerprint experts and a forensic team have taken photographs of the flat and collected some items, he added.        
	On January 31, a gang had struck Debabrata Roy Chowdhurys flat, which is opposite Priyams. I was in office and my wife had accompanied my son to a private tutor in the afternoon. I returned around 5.15pm and found the lock of the door broken. Cash and jewellery worth Rs 1.5 lakh were missing. The burglars, none arrested so far, had left behind a chisel which we handed over to the police, said Roy Chowdhury.        
	The superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, Praveen Kumar, said: Raids are on in various places. We suspect the burglars knew about the families well.

                                                                                                               Danish varsity comes calling
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Centre for TeleInfrastruktur at Aalborg University, Denmark, a global leader in wireless research, has joined hands with Calcutta University (CU) to set up its first wing outside Europe.        
	We have tied up with CU and will offer masters and Ph.D programmes in wireless technology, Ramjee Prasad, the director of the centre, told Metro after launching the wing on Thursday.         
	Besides partnering with CU in academic exchange, the Danish university will also focus on developing patented technologies in the field of wireless interaction, the backbone of mobile and Internet communication.         
	The partnership will also cover student and faculty exchange programmes between CU and the Aalborg university.         
	The students will get degree certificates from Aalborg and CU. We are working out the modalities, said Susanta Sen, the dean of CUs faculty of engineering and technology.         
	Classes at the centre, with 10 Ph.D students, will start on July 1 in the radiophysics department of the CU. In five to seven years, the centre wants to set up its own campus in Calcutta.        
	The centres main focus will be on industry-related research projects in wireless communication technology and the centre is in talks with the Tata Consultancy Services, BSNL and Nokia for sponsored research programmes.         
	If we can bring companies like Nokia to Calcutta through these programmes, the engagement could manifest itself in many ways in the future, Prasad added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The North Wind has started wafting in, with its effect being felt in the nip in the air on Sunday, signalling winter is not far away.         
	The North Wind started blowing from Saturday, bringing down the minimum temperature on Sunday by three degrees, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.         
	Sundays minimum temperature was 19.8 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal. On Saturday, the minimum temperature was 22.7 degrees, six degrees above normal. We expect the minimum temperature to drop another couple of degrees in the next three to four days, said Debnath.        
	Met officials, however, are not sure whether the North Wind will keep blowing unhindered for a long time.        
	The weather will remain cool for the next few days but we cannot say immediately that winter is here. We will get a clearer picture after the weekend, said an official.         
	The cyclone season, marked with frequent formation of low-pressure belts and depressions over the Bay of Bengal, extends from October to December.        
	If such a system suddenly forms, the North Wind will be weakened, the official added.         
	There is a possibility of the development of a low-pressure belt over the southern part of the Bay of Bengal around November 27.

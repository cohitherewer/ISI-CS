                      Changing face of Bengal                    The march of civilisation is accompanied by progress in all spheres of life. Yet, certain aspects of it remain unchanged, standing witness to the passage of time. Hosted by information and culture department, government of West Bengal and Third Eye, Banglar Mukh Aami Dekhiachhi portrays the conflicts and contradictions that run parallel to the growth of Bengal as a hub of urbanisation, modernisation and economic activity. Featuring 106 images by over 36 photographers, it captures the pulse of the people caught up in the winds of change. The primitive and the modern, the quaint and the sophisticated appear side-by-side in the photographs, bearing evidence to the strange co-existence of contraries in a society where new life is born out of the ruins of the old.

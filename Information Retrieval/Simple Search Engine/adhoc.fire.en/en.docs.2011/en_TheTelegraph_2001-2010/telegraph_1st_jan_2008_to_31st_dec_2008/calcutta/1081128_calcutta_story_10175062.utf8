The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Heat on house owners
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Heat on house owners
  - Arrest clause added to rule on reporting tenants to police           A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	House owners who keep police in the dark about new tenants can be arrested as stricter laws come into force to combat terror.        
	We will first try to make house owners aware of the change in rules, then provide a timeframe within which they are required to report at the nearest police station with details about their tenants. If anyone defies the order, we can arrest him or her, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said on Thursday.         
	Its a rule that has been in force for a long time but very few house owners have complied with it. A senior official said hundreds of people were temporarily setting up base in the city every day without the police having a clue about who they were. We need to keep track of this moving population for the city to be secure.        
	House owners who violate the rule will be liable for arrest under Section 188 of the IPC, pertaining to disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant.         
	The police have decided to be strict with owners of cyber cafs and PCOs, too. The officers-in-charge of all 48 police stations have been asked to frequently check their customer registers. Once the new rules take effect, owners of large PCOs and all highrise buildings would be required to install CCTVs.        
	The biggest hurdle for the police is arranging for manpower to ensure compliance. We have been asked to monitor the CCTV footage of highrise buildings and check vehicles round-the-clock. These are tasks that cant be accomplished with limited manpower, a senior officer at Bhowanipore police station said.        
	Chakrabarti told the divisional commissioners of police during a meeting in the morning that there would be zero tolerance for slackness.         
	 We are focusing on all entry and exit points, including the Park Circus connector, Taratala, Ultadanga, the Sinthee crossing and the intersections on the EM Bypass, an officer at Lalbazar said.         
	But the banks of the Hooghly remain almost unprotected. As of now, people entering the city through the ghats are not being frisked, the officer said.        
	The inspector-general of police for law and order, Raj Kanojia, said security arrangements at some star hotels had been found to be unsatisfactory. Licences of those who fail to comply with the guidelines will be cancelled.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee went into a huddle with home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, director-general of police A.B.Vohra and the police commissioner to take stock of security.

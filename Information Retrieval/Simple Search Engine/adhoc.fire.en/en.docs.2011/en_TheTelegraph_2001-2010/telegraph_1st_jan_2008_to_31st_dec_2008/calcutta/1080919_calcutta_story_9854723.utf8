                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dead driver in locked car
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 28-year-old man was found dead inside a locked car on APC Road on Thursday afternoon.         
	Police said Bhola Shaw, a driver, died around midnight on Wednesday.         
	The air-conditioning of the car was on and the tinted glasses were rolled up, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.        
	Four aphrodisiac tablets were found in the car. The police are yet to ascertain whether Bhola was drugged or poisoned or had suffered a heart attack. There were traces of blood on the victims nose, the cops said.        
	Shopowners on APC Road called the police after seeing the car parked for over 10 hours.         
	The police said the spot where the body was found is near a red-light area.         
	Its possible that Bhola had picked up a sex worker. He might have consumed a stimulating drug, which caused his blood pressure to shoot up, resulting in heart failure, said an officer investigating the case.        
	Police are also not ruling out foul play. A sex worker or someone else might have drugged him. We have lodged an unnatural death case and are waiting for the post-mortem report, said another officer.        
	The vehicle has been traced to Vinod Jadav, a resident of Beniapukur. He said he had no idea where his driver had gone with the car.

                          Two dimensions of love                    Little Thespian presents the fourth part of its Katha Collage series with Guldasta, a bouquet of two plays. Based on the theme of love, it portrays the essence of romanticism in two very different ways.The first (an adaptation of Ismail Choonaras Afternoon), Do-Pahar, is the monologue of a middle-aged lady getting ready to welcome a former lover after a long absence of eight years. Though happily married, she cannot resist the temptation to meet him, and recounts memories of the past she shared with him. Laying bare the soul of the protagonist, it deals with the erosion of human values in the modern world. The second play, Muzaffar Hanfis Ishq Par Zor, treats love in the light vein of comedy. It tells the story of a blind servant, who is suddenly afflicted with the deadly disease of love. As he pours out his heart, he reveals the disappointments in relationships in his masters family. Design and direction: Uma Jhunjhunwala.                    Event: Plays in Hindi, Do Pahar and Ishq Par Zor produced by Little Thespian When: Tomorrow at 7 pm Where: Padatik Buildwell Theatre, 6/7 AJC Bose Road

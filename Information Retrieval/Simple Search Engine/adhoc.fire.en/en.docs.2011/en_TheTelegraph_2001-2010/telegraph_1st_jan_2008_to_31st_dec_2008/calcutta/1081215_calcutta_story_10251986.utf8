          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    The shopping bag and the spot where the body was found. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta      
	A pair of tiny feet jutting out of a shopping bag found abandoned near Ultadanga on Sunday turned out to be that of a dead 15-month-old boy.        
	Police suspect the child was abducted and murdered, though they hadnt a clue to his identity till late in the night. We have sent photographs of the boys body to all 48 police stations in the city to trace his parents, an officer at Ultadanga police station said.        
	No external marks of torture were found on the body but the post-mortem report said the boy died of head injuries. We will know whether the injury was homicidal in nature after the viscera is examined, investigating officer Syed Akbar Ali said.        
	A hawker walking down Canal East Road around 9.30am was the first to notice the bag. I saw the bag and then the boys feet. I immediately called a friend who was nearby and both of us went closer to the bag. We alerted residents of the area after confirming that there was a child inside the bag, Arun Das said.        
	The boy was wearing a sweater and two talismans dangled from a chain around his neck. The police took the child to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where doctors declared him dead.        
	We thought he might be alive because there was no sign of injury. A gamcha covered his face and his mouth was partially open, Ali said.        
	The abduction theory gained ground when nobody from the area could identify the boy.         
	 We circulated photographs to find out whether the child was a resident of this area but nobody came forward to say that he/she had seen him before. We are now trying to find out whether his parents live in the city or outside it. We suspect the boy was abducted and killed elsewhere and the body was dumped near Ultadanga at night, a member of the investigation team said.         
	Rajib Das, a construction worker who was in the crowd that gathered on Canal East Road in the morning, said it was unlikely that the nylon shopping bag was left there after dawn. This is a busy area and nobody could have left a childs body like that without being noticed. I couldnt work for a while after seeing the boys face.         
	The police said the boys appearance  fair and apparently healthy till he was alive  suggested he was from a good family.

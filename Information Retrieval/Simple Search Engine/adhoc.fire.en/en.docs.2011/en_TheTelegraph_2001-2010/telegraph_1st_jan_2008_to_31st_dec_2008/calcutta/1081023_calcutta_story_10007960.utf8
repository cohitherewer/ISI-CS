                Power cuts continued in the city and its adjoining areas on Wednesday as generation remained low because of the coal crisis. Power department sources said the shortfall in the CESC-served areas was 110 MW at noon. It fell to 65 MW at 6pm. We need an extra 14,000 tonnes of coal every day for the situation to improve, said S. Mahapatra, the managing director of West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited.     Sikha Neogi, 36, a resident of ESI Housing Estate in Salt Lake, died of an unknown fever on Wednesday after suffering high temperature for a week. Her blood sample has been sent for tests. Doctors at ESI hospital in Rajabazar said Sikha also had liver complications.    A number of flights from Calcutta and those flying over the citys airspace were diverted to other routes on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning due to the launch of Indias first lunar orbiter. An Air Traffic Control official at Calcutta airport said some planes on the Calcutta-Port Blair route flew at a lower altitude than usual for safety reasons. Flights from the US and Europe to Southeast Asia flew over Calcutta instead of Khajuraho.    Students of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) boycotted mid-term examinations on Wednesday and gheraoed senior university officials. They were protesting the authorities refusal to allow 18 students to continue studying in the college for failing in a subject five times. According to Besu rules, a student who fails to clear a subject in a semester examination is given five chances to clear it.     A fire broke out in a fourth-floor flat belonging to R. Majumdar in Dum Dum on Wednesday evening. The flat is in a five-storeyed residential building with shops on the ground floor. Four fire tenders doused the flames in an hour. There were no injuries. Fire officers said the fire was probably started from a short-circuit. The owner of the building was taken to Dum Dum police station for questioning.     Repair of water pipes started in ward 10 of Baranagar municipality on Wednesday after residents complained of water contamination. The water appeared oily and smelt of kerosene, they said. Civic officials said the contaminants might have spread from an oil depot in the area. The pipelines have been sealed.

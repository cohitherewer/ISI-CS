          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday directed the state education department to allow a Calcutta-based teacher in a Sagar school to switch jobs with a teacher from the island working in a city school.        
	Many school teachers across the state want to effect such mutual transfers but have been denied permission.        
	Following the order, Debasish Paria, a resident of Sagar Island, will exchange job with Etha Koley, a resident of New Alipore. Paria teaches in Jadavpurs Shaktigarh High School while Etha has been posted in Sagars Kalyan Sangha Vidyaniketan.

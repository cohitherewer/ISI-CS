                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bail for Riz cops scrapped
  - Trial judge erred by ignoring case diary          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	The three police officers facing charges in Rizwanur Rahmans death have been asked to surrender in three days by the high court, which cancelled their bail on Tuesday.        
	Acting on a petition filed by Rizwanurs family, the division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice P.S. Banerjee observed that the trial court had erred by granting bail to the trio without going through the case diary. To grant bail without seeing the case dairy is illegal.        
	The officers  Ajoy Kumar, a former deputy commissioner of the detective department, assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das  have to surrender in the Calcutta Metropolitan Magistrates court.        
	The bench pointed out another anomaly in the trial courts order  an interim bail without a deadline. The time limit of the bail period should be mentioned in case of an interim bail.        
	Lawyers representing the tainted trio said they were planing to move the Supreme Court challenging the high court order.         
	On August 27, the magistrates court had issued summons to the officers after the CBI filed charges against them and four others, including industrialists Ashok and Pradip Todi, stating they had driven Rizwanur to suicide.        
	Rizwanur, whose body was found beside the railway tracks in Patipukur on September 21 last year, had married Ashok Todis daughter Priyanka against the wishes of her family.         
	The cops surrendered in the magistrates court on October 1 and prayed for bail. But the plea was turned down and the three were sent to judicial custody. The next day, they moved a vacation bench of the sessions court and were granted interim bail.         
	Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur filed a petition in the high court challenging the legality of the sessions courts order. Rukbanurs counsel Kalyan Banerjee submitted before the division bench on Tuesday that the process followed by the sessions court in granting bail to the trio was illegal.        
	Sekhar Basu and Sudipto Moitra, who represented the officers, opposed the submission, saying: The petitioner did not clarify why the process was illegal. After hearing out both sides, the bench decided to cancel the bail.        
	We will challenge the order in the Supreme Court, said counsel Basu. Sources said the officers could file a special leave petition seeking a stay on the order on Wednesday.         
	The Todis and their relative Saraogi, against whom the magistrates court had issued arrest warrants, are missing.

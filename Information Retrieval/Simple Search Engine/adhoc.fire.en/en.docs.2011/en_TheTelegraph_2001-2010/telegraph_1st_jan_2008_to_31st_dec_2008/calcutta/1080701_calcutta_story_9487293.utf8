The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rail track repairs delayed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Rail track repairs delayed
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The citys train links with South India and Puri will remain disrupted for at least another 10 days, because the tracks that were damaged by floods are yet to be repaired.        
	Train services on the Kharagpur-Bhadrak route were disrupted following prolonged heavy rain in mid-June. A railway bridge between Narayangarh and Bakhrabad stations in west Midnapore collapsed after a flash flood in the Keleghai river.        
	One of the two lines on the bridge has been washed away. The South Eastern Railway (SER) authorities are trying to restore it. The other line has been restored but there are still breaches.        
	Keeping in view the safety of passengers, we will not be able to run passenger trains for the next 10 days on this route, said Archana Srivastava, the chief public relations officer of SER, on Monday. Restoration is on but fresh rain has worsened the situation.        
	Railway officials said soil along the tracks had subsided by rain and the movement of goods trains. So, some trains bound for Puri and other destinations in Orissa and South India will remain cancelled, while others will continue to run on diverted routes. The disruption has inconvenienced tourists and patients headed for South India for treatment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Facebook address for autumn festival
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Facebook address for autumn festival
  - Community pujas log into online community for para spirit and publicity          POULOMI BANERJEE                          A Durga idol at Maddox Square                                        
	Durga puja has a brand new address  www.facebook.com.        
	A couple of community pujas in south Calcutta have logged into the popular online community to reach out to non-resident para members and also make a trendy pitch for their favourite autumn address.        
	A frontrunner in the Facebook scheme of festive things is the Bakul Bagan Sarbojanin Durgotsab community started by Tollywood star Koneenica Banerjee. The community on the networking site traces the history of the 81-year-old puja in Bhowanipore and elaborates on this years theme  a Shiva temple in Hampi  besides providing details about the committees Durgotsab office and activities.        
	I have always been very involved with my para puja and for the past two-three years I have been on the committee, says the actress. My friends are now scattered across India or are abroad. They really miss the Puja back home and so I wanted them to get a feel of the festivities.        
	This festive spirit has prompted Arindam Mukerji to create the Durga Pujas Maddox Square community on Facebook. I have been away from Calcutta for many years and know how much it hurts to miss the para puja. This community is for everyone who is or was from the neighbourhood, says the HSBC employee, who has even put up details of a Puja meeting held in the para on Sunday.        
	If Durga Pujas Maddox Square will put up progress of the mandap, details of the idol, anjali timings and even telecast timings on TV channels, Bakul Bagan Sarbojanin Durgotsab will post photographs, video clips, minutes of Puja meetings, Puja timings, bhog details and more.        
	The pitch for popularity is understated yet undeniable. At Bakul Bagan, we have always been publicity shy. We are still not running after prizes, but I do hope many people will see the community on Facebook and visit our para puja this year, smiles Koneenica.        
	If the click campaign lends a trendy touch to traditional festivity it also marks Facebooks triumph over Orkut, the social networking site where some Puja communities have not really taken off.

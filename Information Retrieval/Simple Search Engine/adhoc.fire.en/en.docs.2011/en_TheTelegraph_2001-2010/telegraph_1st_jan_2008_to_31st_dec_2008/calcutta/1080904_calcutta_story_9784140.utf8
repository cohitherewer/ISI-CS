The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Plan for Bypass
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Plan for Bypass
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Traffic snarls are common on EM Bypass during peak hours                                  
	Elevated bus bays on the busier stretches of the EM Bypass are being looked at as a solution to traffic congestion on what is now a rapid-transit corridor only in name.        
	Urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharya said on Wednesday that a committee had been constituted to draft a master plan to make the route smoother and safer for traffic.         
	We have been receiving reports of traffic chaos on the EM Bypass on a regular basis. Reports of accidents on this connector are pouring in, too, because of reckless driving. This has to be controlled before the road is extended from Garia to Baruipur.         
	The master plan committee has been asked to suggest ways to check encroachment by advertising agencies that have put up billboards all along the bypass. The panel will also identify parking areas and localities on the route that need service roads, the minister said.        
	The state government wrote to Delhi two months ago for funds to create the proposed dedicated corridor for certain categories of vehicles, especially buses. We havent received any feedback yet, and I will be going to Delhi for talks again, Bhattacharya said.

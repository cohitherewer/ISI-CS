                A dozen officers, including officer-in-charge S. Basu, were allegedly locked up inside Nodakhali police station on Tuesday night by Sonali Guha, the Trinamul Congress MLA from Satgachhi. She demanded the arrest of those who had lynched an innocent person at Nodakhali on November 20. Over 500 Trinamul activists demonstrated in front of the police station till late on Tuesday night and freed the cops only after 10pm. District superintendent (South 24-Parganas) Ajey Ranade denied that policemen were locked up.    A case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder has been lodged against five persons for the wall collapse in Behala that killed two workers. Among the five charged is Jyotirmoy Bhowmik, the owner of the plot on Dwarik Mukherjee Road on which the wall stood. The promoter of a highrise building that was coming up on Bhowmiks plot had engaged some labourers on Monday to clean an adjoining drain. The wall collapsed when the cleaning was on.

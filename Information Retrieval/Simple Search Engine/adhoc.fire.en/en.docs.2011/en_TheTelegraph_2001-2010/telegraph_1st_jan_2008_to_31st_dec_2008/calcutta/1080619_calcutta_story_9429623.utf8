	A 42-year-old land broker in Rajarhat was shot at and struck several times with a dagger near his Kaikhali home, off VIP Road, on Wednesday morning.        
	Ayub Mullick, who police said was an accused in a murder case, is fighting for life at a nursing home.        
	The attacker has been identified as Nazrul, alias Nabi, a local tough. We are looking for him, said an officer of Baguiati police station.        
	Mullick was reading a newspaper at a tea stall near his Mandalganthi house around 9am when Nabi came riding a motorcycle. He fired at Mullick but the bullet hit the right shoulder.        
	Nabi then pulled out a dagger and struck Mullick several times with it. As the land broker slumped to the ground, Nabi fled on his two-wheeler.        
	Mullicks family said he had been receiving threat calls for the past few days. We do not know the details but he was always very tense since the calls started coming, said Mullicks wife Sabnam Ara Begum.        
	Every morning, my brother visited the tea stall where he would spent some time talking to people. It seems the attacker was aware of his routine, said Mullicks younger brother Yunus.        
	The police have not ruled out the possibility of a business rivalry leading to the attack. We are probing all possible angles. We have come to know that Mullick was having problems selling a Rajarhat plot to a developer, said an officer.

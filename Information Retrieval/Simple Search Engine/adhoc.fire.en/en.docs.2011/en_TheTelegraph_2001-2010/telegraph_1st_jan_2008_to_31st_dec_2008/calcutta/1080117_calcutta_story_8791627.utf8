   A STAFF REPORTER
        
	Twelve hours and several theories later, the mystery blast beneath a tree on Shakespeare Sarani on Wednesday remained a mystery.
 
	 ldquo;We are yet to know what had triggered the underground blast. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and forensic experts have been asked to send their reports, rdquo; said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).
 
	Minutes after the 9.45am blast, several theories started doing the rounds, but none proved to be conclusive.
 
	Police first issued a statement, saying a transformer had exploded. But there was no transformer on the spot.
 
	A source blamed the goof-up on a senior officer of the traffic department. ldquo;The officer rushed to the spot immediately after the blast and saw a distorted iron vat. He mistook it for an exploded transformer and briefed Lalbazar accordingly, rdquo; said the source.
 
	Next to come to the spot, an hour later, was police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, who said ldquo;an electrical short-circuit rdquo; might have led to the blast.
 
	But CESC men dug up the area around 3pm and found the cable intact. ldquo;We dug up the cable and found it intact. There was also no feeder fault, rdquo; said Dilip Sen, the executive director (commercial and mains) of CESC. ldquo;Besides, had there been a cable fault, supply would have been disrupted. No power cut was reported from the area, rdquo; said an official of the power utility.
 
	As soon as the second theory was scotched, emerged a third. The police started saying a leak from an underground gas pipeline might have caused the blast. ldquo;Leaked gas creates enormous pressure that could trigger an explosion, rdquo; an officer tried to explain.
 
	The civic body added weight to the conjecture, with chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) Tushar Ghosh saying: ldquo;A leak of propane from a pipeline of the Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporation had triggered the blast. rdquo;
 
	But the possibility had to be ruled out after men from the gas company dug up the area and found the junction in the pipelines okay. ldquo;There was nothing wrong with the pressure of the gas, rdquo; admitted a police officer. ldquo;Had there been a leak, we could have detected it by smell. rdquo;
 
	Nanda Samui, the general manager of Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporation, said another round of tests would be carried out on Wednesday.
 
	The police then came up with a fourth idea, identifying methane accumulated in sewer lines as the villain. ldquo;But to substantiate the theory, we have to wait for the civic body to examine the sewerage system, rdquo; said deputy commissioner Shamim.
 
	Civic chief engineer Ghosh, however, said a methane-induced blast would have blown off the manhole cover. ldquo;This hasn rsquo;t happened. rdquo;
 
	The fifth conjecture mdash; floated by gossip in the area mdash; of explosives planted under the tree was rejected by the police. ldquo;There were no scorch marks at the site. And none of the injured sustained burns, rdquo; said Shamim.

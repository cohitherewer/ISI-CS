	A fire broke out in Smith Lane, a narrow stretch lined with tyre-retreading shops in Taltala, around 6.30pm on Thursday.        
	Ten tenders took more than two hours to bring the blaze under control. There was no report of any casualty or injury.        
	"The fire probably started at 17 Smith Lane and soon spread to several adjacent shops. The entire stretch was stacked with inflammable articles, causing the blaze to spread fast," said Ajey Ranade, the deputy commissioner of police (central).        
	"Judging by the sound, a few LPG cylinders, too, must have exploded. The cause of the blast would be known only after a forensic test," he added.        
	Residents of the area alleged that had the tenders arrived on time, the fire could have been controlled much earlier.         
	"I spotted flames leaping out of tyrepatti around 6.15pm. Local boys immediately started pouring water on the flames. The fire brigade arrived half an hour later," said Nadeem, who lives close to Smith Lane.        
	The fire-fighters denied the allegations. "Our tenders started arriving on the spot soon after being informed about the blaze. The lane is congested and packed with inflammable material, so we had a problem controlling the fire," said D.P. Ghosh, a fireman.        
	Residents said this was the third fire in Smith Lane in the past five years.

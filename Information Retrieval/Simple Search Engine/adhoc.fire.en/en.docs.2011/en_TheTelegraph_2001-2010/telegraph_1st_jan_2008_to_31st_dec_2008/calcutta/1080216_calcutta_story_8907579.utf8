	A mob ransacked a nursing home in Baguiati and heckled doctors and nurses following the death of a young homemaker on Friday.        
	Nursing home owner Subrata Saha said the relatives and neighbours of Lipika Chakraborty beat up doctors, nurses and officials and damaged furniture after getting news of her death. Officers from Baguiati police station brought the situation under control, he added.        
	The relatives of Lipika, in her mid-20s, alleged that she had died of medical negligence. The nursing home authorities denied the allegation. Both groups lodged complaints with the police.        
	Lipika, a resident of Belghorias Nabin Pally, was admitted to the nursing home, near Joramandir, with severe burns on February 4 after being turned away by state-run hospitals and a nursing home.        
	My wifes sari caught fire from a candle while preparing dinner on February 3. I was not at home. Our seven-year-old son Rahul raised an alarm. By the time the neighbours rushed in, Lipika was badly burnt, said Manas Chakraborty, who runs a printing press.        
	Lipika was first taken to a local nursing home, where she was refused admission. She was then taken to RG Kar and NRS hospitals, before being admitted to SSKM.        
	Even there, she was kept on the floor of the burns section, so we shifted her to the Baguiati nursing home the next day, added Manas.        
	According to him, the nursing home authorities had been behaving rudely with him and his relatives. They refused to allow us to employ a nurse to look after her. Despite that, she was improving gradually. Around 7am, we received a call from the nursing home and after going there, found Lipika frothing at the mouth. There was no doctor to attend to her. A nurse informed us that she had died.        
	Saha said Lipika died around 6.30am and the relatives were informed in time. They even brought a doctor from outside to confirm the death, he stated.

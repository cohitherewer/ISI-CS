The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | School safety plea in court
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       School safety plea in court
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday admitted a plea seeking an order to the central and state governments for boosting security in schools in and around Calcutta.        
	Yashowant Sinha, a resident of Ballygunge, filed the plea. A vacation division bench headed by Justice K.J. Sengupta scheduled the hearing for January 2.        
	A recent survey by NGO Calcutta Forum revealed that security arrangements in schools in the city and its suburbs are not adequate. Something has to be done immediately, said advocate Subroto Mukherjee, who is representing Sinha.         
	There are schools in Calcutta where the student strength has reached 18,000. In some schools, there are two or three unarmed guards, while there are hundreds of schools where there is no security arrangement at all, added the lawyer.        
	The petition is based on facts and figures provided by the NGO and parents of the students in 29 city schools, said Mukherjee. After the Mumbai siege, each and every guardian is worried.        
	According to the petitioner, a task force should be set up for the security of students and teachers in educational institutions. If thats not possible, the government should provide financial assistance to schools so that the authorities can recruit armed guards, said Mukherjee.        
	He cited the instance of a threat call received by a Tollygunge school. Many of the students fell ill. Some of them became unconscious after hearing about the call. There should be a programme to make the school authorities and the teachers aware of the dos and donts in this type of situation. The court should ask the governments to take steps in this regard. The judge asked the petitioner to serve notice on the central and state governments by January 2.        
	We will make our submission in court, said junior standing counsel of the state, Subroto Mukhopadhaya.

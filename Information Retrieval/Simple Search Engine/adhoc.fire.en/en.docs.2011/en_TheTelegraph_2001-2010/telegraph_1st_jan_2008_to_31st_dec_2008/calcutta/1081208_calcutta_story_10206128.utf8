The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Telecom titans pass buck on SIM misuse
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Telecom titans pass buck on SIM misuse
  - Company Officials blame para retail chain for lax verification          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                                  
	Cellphone service providers that have turned even the para paanwallah into a SIM vendor are now refusing to take responsibility for cards landing in the wrong hands.         
	Officials of the main private telecom players claim there is little they can do if retailers bypass standard verification procedures. If basic verification isnt done at the retail level, tracking discrepancies and preventing misuse will continue to be difficult, an Airtel official told Metro with a request that she be not named.        
	The deputy commissioner of the detective department, Jawed Shamim, said telecom companies could no longer get away by playing pass-the-buck. We will soon meet DoT representatives to forward our suggestions on how the system can be tightened. We have already compiled a set of guidelines.        
	But its still just as easy to buy a SIM card by producing a forged identity document as it was before sleuths sniffed out a cellphone link between Calcutta and the mayhem in Mumbai.        
	This reporter produced a photocopy of a colleagues voter ID card with his photograph superimposed on it and approached 16 outlets in central and north Calcutta last week for prepaid SIMs. As many as 14 of them were ready to sell Vodafone and Airtel SIM cards that they said would be activated within 10 minutes.        
	Ei terrorism-er bajaarey ektu chaap achhey, aagey to aaro shohoj chhilo (its a little tighter now because of the atmosphere of terror; it was much easier earlier), said Khokon Biswas of Golden Xerox and Telecom Centre in Shyambazar, one of the two outlets that declined to sell a SIM card without confirming the buyers identity.         
	The 14 outlets that obliged are on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Marquis Street, Royd Street, Elliot Road, Kyd Street, Bhupen Bose Avenue, Bidhan Sarani and Grey Street. According to the police, a shop on Marquis Street supplied one of the three SIM cards from Calcutta that were found on the terrorists who had attacked Mumbai.        
	Just give us the photocopy and relax. We will get your number activated in 10 minutes. Retailers and distributors handle most of the activation formalities in the prepaid connection business. The companies are hardly involved, said the man at the counter of Akay Enterprises, on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road.        
	None of the 14 shops asked for the original voter ID to match with the photocopy. Verification takes place without fail for postpaid connections because the companies want to make sure the billing address given by the customer is authentic. There are no such issues in the prepaid business, a Vodafone official said.        
	The telecom departments rulebook states that SIM retailers and service providers must have a system in place to verify the authenticity of the proof of identity and address provided by an applicant. But SIM cards are rarely blocked because of discrepancies in the documents submitted by subscribers.

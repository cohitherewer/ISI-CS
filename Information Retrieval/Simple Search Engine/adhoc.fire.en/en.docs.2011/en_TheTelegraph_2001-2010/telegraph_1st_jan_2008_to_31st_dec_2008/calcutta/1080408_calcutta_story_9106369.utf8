The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Flyover fix for southern snarls
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Flyover fix for southern snarls
  - Rs 100 crores for high-speed roads at Golf Green, Dhakuria        A STAFF REPORTER                          An artists impression of the project for smoother traffic flow in south Calcutta                                        
	A clutch of transport projects has been readied to ease the traffic snarls at the Lords crossing of Prince Anwar Shah Road and on Raja SC Mullick Road.        
	The Rs 100-crore plan, christened Deep South Intervention Project, comprises        
	 A flyover at the Lords crossing and another on Raja SC Mullick Road, between Dhakuria and Jadavpur        
	 Widening of Raja SC Mullick Road in Baishnabghata        
	 Laying a road from South City to Ghulam Mohammad Shah Road.        
	The project, to be handled jointly by the civic body and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), was finalised at a recent meeting called by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb.        
	A survey will start before the Puja and the flyovers are likely to be ready by 2010.        
	The South City authorities will chip in with Rs 12 crore. We had engaged traffic flow consultant Wilbur Smith for inputs and he had suggested six options, from which the CMDA has chosen the flyover route, said Sushil Mohta, the director of South City Projects.        
	Debs meeting focussed on the need to remove the traffic bottlenecks in the deep south belt  comprising Golf Green, Jadavpur, Baishnabghata and Patuli  and improve its connectivity with in-city areas, such as Gariahat, Esplanade and Park Circus. This will also result in easing the load on EM Bypass.        
	If the Lords crossing and the stretch between Jadavpur and Dhakuria can be made snarl-free, north-bound vehicles from Golf Green will not have to make a detour via the Bypass, Deb said.        
	The civic body proposed that Raja SC Mullick Road beyond the Baishnabghata crossing be widened. It was clarified at the meeting that the public works department, which owns the road, will allow the civic body to take up the work.        
	The pocket witnessed large-scale urbanisation over the past three decades, resulting in a 10-fold rise in the vehicle count. But traffic infrastructure has remained static over the past 25 years, pointed out civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who attended Debs meeting, along with CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.        
	The South 24-Parganas police have long been pointing out that the Lords crossing and the stretch between Dhakuria and Jadavpur are two major traffic trouble spots in the area.        
	A prod from the chief secretary to address the problem prompted both the CMC and the CMDA to take up the project.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SRK wields bat, steals hearts, fires fancy
  - Shaaaaaaaaaaaa... Ruuuuuuuuuuuu...kh          A STAFF REPORTER                        A schoolgirl runs after Shah Rukh Khans car hoping to get an autograph of the star; (below) the owner of Kolkata Knight Riders at the inauguration of a Sarat Bose Road store. Pictures by Pabitra Das				                                             
	Yuvraj Singhs record of hitting the maximum sixes in an over was equalled on Friday, and it wasnt even a cricketer who did it. It was Shah Rukh Khan who was wielding the bat, proving he can do much more than cheer his team.        
	Inaugurating the first Reebok Knight Riders store in the city, the Bollywood Badshah turned into big-hitting brand ambassador, smashing more than six (tennis) balls up, up and away from the black and gold stage outside the Sarat Bose Road outlet.        
	One of those balls was caught  though on the wrong side of the virtual boundary  by Sampa Guha, wearing whites. She wasnt on her way to a Test match: the detective was in her Calcutta Police uniform.         
	I am happy about what Shah Rukh Khan is doing for sports, gushed the gold medallist weightlifter, who has represented India in the Asian and Commonwealth games.        
	Appearing for a 10-minute cameo with son Aryan in tow, Shah Rukh broke into a jig to the tune of the Kolkata Knight Riders theme song.         
	The crowd could have put an 80,000-strong Eden to shame for sheer volume. Shah Rukh Shah Rukh korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re they chanted, perched atop every conceivable vantage point  from neighbouring terraces and balconies  and crowding the road.        
	Namaskar, salaam wallequm, he began. The idea of buying a cricket team in Calcutta was one of the nicest decisions. Many thought that the idea of a film star doing a cricket team wont work but the kind of support that we have got I dont know how you say it in Bengali, but in Delhi and Mumbai, we say jai Calcutta, said Shah Rukh, his dimpled smile bringing on more wild cheers.        
	And Sampa would be happy with his promise to extend his mind and heart to other sports as well, before he signed off, thanking all the dadas.        
	Fans had assembled, some as early as 1pm, waiting in the sun for nearly three hours for the star to arrive.        
	I came running from school to meet Shah Rukh Khan. None of my friends believed me when I said I am going to meet Shah Rukh. Now, I am going to take an autograph and show it to them, said 14-year-old Kiran Punjabi of Loreto Day School.        
	The girl in our picture chasing SRKs car, crying out his name, may not have got the autograph she was seeking, but few others in the frenzied crowd were disappointed.         
	The buzz in the air was that it was Shah Rukh  not Sourav, Shoaib or Sharma  who would get KKR to the IPL semi-finals.

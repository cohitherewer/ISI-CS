          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	State home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti on Tuesday met senior functionaries of police, railways, star hotels fire brigade and other agencies to take stock of the citys preparedness in tackling an emergency.        
	The measures will be discussed elaborately at a two-day meeting of the home secretaries of all states in Delhi from December 4. Chakrabarti will attend the meeting on December 5.        
	The meeting at Writers Buildings started with a review of the security preparedness of the railways. The officers discussed a report submitted by the additional director-general of police (railways) Dilip Mitra, which identified the loopholes in the existing system and outlined the corrective measures that would be put in place soon.        
	This was followed by an assessment of fire safety standards in town and submission of layout and other papers by the star hotels. An officer who attended the meeting said the focus was on preparedness as it was not possible for a state to raise an elite force like the National Security Guards.        
	The terrorists may attack any state, big or small. Its absolutely necessary to take precautions against such a strike, said home secretary Chakrabarti. City detective chief Jawed Shamim said: The meeting  attended by representatives of railways, hotels and other organisations  discussed preventive measures and how to respond during an emergency.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State tops list of pneumonia deaths 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       State tops list of pneumonia deaths 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Bengal has recorded the highest number of child deaths from pneumococcal diseases in the past two years.        
	According to experts, pneumococcus bacteria causes more than 80 per cent of the pneumonia-related deaths.        
	The Central Bureau of Health Intelligence data shows that in 2006, 1,151 died of pneumonia in the state. The figure was 620 the next year, again highest in the country.        
	Deaths caused by the pneumococcus bacteria in Bengal are the highest in India. Since the figures are from state-run medical colleges and hospitals, the actual number of deaths can be much more, said Rohit Agarwal, the secretary general of Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP).        
	The pneumococcus disease can lead to brain damage, paralysis, learning disabilities and speech delays in children. It can affect children below five years but those below two are most vulnerable.        
	Antibiotics are used to treat children with pneumonia but the increasing number of cases drug-resistant pneumococcus bacteria is a cause of concern. Prevention by vaccination is the most effective way of fighting the bacteria. But the cost of the vaccine  Rs 3,700 for each of the four vaccines required to complete the cycle  makes it out of the reach of many, said Ritabrata Kundu, a city-based paediatrician and the secretary of the infectious diseases chapter of IAP.        
	The seven-vallet pneumococcus conjugated vaccine (PCV-7), developed in the US, is now available in India. But it covers only 55 per cent of the 91 sero-types of the bacteria. A number of the 91 sero-types are invasive in nature and affect blood cells and the brain.         
	IPA, an advisory body to the Union health ministry, has requested the ministry to include the pneumococcus vaccine in the national immunisation programme. The request was made in April this year, said Agarwal.        
	Global Alliance for Vaccine Initiative, which provides funds for pneumococcus vaccine to governments, will be approached. But even after procurement, there are issues like storage and supply, said Jaydeep Choudhury, the assistant professor of the department of paediatrics at the Institute of Child Health, Calcutta.

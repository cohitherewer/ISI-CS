                      Moments of truth                    Since time immemorial, man has been on a ceaseless quest for the truth. Greek tragedies have often been prophecies of truth with Sophocles works being marvelled at by theatre audiences worldwide. His Oedipus trilogy has been performed and won accolades all over the world. King Oedipus unravelled the mystery of his birth to quench his thirst for the truth, though, by unveiling the dark side of his life, he spelt doom for himself and Jocasta. His remarkable courage was inherited by his daughter Antigone, who did not succumb to the ill-wishes of Creyon, King of Thebes. Raja Oedipus, Sombhu Mitras adaptation of this seminal work, was the toast of Bengals theatre-goers in the 1970s. Reviving his brilliant transcreation after more than 30 years, media personality Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee returns to stage to present a dramatised reading of excerpts from Raja Oedipus and Antigone (transcreated by Prof Chittarajan Ghosh and Ajitesh Bandyopadhyay). He will be accompanied by veteran theatre personality Bijoylakshmi Burman. The cast is supported by Partha Mukherjee and Shantanu Gupta with Kaushik Bhattacharya as sutradhar.            Event: Dramatised reading from the plays, Raja Oedipus and Antigone

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             SSKM told to shut coal ovens 
  - Threat to Victoria Memorial, not patients, forces conversion to gas          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          The facade of Victoria Memorial                                        
	SSKM Hospital has to stop using coal ovens not because the smoke could be harmful to its patients but because it might damage Victoria Memorial.        
	On Wednesday, Calcutta High Court asked the health department to introduce LPG burners within a week.        
	The courts order was in response to green activist Subhas Duttas supplementary affidavit, accusing the government hospital of violating a September 2007 ban on the use of coal ovens within a 3-km radius of Victoria Memorial. The distance between the SSKM campus and the monument is less than 200 metres.         
	Dutta said the agency running the hospital kitchen  it supplies meals to the 1,300-odd patients in different wards  had been using five coal ovens despite the ban.         
	Government advocate Tulshidas Maity did not dispute it. Previously, only gas ovens were used in the kitchen. The agency had to go back to the old process because of the unavailability of gas cylinders when needed.        
	Dutta said he wasnt sure whether coal ovens were being used in the staff quarters and canteens, too, because he did not have access to these places. The division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice R.N. Banerjee asked the health department to take appropriate action against employees found to be using coal ovens in their official quarters on the SSKM campus.         
	While banning the use of coal ovens in the vicinity of Victoria Memorial on September 28, the same bench had asked the government to ensure that hotels, restaurants and roadside eateries in the area did not use coal. The government filed an affidavit on April 8, saying it had implemented the ban.        
	But the government itself allowed the Bidhannagar Wholesale Consumers Co-operative Society, the organisation given the responsibility of supplying food to patients at SSKM, to use five large coal ovens in the kitchen, Dutta said, backing the charge with photographic evidence.        
	He said 5-6 quintals of coal were being used daily. When I contacted hospital director Pradip Kumar Mitra, he admitted to being aware of the high courts order but unaware that coal ovens were being used in the kitchen.

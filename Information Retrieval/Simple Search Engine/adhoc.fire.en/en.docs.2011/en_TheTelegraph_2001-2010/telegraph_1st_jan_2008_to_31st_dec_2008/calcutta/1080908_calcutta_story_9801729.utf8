          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	A 35-year-old bar singer who was allegedly depressed after being upstaged by her daughter jumped into the Hooghly from Bally bridge on Sunday morning.        
	Two boatmen dragged Tandra Das (name changed) out of the water. She was admitted to BN Bose Hospital in Barrackpore, where her condition was stated to be stable.        
	Asim Ghosh and Sheikh Jainul, the boatmen, said they saw Tandra jump off the bridge around 10.30am. They dived in, pulled her to a bank and informed policemen in a nearby outpost.         
	Tandra had recently moved to Mumbai to work in the bar where her 18-year-old daughter sings, said police.        
	Customers at the bar often asked Tandra to stop singing and allow her daughter to perform. This made her very depressed, said an officer of Belgharia police station.        
	Tandra started singing in bars around eight years ago. Her husband, a real estate agent, was against her joining the profession. She, however, encouraged her daughter to follow in her footsteps. The girl sang in bars for a few months before moving to Mumbai in January. She asked her mother to shift to Mumbai since the pay was better there, said an officer.        
	Tandra moved to Mumbai in February but returned in July after failing to make a mark, he added.

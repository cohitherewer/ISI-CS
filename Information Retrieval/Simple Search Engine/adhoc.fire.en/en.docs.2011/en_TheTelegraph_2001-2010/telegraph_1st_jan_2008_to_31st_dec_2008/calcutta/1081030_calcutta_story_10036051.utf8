The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cracker ban goes bust
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cracker ban goes bust

	The city thumbed its nose at the ban on noisy crackers on Kali puja and Diwali, not even sparing silence zones and hospitals. Violations were reported mostly from south Calcutta and the northern and southern fringes.        
	A team comprising members of the state-level noise pollution monitoring committee and state pollution control board (PCB) found crackers being burst in the vicinity of a number of city hospitals.         
	Cracker of any decibel are not supposed to be burst within 100 metres of a hospital, but the team found the decibel level shot up to 90 at some hospitals.        
	The police hospital in Bhowanipore was one of the worst-affected on Tuesday night. Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department, who was leading the monitoring team, directed the police to arrest five persons from buildings around the hospital and seize banned crackers. The police also stopped a soiree beside the hospital.         
	Ban violators were rounded up near SSKM Hospital, too. According to Calcutta police, nearly 800 people were arrested during the night for breaking noise laws and 275kg of crackers were seized. The team found a similar situation at NRS Medical College and Hospital and Medical College and Hospital.         
	I am suffering from chikungunya and dengue and the bursting of crackers is causing me a lot of discomfort, said Indrajit Mitra at Medical College and Hospital.         
	The violation got worse later in the night. Till evening, the situation was largely under control, but as the night progressed, it became a free-for-all, said environment secretary M. L. Meena.         
	Like in the past two years, the maximum violations occurred in south Calcutta, especially in multi-storeyed buildings and housing estates. One person was arrested from a complex on Ballygunge Circular Road. They think they are above the law. It seems the local police station is non-existent, said an elderly resident.

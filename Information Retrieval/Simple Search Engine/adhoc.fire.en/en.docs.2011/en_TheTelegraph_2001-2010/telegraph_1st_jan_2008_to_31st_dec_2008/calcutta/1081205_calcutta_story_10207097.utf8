                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Anticipatory bail denied
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Mahesh Agrawal, the owner of the Haldiram outlet at the Exide crossing, where a fire had broken out last month.         
	A division bench of Justice D.P. Sengupta and Justice Tapan Dutta rejected Agrawals plea after public prosecutor Asimesh Goswami stresses the need for custodial interrogation of the owner.        
	Goswami also pointed out that the owner had failed to produce a valid cooking licence for the outlet. He had been running the eatery only with a fire licence.        
	The denial of anticipatory bail came six days after the high court ordered a seven-day shutdown of the outlet. Acting on a plea by Agrawal, another high court bench had asked forensic experts to conclude their examination within seven days.         
	On Thursday, the court was informed that the police had called Agrawal to Lalbazar twice and interrogated him, after which they felt it was necessary to arrest him.        
	Agrawals counsel Sudipto Moitra told the court that even though his client possessed a fire licence, the police were threatening to arrest him.        
	Goswami then pointed out that in 2005, a devastating fire had broken out in the outlet. The petitioner is a habitual offender and should not be granted bail.        
	Countering his claim, Moitra said: Even earlier, the police had found nothing against my client. The fire was an accident. After hearing both sides, the bench rejected Agrawals anticipatory bail plea.        
	Agrawals prayer for re-opening the establishment will be heard by the court on Friday.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A University Grants Commission (UGC) team has expressed satisfaction with Calcutta Universitys utilisation of funds. The six-member team is inspecting the university campuses.         
	The four-day inspection, which ends on Saturday, is aimed at assessing the universitys requirement of funds in the 11th Plan.         
	The UGC team is happy with our utilisation of funds allotted under the 10th Plan. We expect the grant to increase considerably in the next plan period, said a senior university official.        
	We are seeking funds for developing campus infrastructure, setting up centres for promoting studies in emerging subjects like biotechnology and genetics and creating teaching posts in these subjects, said Suranjan Das, the vice-chancellor.        
	The UGC officials refused comment.        
	Sources said the team has urged the university authorities to introduce the semester system and continuous assessment of postgraduate students.

                The undergraduate and postgraduate exams of Calcutta University that were scheduled for August 20 have been deferred because of a nation-wide strike by Left trade unions. The L.LB Part I and Part III exams scheduled for that day will be held on August 25, said officials of the universitys examination department. The revised dates of the other tests will be announced later.     Tapan Sarkar, 37, and Bappa Sarkar, 27, were arrested at Maheshtala and Gaighata on Wednesday night for duping 23 people by sending them to Bangkok promising jobs. The jobs were promised in exchange for anything between Rs 20,000 and Rs 60,000 from each. The two were arrested after one of the job-seekers lodged a complaint with the immigration department. The two were produced in Bankshal court on Thursday and remanded in police custody.    Traffic was disrupted on Diamond Harbour Road in Behala after a part of the road caved in on Thursday. Police said the condition of the road worsened after the pipe-laying work under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project started. Officials said repairs would be over by Friday.    Four youths in the age group of 18 to 20 years were arrested at Khardah on the northern fringes of the city on Wednesday night for their alleged involvement in a murder in the area on Monday.

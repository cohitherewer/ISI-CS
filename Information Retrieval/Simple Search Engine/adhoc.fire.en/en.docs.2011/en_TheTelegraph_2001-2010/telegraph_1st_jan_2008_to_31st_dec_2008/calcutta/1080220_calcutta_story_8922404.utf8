           Maidan magic: It is wonderful that consulting and IT services major Satyam, a sponsor of the World Cup, has decided to pitch in to raise the standard of Indian soccer, with Calcutta figuring prominently in the plans (City epicentre of soccer bonanza, January 25). Hopefully, Satyams initiative will motivate other companies to follow suit.                                             
	Apropos the report Anger management enters classrooms, January 28, the management of negative emotions begins in empathy. But how many schools remember to be humane while disciplining the students?           
	I live in Alipore, close to a school. The gates of the school are shut at 8am and children are not allowed inside after that even if they cry and beg the staff.           
	Recently, I was disturbed by the sight of a little boy crying inconsolably outside the school gate after not being allowed inside for being two-three minutes late.           
	The car in which the boy had come to school had left by then. He had nowhere to go to and was too young to return home alone.           
	When a good Samaritan tried to intervene, he was rudely asked by the school staff not to meddle in the matter.           
	In the bid to ensure discipline, the authorities of the school have removed the human touch from education. They cannot expect their students to be humane.           
	 S.P. Mittal,
  Alipore Road.                       
	Apropos the report Lalbazar lets down aged in need, January 25, I was shocked to read that a senior citizen failed to get help from police after dialling 100 while burglars were entering his house. During interactions with the common people, the police top brass makes grand promises but does not keep them later. For example, in July 2006, the then deputy commissioner (headquarters), Pradip K. Chatterjee, had assured the elderly of all possible help from men in uniform. It now appears that the promises were an eyewash.             
	K.C. Sen,
  Garia           
	It is shameful that policemen at Lalbazar did not respond to the call of duty at night. The chief minister and senior police officers have time and again urged common people to dial 100 in distress. What is the use of the service if the cops would not take the calls? The people who were supposed to attend the emergency calls that night should be penalised. The image of the force has suffered because of their irresponsible act.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder, 
  Behala    
	The most irritating aspect of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees personality is his culturebazi (Mela ban opens can of worms, January 30). Like a true Stalinist, he doesnt understand that people have the liberty to decide what song they will hear or what film they will watch, and it is not for the government to set the cultural standards.             
	The chief minister goes on promoting his brand of culture at the taxpayers expense, and even by flouting rules. The Book Fair on congested Park Circus and the soiree at Citizens Park are ready examples.           
	Chameli Pal, 
  Batanagar           
	The juvenile disobedience movement against the high court order on Book Fair on the Maidan should be condemned. The so-called intellectuals who are leading the protest are irresponsible. Last year, they had questioned the presence of Fort William on the Maidan. If a mob, emboldened by the incitement, takes law into its hands, these intellectuals will be the first ones to disappear from the spot.           
	Asit Bhattacharya and Nandita Bhattacharya, 
  Address not given           
	It is unfathomable why in a city that sinks after every shower the mayor and the chief minister are spending their time and energy in serving the cause of a private body, which is blatantly using public emotion to serve their commercial ends. This only reveals what hypocrites our leaders are. Those who are calling for the Book Fair on the Maidan do not deserve to be called intellectuals. Interestingly, none of the delegates who came to the city for the Book Fair were heard to insist on the event being held on the Maidan despite the cancellation disrupting their itineraries.           
	Abhijit Chakraborty, 
  Howrah    
	The proposal to issue or renew trade licences only after verifying clearance from the fire and the civic building departments for the premises concerned sounds logical but would be difficult to implement (Market fires turn licence screws, January 30). Over four lakh traders would have to queue up at the two departments to obtain the clearances. Given the work culture in Calcutta and the corruption in the civic body, the clearances could take years. Identifying and regularising the over six lakh illegal buildings in the city would be easier. Those dealing in non-inflammable articles like cement and steel could be kept out of the purview of fire checks.             
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore    
	The report Homemaker minus home, January 30, once again exposes the brutal face of the society. It is very sad that a woman, despite having a husband and daughter, is spending her days in a mental asylum. I have no doubt that the hatred and torture Madhabi had to endure caused her mental ailments.             
	Rathin Chatterjee,

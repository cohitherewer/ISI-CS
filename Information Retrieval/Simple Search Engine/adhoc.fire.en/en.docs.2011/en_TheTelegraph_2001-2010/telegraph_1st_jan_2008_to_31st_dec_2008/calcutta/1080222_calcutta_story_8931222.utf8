The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus crushes schoolgirl
                                                                                                               Bus crushes schoolgirl
          A STAFF REPORTER                              Sushmita Harijan and (below) the spot of the accident at the VIP Road-Baguiati crossing. Pictures by Amit Datta				                                 
	Sushmita Harijan, 14, was knocked down and killed by a speeding private bus at the Baguiati crossing on VIP Road early on Thursday.         
	The Class VII student was on her way to school when the accident occurred.        
	This was the third fatal accident this year on this treacherous VIP Road stretch, triggering protests and a roadblock by residents.        
	Sushmita, a resident of Jagatpur, off VIP Road, was headed for Chittaranjan Colony Hindu Vidyapith, accompanied by her grandmother Tripti Neogy, around 6.30am when she was hit by a private bus, said an officer of Baguiati police station.        
	Witnesses said the teenager had moved ahead of her grandmother and was in the middle of the road when she suddenly saw a bus speeding towards her.        
	She froze in fear and the bus slammed into her, said Gopal Mondal, a tea stall- owner. Her grandmother, who was just a few steps behind her, also fell and suffered injuries, he added.        
	The two were rushed to a local nursing home. But by then, it was too late for Sushmita. My girl died on the spot, cried mother Jaya Harijan, at their Gyanendra Pally home.        
	Till late on Thursday, police could not trace the killer bus.        
	Public resentment against the police peaked in the wake of the latest tragedy, with residents blaming the series of accidents on administrative apathy. With a little bit of thought and effort, this stretch can become much safer, but no one seems to be bothered. Unless some VIP falls victim to an accident here, the police will not lift a finger, alleged a resident of Baguiati.        
	Tanmoy Mondal, former MLA from Rajarhat, joined the chorus of protest: Between 10pm and 8am, there is no traffic signal between Kestopur and Teghoria and no traffic policeman in sight.        
	Officers of Baguiati police station cited lack of manpower for the failure to bring down the accident count.

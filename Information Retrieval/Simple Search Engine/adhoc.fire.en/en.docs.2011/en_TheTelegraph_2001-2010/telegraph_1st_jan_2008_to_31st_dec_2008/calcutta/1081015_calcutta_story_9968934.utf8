           Charge of blue brigade: Sunil Chhetri in action in the AFC Challenge Cup final that India won beating Tajikistan in New Delhi (PTI)                             
	It is unfortunate that a hoax terror mail from a cyber cafe in Salt Lake led to the arrest of the cafes owner and a woman employee. Both had to suffer unnecessary harassment in the hands of police. Cops have rarely been able to track down terrorists but are competent enough to misuse CrPC sections like 121 or 120B (fomenting war against the state and criminal conspiracy). This speaks volumes of the callousness of our police force. The ignominy and social stigma suffered by Kaushik Basu and Sabitri cannot be denied. Without any evidence, how could the police keep the duo behind bars?           
	Though they have been acquitted, Kaushik and Sabitri will still be looked upon suspiciously. Our police need to be trained thoroughly before they are let loose on society as guardians of law and order.           
	Sleuths responsible for this unpardonable lapse need to be hauled up. Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti had termed the arrests as excellent work. The incident exposes the complete failure of his intelligence network.           
	The hoax mail ensured, at least for a day, defence alert all over the state, with cops pulling up their socks. Whoever sent the mail deserve kudos!

	Apropos the report Victory boost to soccer talent, August 19, it is heartening for all Indian sport fans that the national soccer team lifted the AFC Challenge Cup. But in spite of this triumph and the scintillating win in the Nehru Cup, the overall standard of Indian football has been going downhill. Indias FIFA rank is as low as 151. I feel all the states should set up football academies to nurture budding talent into world-class players. Otherwise, we will have to continue importing foreign players for exorbitant sums while local talent remains untapped at home.

	It is good news for Indian sports that the victory of the national team in the AFC Challenge Cup has been able to motivate young footballers in the city. This glorious achievement by the Indian team will boost youngsters to become the next P.K. Banerjee or Chuni Goswami. Hopefully, they will be able to help our football team qualify in various international tournaments and give us a taste of success in the international arena. This kind of victory also attracts young talent to the sport. The government should take initiatives to improve the infrastructure by proving better grounds, new stadiums and football academies throughout the country.

	The National Library in Calcutta was once considered to be the best in India, if not in Asia. For Bengalis, it was a matter of pride. But now, its condition is best described as a disgrace (Two books a day make library sick, August 13). A library of such stature is without a director for a year, crores of funds remain unutilised, the staff take eight hours to catalogue only two books  the list goes on. The work culture of Bengalis, particularly in the public sector, has not been something to be proud of. Should we just resign ourselves and watch the National Library slowly disintegrate, blaming poor work culture? What is the Union culture ministry doing? Surely, someone is responsible for looking after this institution. May be we need to wait for a well-meaning activist to move a PIL as a wake-up call to the government.

	It is unfortunate that the National Library director-in charge pressured the staff to catalogue 20 to 25 books a day each. It is a difficult task and one person cannot process more than eight books in a day. They are supposed to go through a long processing job before putting a book on the shelf  like putting the authors name, the publisher, the press, the subject, number of pages and so on for cataloguing. Then comes the classification of the book. Besides, a number of posts are lying vacant in the library for years. Several requests by the library employees have fallen on deaf ears. Thus, the output of work deteriorated. The central education department should immediately fill up the empty posts. We should not forget that a library is a temple of knowledge and it is our duty to maintain its sanctity.

	Apropos the report Nakur bites mall bait after 163 years of tradition, August 7, on diversification by confectioners Girish Chandra Dey-Nakur Chandra Nandy, I would like to caution Prasanta Nandy and his siblings Pratip and Pranob regarding their plan of introducing sandesh filled with whisky or brandy. The brothers should realise that their sweets are regarded not only as delicacies, but their sandesh is often bought by Hindus as offerings (prasad) to gods and goddesses. I dont think Nakur would have separate production units for the common and the wine-filled sandesh.

	This has reference to the report Tallest in town amp; country, August 9. Calcuttans would be proud to have the countrys tallest building in their city but what about the problems of infrastructure, be it drainage, roads or footpaths? Once the tallest building becomes operational, traffic snarls  which are a daily feature  would get aggravated. A classic example is the South City complex where there is perennial traffic chaos despite the fact that the 35-storeyed residential complex is not fully occupied yet. The civic authorities must address such issues before granting licence to shopping malls or office complexes in future.

	We have heard of bacteria-free drinking water or cockroach-free kitchen, but never of a male-free school! We will remain thankful to the Welland Gouldsmith School Guardians Forum for mooting such a concept (Molestation sparks fly in school, August 13). Do the paranoid parents think that by the time their little princesses attain puberty the world will be male-free? Will they give them grandchildren without any assistance from males? As children grow up, parents need to imbibe values in them and equip them with survival skills like good judgement, instinct and sensibility to face the world. Todays kids are intelligent and sensible. There is no need to be paranoid.

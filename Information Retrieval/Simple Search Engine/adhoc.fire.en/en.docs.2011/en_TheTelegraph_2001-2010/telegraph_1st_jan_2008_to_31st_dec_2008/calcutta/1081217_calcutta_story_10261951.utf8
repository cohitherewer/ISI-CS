The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Market demolition on hold
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Market demolition on hold

	A 40-member civic team waited for six hours on Tuesday morning to demolish the illegal parts of the fire-scarred Nandaram market, only to be told that the mission had been deferred till New Year.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the civic body had accepted a request from Nandaram traders, who had blocked all entrances to the market, to put the demolition on hold till December 31.        
	I have honoured the request of the traders who had suffered serious losses because of the January blaze. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will certainly pull down the illegal parts of the building, Bhattacharyya said.        
	The traders, however, are in no mood to allow the demolition. The CMC is renewing our trade licences but at the same time claiming that the structure is illegal. This is unfair We will start talks with the civic body after December 31, said Samar Kanti Chowdhury of the Nandaram Market Disaster Management Committee.        
	For six hours since 10am, when the demolition squad reached the spot, the traders played a cat-and-mouse game with cops.        
	Two truckloads of civic workers, armed with sledge hammers and other demolition equipment, found their way blocked by more than 2,500 traders, who had assembled early on Tuesday. As they gathered outside the market, traffic on Brabourne Road was reduced to a crawl.        
	Eager to avoid any law and order problems, we did not try to force our way into the building, said a senior police officer.        
	The civic body tried to demolish some parts of the market on February 6 after a brick on the 12th floor came loose and fell on a labourer. But the demolition had to be called off following resistance from the traders.        
	Originally a G+23 structure, Nandaram was reduced to G+12 in 1992 following a Supreme Court order declaring the top 11 floors illegal.        
	According to the civic records, all storeys above the sixth floor are illegal.        
	The 100-hour blaze left the top floors badly damaged. Even for the buildings safety, demolition of certain parts is necessary, said a senior civic official.

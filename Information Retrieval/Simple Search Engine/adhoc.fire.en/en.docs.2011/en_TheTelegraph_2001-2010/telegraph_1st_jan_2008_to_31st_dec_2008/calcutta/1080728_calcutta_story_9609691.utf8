	A day after Calcutta police were put on high alert following the serial blasts in Bangalore, a car smashed through barricades put up in south Calcutta for surprise anti-sabotage check and disappeared from under the noses of the cops.        
	A constable who fired at the Esteems rear tyres after it flattened the guard rails kept on the Prince Anwar Shah Road-EM Bypass connector and was speeding away, managed only to hit the cars boot.         
	No one in the city polices top brass confirmed the incident but all the 48 police stations were immediately asked to look out for a silver Esteem with a bullet mark in the boot. The vehicle, however, was not traced till late Sunday.         
	The incident happened barely two km from Jadavpur police station and its clear that the car headed for EM Bypass. There were at least four patrol vans on the Bypass and three checking points but still the car disappeared. It is a matter of concern, said a senior officer of North 24-Parganas police.         
	Calcutta police started the surprise checks on vehicles entering and leaving the city after the serial blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad. According to sources, four guard rails were placed on the Bypass connector on Saturday night in such a way that each vehicle had to stop.         
	Six officers of Jadavpur police station were scanning the people in the vehicles and examining driving licences and other documents.         
	Around 1am, the Esteem approached the check post from the direction of Prince Anwar Shah Road. The officers raised their hand to make it stop but the car accelerated and hit the railings one after the other. The policemen had to jump out of its path and could not note the registration number.        
	When the constable failed to hit the cars tyres, the men in uniform did not try to chase the vehicle. Instead, they alerted the Alipore police control room, which relayed the message to the police stations and patrol vehicles.         
	The policemen deployed at Ultadanga, near the northern exit of EM Bypass, said a silver Esteem did not come their way, said an officer at Lalbazar police headquarters.         
	A retired senior officer was not surprised at the incident. Night patrol on entry and exit points of the city is weak. Motorists can get away without even being chased, he said.

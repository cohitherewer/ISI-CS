                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Colleague denies Subhas charge

	Environment minister Sailen Sarkar on Tuesday denied colleague Subhas Chakrabortys allegation that the notification on the withdrawal of 15-year-old commercial vehicles was issued keeping the transport department in the dark.        
	We decided to issue the order following talks with the transport minister and the transport secretary, Sarkar said on Tuesday in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The minister was speaking at a state pollution control board programme to mark  belatedly  World Environment Day.        
	The environment department notification was issued last Thursday. The next day, the high court converted it into an order.        
	On Monday, transport minister Chakraborty had alleged that the notification was passed without bringing the matter to his departments notice.        
	The chief minister, keen to steer clear of the controversy, refused to make any direct comment on the issue  banning old vehicles and converting others to greener fuel. Environment pollution is no longer an exclusive arena of scientists. Politicians, too, should understand the gravity of the situation and act accordingly, Bhattacharjee said.        
	He stressed the need for better networking between various departments, such as environment, disaster management and science and technology. The transport department was not on the list.         
	Sources said the notification, signed by M.L. Meena, the principal secretary in the state environment department, was cleared by the chief secretary and the advocate-general. It included some of the provisions in the earlier notifications of the transport department.        
	During the hearing in the high court last Friday, advocate general Balai Roy stated that the notification had been issued after discussions with various departments.

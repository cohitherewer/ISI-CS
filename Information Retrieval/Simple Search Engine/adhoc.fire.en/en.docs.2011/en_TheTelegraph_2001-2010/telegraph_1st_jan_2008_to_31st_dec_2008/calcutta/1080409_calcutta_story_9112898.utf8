          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Information and broadcasting (I amp;B) minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has urged chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take the initiative in ending the deadlock at the Satyajit Ray Film amp; Television Institute. The film school on the Bypass has been shut since April 3 following Citu-steered labour trouble.        
	I amp;B ministry officials said the minister had on Tuesday written to the chief minister that restoring order at the central institute was the states responsibility and that he should personally look into the matter.        
	Institute chairman Buddhadeb Dasgupta and director Swapan Mullick briefed the I amp;B ministry about the trouble on campus following the decision to replace Star Security and Detective Agency with GD Security Company. Citu has blocked the move.        
	The matter has been resolved. Guards from Star Security and Detective Agency are said to be absorbed. The announcement will be made on Wednesday, said an official on campus.

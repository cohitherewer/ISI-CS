          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths probing Tarun Kanjilals death have registered a murder case following a complaint by his mother Bina.        
	The woman has mentioned in the complaint that she suspects daughter-in-law Gouris hand in Kanjilals death.        
	We have started a probe following the complaint. Yesterday, we had interrogated Gouri for more than two hours. If necessary, we will call her again, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police.        
	Kanjilal, 47, who ran a medicine shop on Prince Anwar Shah Road, was found dead in a passage adjoining his flat in Pallisree, Jadavpur, on Wednesday morning.        
	His face was smashed, several of his bones were broken and there was a cut above his right wrist. The police initially thought he might have fallen from the roof or committed suicide. Till the post-mortem and forensic reports come, we cannot be sure about the cause of the death, he said.        
	The sleuths have learnt that the couple often fought over the visits of some of Gouris friends to their Pallishree flat. The marital discord prompted Kanjilal to admit his two daughters to a residential school in Rajarhat, said an officer.        
	Kanjilal had apparently stopped visiting the medicine store of late.

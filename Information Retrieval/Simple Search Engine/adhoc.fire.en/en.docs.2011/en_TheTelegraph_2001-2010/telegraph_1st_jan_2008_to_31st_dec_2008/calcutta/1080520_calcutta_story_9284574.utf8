                      Progress of the soul                    Sharing a passion for photography with his illustrious father Bikash Bhattacharjee, 27 year-old photographer Bivas Bhattacharjee says that he uses the medium as a means to create visual cues that help arouse emotions and experiences. Leaving Behind My House, the ongoing debut exhibition of his photographs, features a set of 20 images that portray the ascent of a soul through various stages of realisation. Taken through a period of four years, the works on show trace the significant stages of the young mans own conscious spiritual development; from the initial Mindless rebirth or Living in fear to the final Living and acting in a form qualitatively similar to the creator. Philosophical and abstract in form and content, the photographs that constitute the body of the piece are, by their makers own admission, not truly demonstrative as to what is being perceived by the soul at a certain stage in the evolutionary process.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs by Bivas Bhattacharjee When: Till May 28 (except Sunday); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Gallery Sanskriti, 5C Alipore Park Road

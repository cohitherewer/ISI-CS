     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	The Centre on Thursday sanctioned two projects worth Rs 231.83 crore for the development of slums in the city and in the districts.
    
	The projects, under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNURM), include construction of 11,282 houses and setting up of basic infrastructure in the slums.
    
	For long, we had been planning to develop the slums in the city and elsewhere in the state. Now that the Centre has sanctioned the projects, work will start in right earnest, state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said.
    
	In Calcutta, Rs 5.68 crore will be spent for the development of the Jhorobasti slums, near Tollygunge. The government has already started preliminary work for the revamp, said Bhattacharya.
    
	Each slum-dwelling family will get a single-bedroom flat with an attached bathroom and kitchen. There will be 24-hour power and water supply.
    
	The minister has called a meeting on February 6 with officials and engineers of the civic bodies of areas where development work will be taken up with central funds.
    
	Altogether, projects worth Rs 3,660 crore have been sanctioned under the JNURM. But we have been able to do very little. I have called the meeting to expedite work, the minister added.
    
	Several other projects are in the pipeline. Once they are sanctioned  likely by March  there will be enough funds to build 1.5 lakh houses for people below the poverty line.
    
	Apart from Calcutta, slum development work will be taken up in Champdani, Jamuria, Bolpur, Nabadwip, Ashoknagar, Habra, Shantipur and Jiagunj.

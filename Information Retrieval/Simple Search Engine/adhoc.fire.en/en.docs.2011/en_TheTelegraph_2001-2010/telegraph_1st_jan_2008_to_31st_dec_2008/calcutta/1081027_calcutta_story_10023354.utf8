The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blaze at shoe workshop

  - Unit had no fire licence          A STAFF REPORTER                          Fire tenders lined up in Badur Bagan Lane on Sunday afternoon. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	A fire broke out in a shoe-manufacturing unit, which was being run without a fire licence, in the Amherst Street area on Sunday afternoon.        
	Even on a rain-drenched day, eight tenders took more than 90 minutes to bring the blaze under control.        
	There were no casualties as the 30-sq ft unit at 15 Badur Bagan Lane has been lying closed for the past week, since owner Damodar Shaw left for his home in Bihar.        
	A short-circuit is believed to have triggered the fire.        
	Badur Bagan Lane is cramped with around 300 shoe-making units that deal with inflammable articles like leather, rubber and adhesives. The three-storeyed building that houses the burnt unit has 50 others, each employing five-10 people on an average.        
	The unit was being run without the fire departments permission. Other precautionary measures were not followed, too, said Gopal Bhattacharjee, the director-general of the state fire and emergency services.        
	The building was used for both residential and manufacturing-cum-storage purpose. Such an unorganised industry dealing with inflammable material should not exist in a residential area, said Bhattacharjee.        
	Local CPM legislator Anadi Sahu evaded a direct reply when asked whether the units were illegal. They have been there for over 50 years. More than 10,000 people earn their livelihood, directly or indirectly, from this industry.        
	Workers in the adjacent units saw smoke billowing from Damodar Shaws room around 12.45pm.         
	Soon, flames were leaping out of the room that was stashed with leather, rubber and chemicals, said Dinanath Shaw, a worker in an adjoining unit.        
	The buildings housing the 300-odd units are so close to each other that firemen had a tough time reaching the spot. A Kali puja pandal had to be broken to clear our way, said a fire-fighter.        
	Residents said finished products from these units find their way to stores owned by prominent brands across the city.

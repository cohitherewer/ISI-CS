                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Parent protest over death 
  - Demand for principals resignation after student tragedy          A STAFF REPORTER                          The blockade by parents. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Around 250 parents and guardians blocked Diamond Harbour Road for an hour on Monday, demanding the resignation of the principal of the school where eight-year-old Iftesham Chowdhury was slapped so hard that she went into coma and died.        
	Traffic came to a standstill from Kidderpore in the north to Behala Chowrasta in the south from 8.30am to 9.30am as the protesters raised slogans in front of Bidya Bharati School. Yoga teacher Anita Das, whose slap allegedly led to Iftesham losing her balance and hitting her head against a wall, is absconding.        
	The blockade was lifted after the school management agreed to discuss the demands of the guardians.        
	We want the principal (Anjana Mullick) to resign. Teachers and staff members who are not kind to students should be removed, said Samit Kundu, the father of a Class III student.         
	The other demands include a guardians forum that the authorities should consult before taking any major decision, counselling facilities and kindergarten training for teachers. The parents also asked the authorities to start a fund in Ifteshams name that would contribute to education of poor students.        
	Teachers often beat students with wooden scales and sticks. My daughter had pleaded with me not to complain to the principal against some teachers because they would target her, said one of the guardians.        
	The managing committee will meet and make a final decision, said school secretary B.N. Jain.        
	Mullick said she was ready to quit if the managing committee asked her to do so. I have sacked Anita. However, I made a mistake by not meeting Ifteshams parents in hospital and after her death. If the management asks me to step down after more than 24 years of service, I am ready.

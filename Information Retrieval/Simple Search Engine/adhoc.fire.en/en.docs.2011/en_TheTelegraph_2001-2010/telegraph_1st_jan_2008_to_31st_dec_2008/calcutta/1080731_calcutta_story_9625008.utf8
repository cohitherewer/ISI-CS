          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The chief minister on Wednesday gave the green light to a proposal to open a training centre for pilots and airhostesses at Behala flying club. Minister of state for technical education Chakradhar Maikap presented the proposal at Writers Buildings.         
	According to Maikaps plan, about 300 students will be trained at the centre every year. The courses will be of two to three years.         
	The technical education department is in the process of preparing a detailed project report, said an official at Writers Buildings.        
	Sources at Writers said Maikap had presented the plan to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, who had cleared it verbally.         
	The flying club on 22 bigha near Parnasree has been lying unused for years. It has a hangar and an old aeroplane, and is currently looked after by the transport department.

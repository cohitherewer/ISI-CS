The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bypass breakdown
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Bypass breakdown
  - Conceived in the Sixties, brought into being in the Eighties and now choking, the EM Bypass tells its tale                                               
	Once upon a time there were only rice fields and large ponds. I dont remember those days because I wasnt born then. Ive heard it said clusters of huts dotted the fields. Sonar Bangla was this close. At times a lone man would sit under a tree with his fishing rod hoping to catch something from the pond  a couple of which, maybe more, are still there. But all this is part imagination and part hearsay.        
	The before never bothers us. Its the after thats the problem. I am a road. But Im not just any road  there arent any any roads, really, each of us is unique. Im a bypass. I was created to save a city, which Ive never had the privilege to see. Visitors  there are many that crawl across my supine, unsmooth body every day  tell me, Boy, you havent missed much. There are some locals too who confirm in vervy vernacular the visitors view.        
	Ive been told that I was conceived  on a drawing board  sometime in the early Sixties of the last century under what was called the Basic Development Plan, the first such for Calcutta, with funds from the Ford Foundation. Sometimes I feel in my dark moments that the source of all my suffering lies in my American-sponsored origin. American is a much-mauled word in this part of the world. Who doesnt know no good can come of something American? Another word thats hated in this neck of the woods is haste. People here prefer to study things over and over again, shelve them for a time allowing them to gather dust, and then dust them and shelve them again.        
	I cant tell for sure if the story leading up to my birth in the Eighties  Calcutta had just come out of a not particularly happy decade, though a bypass wasnt probably the healing touch it needed  had been nursed with such great deliberation. All I know is the push from shelf to shelfless existence for me came from Delhi in the crisp form of Rs 150 crore of cash for Calcutta.        
	Many hundred crores have flown down my now-scarred body since. I am now grown-up, at 16 kilometres long. But at no kilometre is my body perfect. The annual nips and tucks post the rains dont help. Im spilling out at the sides, not a bad thing for roads, though not so good for you of blood and flesh. Now I am a fat lot better than I was when I started my life in the narrow lane  two to be exact  from Ultadanga to the Park Circus connector. It took only a few years to gallop to the Kasba crossing but another decade to snail to Garia.                          NORMS ACCORDING  TO THE PLAN    1.Waste recycling region  (WRR), or Dhapa: No  land-use change, or development,  was allowed    2. S-1 mdash;Agriculture along  with business buildings,  assembly buildings  and mercantile buildings  and incidental facilities  permitted    3. RI mdash;Residential and  industrial with  agriculture    4. T mdash;Only CMDA  townships were allowed    5. R mdash;Residential    REALITY CHECK    In the last decade  and a half, a number  of commercial  establishments and  even an engineering  college have come up in  the waste recycling area  in violation of the plan    Agriculture is permitted  in the entire zone, except  the township zone, but is  practised only in the  waste recycling area    A large number  of commercial  establishments have  been constructed  next to residential  buildings in the R zone    Height restrictions  are flouted    There was a provision  for taking approval from  the CMDA for any project  within 500 metres on both  sides of the Bypass but  got swamped under the  real-estate boom      
	My conceivers or conceptualisers had willed me to be 10 lanes broad. Alas, Im yet to reach that scale of breadth, though theres a stretch between the stadium and the Hyatt where Im close to 10 lanes. My parents had thought of a 10-lane expressway, mind the terminology (EXPRESSWAY), with service roads on either side.  
	Its with some sadness that I admit I dont have any servants, which is what service roads are supposed to be, along any of my 16-km length. So I am master, servant rolled into one. I cant, by force of circumstances, therefore, be the expressway you want me to be. When I was young or in my teens, it used to feel good, as if I, a piece of inert asphalt, were flying when you flew down in your cars unbridled by red and amber or by men strolling across. I was born to speed. But now its a forbidden taste, to be sampled on breezy late nights that carry the filmy-eyed young, at times to tragic ends.         
	Unhappily then Im not as broad as I should be. Nor am I skirted on either side by the green verge that protects my brothers in cities like Hyderabad. I cant also be the expressway that was to merge into another expressway vrooming the city to the airport before you could say VIP. From what I hear my expressway mate is in far worse state than I am. If I was meant to ferry wheels around at 100km an hour but can manage on some stretches half of that, VIP Road, better known as Kazi Najrul Islam Avenue, is happy the day it can make 20-30 without spilling blood.        
	Reminds me I too have a mouthfilling name, Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. I realised soon after birth how wrongly I was named. I was clogged with noxious smell rising from skin factories washing and sunning the sin off animal hides. Citizens would have an embarrassing time apologising to their foreign guests when they passed those spots. Some of the skin merchants have skedaddled to torment a spot farther south. But if the stink isnt rising any more, something else is.        
	In my age of innocence, the world around was rice and vegetable fields, some of which flourished on the detritus of the city dumped at places near me.         
	I forgot to mention that what the city disgorges causes a hell-stink too. Filth trucks drop on me their unwrapped gifts on their way to the grounds that enfold in their embrace the citys excrement.         
	I had got used to the citys stink. But had no idea its perfume would be suffocating. A giant development has come up offering high-priced living to the perfumed set. Theyve been thoughtful enough to provide lunching and dining-out options on the property itself, not to speak of five-star hospitality up and down the road. My view to the west, the way the city lies, has been blocked off all along the 16-km stretch by brick-and-mortar monsters, throwing height restrictions out of the window, I am told. As Im forced to live with the dust of development, I hear theres a rising cry that all this real estate is damming the flow of rainwater down the natural west-east slope, rushing Calcutta towards a waterlogged death.         
	Im, however, more worried about predictions about my own demise sometime around 2015 by a representative (who prefers to remain anonymous) of my minder, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. A road doesnt quite die, it subsists in a clogged-up deathlike existence. You know what I mean: like all of your roads  Chowringhee, Central Avenue. What you call arterial roads out of astonishing ignorance. If they functioned like arteries, I wouldnt be needed.        
	I hear that my chances of survival in better conditions lie in the plan for another road that also starts its drawing-board life as an expressway  Eastern Expressway  through Rajarhat. A bypass to bypass the Bypass. But my younger brother will have a harder time getting from the blueprint to the ground because land has become tougher to acquire this first decade of the 21st than it was in the Sixties of the last century.        
	I ought to feel happy my rival, who will snatch my exalted bypass status, has such a dim possibility of seeing the light of day. But, despite being a crabby Bengali by birth, I dont. Because in my rivals birth depends my continued survival. Either way, however, Im damned. I die a thousand deaths a day as another jammed-up artery or I live in the shadow of an expressway as a bypass thats not the Bypass.         
	You know what I mean.  
	WHAT WENT WRONG  
	In a 1997 study, the architecture department of IIT Kharagpur said the Bypass is plagued by several ills. The report found:    No section or intersection  provides service adequate  for an expressway  Unlimited access at several  points along the road converts  it to a low-speed one  In certain parts the land  use along the roads is  gradually changing into  shops and establishments  Improper intersections  are causing delay  Reduced capacity of  the road due to hindrances  Mixing of slow and  fast-moving vehicles  No defined lanes and  traffic discipline  No properly defined bus bays  Lack of pedestrian facilities   
	In the over 10 years since  the report, the problems have  got worse      JAYANTA BASU

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Thai air link resumes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Thai air link resumes

	Calcuttans stranded in Thailand because of political unrest will finally be able to return home as flights from Bangkok are set to resume on Friday.        
	Flights between Calcutta and Bangkok are set to resume tomorrow, an official at Calcutta airport said on Thursday. A Thai Airways flight, carrying stranded passengers, is scheduled to arrive in Calcutta from Bangkok on Friday night. The flight, with 44 business and 193 economy class seats, will be full, said a Thai Airways official.        
	Thousands of Indians, including many from the city, have been stranded in Thailand since on November 25, the day anti-government activists laid siege to Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok.        
	Jet Airways, which flies daily between Calcutta and Bangkok, will resume service on the route on December 6, an airline official said. Air India Express, which operates thrice a week, will resume service on Sunday.        
	Since the stand-off kicked in, some stranded Indians were evacuated through the Thai airbase in U-Tapau. A flight carrying 100-odd passengers had arrived in the city earlier this week. Some other passengers were brought back through Delhi. We were getting conflicting reports everyday and were not sure when we would be able to reach home, said Joy Chakraborty, who returned on December 2.        
	It was scary to be stuck in a foreign land. There were severe food problems, said city-based businessman Avtar Singh, who returned on a special flight on Tuesday.        
	In Calcutta, foreign nationals who had planned to visit Bangkok are having second thoughts. Many foreigners, including Thai nationals, are applying for an extension of their visas, said Basab Talukdar, the foreigners regional registration officer in Calcutta.

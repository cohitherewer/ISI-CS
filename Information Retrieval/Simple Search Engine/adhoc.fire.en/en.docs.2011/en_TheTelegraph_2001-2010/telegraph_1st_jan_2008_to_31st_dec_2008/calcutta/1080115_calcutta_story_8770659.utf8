 - JU report clears anti-SFI unions of violence and arson charges
     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                  
	The one-man commission, set up by the chief minister to probe the Jadavpur University violence in April last year, has rubbished the allegations of the CPM-backed Karmachari Samsad against three anti-SFI student associations.
    
	The panel, headed by Ashoke Mohan Chakraborty, the additional chief secretary in charge of higher education, has observed that there is no evidence to prove that any member of the three associations  Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu), We the Independents (WTI) and Forum of Arts Students (FAS)  was involved in the violence and arson on the night of April 5.
    
	The Samsad, a body of non-teaching employees of the university, had alleged that the three anti-SFI groups had ransacked its office, set it on fire and looted items worth Rs 60,000. According to some Samsad members, the groups had also ransacked the Science Club of the university.
    
	The arson followed the students union elections of the science faculty, which was won by the WTI.
    
	The Chakraborty commission report, a copy of which is with Metro, was placed before the universitys executive council last Wednesday.
    
	As many as 187 witnesses appeared before the commission, but none could name an individual who had taken part in the destruction of the properties, the report said. The inquiry commission is not in a position to name the persons who destroyed the Samsad office and the Science Club.
    
	More than 70 teachers and around 300 non-teaching employees stay on the campus, which also houses six hostels, accommodating over 700 students. Nobody had witnessed the Samsad office being set on fire, the report said.
    
	The panel also found no truth in the Samsads allegation that anti-SFI students had tried to prevent fire tenders from reaching the spot. An officer of Gariahat fire station told the panel that nobody had stopped the fire tenders at the university gate that day.
    
	The commission has expressed concern over the way Samsad leaders had asked the securitymen on the campus not to intervene. It was, indeed, strange that the securitymen had been advised by the senior leaders of the Karmachari Samsad not to confront the trouble-makers
    
	The panel has urged the authorities to evolve a code of conduct to improve the relationship between the Samsad and the student bodies.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	A youth being tried for double murder scaled the boundary wall to escape Howrah jail with a 22ft ladder he had stitched together bit by bit over a month and then hidden on the premises.        
	One of his two accomplices landed in the drain bordering the wall, broke his foot and was caught. Seeing this mishap, another prisoner aborted his jailbreak attempt and slipped back inside.        
	Nandan Barua, the jailer, lodged a complaint with Howrah police station against chief warden Harish Chandra Singh, who was arrested late on Friday.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that Dilip Singh and his accomplices used a ladder fashioned out of branches of trees, pieces of wood, ropes and towels over a month to scale the wall.        
	The owner of a grocery shop on PK Banerjee Road opposite the jail said he saw a youth jump off the northeastern corner of the wall around 8.30am and thought he was a labourer employed by the authorities. When two more youths clambered to the top of the wall and one of them jumped down, I raised an alarm, said the trader.        
	By the time residents, policemen and guards ran to the spot, Dilip, dressed in shirt, trousers and sneakers, had reached GT Road and melted into the crowd. Pankaj Jha was lying in the drain, writhing in pain. Their third partner had not been identified till Friday night.        
	The district police accused the jail authorities of negligence. Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police, said: More than a month ago, I had received an intelligence input that Dilip might try to flee the jail. I informed the inspector-in-charge of Sankrail police station, who wrote to the jail authorities on November 18. Even after that, security wasnt tightened.         
	The jail authorities refused comment but sources indicated that the plan could not have been hatched without insider involvement. Warden Harish Chandra Singh had reportedly asked Dilip and Pankaj to clean a womens toilet at the northeastern corner of the compound. Inmates are not supposed to move around before 10am but the two  not in jail uniform  went to clean the toilet around 8.15am.        
	Dilip had shot Prakash Singh, 21, and Suren Singh, 30, in May 28, 2007, at Shish Mahal Bar in Alampur, Howrah. He was arrested on the same day and sent to Howrah jail.

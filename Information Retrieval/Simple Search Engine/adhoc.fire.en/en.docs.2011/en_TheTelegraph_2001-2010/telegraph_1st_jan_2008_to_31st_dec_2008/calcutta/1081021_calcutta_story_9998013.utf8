The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cratered corridor to mishap

	More than a dozen people have been killed in two dozen accidents on the Kona Expressway in the past eight months. Potholes and craters have turned the 7-km stretch from Sheikhpara to Kona Truck Terminal into a death trap. But the state public works department (PWD)s highway division has only carried out patchwork on the high-speed corridor so far.        
	Senior traffic police officers in Howrah attributed the rise in the number of accidents to several other factors.        
	An officer of Howrah traffic guard said: The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has failed to maintain the road properly. Moreover, there are no traffic signals at important points and no underpasses, service roads, overbridges and speed-breakers. These are a must on an expressway for smooth movement of traffic.         
	The condition of the expressway is particularly bad near Santragachhi and Garfa bridges and between Batore and Drainage Canal Road, where accidents are common.        
	A traffic officer said: The Santragachhi bridge was not constructed properly. The slope is too steep and heavy vehicles often break down on the way up. The NHAI knows about the problem but why it does not try to rectify the fault is a mystery.        
	Several large craters near Santragachhi bridge add to the problem. This is the most accident-prone zone.         
	The poor condition of the road leads to long traffic snarls, particularly in the evening. Vehicles are forced to slow down to negotiate craters. Ambulances on the way to Howrah District Hospital, the largest in the district, also get caught in the snarls.         
	Debjit Ghosh, the manager (food and beverage) of Lake Land Country Club, said: I take the expressway on the way to my homes in Andul and Mudiali. It is a horror ride on my motorcycle. I dont know how the authorities can be so callous.         
	Under pressure from the Howrah traffic department, workmen from the PWDs highway division started filling up the craters last week. Traffic policemen feel the patchwork will not last more than a month.        
	Asit Manna, the executive engineer of the Howrah highway division of PWD (Roads), said only patchwork is being done as the NHAI had not sanctioned funds for the renovation of the stretch. We have submitted an estimate to the NHAI for revamping the road.

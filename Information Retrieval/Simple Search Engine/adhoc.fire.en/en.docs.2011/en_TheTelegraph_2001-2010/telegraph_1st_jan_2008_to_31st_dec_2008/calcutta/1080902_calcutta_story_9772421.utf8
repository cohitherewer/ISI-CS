                      Creative analysis                    The ever-widening chasm between virtuous ideals and the harsh reality of the present is a source for concern to all right-thinking, responsible individuals. Constructing the Present, the ongoing exhibition of paintings by a group of artists, examines how this gap is shaping contemporary artistic practice. It shows the complex way in which politics, art and philosophy are integrated and intersected in the context of our society, resulting in some obvious contradictions. Tracing the historical journey of our civilisation, it points out how the modern generation has moved away from tradition, with dangerous consequences. Significantly, the exhibition also shows the unique, distinctive characteristics of India that remain pure and unchanged in spite of the influence of globalisation. Participating artists: Manjari Chakravarti, Tapati Chowdhury, Chhatrapati Dutta, S.Gopinath, Jahangir Jani, Mahbubur Rahman (a painting by him appears here), Rajeswara Rao, Tamay Samanta, Partha Shaw, Deepak Tandon and Babu Xavier.

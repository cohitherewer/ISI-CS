The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Park Street pause for Big Mac
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Park Street pause for Big Mac
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The doors to McDonalds Park Street outlet are still firmly shut but the company is bullish about a third food stop at City Centre II and a fourth drive-through eatery in collaboration with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited.        
	The fast food giant will invest Rs 100-150 crore in the east in the next two-three years, said Vikram Bakshi, the managing director of McDonalds (north and east).        
	The Park Street outlet can open as soon as clearances come through. It shut down in August last year, five months after opening, following an explosion that killed a pedestrian and injured four employees.        
	We are ready to open the Park Street store and are awaiting clearances. The major clearance is from the fire services department. We have done everything possible. Fire officials say there have been fires elsewhere (read Haldirams) and they have to be sure before giving us the licence. We have changed the entire air-conditioning system and the outlet will run completely on electricity, said Bakshi.        
	This will make the 140-seater eatery the sixth electricity-run McDonalds in India. Delhi airport houses the only other electricity-run outlet of the company in the northern and eastern region.        
	Special equipment has been flown in for the Park Street eatery, according to Bakshi.        
	We have received the application for fire clearance and are in the process of going through it. In a couple of days we should be in a position to say if we are granting the clearance or not and if they need to take any more measures to get the clearance, said Gopal Bhattacharjee, the director-general of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.        
	A 170-seater Big Mac is slated to open at City Centre II in Rajarhat in the first quarter of 2009. AJC Bose Road and an undisclosed location are being considered for the outlet in collaboration with Hindustan Petroleum.        
	The Mani Square store hosts 2,750 guests on an average per day. Overall, we are gaining and are recession-resistant because we are affordable. There is a shift in the consumer habit from fine dining to casual dining, said Bakshi.

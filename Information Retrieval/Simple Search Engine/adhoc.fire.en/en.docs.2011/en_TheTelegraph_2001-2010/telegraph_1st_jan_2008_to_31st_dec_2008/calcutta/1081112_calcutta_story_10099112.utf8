                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Fever claims 14-yr-old
  - Vector casualty 30 but health department withdraws experts          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	A 14-year-old girl died of an undiagnosed fever on Tuesday, taking the toll from vector-borne diseases in the city this season to 30.        
	The growing list of casualties, however, has not stopped the state health department from withdrawing its specialists who were coordinating with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to curb the mosquito menace.        
	Officials said the department, facing a manpower crunch, could not spare the experts any more.        
	The latest vector victim, Puja Mondal, died at MR Bangur Hospital around 10.45am. Mother Shyamali said the doctors suspected that Puja was suffering from dengue.        
	The resident of Bishnupur, on the citys southern fringes, had been running a temperature since Monday morning.        
	Her condition worsened in the afternoon. She was taken to a neighbourhood doctor who advised immediate hospitalisation, said Manik Adak, Pujas uncle. The girls father, Gautam Mondal, is a contract labourer in Siliguri.        
	On Tuesday morning, relatives took Puja to MR Bangur Hospital. Her condition kept deteriorating, prompting doctors to put her on intravenous drip. But she could not be revived.        
	The hospital had collected her blood sample but the report is yet to come, her uncle said.         
	The blood test report of 10-year-old Oikyanarayan Bhattacharya, who died at Institute of Child Health on Sunday morning, revealed on Tuesday that he had been suffering from dengue.        
	The platelet count was dangerously low. He had been vomiting blood, said a family member of the victim from Baranagar.        
	The vector battle has taken a beating following the withdrawal of the nine teams of experts the state health department had deployed to coordinate with the CMC.        
	It was an emergency measure that could not continue forever. The deployment of the experts resulted in a severe manpower shortage in the department, said an official.        
	With winter approaching, the vector situation should be under control soon... The CMC is now implementing its own vector-control measures, said another official.        
	The nine teams worked for around 20 days, helping civic officials to control mosquito breeding and run awareness campaigns.

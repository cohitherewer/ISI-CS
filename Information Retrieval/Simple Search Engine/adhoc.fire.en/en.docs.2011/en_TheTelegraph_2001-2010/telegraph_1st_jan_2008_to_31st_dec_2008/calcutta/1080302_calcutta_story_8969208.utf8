The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rush to ready book fair
                                                                                                               Rush to ready book fair

	So what if booklovers have lost enthusiasm by now and the stalls are not ready yet? Boi Mela 2008 is here.        
	Enter the main gate of Salt Lake stadium and chaos greets you. Its the first day of the fair but few stalls look ready. As carpenters, decorators and publishers scamper to get things in order, a group of police officers enjoy an adda session.        
	We have our forces ready. But is the book fair ready for the evening rush? It will take the organisers at least a day or two to get things in order, says a cop.        
	But where are the organisers? Till one in the afternoon they were not to be seen and their office was locked. They should be present at the fair venue from the morning, at least on the first day of the fair, said Ravi Singh, a visitor who runs an IT-solutions firm in Delhi.         
	Only two stalls seemed complete. Right in the centre was the American consulates stall. The stall was ready and even the books had been placed in the shelves. All that was left was the flag-off. The deadline is sacrosanct for us, said Pulak R. Pattanayak, the special services librarian of the American Library.        
	Oxford University Press was also almost ready for the evening. As their employees helped decorators get things in order, publicity executive Devika Chatterjee rued the loss of business on Day One. If we cant sell anything on the first day, its a major loss, she said.        
	The organisers had a different story to tell. We purposely kept our office closed till 1pm as we did not want to be flooded with a flurry of requests from various kinds of people, said Subrojyoty Paul, a ground committee member.        
	The last-minute confusion is because we got the grounds late. We were handed over the main area only on Wednesday. How can we get things in order within such a short time? We were allotting stalls till last night, he added.         
	The chief architect of the book fair, Subhonlal Bonnerjee, was still seen immersed in an elaborate plan of the fairground. We promise you a more compact fair this time. We have omitted stalls on the periphery of the stadium so that book-lovers dont have to walk much. But we need time to get things in order, he said.        
	Outside the office, a member of Bangiya Prakashak O Pustak Bikreta Sabha could not stop gushing that unlike previous years, space allotment has been fair this time. Previously guild members would manipulate and get the best stalls. But this time the guild is not the only one organising the fair. So the lottery was fair and as luck would have it, many important publishers have got undesirable stalls, he said gleefully.

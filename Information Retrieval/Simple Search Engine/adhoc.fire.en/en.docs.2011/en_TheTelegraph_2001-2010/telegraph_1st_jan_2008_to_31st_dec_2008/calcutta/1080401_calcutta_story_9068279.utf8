The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal buildings dot Buddhapara
                                                                                                               Illegal buildings dot Buddha para
                                          
	Illegal construction continues in the chief ministers Palm Avenue neighbourhood and its adjacent areas, even a month after the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the city police formed a wing to crack down on such structures.        
	The area has been witnessing a realty boom over the past few years. Local youths, with the blessings of political leaders, have emerged as small-time promoters to cash in on the trend. Metro runs a check on the high-security neighbourhood, where rule violation is the norm.                
	5E Palm Avenue        
	What we saw: The first floor of the building was being extended. The portion under construction was covered with tarpaulin and four labourers were working overtime to finish work.        
	Borough office: The landlord did not take our consent for the construction, said an official. The landlords of several buildings are adding floors illegally. Since its an elite area, they earn lakhs by renting out the floors.        
	Localspeak: Residents said illegal construction thrives with the backing of a section of civic and police officers. Promoters pay a hefty amount to officials of the building department and the police station and carry out illegal construction with impunity. Several complaints to Karaya police station have not yielded any results, said Atanu Bhattacharya, a retired central government employee.                
	54 Bright Street        
	What we saw: A two-storeyed building stood on the premises of a para club.        
	Borough office: The construction is illegal. Since the building was raised by local youths who wanted to open a school in it, we did not object, an official said.        
	Localspeak: We were forced to turn a blind eye to the illegal construction as local CPM cadres were involved in it. The ground floor has been handed over to an NGO, which runs a school there. Local youths drink and gamble on the first floor, said a resident, who did not want to be named.                
	5F Palm Avenue        
	What we saw: Two illegal floors were constructed barely 500 metres from the chief ministers residence. Six families had moved in. The civic body demolished the floors after Metro published a report last year, but the landlord reconstructed them.        
	Borough office: The construction is illegal. Most of the promoters in the area have been accused of violating building rules but it is difficult to act against them, as they are backed by political parties, an official said.        
	Localspeak: Several complaints have been lodged with the local police station but nothing came out of them, said a resident.                
	Councillorspeak: I have prepared a list of illegal structures in my area and will soon hand it over to the mayor. The accused promoters are mostly backed by the CPM and the Trinamul Congress. We will raze all unauthorised structures, said RSP councillor Sushil Sharma.

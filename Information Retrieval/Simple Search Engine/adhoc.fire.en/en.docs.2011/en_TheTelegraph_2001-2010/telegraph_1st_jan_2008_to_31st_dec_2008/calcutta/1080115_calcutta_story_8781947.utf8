	The Bengal government cares about the party, not the people. They have failed us. Our gov- ernment will arrive tomorrow.
    
	After waiting 48 hours for the fire at Nandaram to be put out, this was what a Rajasthani trader, who had lost everything in the blaze, had to say late on Sunday.
    
	His government  seven ministers, MLAs, MPs and officials from BJP-ruled Rajasthan  arrived on Monday morning and worked overtime to extend a helping hand to the brethren allegedly let down in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees backyard.
    
	The Bengal vs Rajasthan face-off turned ugly at Writers Buildings later in the day, when the delegation members said they were humiliated and insulted by fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee, who refused to talk to them.
    
	With a minister like you, no wonder the fire is still burning, said a member of Team Rajasthan, riled by Chatterjees rebuff.
    
	The fire services minister stuck to his guns. I was preoccupied and the delegation from Rajasthan had not taken an appointment. They almost barged into my room. Why should I talk to them? demanded Chatterjee.
    
	MP Subash Meharia from Sikar said the team would urge chief minister Vasundhara Raje to take up the matter with her Bengal counterpart. We are shocked. At a time when Burrabazar is burning, the minister tells us that he has nothing to say, brushes us aside and walks off.
    
	The BJP was quick to pounce, with spokesperson Prakash Javadekar saying in Delhi: The fire in Burrabazar has brought to the fore the abysmal failure of the Left Front government in Bengal. We condemn the attitude of the government and demand a high-level inquiry.
    
	Javadekar went on to list the problem points in the state governments handling of the Nandaram Market blaze: Failure of making water available, not allowing the army to take any corrective action, failure of many fire tenders and the callous attitude of those in power....
    
	The delegation members in Burrabazar demanded that the Bengal government construct a building on the spot and rehabilitate the traders. They also called for temporary arrangements and Rs 10 lakh compensation for each trader. 
    
	Chief minister Vasundhara Raje is very concerned about the fire. More than 85 per cent of the traders whose shops were destroyed in the blaze are from Rajasthan and it is our duty to help them, said Rajasthan education minister Kalicharan Saraf.
    
	The team spoke to the traders and later met the governor. We will submit a report to the chief minister, said a member of the delegation. The blaze is the outcome of a conspiracy between the government machinery and land sharks who have been eyeing the property for a long time. We want a CBI inquiry.

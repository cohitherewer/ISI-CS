          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	A tipsy teenaged girl tottered in the middle of the road close to midnight, bringing cars to a screeching halt, and screamed at policemen when they came near.        
	Dont touch me Let me live my own way, the college student, in jeans and a printed top, shouted at the policemen who tried to persuade her to move onto the Vivekananda Road pavement near the Maniktala crossing.        
	Later, crying, Preeti (name changed) told the police that she was left with no one to take care of her after her mother died of cancer a month ago.        
	She was spotted by constables of Amherst Street police station around 11.45 on Tuesday night when she parked her unsteady self in the middle of the road.         
	Since we had no women police with us, we could not use force on the girl, said an officer.        
	Two constables posted at the kiosk at the Maniktala crossing walked up to her after a pedestrian informed them that a young girl was laughing, standing on the road.         
	Three cars were behind her. She was laughing and shouting at the motorists, saying she would not allow them to go home, said a constable.        
	Ami jakhon bari jabo na, tomrao bari jabe na (If I dont go home, you will not either), Preeti screamed, throwing her hands in the air and breaking into peals of laughter.        
	The constables went close to her to protect her from being run over. Do not touch me, she shouted.        
	Sensing trouble, the constables called in two of their colleagues. As Preeti wobbled, the four cops cordoned her off and persuaded her to walk up to the pavement.        
	(But) The girl suddenly started running along the pavement, she was heading towards the middle of the road again, said an officer.        
	The four cops blocked her way as a police vehicle reached the spot, by when the girl had started crying as she narrated the loss of her mother.         
	We said we would share her pain sitting in an air-conditioned room at the police station. She got on the vehicle, the officer said.        
	It had taken half an hour to bring her under control.        
	At the station, she revealed the name and contact numbers of her father and twin sister. She was handed over to her father.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A hub of tinder boxes
                                                                                                            A hub of tinder boxes
  - Firefighting an impossible task in tall buildings in narrow lanes					 					      TT for City                
	The 100-hour-long blaze in Nandaram Market drove home Burrabazars vulnerability to fire. Firefighters have warned that such a disaster is waiting to strike again. Tall buildings in narrow lanes makes firefighting difficult, said Bibhas Guha, the division officer (central) of West Bengal Fire Service. In civic records, around 830 buildings in the trade hub are either illegal or unsafe. Metro visits three of them  all in ward 22 and owned by one promoter.        
	Where: 58 and 58/1 Sir Hariram Goenka Street.        
	What we saw: The gap between the adjacent addresses, both four-storeyed structures, is barely 2 ft. The narrow stretch leads to a makeshift kitchen, where huge ovens burn through the night as karigars fry bhujia and other snacks in huge pans. The buildings, which have come closer over the years, have grown bigger both horizontally and vertically. The number of tenants, too, has risen, say local people. Construction was on to the rear of the two buildings when Metro went to the spot on Friday afternoon.        
	Localspeak: I have been practising here for 50 years. Last year, the owner of 58/1 bought the adjacent two-storeyed house and soon added two more floors to it, said Dr Bimal Chandra Paul, who has his chamber on the ground floor of 58/1. Illegal construction is on.... There is so little space that patients cannot be brought in on stretchers.              
	Where: 2/2B Chetan Seth Street.        
	What we saw: The new four-storeyed building shares its walls with the adjacent 5B Sir Hariram Goenka Street, which is more than 50 years old. According to civic building rules, a gap of six feet is a must between between two adjacent buildings. The lane that leads to the building, which is two blocks from Chetan Seth Street, can accommodate only one person at a time.        
	Localspeak: We dont know what will happen to us if a fire breaks out, said P.S. Agarwal, who has a shop at 5B Sir Hariram Goenka Street. Local residents alleged the civic body has not taken any action against the owner despite repeated pleas.              
	Where: 2 Sir Hariram Goenka Street.        
	What we saw: A new seven-storeyed building on a road that is hardly six feet wide. Local residents claimed that the plan the civic body had sanctioned was for three storeys only. And construction is reportedly on to add more floors.        
	Localspeak: The building flouts all norms. We are engaged in a legal fight with the promoter, said Narayan Sharma, a resident of 60/A Nalini Seth Road.        
	Councillorspeak: I am aware of the illegal constructions. But they are commonplace everywhere, said Meena Devi Purohit.        
	Ownerspeak: We are not involved in any illegal construction We have the required permissions, said Bikki Shikharia.

     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Aftab Alam Ansari had planned to meet leaders of Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami in Lucknow between December 28 and 31, according to Uttar Pradesh police.
    
	The 27-year-old suspected militant arrested in Baranagar on Friday had visited Lucknow and Gorakhpur several times telling his office that he was going on vacation.
    
	We found out from the attendance register of the power utility where Ansari worked that he was on leave for a week in November when the serial blasts took place in courts in Lucknow, Varanasi and Faizabad. Ansari had also applied for leave for four days from December 28, said an officer of the Special Task Force (STF) of UP police.
    
	It seems that Ansaris arrest has helped us to avert another round of explosions, added the officer.
    
	The name of Ansari, a wing commander of Harkat, came up after STF officers arrested Mohammad Khalid and Tarique at Barabanki railway station a week ago. During interrogation, the duo stated that Ansari had ferried explosives that were used in the blasts in Lucknow. They also said that Ansari was in Uttar Pradesh till the explosions were carried out.
    
	He used to take leave often. If we asked him the reason, he would say that he was going on vacation. Sometimes, he cited family problems, said a colleague of Ansari.
    
	The call records on Tariques cellphone show that Ansari had made several missed calls. Besides, calls were made to Tarique from public phones around Ansaris house, said an STF officer.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court declined to grant the custody of an 11-year-old boy to his father on Thursday, bypassing the natural right of a parent over his minor child.         
	The boy, Sanjit Rai, had been sent by his father to work as a domestic help in Calcutta, where he was allegedly beaten and tortured regularly. Unable to bear it, Sanjit ran away.         
	The father will not get custody of the child until the boy is fit and the persons responsible for his present condition are tried before the appropriate court, a division bench of Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice Tapas Kumar Giri said in its order.        
	Legal experts say that though parents have the right to seek custody of their minor child, the court passed the order on humanitarian ground.         
	The father, who stays in Bihars Chhapra village, had sent Sanjit to Calcutta to work as a bonded labour. The court believes that the child would be sent back to work in another place if the father is given his custody, the experts said.         
	Sanjit is currently staying at Cini Asha, a home for the destitute. On Thursday, the judge handed the responsibility of taking the child to SSKM Hospital for treatment to Bharati Mutsuddhi, the court-appointed special officer. The state will have to bear the expenses for Sanjits treatment.        
	Sanjit was brought to Calcutta by a man from his village and placed in the service of Manish Pradhan at Gariahat Road. Manishs wife, Debarati, allegedly beat him mercilessly for small mistakes and even branded him with red-hot tongs for breaking a glass.        
	When the neighbours got wind of the torture, they helped Sanjit run away and took him to Gariahat police station. On the basis of his complaint lodged on July 17, Debarati was arrested, but was later granted bail by an Alipore court. The case is still pending. The Alipore court had ordered that the child would stay at Cini Asha.         
	A person claiming to be Sanjits uncle then petitioned the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) for custody of the child. The CWC said Sanjit would only be handed over to his father after his statement is recorded before a magistrate. The uncle then moved high court.

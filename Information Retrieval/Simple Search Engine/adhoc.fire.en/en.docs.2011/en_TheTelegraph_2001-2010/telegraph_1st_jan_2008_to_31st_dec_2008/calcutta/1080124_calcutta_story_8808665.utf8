	Krishnadas Ghosh lost a leg but gained a second life at Nightingale nursing home. But to no credit to his doctor, who issued a death certificate in his name when he was only recuperating.
    
	The 66-year-old yoga teacher was hit by a truck near his home at Maheshpur in West Midnapore last month. He was brought to Calcutta and admitted to Nightingale, on Shakespeare Sarani, on December 14. The doctors decided to amputate his leg, which was smashed under the rear wheels of the truck.
    
	My father was very fit. We could not believe that he would not be able walk on his own again. We dreaded to inform him about the doctors decision, said Krishnadass son Tapan.
    
	The surgery was performed on schedule. When Tapan visited the nursing home later, the authorities handed him Krishnadass death certificate (a copy of which is with Metro), declaring that he had expired on January 2, 2008, at 4.45pm.
    
	I could not believe my eyes, said Tapan. He broke down in the hospital lobby before calling up his family members and giving them the news. When Tapan finally went to his fathers bed to see his body, he found that Krishnadas was very much alive, though not in the best of health.
    
	I nearly collapsed on seeing my father alive, recounted the son.
    
	It was a bad mistake, admitted S.C. Bhattacharya, a senior administrative official of the nursing home. He refused to elaborate on the matter.
    
	Krishnadas is yet to get over the loss. I dont want to live without a leg. I wouldnt like to be a burden on my family. Yoga was my world and my students were like my children. Without yoga, nothing has any meaning, he said.

                      Creative printmaking                    Like chamber music, the language of printmaking is soft, intimate and unobtrusive. While a painter has an entire orchestra of colours at his disposal, a printmaker works with only black, white and a few basic colours. Yet, these colours are enough to express a spectrum of emotions; from the moods of nature to the feelings of the heart. Outlines and silhouettes of a subject express wit and humour, revealing character better and in a more subtle manner than their coloured counterparts. Printmaking, originally invented and used for commercial purposes, is now an independent and eloquent mode of creative expression. Masters of Bengal, the ongoing show of graphic works by renowned artists, presents a collection of prints that offers a veritable feast for those with a taste for the aesthetic. Participants: Somnath Hore, Ramendra Nath Chakraborty, Nandalal Bose, Dharmanarayan Dasgupta, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Shyamal Dutta Roy, Ganesh Pyne, Bikash Bhattacharjee, K.G. Subramanyan and others.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bullet-hit trader chases attackers
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 50-year-old man in Naihati braved a bullet injury in his shoulder and chased away the attackers before passing out.        
	Rathin Bhowmik, a trader dealing in electronic goods, stepped out of his Bijoynagar Colony home, on the northern fringes of the city, around 2.30pm when three youths on a red motorcycle approached him.        
	Bhowmik was carrying a bucket-load of garbage which he wanted to dump in a nearby vat.        
	The youths asked Bhowmik whether his brother Ashis, who runs an electronic goods shop in Behala, was at home, said an officer of Naihati police station.        
	Bhowmik told them that Ashis had left for his shop and started walking towards the vat. Moments later, one of the youths shot at him. The bullet hit him in his left shoulder and he fell down, the officer added.        
	But Bhowmik, who had been a footballer in his youth and still maintains a fitness regime, promptly stood up and threw the steel bucket at the trio.        
	One of them fell off the two-wheeler under the impact. But he quickly got on the vehicle and the trio sped off, the officer quoted a witness as saying.        
	Bhowmik, bleeding profusely, tried to catch up with the motorcycle but he lost consciousness and slumped to the ground after running about 20 metres.        
	He was taken to Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital in Kalyani and later shifted to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. The police said he was out of danger.        
	A case under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder) has been started against the unidentified trio. We are trying to track down the attackers and find out what prompted them to fire at Bhowmik. The investigating officers have come across a few leads and are preparing the sketches of the trio, said Pravin Tripathi, the additional superintendent of police, Barrackpore.        
	The residents who saw the youths speed off towards the Kalyani Expressway told the cops that they were in their mid-20s. The gun, the officers said, was a country-made single-shot.        
	The cops are investigating whether the murder attempt was linked to business rivalry. But the Bhowmiks ruled out the possibility.        
	My brother doesnt have any enemies. We are clueless about the motive behind the attack, said Bhowmiks brother Ashis.

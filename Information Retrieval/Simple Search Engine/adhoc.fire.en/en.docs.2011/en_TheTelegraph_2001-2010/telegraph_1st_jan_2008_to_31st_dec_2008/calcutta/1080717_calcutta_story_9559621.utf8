                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       JEE board to reveal marks
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Wednesday directed the member secretary of the JEE board to assess the marks of physics, chemistry and biology papers of Salman Khatun within a week and inform the student details of the marks.        
	Justice Soumitra Pal passed the order on the basis of a plea by Khatun who alleged that the board did not assess her answer scripts as she had forgotten to mention her enrollment number for the multiple choice questions.         
	Moving the petition on June 18, Khatuns lawyer Saptarshi Roy said his client made two representations before the member secretary, but he did not give any reply.

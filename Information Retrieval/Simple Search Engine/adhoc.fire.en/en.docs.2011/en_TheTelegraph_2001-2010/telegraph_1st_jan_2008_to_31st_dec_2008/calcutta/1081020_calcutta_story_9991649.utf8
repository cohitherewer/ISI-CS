          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Sudeshna Majumdar (name changed) spent almost Rs 3 lakh to train to be an airhostess before joining a private airline as a trainee in February this year. The 22-year-old now wants a more secure job in another industry.         
	My dream since college was to become a flight stewardess. But what happened to some of my friends in Jet, and earlier in JetLite, has shaken me, said Sudeshna. She has dropped her CV in hotels and advertising agencies. She is willing to take up a job in either sector, as long as she is not in danger of being fired.         
	The slump in the aviation industry has made the youngest recruits of various airlines the most insecure. The feeling intensified with Jet Airways sacking 1,900 probationers (only to take them back) and Kingfisher cutting the salaries of trainee pilots.         
	The threat of job loss and pay cut is looming large. Junior employees are applying in other sectors fearing that they will be sacked, quot; said a senior official of a low-cost carrier.        
	According to aviation industry sources, commercial staff are eyeing hospitality, advertising and marketing, real estate and retail sectors, while technical crew are exploring options in the automobile and related industries.         
	Jobs, even in sectors other than aviation, will be hard to come by, said a Jet employee. There is a freeze on recruitment in many firms because of the economic downturn. And if aviation suffers, sectors like hospitality will also be hit.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta airport authorities have ordered a probe to find out how a passenger nearly boarded an Air India flight to Aizwal on Saturday with two bullets in his cabin baggage.        
	The CISF has been asked to submit a detailed report on why the bullets could not be traced during mandatory security checks, said a senior airport official on Monday.         
	The bullets in Mizoram-resident Lalma Lalsama Zasais bag were found during an extra security check.        
	The CISF men said they did not scan the bag because it had gone though the X-ray for registered luggage and carried a security tag.        
	Zasai was carrying it as cabin baggage because his registered luggage had exceeded the 20-kg limit.        
	An Air India official said on Monday that Zasais bag might not have passed through an X-ray.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       37 bombs found in container
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Thirty-seven crude bombs were recovered on Friday from an abandoned garage on Lockgate Road, in the Chitpur police station area.         
	Officers rushed to the spot after a tip-off and found the bombs in a cooking-oil container.        
	The container was sealed, so we let the bomb disposal squad officers handle them, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that the bombs were manufactured a couple of days ago but not inside the garage.        
	We suspect that the bombs were brought in to create chaos during the bandh days. We are yet to ascertain which political party was responsible for this, said an officer of Chitpur police station.

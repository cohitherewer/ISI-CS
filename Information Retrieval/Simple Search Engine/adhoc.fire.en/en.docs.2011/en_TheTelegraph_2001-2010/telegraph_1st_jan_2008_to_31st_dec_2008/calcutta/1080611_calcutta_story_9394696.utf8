                The Bagha Jatin flyover, which was closed for repairs in September last year, will be opened to traffic on Wednesday. Repairs worth Rs 25 lakh were carried out on it barely six years after its construction. Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya will be present at the reopening ceremony, scheduled for 8.30am on Wednesday.    Gautam Mullick, a resident of Ezra Street, was arrested on Tuesday and Rs 4 lakh recovered from his bank account, which was deposited by Mahesh Boi, the prime accused in connection with the theft of Rs 20 lakh from the RN Mukherjee Road office of tax consultant Anindya Kundu. Boi had been ordered to collect Rs 20 lakh from Kundus clients and keep the cash in the office safe. But Boi left with part of the amount for his home in Balasore. He was accompanied by his uncle Ratan Pai and his friend Gautam. Gautam received Rs 4 lakh while Bois uncle made another Rs 3 lakh. After raiding Bois Balasore home, cops failed to find Gautam but recovered Rs 1 lakh that he had kept with a friend. Till Tuesday, the total amount recovered stood at Rs 16 lakh.    A section of employees of Calcutta University (CU) threatened to launch a movement protesting the authorities decision to mark absent all employees who had failed to turn up for work on June 6, the day the Trinamul Congress had called a 12-hour bandh. They alleged that no such decision was taken for the CPM bandh on June 5. Questioning the dual policy of the authorities, members of Calcutta University Employees Unity Centre submitted a memorandum to the university registrar on Tuesday. They have demanded that the university frame a fixed policy on whether employees failing to attend duty on bandh days should be marked absent or not, Dipak Das, the general secretary of the unit, said.    An autorickshaw knocked down a traffic constable, Mantu Pathak, near Ultadanga on Tuesday. He was rushed to a nursing home with a right knee injury. The auto has been impounded and the driver arrested.    A middle-aged man died near Calcutta airport after being hit by a taxi on Tuesday morning. Mohammad Sheikh, 38, was crossing the road when the taxi, heading towards Barasat, hit him. He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.    Police will crack down from Wednesday on hawkers blocking more than one-third the width of the pavement or carrying on business on the carriageway, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said on Tuesday. He has also asked the police to confiscate the wares.

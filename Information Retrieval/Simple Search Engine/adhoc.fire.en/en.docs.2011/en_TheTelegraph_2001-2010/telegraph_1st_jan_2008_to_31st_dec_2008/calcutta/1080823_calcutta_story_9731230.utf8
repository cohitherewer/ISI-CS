                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Runaway girl found at station
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sraboni Midday                                  
	A nine-year-old girl in school uniform was found loitering in Liluah railway station on Thursday night and handed over to Government Railway Police (GRP).        
	Sraboni Midday did not say where she lived but claimed that she had run away as her mother used to torture her for not studying. Residents of the area took her to GRP officers, who later sent her to Don Bosco Asalayam Home in Liluah.         
	Sibu Ghosh, the officer-in-charge of Belur GRP, said: Around 11pm on Thursday, a resident handed over the girl to us saying that she was loitering on platform 3 of Liluah station. We gave her food and kept her in a room in the police station at night. We requested a woman from the area to stay with her.        
	On Friday morning, officers asked Sraboni her address. She only told them her fathers name and that she fled home as her mother often used to beat her up for not studying.        
	The girl is very shy. She took a long time to say that she, along with some friends, went to a railway station after school and boarded a train. She got down at Liluah station because she was hungry, added the officer-in-charge.        
	Sraboni could not say where her friends were but insisted that they got on the train with her. She told the cops her fathers name was Sukumar Midday but could not say her mothers name.        
	When police asked her where she studied, she wrote Jalbani Primary School on a piece of paper.        
	She was in school uniform and was carrying a school bag. We searched the bag for the address and the name of her school but could not find any lead. There is a notebook, a clipboard, a stainless steel plate and a tiffin box in the bag, said Ghosh.         
	Till late on Friday, no one contacted the cops about the girl. The officers expect the girls parents to get in touch with them once her picture is published in newspapers.         
	Subrata Mukherjee, an officer of Don Bosco Asalayam Home, said he and his colleagues contacted all police stations in the neighbourhood to find out whether any missing diary was lodged.

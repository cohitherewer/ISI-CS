  - SCHOOL ACCUSED OF SUPPRESSING DEATH NEWS          A STAFF REPORTER                           THE DAY AFTER: Police supervise Saraswati puja immersions on Wednesday, a day after a 16-year-old drowned in the Hooghly while immersing the idol worshipped in his school.

	Amit Kumar Dubeys parents have pleaded with police to take action against the Andhra Association School authorities for their negligence, resulting in the drowning of their son in the Hooghly.        
	Amit, 16, drowned while he and two classmates were immersing the Saraswati idol of their school at Gwalior ghat on Tuesday morning. The body is yet to be traced.        
	In a written complaint to South Port police station, Bachcha and Uma Dubey have alleged that the school authorities did not inform them before taking Amit along for the immersion. They also accused the authorities of keeping the news of the mishap from them for eight hours.        
	The couple and other members of their family came to know about the drowning of the Class IX student from TV news bulletins.        
	The school should have informed us about the mishap soon after it occurred. The authorities were negligent and should take responsibility for the drowning. The police should take action against them, said Bachcha Dubey.        
	The police, however, said there was nothing in the complaint that warrants registration of a negligence case. The letter is primarily a plea to trace the body and a compilation of grievances, said an officer of South Port police station.        
	We asked Amits parents if they wanted to state anything specific against the school. But they had nothing else to say apart from whats mentioned in the complaint, the officer added. Like the parents, our primary objective now is to trace the body.        
	Amits cousin Sanjiv claimed the school was trying to win over the Dubeys by assuring them of help. He did not specify the assurances.        
	The headmistress of the school, Kalyani Achari, was not available for comment. Tanmoy Ghosh, the only teacher in the immersion team, said: We were all searching for Amit in the water. It occurred to no one that we should inform his parents.

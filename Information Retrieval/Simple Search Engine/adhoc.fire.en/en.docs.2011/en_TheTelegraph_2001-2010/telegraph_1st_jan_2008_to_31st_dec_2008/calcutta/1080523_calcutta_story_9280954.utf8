The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slush is death risk
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Slush is death risk
  - DRAIN UPGRADE PUTS PEOPLE IN PERIL          AMRITA GHOSH                          Slush from a roadside drain has narrowed down the busy Andul Road, forcing pedestrians onto the carriageway. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                        
	Upgrade of an earthen drain along Andul Road has turned the artery, one of the busiest in Howrah, into a death trap.        
	Slush from the five-km drain  its being concretised by Howrah Improvement Trust  is dumped on the open space on both sides of the road, forcing pedestrians and cyclists to come in the way of speeding vehicles.        
	The 10-ft-wide concrete drain extends from the Hanskhali bridge to Alampur.        
	The latest victim of the ill-planned upgrade was Subhra Patra, a Class XII student of Thana Makua High School. The 17-year-old was cycling home from school on May 13 when she was crushed by an oil tanker. Because of the slush, the girl had no option but to cycle down the carriageway, said a witness.        
	Barnali Chatterjee, who walks her 10-year-old son to Oxford High School every day, said: We cannot use the sidewalk because of the slush and walk down the road risking our lives. A speeding vehicle can hit us any moment. Its good that the drain is being concretised, but what about the pedestrians safety?        
	Hundreds of trucks, buses, minibuses, taxis and cars ply down Andul Road, which connects Vidyasagar Setu with National Highway 6. Hundreds of oil tankers take the road daily to reach Indian Oils refilling centre near Chunavhati. There are also scores of autorickshaws that ply on the road illegally.        
	To make matters worse, whatever open space is left free of slush has been taken over by shops selling building material and bamboos. The shops are all illegal, alleged a local resident.        
	Samarendra Koley, the chief executive officer of Howrah Improvement Trust, said: We know the slush is inconveniencing pedestrians and cyclists. The contractors executing the project have been asked to remove it at the earliest.

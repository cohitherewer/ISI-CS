          A STAFF REPORTER                                    K.V. Kamath, the managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, and (above) Pradip Sureka with his car. Telegraph pictures                                  
	A court has ordered the arrest of K.V. Kamath, the managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, for the ordeal businessman Pradip Sureka had to go through last Friday.        
	According to complaints lodged by Sureka, four debt recovery agents allegedly sent by the bank forced him and his son out of their Ford Ikon, assaulted them and took away the car on the ground that the businessman had defaulted on repaying a loan.        
	Before leaving, the youths flung a court order issued against Chanda Prasad at Sureka. The Behala resident said he had never defaulted on repaying the Rs 4.5-lakh car loan  a claim that the bank later accepted and released the vehicle.        
	The additional chief judicial magistrate of the Alipore court, Jayanta Koley, issued the non-bailable arrest warrants following a petition by Sureka.         
	Among the others facing arrest are Rajiv Dubey, a senior manager overseeing debt recovery in Calcutta, and two recovery agents, one of whom has been identified as Mohammed Ali.        
	The incident has left Sureka shattered. We have moved court to seek justice and hope the arrest warrants will be executed before the case comes up for hearing on December 19, said Surekas lawyer, Tapendra Narayan Roychowdhury.        
	ICICI spokesperson Charudatta Deshpande told Metro from Mumbai that the bank would contest the case. We have filed a complaint with the police explaining how the complainant has misrepresented facts.        
	Officers of Shakespeare Sarani police station, where Sureka had lodged a complaint, said they would comment after receiving a copy of the court order. The businessman had also lodged a general diary with Behala police station said.        
	Sureka found his car parked at the Upper Wood Street branch of ICICI Bank, which is under the jurisdiction of Shakespeare Sarani police station. The assault occurred on SN Roy Road in Behala, near the Surekas home.        
	Sureka had complained that a briefcase containing Rs 25,000, a TV and a music system were missing from the car.

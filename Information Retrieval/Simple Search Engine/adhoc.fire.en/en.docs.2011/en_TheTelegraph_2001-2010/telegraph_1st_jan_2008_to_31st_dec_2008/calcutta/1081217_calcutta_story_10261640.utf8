          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Bidyut Saha, whose wife and son were murdered		      
	A day after the body of a baby in a shopping bag was identified as Indrajit Saha, the body of a woman in a gunny bag was identified as his mother Bula.        
	The infants aunt Nandita Saha was arrested on Tuesday and charged with murder while the hunt is on for the prime suspect, her husband Satya.         
	The motive of the double murder is said to be a family feud over property.        
	The mother and child had gone missing on Sunday morning from their Beleghata home. The boys body had been put into a shopping bag and dumped by a canal in Ultadanga. The mothers body was put into two gunny bags and dumped by the Durgapur Expressway near a plywood factory in Dankuni.        
	Satya, who has been missing since Sunday morning, works in a soft drinks factory in Dankuni.        
	Both bodies were found on Sunday but one-year-old Indrajit was identified on Monday morning while 32-year-old Bela was identified on Tuesday night.        
	The victims husband, Bidyut Saha, identified the body in the morgue, said Parthasarathi Majumdar, the officer-in-charge of Chanditala police station.        
	The police station in Dankuni alerted the Ultadanga police late on Tuesday about the unidentified body of a woman. The body had been stuffed into two gunnybags and the two were then stitched together.         
	There were head injuries and strangulation marks, police said.        
	Earlier in the day, Nandita Saha confessed that she and her husband, Satya, had assaulted Indrajit and Bula around 7am on Sunday.        
	She later identified the nylon shopping bag in which Indrajits body was found as the one Satya had taken to the market that morning, said an officer of Ultadanga police station.        
	Police suspect that Satya, on his motorcycle, had gone to Canal East Road and dumped the babys body. He later took his car and took Belas body to Dankuni and dumped it off the Durgapur Expressway.        
	Nandita was arrested under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and will be produced in court on Wednesday morning.        
	Indrajit was murdered on his first birthday. Sleuths said brothers Satya and Bidyut had been engaged in a family feud over their ancestral house in Beleghata ever since the death of their father a few years ago.        
	Satya was allegedly pressuring Bidyut, who works in a Sealdah market, to leave the house. Arati, their mother, would apparently side with Satya and Nandita.        
	Arati, who was detained by police on Monday, said she had gone for her morning walk when the incident occurred.

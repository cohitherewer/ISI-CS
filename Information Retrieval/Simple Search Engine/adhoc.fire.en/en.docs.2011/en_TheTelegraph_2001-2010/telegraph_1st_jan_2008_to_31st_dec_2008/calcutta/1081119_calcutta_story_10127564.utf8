                      Freedom from life                    Located on the northern fringes of the city, Gobardanga has, of late, witnessed a theatre renaissance of sorts, with a number of impressive productions being performed by groups based in the area. This week EZCC hosts the staging of the Gobardanga Trilogy, a set of three plays presented by Gobardanga-based groups. This evening, Rupantar will present Tagores Dakghar (picture right). A poignant tale about Amal, a terminally ill boy, it deals with death as a spiritual freedom from the world of hoarded wealth and certified creeds. Confined indoors on doctors orders, Amal yearns for freedom and open spaces. He engages passersby in eager conversation from the vantage of an open window and, fascinated by a new post office visible in the distance, develops a fancy that he will receive a letter from the king, an obviously allegorical personage. Amal represents the man whose soul has received the call of the open road. He makes a new world for himself by his imagination and insatiable curiosity, and passersby bring the world to him. Direction: Pradeep Raychoudhury. Tomorrow: Shilpayan will stage Khowab (dir: Ashis Chattopadhyay; at 6 pm); November 21: Naksha will present Swapna Swadesh (dir: Ashis Das; at 6 pm).            Event: Play in Bengali, Tagores Dakghar, produced by Gobardanga Rupantar When: Today at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, 1B 201 Salt Lake

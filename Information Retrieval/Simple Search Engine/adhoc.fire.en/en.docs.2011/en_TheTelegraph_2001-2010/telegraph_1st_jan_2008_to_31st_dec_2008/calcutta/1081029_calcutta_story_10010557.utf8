          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	The imminent hike in the salaries of the private engineering college teachers is likely to cost the parents dear. Tuition and other fees of the colleges are set to go up once the recommendations of the pay panel constituted by the University Grants Commission are implemented.        
	There are two ways we can meet the increased expenses after the pay panels recommendations come into effect  seek assistance from the government and increase fees. Since it is unlikely that the government will agree to share our burden, we will be left with no option but to increase the fees, said Taranjit Singh of the JIS group of engineering institutions.        
	The UGC panel, headed by G.K. Chadha, had recommended a nearly 70 per cent hike in the salaries of college and university teachers. The recommendations are likely to be implemented within a year.         
	A Supreme Court ruling has given state governments the power to fix the fees of private colleges. The Bengal government has made it mandatory for private engineering colleges to pay teachers according to the scale set by the UGC.        
	While state-aided colleges and universities get full government assistance for paying the teachers, the 50-plus private engineering institutions have to depend completely on students fees.        
	Under the enhanced scale, private engineering colleges will have to pay at least around Rs 21,000 a month to a lecturer. Currently, the minimum salary of a lecturer is about Rs 12,000 a month. The salaries of readers and professors will increase commensurately.         
	Private engineering colleges currently charge about Rs 43,000 every year from students. An upward revision of students fees is unavoidable. It is too early to say the extent to which the fees are going to be raised, said Kisan Kejriwal of the MCKV Institute of Engineering and Management.        
	Representatives of an association of private engineering college owners will meet state higher education department officials soon to discuss the matter.         
	Fees in engineering colleges were last revised in 2006, when the annual tuition charges went up from Rs 31,000 to Rs 43,000.         
	A committee is supposed to revise the fees in each state every two years.        
	The fees structure committee of Bengal had last revised the fees two years ago. We will urge the government to promptly hike the fee, especially since a revision is already due, said the owner of an engineering college on the southern fringes of the city.

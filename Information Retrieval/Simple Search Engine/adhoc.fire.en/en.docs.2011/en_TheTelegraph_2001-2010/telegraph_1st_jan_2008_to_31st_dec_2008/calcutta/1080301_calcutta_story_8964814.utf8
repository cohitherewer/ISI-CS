The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dealers scurry to take Nano to the people
                                                                                                               Dealers scurry to take Nano to the people
  - Flurry of new outlets          ANASUYA BASU                          The Nano, whose projected Puja rollout is being greeted with a host of new showrooms                                        
	Dealers of Tata Motors in the state are busy putting infrastructure in place for the Puja rollout of Nano.        
	Lexus Motors, the largest Tata Motors dealer in West Bengal, has acquired land in Barasat, Chinsurah and Uluberia for opening outlets to showcase Nano, while RD Motors is preparing to launch showrooms in Baruipur and Chinsurah. The third dealer, KB Motors, is strengthening its network by opening outlets in Madhyamgram, Kalyani and Hooghly.        
	Since Nano is expected to have a strong semi-urban and rural market, the company is looking to augment its distribution network in the districts. We will add showrooms and also open dealerships in areas where we dont have a presence, said a Tata Motors spokesperson from Mumbai.         
	The idea is to take Nano to the customer rather than make him come to Calcutta to buy the car, said Anil Bagaria, the director of KB Motors.        
	The new showrooms for Nano, as specified by Tata Motors, will be D-class outlets with floor space of about 1,000 sq ft. These will be sales stores without workshops, said Vinod Kumar Agarwal, the managing director of Lexus Motors.        
	The company is yet to give us an LoI (Letter of Intent) but is guiding us in opening the outlets. I am expecting the LoI within a couple of weeks, added Agarwal.         
	The company is laying a lot of stress on the rollout. We are adding new dealerships every fortnight. Currently, we have 170 dealers across the country. We hope to appoint more distributors before the Nano arrives, said the spokesperson.         
	In addition to three distributors in Calcutta, Tata Motors has four others in the rest of the state, with eight showrooms in Siliguri, Malda, Kharagpur, Asansol and Haldia. We are looking to add four to five showrooms through our existing distributors in Durgapur and Burdwan. We are also looking for a new distributor in Howrah, added the spokesperson.        
	The Lexus Motors Uluberia store will be for commercial vehicles but will also sell the Nano, said Agarwal.         
	RD Motors opened a 1,000-sq-ft showroom in Krishnagar in November last year and is launching the two stores by April.         
	Yes, we are preparing for the Nano rollout, said Pradip Jain, the proprietor.        
	KB Motors is looking at a branch in Joka, said Bagaria.        
	Tata Motors remained tightlipped about when bookings for Nano would start. Trial production is slated to start in June-July.        
	The dealers expect bookings to open by August.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A woman accused of driving her husband to suicide and currently out on bail will get custody of her two children for the pujas.        
	A division bench of justices B. Bhattacharya and R.N. Banerjee on Friday granted Rita Bardhan custody of her son Soumya, 9, and daughter Soumita, 11, for the five Puja days.         
	The case relating to permanent custody of the kids, who stay with their paternal grandmother, is awaiting disposal.         
	Ritas husband Samir, a resident of Mallikpur, killed himself in May 2005, allegedly after being mentally tortured by Rita. After his death, Samirs brother Sunil lodged a complaint against Rita, leading to her arrest. Since then, the two children have been living with their grandmother in Mallikpur.         
	Rita was released on bail after 58 days in jail custody. She went to stay with her parents in Kasba and filed a custody petition in an Alipore court.        
	She moved the high court earlier this month after the lower court dismissed her plea.         
	Last week, the high court bench asked Samirs family to bring the children to Fridays hearing.         
	Soumita and Soumya told the judges that they were very happy living with their grandmother and uncles. They always take care of us, Soumita said.        
	When asked why he did not want to live with his mother, Soumya said: In our house there are many rooms, but in Kasba there is only one room.        
	After speaking to them, the judges decided that on the morning of Sashthi, Samirs brother Sunil would hand over the children to Rita at her Kasba home and bring them back to Mallikpur on Ekadashi.        
	Rita and her parents will have to ensure that they do not misbehave with Sunil when he goes to their house, the bench said.

	The drinking water supplied to most city hospitals, the Lalbazar police headquarters and even the civic headquarters is not fit for human consumption, says a report submitted to Calcutta High Court by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) on Friday.         
	Acting on court orders, the CMC had collected samples of drinking water from various public places in the city and tested them. The results revealed that the samples were contaminated with bacteria and other impurities.        
	Following a petition by environment activist Subhash Dutta on contaminated drinking water in Calcutta and Howrah, the civic body had claimed in the high court in 2002 that it supplied pure drinking water, but many city institutions lacked proper storage facilities. The court had asked the CMC to test random samples from various public institutions in the city, including the CMC headquarters.        
	 On Friday, the CMC told the court that it had collected six samples from its headquarters on SN Banerjee Road, three of which were found to be unfit for human consumption. Similarly, most of the samples from NRS, SSKM, Bangur Institute of Neurology, KS Roy TB Hospital, Beleghata ID Hospital and Institute of Child Care were contaminated.         
	The high court accepted the report but did not pass an order. The judgment is expected on August 1.

          Todays question: Do you think the transport minister is serious in his threat to get autorickshaws to convert to LPG by December? More responses will be published next week                          
	

D.P. Bhattacharya,
  Sonarpur        
	Many of the promises made by the transport minister have failed to take shape. After Ratan Tata decided to take the Nano project out of Bengal, Subhas Chakraborty had announced that Singur would host another auto plant. He even said the new deal would be completed by October 31. But the industries secretary and the chief minister never supported the claim. The transport ministers assurance of establishing the Millennium Convention Centre under Vidyasagar Setu too is yet to take shape. It is difficult to ascertain how serious he is on his commitment.               
	

SUBHASIS GANGULY,
  Address not mentioned        
	It is good that the transport minister has taken a step to stop pollution caused by vehicles using katatel.               
	

Mahmadul Haque, 
  Sapgachhi         
	In the past 30 years, ministers, including the transport minister, have made thousands of promises that have not been fulfiled. This will not be an exception.               
	

A.S. MEHTA, 
  New Alipore         
	Calcuttans are used to tall promises dished out time and again by the ineffective transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, none of which have been fulfiled so far. Be it stopping the use of katatel or limiting the number of passengers in autorickshaws, his promises and threats have never converted into reality. The shift to LPG roar would also end in a whimper.               
	

Subho Bhattacharya, 
  Deb Lane         
	It is not an issue of a threat by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. The people of Calcutta are very much aware that it is the worst city in India in terms of pollution control. Old vehicles and the use of katatel makes it worse.             
	Dilip Kumar Biswas,
  Green Park  
	The transport minister can hardly convert the autorickshaws to LPG within December 31. The number of registered autos is about 42,000 and unauthorised ones are more. The present system is not good enough to control autorickshaws. The Supreme Court had ordered autorickshaws in Calcutta to use LPG seven years ago. But the transport department was not serious in following the order. Now the high court has issued the same order to stop air pollution. But the state government has not taken any action because of political compulsions. The declaration will yield little result.

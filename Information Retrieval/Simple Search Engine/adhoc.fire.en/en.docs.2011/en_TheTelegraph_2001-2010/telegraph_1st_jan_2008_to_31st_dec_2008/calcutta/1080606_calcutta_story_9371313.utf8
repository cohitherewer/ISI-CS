          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 65-year-old man was killed and his wife critically injured in an accident shortly after the bandh came to an end on Thursday evening. The accident took place at the Beleghata Main Road-EM Bypass intersection.         
	A speeding car hit the couple  Naba Kumar Roychowdhury and his wife Bithi  while they were crossing the road. The residents of Old CIT Building, off Beleghata Main Road, were out on their evening walk.         
	The accident took place around 6.50pm. With not too many vehicles around, the car was speeding and the couple crossing the EM Bypass from the Beleghata end came in its way, said a senior officer of the Beleghata Traffic Guard.         
	A sergeant reached the spot within minutes of the accident and tried to chase the car but it escaped. We are looking for it, said the officer.         
	The couple was taken to a private hospital in Salt Lake, where Naba Kumar succumbed to his injuries. Bithi was later shifted to the ICU with critical injuries.        
	Preliminary investigations revealed that Naba Kumar had retired a few years ago and had married off their daughter. The evening stroll was part of their routine, an officer said.        
	Nearly 300 people protested on the Bypass after the accident, which resulted in a traffic jam on the artery. Later, officers from Beleghata police station and Beleghata Traffic Guard which was inaugurated three days ago to intensify traffic patrolling, brought the situation under control.         
	Ambulance mishap        
	In the morning, Shibu Dey and Raju Raut were seriously injured when the ambulance in which they were travelling rammed into a roadside divider near Teghoria, on VIP Road. The ambulance was taking Shibu to a nursing home and Raju was accompanying him when the accident took place.         
	Police said the ambulance, heading towards Ultadanga, suddenly dashed against the divider and toppled over. They felt it could be due to the driver speeding on a wet road surface in the rain.

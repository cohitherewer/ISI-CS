          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                              
	Nafisa Begum, a 24-year-old slum-dweller, cant wait to start her career in a BPO. But when she had completed her graduation in Urdu, the daughter of a tailor couldnt dream of working in a call centre because of problems in speaking English.         
	A career development programme for economically backward Muslim youngsters from Urdu and Bengali-medium backgrounds has made Nafisa upbeat about her chances of landing a BPO job.        
	The free programme is being launched by the State Haj Committee, an independent arm of the state minority development department, along with city-based organisations Students Education Trust and Educational Support Council.        
	Counselling for admission into the training programme for BPO, retail and insurance sectors started on February 17. Shortlisted candidates will start classes from the second week of March.        
	The response has been overwhelming. About 4,200 students have applied, of whom about 3,000 will be shortlisted. The three-month programme is meant for students between the age of 18 and 40. The minimum qualification is HS or equivalent, said Nadeem Ul Haq, a representative of Students Educational Trust.        
	The number of applications from women  almost half the total figure  has been impressive. Even girls in hijab are coming for the programme, said Shahabuddin Ahmed, the secretary of Educational Support Council.        
	The Haj committee has offered us free use of Haj House, on Dilkhusa Street, he added. Three-hour classes will be held in the evening once a week for three months. We had planned to have 300 students in a class, but are now looking at 500 students per batch, said Javed Akhtar, an executive member of Educational Support Council.        
	The state government may provide financial support to the programme, said Abdus Sattar, the minister of state for minority development and madarsa education and chairman of the the Haj committee.        
	After lessons in personality development, spoken English and group discussion, I could soon be working in Sector V, said Nadia Khan, a final-year student of Maulana Azad College.        
	The authorities have approached placement firms in the city to help students find jobs after the course.

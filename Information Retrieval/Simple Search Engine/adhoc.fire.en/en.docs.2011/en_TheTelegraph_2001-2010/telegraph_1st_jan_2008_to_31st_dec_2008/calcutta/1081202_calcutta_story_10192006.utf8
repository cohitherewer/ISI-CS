The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Shorn of gold and grit
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shorn of gold and grit
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Ab kya hoga (What will happen now)?        
	A grim-faced Ashok Todi asked one of his lawyers this question on Monday afternoon as the court officer in the special CBI court pronounced the order passed by magistrate Madhumita Roy.        
	The clock struck 2.30.        
	The bail plea is rejected and the accused (Ashok Todi) is remanded in judicial custody till December 12, the court officer shouted out in the packed Bankshal Court room.        
	Two constables in the courtroom asked the accused to take off his gold chain and two gold rings.        
	The businessman handed over the chain, the rings, a wallet and a mobile phone to an acquaintance seated next to him on the wooden bench.        
	Todi then went into one last huddle with his lawyers and associates.        
	I have been trapped, he told Metro.        
	Sweating profusely in the December afternoon, Todi then asked one of his lawyers what would happen if he was taken ill in the jail.        
	Kya criminals bhi honge wahan par (Will there be criminals as well)? he asked.         
	One of the lawyers tried to reassure him that arrangements would be made for him to stay in the jail hospital.        
	Around 3pm, Todi was escorted out of the courtroom and hustled into a waiting police van through a crowd of cameras.        
	He has been taken to Presidency jail and he will be kept with common criminals. Why should there be any preferential treatment? the inspector general of prisons, B.D. Sharma, told Metro in the evening.        
	But late on Monday, Todi, who has a history of cardiac trouble, was shifted to ward number one of the Presidency jail hospital following a check-up at SSKM Hospital.        
	It was 10.10am when Todi arrived in the courtroom. To give the waiting cameras at the main gate of Bankshal Court the slip, the police brought him in through the Bar Library entrance.        
	The 14th metropolitan magistrate court drew in the crowds. Rarely do we see such a case where the high and mighty and senior police officers are charged. Everybody is eager to know the outcome of the case, said Raja Banerjee, at Bankshal for a hearing in a property case.        
	The accused, surrounded by associates and lawyers, appeared anxious from the beginning though some members of Team Todi tried to put up a brave front.        
	We are sure the verdict will be in our favour. We are hoping and praying, said one of his associates.        
	But once the verdict was pronounced, the heads dropped and hope gave way to despair.         
	The Todi home at CG 235 in Salt Lake was shrouded in darkness late on Monday as the head of the family spent his first night in custody at the jail hospital.

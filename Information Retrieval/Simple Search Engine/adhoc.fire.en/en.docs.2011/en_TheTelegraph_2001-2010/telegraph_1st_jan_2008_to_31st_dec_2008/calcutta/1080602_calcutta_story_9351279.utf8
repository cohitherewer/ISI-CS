          A STAFF REPORTER                      Dolan Das: Watery grave. Picture by Pronab Biswas                          
	Dolan Das, 11, drowned on Saturday afternoon while taking swimming lessons from an unauthorised trainer.        
	Swapan Pal, the trainer, has been arrested following a complaint lodged by the girls parents with Naihati police station on Sunday morning. The parents alleged that Pals negligence had led to their daughters death.        
	Pal, 38, has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. We have booked him under Section 304 of Indian Penal Code as he did not take any safety measures while conducting such unauthorised training sessions, said P. K. Tripathi, the additional superintendent to police, Barrackpore.        
	Pal used to give swimming lessons to children in a pond in Naihatis Prasadnagar. Dolon, a Class VI student, had been going for the past fortnight.        
	On Saturday, we became worried when she failed to return even after two hours. A local youth came to our house and said Dolon might have drowned, said the girls father Nabin Das, who works in a private firm.         
	Dolans parents and a few neighbours, accompanied by Swapan, started searching for her in the pond. Her body was finally fished out in the evening.        
	We came to know that Swapan had asked her to practise while he was busy supervising repairs in his house. When he returned to the pond, Dolon could not be traced, said a neighbour.

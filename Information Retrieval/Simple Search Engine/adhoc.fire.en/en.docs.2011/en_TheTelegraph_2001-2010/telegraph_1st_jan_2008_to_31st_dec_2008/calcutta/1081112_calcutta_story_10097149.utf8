The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Summer offers dispel B-school job fears
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Summer offers dispel B-school job fears
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Students of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, can spot a ray of hope after waiting anxiously for months to see how the economic meltdown will affect their future.        
	With about one-third of the 300 first-year students of the postgraduate programme in management securing placements for summer internships at the end of Slot Zero on Monday, the fears on the B-school campus gave way to cheers.         
	Given the recession-like situation in the US and forecasts of downturn in India, there were concerns among students. After Slot Zero, we feel recruiters will keep their faith with IIM Calcutta graduates, said a second-year IIM student.        
	Slot Zero is the first rung in the placement ladder and is reserved for the best brains and the companies with the most lucrative offers.        
	Though Slot Zero saw a dip in the number of students placed  from 120 last year to around 100 this year  and felt the absence of Lehmann Brothers  which had offered Rs 1.36 crore per annum to a student in the final placements in 2008  the B-school boys and girls were happy.         
	There has been a decrease in the number of students placed in Slot Zero but it was along the expected lines, especially given the market condition, said an IIM Calcutta student.        
	The list of recruiters included regulars on campus like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Boston Consulting Group, JP Morgan Chase and Barclays Capital.        
	The summer placement season began on November 9 and the placement cell representatives expect it to be over in another two days.         
	Slot Zero has always been dominated by investment banks, but this year it was a healthy mix of companies from various sectors, said a student.         
	The placement cell representatives, however, refused to share data of sector-wise placement.         
	Though the summer placement trends are indicators of whats lying ahead in the final placements, the budding managers are keeping their fingers crossed.         
	We dont want to jump to any conclusion right now, said a student.

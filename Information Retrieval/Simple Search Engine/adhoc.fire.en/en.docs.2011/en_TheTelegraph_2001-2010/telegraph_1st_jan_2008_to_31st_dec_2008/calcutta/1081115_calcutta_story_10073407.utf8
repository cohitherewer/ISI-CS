The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Hostel girls under siege
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hostel girls under siege
  - Property dispute hounds students        MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                                                  
	Fourteen students of Loreto College and five Anglo-Indian families are under siege at their 38 Elliot Road home.        
	At 6am on October 30, a group of nearly 40 men invaded the parking lot of the address and grabbed an adjacent room on the ground floor that was part of the Dr Grahams Homes Girls Hostel.        
	A no admission without permission notice is up at the entrance of the parking lot and groups of men are parked there, day and night.        
	We feel so unsafe with the men flocking around whenever we pass by. Its very disturbing. We are all children supported by Dr Grahams Homes; we have nowhere else to go, said a girl in the hostel on the second floor.        
	The new occupants claim that Iftekhar Ahmed of 7 Ripon Lane, who promotes buildings in the area, has bought the premises and handed over the keys to them.        
	This was nothing but kabza (forceful possession). Now the goons knock on our doors every day threatening us with dire consequences if we dont withdraw the police complaint. We are terrified, said Richard Allwyn Payne, a teacher who has been living there since 2003.        
	Iftekhar Ahmed sits in a chair near the gate and protects the 1,000-odd square feet of the legally purchased premises. I have been a tenant here for over two decades. I have rent receipts to prove it. Now I have purchased it. If anyone thinks Ive done anything illegal, let it be proven. Theres nothing more I need to tell you, he told Metro.        
	The rent receipts submitted to Park Street police station state that DPS (HAP) Private Limited, a company at 21B Gurusaday Road, is the owner of the parking lot and the adjacent room.        
	But documents produced by the hostel authorities show the parking lot and the adjacent room registered under the name of the original owner of the second-floor flat, Gillian Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School. She had sold the flat along with the parking lot and the room to Dr Grahams Homes in 2005.        
	When I purchased the second-floor flat, the parking lot and the room on the ground floor were registered along with it. They legally belong to whoever is the owner of that flat, said Hart.        
	The hostel authorities and the families at 38 Elliot Road allege that officers at Park Street police station have been turning a deaf ear to their pleas. I cannot comment on something I dont know much about, Nissar Ahmed, the officer-in-charge of Park Street police station told Metro.        
	But the hostel authorities have a different story to tell. I met Nissar Ahmed at the police station where Iftekhar Ahmed, too, was present. In the middle of our conversation, Iftekhar told me: Dont talk so much lady, I know all about you. The officer kept mum, alleged Moina Jhala, the chairperson of Dr Grahams Homes Girls Hostel.        
	Some residents of the area hinted at a nexus between Iftekhar Ahmed and Sultan Ahmed, the local Trinamul legislator. Sultan Ahmed, however, said: Iftekhar promotes buildings illegally. He has political backing and has exerted some influence on the police. The situation is a threat to the girls living there.        
	The girls are now pinning their hopes on action by the deputy commissioner of police (south), Rajesh Subarno. I assure you, timely action will be taken, said Subarno.

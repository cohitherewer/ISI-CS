The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City pockets flooded
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             City pockets flooded

	A smart shower for half an hour on Tuesday afternoon left several city pockets, mostly in south Calcutta, waterlogged. In some stretches, the water did not recede even in the evening.        
	The Met office said the city received 74.8 mm of rainfall between 5.30pm on Monday and 5.30pm on Tuesday.        
	The worst-hit areas in south Calcutta were Dhakuria, Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens, Picnic Garden Road and Bondel Road.        
	In the north, the situation was worst on Madan Mohan Burman Street.        
	Chief civic engineer (drainage amp; sewerage) Tushar Ghosh said: The intensity of rainfall in south Calcutta was more than in other parts of the city.        
	In the afternoon, most parts of Rashbehari Avenue were under knee-deep water. Several shops remained close.        
	The shower did not last more than 30 minutes but the water could not be drained out even in three hours. Cant the civic authorities be more efficient? wondered Kajal Mukherjee, wading through ankle-deep water on Rashbehari Avenue.        
	But civic sources claimed that in most places the water receded faster compared with previous years.        
	The situation in other waterlogging-prone areas like Amherst Street, CR Avenue, Congress Exhibition Road and Gurusaday Road was much better this year, said an official. The shower and the waterlogging caused widespread traffic jam.        
	More rain is expected on Wednesday. Monsoon is active over Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal. We expect more rain on Wednesday, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section of Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.

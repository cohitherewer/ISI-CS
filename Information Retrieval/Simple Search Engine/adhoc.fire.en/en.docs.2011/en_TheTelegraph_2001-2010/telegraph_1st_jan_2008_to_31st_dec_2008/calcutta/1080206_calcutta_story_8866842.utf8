          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                      
	Gul Mohammad Khan, who was forced to leave Afghanistan in 1983 for alleged anti-national activities and has been staying in India since, moved a petition in the high court on Tuesday challenging a Union government notice asking him to quit India.        
	The notice issued by the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer in Calcutta on January 1 asked Khan to leave India within 30 days. The case is expected to come up for hearing on Wednesday.        
	In 1983, Khan had given an undertaking that he would leave India for Canada within three months. He was allowed to stay on as an Afghan refugee, said Subrata Mukhopadhyay, the counsel for the officer.        
	Khan came to Calcutta and started trading. Currently, he is the owner of several properties here, he added. According to the lawyer, the Indian government had issued a similar quit India notice on July 28, 1997, asking Khan to leave the country within 15 days.        
	He had moved a petition against the notice in the city civil court. The government lawyer had told the court that Khan had been collecting money from Afghan refugees on behalf of an organisation in Peshwar, Pakistan, which was fighting the Afghan government, said Mukhopadhyay.        
	The court had dismissed Khans petition.The government, however, did not take any action against him. Khan stayed on, married an Indian national and has two children by her. His wife and children have ration cards, said Khans counsel.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sub-inspector Chakrabarty. Picture by Pronab Biswas                                  
	Police arrested an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Monday evening for selling cartridges to criminals from the central armoury in Nadia district.        
	Sub-inspector Shankar Chakrabarty, who has been with the force for over 35 years, confessed to his crime during interrogation and admitted that he would sell each .38mm cartridge for Rs 100.        
	A team from Ashokenagar police station went to the Bhawani Bhavan headquarters of the states investigative agency that deals with high-profile criminal cases and rounded up the accused.        
	Chakrabarty ran his cash-for-cartridge racket when he was posted at Nadia districts central armoury in Krishnagar from 1979 to 1990.        
	Elaborating on Chakrabartys modus operandi, an officer said: He would allot ammunition to policemen from the entire Nadia district coming to Krishnagar for routine firing practice. Chakrabarty took advantage of that fact that many policemen would skip the exercise.        
	The sub-inspector would assure the policemen giving firing practice a miss that he would mark them present in the register.        
	This gave Chakrabarty a chance to keep stealing cartridges. We suspect that Chakrabarty stole thousands of rounds of ammunition over the years, said the officer, adding that a probe is on to ascertain whether he had any other sources of procuring cartridges.        
	Sanjay Mukherjee, the special inspector-general of police, CID, clarified on Tuesday that the armoury of the investigative agency  where Chakrabarty was transferred in 2004  was safe.        
	He was posted in the control room and had no access to the CIDs armoury. Besides, we have matched the stock of our ammunition and not a single cartridge was missing, said Mukherjee.        
	Chakrabarty was produced in a Barasat court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody till November 7.        
	According to cops, Chakrabarty was arrested after a dealer in arms and ammunition, who supplied cartridges to criminals, was picked up from Titagarh a week ago.        
	He spilled the beans about a father-son duo supplying ammunition to criminals, said a sleuth.        
	On October 26, Asim Mallik and his son Surajit were arrested in a raid at Machlandapur in North 24-Parganas. We recovered 84 rounds of cartridges, all of .38mm bore, from them, said an officer of Ashokenagar police station.        
	The .38 mm bore is used for service revolvers.        
	The Malliks put the sleuths on the trail of ammunition agent Madhab Das of Titagarh. Dass arrest led the cops to Chakrabarty, from whom the agent would buy a cartridge for Rs 100 and sell it for Rs 150.

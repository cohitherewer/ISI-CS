          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A thief escaped from police custody while being escorted to a police van after a check-up at Medical College and Hospital on Monday morning.         
	A constable was holding 20-year-old Murad Alams wrist when he broke free. The Kalabagan resident had not been handcuffed or tied with a rope as that would have violated human rights.        
	Alam ran away while he was being escorted through a crowd. The constable chased him but he ran out of the main gate, crossed College Street and disappeared, said a senior police officer.         
	Alam was arrested in Jorasanko on Sunday in connection with several theft and snatching cases. He complained of stomach ache at night.        
	He was taken for check-up on Monday morning along with four other criminals.

                The girl who died in Howrah District Hospital on June 10 after falling ill in a bus that was stuck in roadblock has been identified as Tapasi Sarkar, 18. Her maternal uncle, Arun Koyal, identified her. Tapasi, a resident of Madhpur, in Serampore, was on her way to Jaypur Bill, in Bally, to attend a Kali puja at a friends house. Her body was handed over to her uncle on Friday.     A division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh of Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to produce the environment impact assessment report and the environment management plan of the proposed water treatment plant beside EM Bypass within three weeks. The court passed the directive on the basis of an allegation by the lawyer for People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC), a social organisation, that the CMC had planned to construct the plant on the wetlands without drawing up an environment impact assessment report.    The bomb disposal squad of the Calcutta police detective department recovered nine crude bombs from a vat on Alipore Road on Friday morning. The bombs were wrapped in a polythene bag. A civic sweeper cleaning the vat spotted ed the bombs.    An 18-year-old youth hanged himself at his Rabindra Sarani home on Friday afternoon. Ravi Gujratis body was found hanging from the ceiling of his tiled-roof home with a gamchha tied around his neck. No suicide note was found.     Trouble broke out at the airports domestic terminal building on Friday afternoon over a mentally challenged passenger creating a ruckus. The 24-year-old passenger was to take the Air Deccan flight to Bagdogra. However, he got into an argument with his father and also allegedly pushed away Deccan staff who tried to intervene. He was handed over to the CISF and not allowed to take the flight.    A patients relative was arrested from Ruby General Hospital, on EM Bypass, for ransacking the reception area. M.K. Sarkar allegedly smashed window panes and glasses with an iron rod following an altercation with the hospital authorities. He alleged that the hospital had overcharged his mother-in-law, Malina Chowdhury, who was admitted to the hospital last Friday with gall bladder problems. Her family had requested that she be put in a BPL category bed, which the hospital refused. Malina was discharged on Thursday, but Sarkar claimed on Friday that the bill was hefty. The hospital, however, claimed that Malina was charged only Rs 5,000 for her treatment.

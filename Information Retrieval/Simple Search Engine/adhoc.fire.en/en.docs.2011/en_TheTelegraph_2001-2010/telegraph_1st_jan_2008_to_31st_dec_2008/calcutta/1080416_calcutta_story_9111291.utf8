                 Powerless: Students busy with last-minute revisions in the candle light before examinations                            
	It is unfortunate that a mothers attempt to save her young son by donating her kidney has been thwarted by the lack of funds (Funds hitch in transplant, March 4). Should a youth die simply because he is poor? Can we call ourselves civilised after that?           
	Many of our countrymen cannot have two square meals a day, clothing, shelter and medical care, yet our leaders hail the remarkable progress we are making as a nation. Who are the people enjoying the fruits of this progress?           
	Only a local club has come forward to help the young man while private and government hospitals have chosen to look the other way. If the state does not arrange for free treatment of such patients, the poor may well think that they do not matter for the country.           
	There are several good voluntary organisations in Calcutta. One of them will probably help in carrying out the transplant but why should the needy have to depend so completely on the benevolence of the private sector for something as basic as medical care?

	The Higher Secondary examinees suffered because of power cuts every day for one to three hours (Little light for examinees, March 8). The photograph of a girl studying for the examination by candlelight depicts the plight of the students. Babies, patients and the elderly are suffering just as much. The chief minister should improve the power situation before calling all and sundry to the state to set up industries.             
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park           
	Widespread and regular power cuts have made a comeback to the city at a time when several examinations are being held. The Higher Secondary examinees stand to lose the most. Fourteen years of hard work may be undone by a few hours of darkness.

	Apropos the report Braveheart catches molester airman, March 7, it is inspiring that Chaitali Mallick, who was molested and injured by an airman, fought back and put him behind bars. Cases of molestation have become common in the city but police do not always crack down on the guilty. It is time for the women to stand up unitedly against the culprits.             
	Ratan Kumar Halder, 
  Behala           
	Group theatre actress Chaitali Mallick is a role model for millions of women. She demonstrated that mental strength is all it takes to fight back against a physically strong assaulter. A large percentage of woman now venture out alone for work. It is vital for them to learn how to keep lecherous men at bay.           
	Rathin Chatterjee, 
  Dum Dum             
	Apropos the report Shut orders slapped on hospital duo, March 6, the pollution control board should not have shut down two state-run hospitals in Howrah until the authorities adopted a proper system of disposing bio-medical waste. Most state and private hospitals do not have a system in place to deal with bio-medical waste. Hospitals in south India, in contrast, dispose of bio-medical waste in accordance with the norms. These factors, along with quality medical care, help them in drawing patients from other states and abroad. The pollution control authorities should give the two hospitals a chance to set up a plant for treating bio-medical waste. The state health minister should intervene in this regard.             
	Sukumar Ghosh,

	Despite all the talk of Indias economic growth, unemployment remains a problem even in urban and suburban areas (Jobless lose crore over Dubai dream, March 5). Some unscrupulous people have taken advantage of the problem to make a fast buck. people should remain alert about these cheats.             
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia           
	lIt is the ultimate ambition of a large section of uneducated youths in the city to work in West Asia. Two men have made a crore exploiting this craze. The administration should try to catch frauds like the duo before they strike so that people are not ruined.           
	Bhupen Bose, 
  Dum Dum             
	The railway minister has once again presented a please-all budget but the hard fact remains that he has consistently failed to provide security to passengers. The loss of valuables of two foreign tourists underscores the problem (Parisi-ans hapless spring sojourn, March 7). Unfortunately, airlines scarcely fare better when it comes to providing security to passengers luggage.             
	Govinda Bakshi,

	Apropos the report 400 acres lost, civic vigil on squatters, March 5, if the civic body is alert then it does not have to waste substantial amount of public money for the rehabilitation of squatters. The land along the canal bank in Rajabazar, which was cleared a few years ago and the encroachers rehabilitated at Dhapa, has once again been occupied. Eviction drives are useless in the absence of follow-up action.

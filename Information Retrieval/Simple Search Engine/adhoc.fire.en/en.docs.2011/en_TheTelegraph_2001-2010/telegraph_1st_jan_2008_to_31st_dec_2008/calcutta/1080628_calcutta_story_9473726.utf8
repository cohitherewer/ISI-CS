The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Watch on 3-wheeler pollution
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Watch on 3-wheeler pollution
  - Court singles out case   against autorickshaws        OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                        
	Pollution caused by autorickshaws will now be taken up by the court, which has elsewhere in the country been the prime mover behind efforts to clean up the air.         
	The green bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday asked environment activist Subhas Dutta to file an affidavit so that the issue of pollution caused specifically by autorickshaws could be heard separately.         
	Dutta will have to file the affidavit on July 18, when the next hearing comes up.        
	In a campaign against the citys poor air quality, Metro had highlighted the pollution caused by autorickshaws.         
	Reports suggest Calcuttas annual average RPM (respirable particulate matter) count is about 105 micrograms per cubic metre, 45 micrograms above the permissible limit of 60 micrograms. Even the state government has admitted that air pollution kills at least 10,000 people in Calcutta every year.        
	According to the report of the Central Pollution Control Board, 50 to 70 per cent pollution in any of the metros across the country arises from auto emission. In Calcutta, the pollution caused by autos is the worst in the world, Dutta said during the hearing of a case on vehicular emission in general at the bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh.        
	Dutta said autos pollute the air because:         
	 Sixty per cent of the vehicles are unauthorised        
	 There is no system of checking fitness        
	 Most run on adulterated fuel        
	 Instead of three, they carry seven-eight passengers, forcing the engine to overwork and produce more emission        
	 Instead of operating as contract carriages (by the meter), they run as stage carriages (shared).        
	Various factors contribute to pollution but the factor relating to autorickshaws should be considered first. I want to assist the court. Kindly allow me to do the job, Dutta prayed before the court.        
	The bench replied: You file a separate petition. We will hear the matter.        
	Dutta said the same bench in an order in 2004 had asked the state government to stop plying of unauthorised autos in the city. But it is unfortunate that the state government has failed to carry out the order, Dutta added.         
	The pollution control board had recommended compulsory conversion of three-wheeler engines to LPG, but the transport department did not act on it. Proposals to rein in illegal autos gather dust at Writers Buildings.         
	In an affidavit in 2004, the government had said the city and the neighbouring districts have 30,000 legal autos, which the transport department brought up to date to around 40,000. Estimates, however, suggest that the actual number is close to a lakh.

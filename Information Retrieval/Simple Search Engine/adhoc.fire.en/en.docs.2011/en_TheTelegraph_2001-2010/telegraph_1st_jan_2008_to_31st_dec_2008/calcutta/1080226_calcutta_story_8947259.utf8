	Half the battle is won if we try to understand the autism culture. Dr Stephen Shore says: Once an autistic, always an autistic. We cannot change them. Then why not we change our views and rethink before we get into that age-old conflict of your world and our world! Does the world belong to only the privileged and fortunate?        
	Autism cannot be cured with medicines. Remedial teaching through proper intervention is the only answer. Early diagnosis, screening and adult supervision can help an autistic perform better. Remedial teaching through proper intervention is the only answer. Earlier the diagnosis and screening, the better it is for the person bound by Autism. They can perform well under adult supervision and guidance.              
	Getting them ready: They do not see the world the way we see it. They perceive things their way. At times they try to come out of their shell, but the unfriendly world makes them recoil. Any change in their routine makes them apprehensive. So you must prepare them for it. Tell them what they are supposed to do, what is expected of them under certain conditions.         
	Exposure to different situations will help them learn social skills. Use the theory of mind to help them get a better idea of what other people are thinking. We observe peoples body language and facial expressions and act accordingly. Parents must develop situation-specific behaviour in an autistic child  going to a restaurant, picnic, birthday party, travelling by train or sitting in a gathering  to avoid uncomfortable questions.        
	Almost all special schools are founded by parents of special children. As parents, you will have to fight the way out for your child. You must teach them the dos and donts within a guided framework and bring them closer to the mainstream.         
	An autistic child finds it difficult to work for long hours. Make learning short and predictable both at home and school. Give them snack breaks in between sessions when they can enjoy, say, a plate of muri or homemade spicy corn flakes, instead of fried potato chips every day. Serve the goodies in small packets after every session to make lessons predictable and fun.        
	They should understand what comes next. This predictability will motivate them to stick to the sessions. It is important to make the child understand the concept of start and finish. Daily activities should be scheduled to help a child interpret what he is expected to do and switch over to the next job smoothly.              
	Activities: Predictability is the key. A child should be able to do the activity without being prompted. I have seen that learning becomes more enjoyable if there is a balance between a structured timetable and leisure set to the childs pace. The child should be allowed to enjoy his freedom of movement within the boundary of school. Allow him to roam around where he likes. It might be the principals office, library, computer room or open spaces. We should not deprive him of fun saying that such behaviour (read indiscipline) is not part of the rulebook. Let us shake off the traditional way of school management. Then I am sure we will see more positive behaviour in the autistic child. Gradually he will pick up social skills and merge with the mainstream.                    Sean Penn plays an autistic dad in I am Sam		    
	Acquire knowledge: Learn why the child is not sitting upright in the classroom. He slides down on the desk, stretches his legs, slouches, stretches or rolls his whole body on the mat, sporting a smile of satisfaction (as explained by a high functioning autistic person). These postures are not familiar in the classroom, but we need to start accepting them.         
	Autistic children have the habit of spinning, flinging objects, going round and round the room. Hand flapping, fidgeting or rocking are self-stimulating (STIM) behaviours. STIM needs to be recognised. Allow it for some time and dont humiliate the child for such behaviour.        
	The smell of spices is repulsive to autistics. Identify and stop them from visiting places where there are such smells. Reduce noise levels, though it is a difficult proposition in the school environment. Provide cosy corners and a stress-free environment to make their life hassle-free.        
	Children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) have face blindness. They may not recognise the face of a person theyve met earlier. But they can identify people by particular objects like the spectacles or earrings. A high-functioning person with ASD can recall the person previously met once he is reminded of the meeting.         
	They may be in an uncomfortable position while looking straight into your eyes. They have gaze discomfort. I met a 28-year-old autistic person who was unable to look into someones eyes as it caused pain. An autistic persons threshold of touch sensation can be very high or low. They often either cannot tolerate touch or dont feel any sensation at all. Do not crowd around an autistic person. Do not ever scream at them. Such treatment drowns them in a whirlpool of distress. Try to win their trust and confidence.        
	Autistic children are generally allergic to certain food and clothing. If the childs behaviour is beyond control, carefully chalked-out medicine management may be needed under a clinical psychiatrist. But psychiatric medicine has side effects.        
	Another important factor is the approach of the teacher, facilitator or caregiver. A negative approach leads nowhere while a positive approach with a doers attitude is the key to success. There should be no room for ego hassles from the facilitator as autistic children are brutally innocent. They will either say I will not do it or I will do it. Understand the iceberg concept or stop messing around with autistic persons.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Flame dims in Kumartuli
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          low on fuel: A Kumartuli artisan uses a blow torch to dry a Durga idol before painting it. Picture by Pabitra Das                                  
	Kumartuli artisans, already grappling with a severe space crunch, are facing another problem  shortage of kerosene.         
	The idol-makers, who are entitled to subsidised kerosene to dry clay, have yet to receive their quota of fuel this year. Every year we get five litres of kerosene each week for a month before Durga puja and for 15 days before Kali puja, said Babu Pal, the joint secretary of Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskrity Samity.         
	The artisans are required to send their applications to the food and civil supplies department, which conducts an inspection before issuing kerosene ration permits mentioning the amount of fuel to be given and the period of supply.         
	Till last year, we would get the first instalment of kerosene a month before Puja. This year, we have not received anything till date, though hardly a fortnight remains for Puja to begin, said Pal.         
	Kerosene is required mainly for the blow torches that are used to dry the idols. We faced a lot of problems while making Viswakarma idols. The government supplies kerosene at Rs 10 per litre, but we had to buy it from the market at Rs 28 per litre, said Mahadeb Pal, who bought 10 litres of fuel to dry 15 Viswakarma idols.         
	We have no idea when we will get this years quota, said Babu Pal. Even the official inspection was delayed this year, he added.         
	Kerosene ration permits were issued on September 12, but National Trading Company, the supply agent, said it did not have enough stocks.         
	Officials of National Trading Company said they hadnt received any extra oil from the food department, said R.C. Sarkar, the joint director of the consumer goods department.         
	The agent is not at fault. A month back, their allotment was reduced from 80 to 70 kilolitres per month, said R.K. Giri, another joint director.         
	The number of ration-card holders is increasing but the amount of kerosene that comes from the central government has remained the same. We are reducing the quota of kerosene for each permit-holder. We should have been more careful while issuing permits for such a huge quantity of oil, he said.         
	The Kumartuli samity, comprising 310 members, has been promised 6,200 litres of kerosene for this festive season.

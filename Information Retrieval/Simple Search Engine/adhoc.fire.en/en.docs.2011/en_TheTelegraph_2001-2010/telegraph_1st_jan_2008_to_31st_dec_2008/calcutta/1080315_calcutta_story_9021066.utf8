The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SFI orders campus skirmish probe
                                                                                                               SFI orders campus skirmish probe
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The SFI state committee has ordered an inquiry on Friday into the role played by its supporters in the clashes at Presidency College and Hindu Hostel.        
	The clashes followed the announcement of the students union election results in the college. The Independent Consolidation (IC) and ally Democratic Students Organisation won the elections by bagging 37 seats, two more than the SFI.        
	The SFI state committee president, Sudip Sengupta, said on Friday evening that action would be taken against the organisations supporters if the inquiry reveals that they had over-reacted and created trouble.        
	The SFI Calcutta district committee has been asked to submit the probe report on Saturday.         
	An SFI internal inquiry in connection with student union elections is unprecedented in recent times.         
	According to sources in the college, a section of SFI supporters had allegedly passed comments at IC supporters when the students were dispersing after the announcement of the poll results on Thursday night. A skirmish followed.        
	Around 11am on Friday, students supporting the SFI allegedly forced their way into Hindu Hostel and attacked IC supporters.         
	Some IC supporters were allegedly locked up in a room.         
	Jorasanko police detained 10 students. Both SFI and IC claimed that three of their supporters were seriously injured in the clashes.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out in a heat treatment factory in Howrahs Belgachia, on Thursday morning. Six tenders took two hours to douse the blaze.        
	The factory shade was gutted but no one was injured.        
	Fire officer Dilip Sinha said Tools Star Private Ltd, on Benaras Road, did not have any fire-fighting arrangements. A probe has been ordered to ascertain the cause of the fire.        
	Police said the fire broke out in a tank filled with treatment oil. Soon it engulfed the whole shade. Around 25 workers who were working in the shade fled.        
	There was traffic jam on Benaras Road after the fire.

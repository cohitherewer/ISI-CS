                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Docs lose licence for fatal surgery 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A city gynaecologist and a general physician have lost their medical licences for two years for botching an appendix surgery they were not even qualified to attempt.        
	Debashish Mitra and Bikash Kumar Ghosh had denied conducting the surgery that led to 28-year-old Sunanda Ghoshs death four years ago, but the West Bengal Medical Council found both guilty of knowingly risking the patients life. The primary charge against the duo was that neither of them was a general surgeon or an anaesthetist.        
	 Their names were removed from the councils register for two years after the charges of negligence were proved, Dilip Ghosh, the councils registrar, announced on Tuesday.        
	Sunanda, a resident of Ukilpara, had been admitted to the Baruipur nursing home owned by Mitra in August 2004 with severe abdominal pain that was diagnosed as appendicitis. She was wheeled into the operating theatre on August 15 for removal of her appendix and died three days later.        
	The patients family said no anaesthetist was present during the surgery. She was apparently anaesthetised by these two doctors, a member of the medical council said.        
	The committee that probed the incident found both doctors guilty of medical negligence and recommended that the council file chargesheets against them.         
	They were given a chance to defend themselves and their statements were reviewed by the members. But it was proved that there was negligence on their part in handling the patient from the time of admission till her death, the council member said.         
	Mitra told Metro that he hadnt decided whether to challenge the decision. I have not received a copy of the councils decision. As and when I receive it, I will decide my next course of action.         
	His colleague echoed him. I will decide after a few days, Bikash Ghosh said.        
	Sunandas family members, who had ransacked the nursing home and filed an FIR with the local police station after her death, said they would have been happier if both doctors were permanently blacklisted.        
	Mitra and Bikash Ghosh can apply for registration again after two years.        
	The council will consider their applications if there are no adverse reports (against them), the council member said.        
	Although Mitra and Bikash Ghosh have been penalised, the Bengal council cannot take action against any Calcutta doctor who is registered with a medical council of another state.

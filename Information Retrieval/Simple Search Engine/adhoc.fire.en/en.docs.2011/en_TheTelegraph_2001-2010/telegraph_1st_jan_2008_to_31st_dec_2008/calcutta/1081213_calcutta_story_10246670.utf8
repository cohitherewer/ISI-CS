                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Open door for army drill
  - THOUSANDS BRAVE SUN TO SALUTE BRAVEHEARTS          A STAFF REPORTER                          Twelve paragliders dived from a helicopter high above Victoria Memorial on Friday during the final dress   rehearsal for Vijay Diwas celebrations.

	For Natasha Rosemary and her two sons, aged 4 and 7, it was a Friday afternoon outing with a difference as they joined 2,000 others at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club for a rare glimpse of an army drill.        
	The decision by the army to invite civilians for such a display will help young children like my boys have a better understanding of and take greater pride in those protecting our country, said Natasha, eyes glued to the sky while her sons waved at helicopters during the Fly Past.        
	This was the first time since Vijay Diwas 1972 that the final dress rehearsal of Military Tattoo and Band Display was thrown open for public viewing, within weeks of the terror attacks in Mumbai.        
	Students and businessmen, friends and family  some wearing their patriotism on their sleeve and others curious to catch their first live military show  braved the blazing December sun at the Turf Club to cheer the bravehearts in uniform.        
	I have never missed the Republic Day and Independence Day parades on television. After what I saw today I want to join the Indian armed forces, said Raghav Shravan, a 14-year-old student of Don Bosco Park Circus.        
	Vijay Diwas commemorates the victory of the Indian armed forces on December 16, 1971, when Bangladesh was created.        
	The Eastern Command was at the forefront of the war, so this occasion is of great significance. We wanted the citizens of Calcutta to witness the gallantry of their armed forces, said Group Captain R.K. Das, the CPRO of the Eastern Command.        
	With the role of the armed forces on everyones lips from the night of November 26, the Indian army and the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation Limited, in association with The Telegraph, threw the gates open for the final countdown to Vijay Diwas on December 12 and 15 at the Turf Club.        
	Post-26/11, the feeling of patriotism is at its peak among the people. Suddenly the focus is on how important the armed forces are for the protection of our country and the citizens. That is why so many people have turned up to watch this drill, said T.V.N. Rao, the managing director of the tourism corporation.        
	Some of the loudest cheers on Friday were reserved for the death-defying stunts of the 35-member Corps of Signals Motor Cycle Rider Display Team. Among those applauding was Rahul Deb, a third-year student. This is a dream come true for me. It was an inspirational show.

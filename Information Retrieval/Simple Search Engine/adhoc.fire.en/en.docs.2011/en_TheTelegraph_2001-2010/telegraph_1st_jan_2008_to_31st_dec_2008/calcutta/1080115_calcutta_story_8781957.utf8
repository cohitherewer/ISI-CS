	Fireman Achintya Mukherjee collapsed while fighting the flames at Nandaram on Sunday night. He could barely breathe and had to be rushed to Medical College and Hospital.
    
	His colleagues Uday Adhikary and Kamal Nandy suffered serious eye injuries while trying to douse the blaze and had to be taken to a south Calcutta eye clinic for treatment.
    
	The fire that has been blazing at Nandaram Market for more than 72 hours can claim more victims any time, warned doctors on Monday.
    
	According to critical care expert Subrata Maitra, firemen working inside the complex can suffer mild to serious burns and also inhalation-linked injuries that can be fatal.
    
	Adhikary and Nandy are suffering because of sustained fire-fighting without adequate protection, said eye specialist Abhijit Sen, who treated the firemen.
    
	Like in the case of welding, staring at flames without protection damages the outer layer of the cornea, exposing the sensitive nerves in the second layer, explained Sen.
    
	This causes severe pain in the eye, especially when one blinks. The two firemen have to keep their eyes shut for 24 hours, using eye pads, to avoid an infection.
    
	The doctor warned that an infection at this stage could lead to loss of eyesight. The firemen must wear tinted glasses to avoid such eye damage, added Sen.
    
	Tinted glasses apart, firemen must also use oxygen masks to battle a blaze. Since the firemen are working in conditions where there is little or no oxygen, they must wear oxygen masks to avoid respiratory trouble, said Bhabotosh Biswas, the head of the cardio-thoracic department of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. 
    
	Inhalation of carbon monoxide can cause respiratory failure and even death. The poisonous gas severely affects the respiratory tracts, causing breathlessness, cough and choking, said Maitra.
    
	Firemen, however, said they lack even the basic amenities. We only have a helmet to protect our heads. There are no fire-proof jackets or oxygen masks, said a fireman.
    
	The residents of the area are also at risk. People suffering from asthma and cardiac problems can suffer serious attacks, added Biswas. 
    
	Long-term damage is a possibility, according to him. Chemicals are burning inside the building, emitting toxic gas. Whether the local residents and the firemen suffer long-term damage or not depends on the nature of the chemicals.

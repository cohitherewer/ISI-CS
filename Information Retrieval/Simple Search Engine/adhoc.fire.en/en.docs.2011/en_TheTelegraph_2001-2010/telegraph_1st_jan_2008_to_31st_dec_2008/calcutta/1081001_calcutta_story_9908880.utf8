                      Antiquated expressions                    The sepia-toned works of Josh P.S. are drenched in our colonial past. Echoing the sentiment espoused in the title of the ongoing exhibition, Alone in the Crowd, his works appear disparate, disjointed and even alienated from one another. But there is a unity in diversity at play for the artist dredges through the haze of history, memory and myth to come up with icons which recall the waves of invasion and colonisation that have swept the subcontinent over the past centuries. Josh also focuses on the skirmishes for wealth and power among imperialist forces that left behind a trail of relics and colonial architecture in our country. He has chosen his subjects with a great deal of care and deliberation while viewing them from the prism of contemporary events. They are not straightforward reflections, but those that offer a degree of ambiguity. Layered with meaning and laced with irony, they present a means of subversion to those who are able and willing to look behind the facade. They speak the language of exploitation and resistance, of violence and non-violence and of bondage and the desire for freedom.                  Event: Paintings, installations and prints by Josh P.S. When: Till October 4; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Bose Pacia, 18 Park Street

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Puri mantra works for couple 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The sea air has worked its magic, much like what the high court had hoped for.        
	A week ago, the court had asked a warring couple  Subrata Basu and Priyanka  to spend four days in Puri with their six-year-old son to see if their relationship could be mended.         
	On Thursday, the couple, who had separated two years ago, informed the judge that they have decided to give their marriage another try.         
	Judges of Calcutta High Court have used this formula on a number of couples on the brink of divorce and the outcome has been positive, more often than not.        
	We were both very worried about our child and had always been hopeful that things would get sorted out. The problem was that we never got a chance to reach out to each other to settle our differences. After going to Puri we sat down, discussed, and realised that our relationship was repairable, said Subrata on Thursday.        
	We were together after two years and had a great time. We would go for outings together and walk on the beach. We even visited Nandan Kanan. Now we want to start afresh. Priyanka is eager to return home to me. We want to get our son admitted to a good school. Its a happy occasion. Weve been through a lot of pain, which I hope is over now, he added before leaving for Mankundu in Hoogly to bring back his wife and son.         
	Subrata, a resident of Bandel, married Priyanka in 2001. A year later, they had a son. But since 2005, their relationship soured and in 2006, Priyanka went back to her parents in Mankundu with their son.        
	Priyanka moved court, Subrata retaliated and in mid-July the judge sent them to Puri.

  - XMAS CARNIVAL TO REVIVE PARK STREET          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          FUN STOP FANFARE: Park Street lit up for Christmas. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Park Street awaits a week-long carnival next Christmas, which will herald a public drive to revive the citys original entertainment destination.        
	Events like an orchid festival, art auction, wine-and-cheese dinner, concerts in restaurants and on ornate verandahs, and even a book fair and an exhibition of rare photographs have been lined up for the carnival.        
	The project  launching the public-participation initiative by Centre for Built Environment (CBE), a non-profit society of architects, city planners and environmental engineers  has been conceived to articulate an integrated scheme for the renewal of Park Streets urban fabric by creating a Park Street district.        
	The idea is to hark back to the golden era while also looking ahead, and this could be a pilot to what can be achieved there more generically, says Monica Khosla Bhargava.        
	The architect and urban designer from CBE had recently anchored a forum at Oxford Bookstore, where stakeholders on Park Street were given feedback forms to fill up. We are looking at all their suggestions, since the essence of the project is public participation, says Bhargava.        
	The Park Street district, as conceived by CBE, aims to revive and enhance the character of the entertainment street through reuse of the structures, verandahs, courtyards and landscaping. Cleaning up the sidewalks, re-arranging street furniture and street vendors and reducing visual clutter are among the basic priorities.        
	For the festival, a grand gateway to the fun hub is being planned at the Chowringhee end. A signature song with a video film featuring icons of Park Street, like Louis Banks and Usha Uthup, besides other personalities and institutions like historian Barun De and St Xaviers College, will also be created.        
	Kanchana Mukhopadhyay of Bingsha Shatabdi feels Park Street could be partially pedestrianised and the areas around the corridor rejuvenated, like the Centreville areas of European cities... We can even think of illumination like Champs Elysees and cast-iron benches for pedestrians.        
	Swaran Chaudhury, a resident of Middleton Row, is emphatic that Park Street should not be used as a thoroughfare, but agrees total pedestrianisation of the road may not be possible. How would she like to see the verandahs reused? Clean, vendor-free promenades with hanging flower baskets. She also stresses the need for the hawkers to become partners in the upkeep of the place.        
	Were in touch with the civic body, police and the urban development department for a plan to illustrate the potential for urban renewal and creation of a Park Street district, adds CBE president Santosh Ghosh.

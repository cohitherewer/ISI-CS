          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Soma Das, 17, was rescued from Jankipur village, in Purnea, Jharkhand, three days after she went missing from Jodhpur Colony, in the Lake area. Her parents alleged that she had been abducted.        
	A team was despatched after news came in on Thursday that Soma was in Purnea. Officers contacted a local NGO after reaching Purnea and then traced Soma.        
	Investigations suggest that Soma went off with neighbour Mohammad Ali, alias Rinku, who hails from Purnea. The police are yet to find out if she was taken to be sold off.        
	Officers of Lake police station have also started a hunt for 13-year-old Srabanti Baidya, of Gobindapur Colony, who has been reportedly missing since Wednesday evening. She went for her tuitions in the evening but didnt return, her parents said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC ruling on landgrab bid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HC ruling on landgrab bid
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Lolita Lekha nee Majumdar is free to demarcate her seven-cottah plot in Tollygunge that a section of local residents was out to grab, the high court has ruled.        
	The court, in a recent order, directed police to ensure that the nature, character and possession of Lolita Lekha nee Majumdars land is not changed by any party to the dispute during the pendency of the writ petition.        
	The plot at 130A Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road has been a bone of contention between Lolita, who inherited it from her father, and a local club, Netaji Jatiya Sebadal. When the 62-year-old NRI went to visit the plot in March, the club members  backed by Trinamul Congress MLA Arup Biswas  drove her out and threatened her with dire consequences if she ever claimed the property.        
	We are happy with the ruling. The court has granted liberty to my client to take steps to demarcate the property, said Lolitas lawyer Dolla Adhikary. The ruling was on a petition filed by the woman under Article 226 of the Constitution (infringement of fundamental rights) on April 10.        
	Lolita will start demarcation work once she receives the certified copy of the ruling, said Adhikary.        
	The Telegraph had on April 2 reported how local residents, in collusion with Biswas and some officers of Jadavpur police station, were trying to grab the plot.        
	Instead of helping out the woman, the police had blamed her for leaving the plot vacant for so long. A day after the report was published, North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar ordered a probe. Later, the police said Lolita was the rightful owner of the plot and assured her of all help if she wanted to construct a house there.

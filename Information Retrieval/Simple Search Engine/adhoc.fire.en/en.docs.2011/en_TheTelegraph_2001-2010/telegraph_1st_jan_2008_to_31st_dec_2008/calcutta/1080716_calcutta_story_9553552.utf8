           Study in contrast: A page in the June 19 edition of Metro                             
	Monsoon brings both good and bad news for Calcuttans  good news because the season offers respite from the sweltering summer heat, bad news because waterlogging is inevitable in the city streets (Pleasant surprise in flooded streets, June 18). Against this backdrop, the news of the measures taken by the civic authorities to stop waterlogging made for heartwarming reading. What is commendable is that the pockets that used to suffer the most during heavy rain have been spared the inconvenience of waist-deep water.           
	I lived in Amherst Street from 1968 to 1976 and saw first-hand how the residents suffered because of waterlogging as a result of clogged drains. I then moved to Labony Estate in Salt Lake, which too goes under water after heavy rain for an hour. That Ultadanga was not waterlogged during the recent spells of rain is wonderful news for me. If water is being pumped out at Ultadanga, Salt Lake is sure to benefit. Similar measures ought to be taken in other parts of the city.

	It is really commendable that the mayor is by the side of the city residents even when they are knee-deep in distress (Knee-deep in distress and Wet look, June 19). He must be amazingly energetic to be able to attend a programme to felicitate actor Soumitra Chatterjee after being extremely worried all day about his subjects under knee to waist-deep water. I know the resident of Silpara, Narayan Roy Road, in the picture next to the mayors with a film star. The gentleman showed me the picture, elated that the mayor was beside him at the time of peril.             
	Diptimoy De,
  Narayan Roy Road           
	The photographs of mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattcharyya holding a glass of cold drink and a hapless man holding on to an iron rod to save himself from drowning near Taratala Road (Rain, for better or worse, June 18) speaks volumes about the uncaring attitude of our mayor. When major parts of the city were under waist-deep water after one spell of rain, one expected the mayor to supervise pumping operations instead of relaxing in the company of an actress.           
	A.S. Mehta, 
  New Alipore           
	The people of Behala have been suffering enormously because of waterlogging. While the mayor has been promising to alleviate the distress of the residents in all his statements, reports in Metro lead us to conclude that there has been utter mismanagement, if not gross negligence, in ensuring the well-being of the people and protecting the environment. The principle causes of waterlogging appear to be improper implementation of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, lack of alternate drainage arrangement during execution of the project, inadequate de-silting of drains, blockage of outflow channels and inadequate pumping arrangements. Those who are entrusted with the responsibility of executing such important projects need to be penalised for their inaction or wrong action.

	Accumulated rainwater in Lower Rawdon Street has so far receded the quickest this monsoon. This was because the blocked drains were cleared. The condition of Hungerford Street and Moira Street, where the civic body did some work, and of AJC Bose Road, Sarat Bose Road, Theatre Road, Camac Street and Woodburne Park Road remain the same.           
	S.S. Almal, 
  Lower Rawdon Street                       
	Apropos the report School tips to block bullies, June 21, it is good to know that many schools are joining hands with the government to eradicate ragging by counselling Plus-II students. Every year, we read of students ending their lives or sustaining injuries after being ragged. Many of the victims, generally the most vulnerable in the class, develop psychological ailments.             
	Sourish Misra,
  Salt Lake                   
	Going by the report Touch of irony in couple killers end, June 17, one gets the impression that if someone is over 50, of frail health, and has enough moolah, he or she can afford to plot a murder or two, as the court will allow bail ad infinitum on health grounds.             
	Md Motleb Ali,

	Apropos Police bear with beacons, June 4, if the police force had more traffic sergeants and assistant commissioners like Sudip Kumar Maity and K. Harirajan, vehicles with beacons would have thought twice before breaking rules.             
	Kajal Chatterjee,
  Sodepur             
	Apropos the report HS students lose out in admissions, July 9, of the 50 students admitted into our BA English (honours) class this year, 16 (not seven) come from the West Bengal HS board. Also, we do not take in students on the basis of their school-leaving board marks, but entirely on their performance in our admission test.

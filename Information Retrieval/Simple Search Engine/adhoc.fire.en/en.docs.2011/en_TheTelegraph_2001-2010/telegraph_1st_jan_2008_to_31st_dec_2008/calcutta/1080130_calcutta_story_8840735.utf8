           Flute fusion
          Canadian bansuri flute player and composer Catherine Potter has carved out a distinctive niche in the world music scene with her sophisticated cross-cultural approach, the fruit of a long, musical journey between Montreal and Mumbai. A student of Hariprasad Chaurasia, she performs this evening with a world fusion ensemble, weaving together the best of north Indian classical music, jazz and contemporary sounds. The music of the Catherine Potter Quintet blends ancient and current traditions, faithfully rendering the intricate beauty of Indian ragas and talas while creating jazzy atmospheres and enticing rhythms with forays into flamenco and funk as well. Hosted by Canadian government, Canadian High Commission, New Delhi and Canadian Consulate, Calcutta.
         Event: Fusion music performance by Catherine Potter Quintet When: Today at 7 pm Where: Calcutta School of Music, Sandr Hall

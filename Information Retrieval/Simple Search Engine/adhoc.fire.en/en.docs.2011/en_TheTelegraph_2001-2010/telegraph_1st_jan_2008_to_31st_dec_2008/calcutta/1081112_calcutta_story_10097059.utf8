	Police hope that Sadaquats arrest will lead them to Amir Reza Khan, believed to be the founder of Indian Mujaheedin. Amir and his right-hand man Sadaquat were allegedly involved in the attack on the American Center in January 2002.         
	We are interrogating Sadaquat to find out the whereabouts of Amir Reza Khan, a resident of Mufiddul Islam Lane in central Calcutta. He will be brought to the city once we get permission from court, said an officer of the special task force of Calcutta police.        
	Amir, who is the prime suspect in the recent serial explosions in Delhi and Ahmedabad, is reportedly hiding in Pakistan. According to Calcutta police, he left for Bangladesh after the American Center attack.        
	We have information that Sadaquat was in touch with Amir during the recent blasts. We will question Amirs family members in the city to find out whether Sadaquat had contacted them, pointed out an officer.        
	Sadaquat, who assumed the name Sadique after the American Center attack, was picked up by Mumbai police a month and a half ago in connection with serial blasts on local trains. On Saturday, he told a Calcutta police team that he had fired 69 rounds at policemen guarding the Center.        
	On Tuesday, Sadaquat was interrogated in Ahmedabad in connection with the blasts there. According to police sources, Sadaquat has confessed that he was involved in all major blasts in the country till the Mumbai train blasts in 2006. This includes the blasts at Gorakhpur, at Sankatmochan Temple in Varanasi and Sarojini Nagar Market in New Delhi in 2005.

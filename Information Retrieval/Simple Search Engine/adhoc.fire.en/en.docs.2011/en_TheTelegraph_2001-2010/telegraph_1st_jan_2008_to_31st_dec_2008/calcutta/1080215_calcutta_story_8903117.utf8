The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Illegal entry bar on fliers 
                                                                                                               Illegal entry bar on fliers 
  - ADVISORY TO CARRIERS          SANJAY MANDAL                          Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport: Unauthorised passengers, stay away. A Telegraph picture                                        
	The immigration authorities have asked international airlines to ensure that unauthorised passengers do not get to land at Calcutta airport.        
	The airlines have been asked to prevent passengers not allowed to enter the country through Calcutta from boarding city-bound flights and to "thoroughly scan" the documents of fliers on the way to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	The advisory follows the unauthorised arrival of three Pakistani nationals at the airport on February 10.        
	Mumtaz Ruksana, 52, Syed Masroor Hussain Shah, 40, and Mumtaz Ahmed Khan, 62, who arrived by Jet Airways's Dhaka-Calcutta flight, were denied entry at the airport and sent back by GMG Airline.        
	According to rules, a Pakistani national can enter or leave India by air only through Delhi and Mumbai airports.        
	"We are writing to Jet Airways, asking it to ensure that such incidents do not recur," said Basab Talukdar, the chief immigration officer of eastern India.        
	Immigration officials said international airlines often allow passengers without a valid passport or visa to board a flight.        
	Airline personnel at the check-in counters are not supposed to issue a boarding pass to a passenger who does not possess valid travel documents.        
	On January 18, an NRI from New York had arrived at Calcutta airport, via Dubai, on an Emirates flight. His passport had expired on January 12, but since the date of validity stamped on it was not legible, the passenger did not renew it. The 62-year-old man was denied entry at the airport and had to return to Dubai.        
	The authorities are also worried over direct transit passengers, who arrive at Calcutta on their way to another international destination to catch a connecting flight.        
	"Since there is no special lounge for direct transit passengers, they have to be allowed in the common areas. We have no idea how many such passengers arrive and whether all board connecting flights," said Talukdar.         
	The immigration authorities have asked international carriers to provide a list of passengers on direct transit.

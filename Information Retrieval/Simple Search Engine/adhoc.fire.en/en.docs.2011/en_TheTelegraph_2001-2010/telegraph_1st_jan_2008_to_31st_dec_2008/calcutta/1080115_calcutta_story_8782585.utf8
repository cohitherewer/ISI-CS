	The Burrabazar blaze threw traffic in large parts of central Calcutta out of gear on Monday.
 
	The worst-affected were those headed for Howrah, as New Howrah Bridge Approach Road and Brabourne Road were blocked to facilitate fire-fighting.
 
	The only artery leading to Howrah that was open was Strand Road, which was plagued with snarls for most part of the day. Every time a tender rushed towards Mullickghat pumping station for a refill, traffic sergeants suspended vehicular movement on the road, adding to the congestion.
 
	Mahatma Gandhi Road was only open for the city-bound traffic from Howrah.
 
	Also chock-a-block with vehicles were APC Road, BB Ganguly Street, Chittaranjan Avenue and Rani Rashmoni Avenue.
 
	 ldquo;We tried all possible diversions to ensure smooth car flow. If things work according to plan, Brabourne Road will be opened tomorrow, rdquo; said Ranveer Kumar, the joint commissioner of police (traffic).
 
	But commuters who were forced to make detours, that only ended in snarls, wondered why one flank of Brabourne Road was not opened on Monday.

	 ldquo;From Howarh, one had to travel through Posta down Kali Krishna Tagore Street to reach Chittaranjan Avenue. With the road kept open for traffic on both ways, vehicles hardly moved, rdquo; said Subhendu Ghosh, a small-time trader of electronic goods from Ultadanga, who travelled the stretch on Monday afternoon.
 
	For vehicles heading for Sealdah from Howrah, the only road open was Mahatma Gandhi Road. But with onlookers at the fire site spilling on to the thoroughfare near Sonapatty, buses, taxis and two-wheelers had a tough time moving.
 
	As the situation was becoming increasingly difficult to handle, senior officers, including joint commissioner Kumar, discussed the feasibility of opening one flank of Brabourne Road.
 
	But with the local people still gathered on the road in front of the Nandaram-Kashiram complex and the mood remaining tense, the officers decided to maintain a status quo.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Girl rejects her runaway mom
  - High court accepts six-year-olds wish to continue to stay with father          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	A law that recognises a mothers right to her child as greater than the fathers until the age of 14 had to be reinterpreted on Monday when little Anita exclaimed: But I dont even know her!        
	Anita was only 25 days old when her mother, Rina Hazra, deserted husband Prabir and their newborn. The then 25-year-old woman was admittedly so depressed at not giving birth to a boy after seven years of marriage that she never returned to her husbands house at Tetultala Jala in Piyara Bagan, Howrah.         
	Staying with her parents, Rina wasnt to come out of that phase for another six years, by which time Anita would be her fathers daughter.        
	The high court bench that heard Rinas custody petition not having remarried, she had a strong case  tried in vain to convince Anita that she would need her mother more until her early teens. The Class II student of a convent school in Liluah took only a second to give her verdict.        
	I want to stay with my father. I will not go with her (Rina), she said.        
	Justices Amit Talukdar and P.S. Banerjee didnt have another question to ask. They only had a few words of sympathy and advice for Rina. We have tried our level best. Although custody cases are not within our jurisdiction, we have tried and failed. You have the liberty to approach the appropriate forum, the bench said.        
	Rina can, however, approach a lower court only for visiting rights.        
	Anita, happy as only a child can be after such an emotionally draining moment, went back home with her father as if nothing had happened.        
	Prabirs lawyers Jaymalya Bagchi and Rajiv Lochan Chatterjee said it was a complicated case that tested the court. The firmness with which Anita said she wanted to stay with her father prompted the judges to allow her to do so, they said.        
	A medicine shop employee, Prabir had feared arrest on receiving a lawyers notice from his wife in February and moved the high court for anticipatory bail. After fixing the date for the in-camera hearing, the division bench asked Prabir to bring Anita along.         
	Tears were the first indication of what was in Anitas mind. When the judges asked her to go to her mother, she cried, Bagchi said.

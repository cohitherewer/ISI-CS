                      Strokes of genius                    An artist destined to work within a transitional period of society or an artistic movement is often caught up in uncertainties. Preceded by a strong tradition in an art environment with virtually nothing new to offer him, Abani Sens career in art was perhaps strengthened by his complex situation. His handling of figures, colours and movements, created through bold brush strokes, reflects his anxiety and restlessness. Well-known for his watercolours, the expressive oils he painted during the Bengal Famine of 1943 are poignant reminders of that period in history. His favourite subjects are wildlife and nature. Bearing influence of Indian, Far Eastern and Western styles, his works are full of passion and vigour and characterised by his simple, bold and sincere attitude to his art. Whispered Legacy, the ongoing retrospective of paintings and drawings by the great master, features an impressive collection of watercolour, pastel and oil amp; charcoal works. Curator: Ina Puri.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings and drawings by Abani Sen When: Till July 28; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Emami Chisel Art Pvt. Ltd, Emami Towers, 687 Anandapur E.M.

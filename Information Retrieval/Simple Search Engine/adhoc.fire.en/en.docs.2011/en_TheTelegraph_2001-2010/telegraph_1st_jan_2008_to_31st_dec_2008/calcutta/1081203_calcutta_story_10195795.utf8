The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | PM to unveil hospital
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       PM to unveil hospital
          DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY                          The multi-speciality Bharat Sevashram Sangha Hospital on Diamond Harbour Road                                   
	A multi-speciality hospital set up by Bharat Sevashram Sangha in Joka will be unveiled by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on December 6.        
	The hospital will offer treatment at an affordable rate without compromising on quality, said Swami Brahmatmananda, the secretary of the hospital.        
	The six-storeyed Bharat Sevashram Sangha Hospital, coming up across seven acres, will have 500 beds. In the first phase, which the Prime Minister will unveil, there will be 50 beds for eye patients.         
	Swami Biswatmananda, the chief co-ordinator of the Sangha, said the first phase would have an outpatients department, a diagnostic wing and dedicated units for medicine, surgery, gynaecology, eye and ENT.        
	Once complete, the Rs 150-crore hospital will have 100 clinics to be attended by 100 doctors. Every patient will be able to consult a doctor by paying a nominal fee. If a doctor advises a diagnostic test, it will be done here at half the cost of private hospitals, Swami Biswatmananda said.        
	The entire hospital is likely to be ready within a couple of years.        
	The location of the hospital  at the junction of urban and rural areas  is unique, the secretary pointed out. Surrounded by a rural belt, the hospital is hardly 20 km from Esplanade. People living in the vicinity of the hospital hardly get any opportunity for specialised treatment. The hospital will address their needs.        
	There will also be a wing for treating snakebites, as the number of such patients is high in South 24-Parganas.         
	But we cannot start the wing immediately as intensive care unit, intensive therapy unit and facilities for dialysis  which are needed for treating patients  are not yet ready, said Biswatmananda.        
	To review the security for the Prime Minister and his team, district police superintendent Ajey Ranade and other senior officers visited the hospital on Monday.         
	We have asked the hospital authorities to allot space for setting up a police outpost, said Ranade.

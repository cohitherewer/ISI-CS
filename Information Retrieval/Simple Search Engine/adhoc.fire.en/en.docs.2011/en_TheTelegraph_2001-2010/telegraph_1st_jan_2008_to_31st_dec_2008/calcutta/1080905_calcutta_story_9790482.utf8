                      Expressions of life                    A number of young contemporary artists have come together to portray their vision of life in Entourage de Color, the ongoing exhibition of paintings and sculptures. Refreshingly different from the conventional mould, their works explore the hidden mysteries of life, time and its relations. They also make interesting forays into existential space, delve into the subconscious and try to explain and interpret dreams. The paintings of Somit Gupta are an attempt to articulate his experience of life, capturing the myriad hues of the physical and metaphysical. Nobina Guptas works are inspired by the natural energy of the universe. Her images are visual metaphors of objects of the organic world. The art works of Saumik are shaped by time and its relationship with the individual; his works trace the journey of an artist as he meanders through life. Piyali Sadhukhan (a painting by her appears here) reflects her stance vis-a-vis politics, civilisation and society through her canvases. Santanu Chakrabortys works are aesthetic expressions of his ordinary, familiar surroundings. The prints of Jayshree Basak depict sufferings through subtle, stunning images. Ritabrata Joarder paints his conscious and sub-conscious mind in his works, leaving impressions of his own mental paradoxes. Pradip Kr Patra gives wings to his creativity in distinctive style, using his sculptures as a medium to share his dreams.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Daggers drawn over plot   Police order probe, victim seeks cover
                                                                                                               Daggers drawn over plot
   - Police order probe, victim seeks cover          A STAFF REPORTER                                                      The Netaji Jatiya Sebadal club house. A Telegraph picture		    
	Lolita Lekha nee Majumdar is living in fear as those determined to grab her land turn more belligerent and the wheels of a slothful state administration begin to turn ever so slowly.        
	The morning after the land grab attempt at Ranikuthi was reported in The Telegraph, South 24-Parganas police ordered an inquiry into the matter.        
	I have asked the deputy superintendent of police (town) to conduct a detailed inquiry and submit a report. We will take action after going through the report, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).        
	Wednesday saw Lolita Lekha nee Majumdar seeking protection from Park Street police station. I am scared of those people, as they can harm me. I am alone in the city here and my children (in America) are frightened about my safety. So, I have requested officers of Park Street police to provide me protection, said the 62-year-old NRI, who has put up with friends on Park Street.        
	Lolitas fears were compounded with Arup Biswas, the Trinamul Congress MLA of Tollygunge, chairing a meeting at the local borough office in support of the local club Netaji Jatiya Sebadals efforts to deny the rightful owner access to her ancestral property.        
	This vacant land is the lungs of Tollygunge and we cannot it give up. Local people will form a committee to save it, Biswas said.        
	What about Lolitas right to property? The land belongs to the club, he insisted.        
	As far as legal proceedings go, Jadavpur police station is required to submit a report to the Alipore magistrates court on April 18, detailing action taken in the matter following the courts directive on March 18. The police called us this morning and asked me to submit all the documents relating to the land, said Dolla Adhikari, Lolitas lawyer.        
	We had submitted all documents a month ago, but on Wednesday, they said they could not understand the papers.... It is so strange. We have now decided to file a writ petition in Calcutta High Court under Article 226 (infringement of fundamental rights) of the Constitution, added Dolla.

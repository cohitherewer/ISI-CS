                                                                                                               Dispute over tech hub water
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Bidhannagar Municipality and Naba Diganta Industrial Township Authority, the administrative authority of Sector V, are on collision course over water.        
	Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company, a private firm setting up the tech hubs water supply network on behalf of Naba Diganta, has kept two pipes near the two CMDA reservoirs in Central Park with the intention of drawing water from them.        
	We called up Naba Diganta officials and were told that they intend to take water from the reservoirs. If the Sector V water is drawn from there, the Salt Lake supply will be hampered. We met the Naba Diganta official on Wednesday to discuss the issue, said Tapan Talukdar, the chairman-in-council (water supply) of the municipality, on Wednesday.        
	S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Naba Diganta, said: It will take two years for the network to be ready. We wont draw water before that.         
	Representatives of the municipalities concerned and the state municipal affairs department are slated to meet on Friday over the issue.

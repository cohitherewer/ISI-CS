                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SSKM clears hostel

	Male undergraduate students of SSKM were asked to leave their hostel and classes were indefinitely suspended after two unions fighting to enlist new members had a go at each other with rods and stumps.         
	In all probability, the hostel doors will never open again for these 330-odd students because of the vandalism they resorted to on campus, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM.         
	The decision to suspend classes and clear the hostel of undergraduate students was taken at a meeting convened by the authorities to discuss violence on the campus since the close of admissions on Thursday. Police had restrained the warring groups, one from the Students Federation of India and the other from the All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO), after the first clash but they were back in the act on Friday morning.         
	Members of the two unions attacked each other in the hostel and then took the fight to other parts of SSKM, including the administrative building. Several students were injured in front of the medical superintendents office. Reporters and non-medical staff were attacked, too, and one group allegedly destroyed a television camera.         
	After deciding to clear the mens hostel of all undergraduate boarders, professors and other officials went from room to room to ask the students to leave by 3pm, a source said.         
	Some students refused to leave and others sought more time even as the violence continued. Girls were exempted from the order, but they voluntarily vacated their hostels.        
	Gourango Pramanik, the unit secretary of the AIDSO, claimed that some members of the hospital co-ordination committee were injured during the police lathicharge and not in any attack by the students. He accused the SFI of bringing outsiders to the campus to ransack the hostel.         
	The SFI said 15 of its members were injured in the clashes. Its rival union pegged the number of activists hurt in the fracas at 14. The two groups had been competing with each other for new members from the time admissions started on Wednesday.        
	The students have to pay just Rs 12 per month for the hostel rooms and they go about breaking stuff and smashing each others laptops. They were not studying here, so they wont lose much if classes are suspended, Mitra said.

                      Portrait of a holy city                    One of the most ancient Indian cities, Varanasi, or Kashi as it is also known, has, over the centuries, attracted a steady stream of monarchs, saints, students, musicians, devotees and, of course, artists. Eternal Varanasi, the ongoing show of recent works on the city by a group of six eminent artists, represents its complex legacy of mystique and richly-textured history. While some choose to exhibit their detailed knowledge of Varanasis numerous lanes and bylanes, others depict the holy men who have made the city their home, while the rest celebrate the uniqueness of Varanasis architectural heritage. The works on show contextualise the crucial emotional role played by the city on the artists consciousness. Its social and cultural life no less important than its temples, palaces, shrines and mosques, the articulation of its tangible and intangible heritage is what makes the exhibition distinctive. Participants: Ganesh Haloi, Subuddha Ghosh, Giovanna Caruso (a painting by her appears here), S. Pranam Singh, Tapas Kanti Mitra and Tapas Ghosal.                  lEvent: An exhibition of recent works by a group of artists lWhen: Till August 21; 11 am - 7 pm lWhere: Gallery K2, Supra Court, 35 Lansdowne Terrace,

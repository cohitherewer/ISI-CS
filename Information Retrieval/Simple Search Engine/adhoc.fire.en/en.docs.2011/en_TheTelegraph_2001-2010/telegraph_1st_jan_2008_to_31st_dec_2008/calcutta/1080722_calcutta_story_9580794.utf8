                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       UPA a hit with punters
          ZEESHAN JAWED                                            
	Manmohan Singh will sail through the trust vote comfortably, if the mood in the Burrabazar betting circuit is anything to go by.        
	The odds were fluctuating with every piece of news or rumour trickling in but on Monday afternoon, the mood in the trade hub was predominantly in favour of the government winning the trust vote.        
	An insider said the odds were 25 paise if the UPA won and Rs 3.50 if it failed to reach the magic mark of 271. Which means, for a bet of Re 1, a punter will get Rs 1.25 if the UPA wins and Rs 4.50 if the Opposition wins.        
	The betting syndicate that was lying low after Indian Premier League became active soon after Prakash Karat withdrew support to the government on July 8. As the political drama unfolded and the MPs started switching sides, the interest of the people heightened. Till now, I have received wagers worth Rs 3 crore, said a bookie while taking down bets on his notebook.        
	Nobody wants elections now. The general feeling is that the UPA will sail through. The betting syndicate across the country is operating with this general feeling, said the bookmaker.        
	The excitement of making a few quick bucks can be felt in every lane and bylane of Burrabazar. Traders in the gaddis were glued to television sets, keeping themselves abreast with the latest developments in Delhi.        
	I hope to make up for the losses I had suffered after the stock market crash, said a businessman in Sonapatti, who was praying for the UPAs victory on Tuesday.        
	But cops are spending sleepless nights. People here start betting even on weather. We have stepped up vigil and are keeping a tab on the usual suspects, said an officer of Posta police station.

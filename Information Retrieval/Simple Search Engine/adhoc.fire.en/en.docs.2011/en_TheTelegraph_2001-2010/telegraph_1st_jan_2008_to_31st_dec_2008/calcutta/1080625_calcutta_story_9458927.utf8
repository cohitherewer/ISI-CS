          A STAFF REPORTER                                              The minibus and the   cycle-van    
	A minibus hit a cycle-van carrying two schoolgirls at Bagha Jatin on Tuesday afternoon, injuring both.        
	Rituparna Das and Rupmita Ghosh, students of classes VI and V of Jadavpur Sammelani Balika Vidyalaya, were injured in the head and face. The van-puller was injured in the face and hands.        
	The driver and conductor of the minibus fled the spot. Witnesses said the mishap occurred around 4pm, when the driver of the bus on the Bijoygarh-Howrah route lost control and hit the van near Layalka.        
	I rushed out on hearing a loud thud and found the two girls, bleeding profusely, being dragged out of the mangled remains of the van, said Indrajit Pal, who lives close to the mishap spot.        
	The girls, both residents of Bagha Jatin, were taken to Bijoygarh Hospital and the van-puller to Bagha Jatin Hospital. Rituparna was later shifted to RG Kar Hospital and Rupmita to SSKM Hospital.        
	She will be under observation for the next 36 hours, said Rituparnas uncle. Rupmita, too, is under observation.        
	We are trying to trace the driver and conductor. A case of rash driving has been started, said a senior police officer.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Burglars entered a Burrabazar jewellery shop by breaking open the shutter lock and made off with Rs 20 lakh in cash early on Wednesday.        
	 The burglary was detected when co-owners Rajesh Kumar Bubna and Amit Tibrewal opened the Clive Row shop at 10am. They found the vault open and the cash missing.        
	An officer from Burrabazar police station said the theft seemed to be the handiwork of a local gang. The owners suspected theft the moment they found the main gate lock broken. We have interrogated some employees of the shop. We are also probing the relationship between the owners.

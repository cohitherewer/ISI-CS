          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The middle-aged woman whose body was found beside Kestopur canal in Salt Lake on Sunday has been identified.        
	The woman was Shefali Biswas, 40, a resident of Adarshapally in Rajarhat. She joined AMRI Hospital in Salt Lake as a nurse eight months ago, an officer of Bidhannagar East police station said on Monday.        
	A probe is on and we are waiting for the post-mortem report to know the cause of the death. Family members of the deceased have not lodged a complaint, the officer added.        
	The cops said Shefali was married with two daughters, aged 16 and 10 years. Husband Pijush is a mason in the Rajarhat area.        
	Family members said the hospital had recruited Shefali through Bharati Ayah Centre, a private agency in Kestopur that provides nurses to hospitals and nursing homes.        
	She was on the night shift on Saturday and left home for work in the evening. When she did not return the next morning, we called up the hospital but the authorities said she had not turned up the previous night. Late on Sunday, the police informed us about the body, said Shefalis younger brother Nikhil Biswas.        
	He said the family would go through the post-mortem report to know the cause of the death and then decide on filing a complaint of unnatural death.        
	Shefali was found lying face down beside Kestopur canal, behind Sarat Abasan in Salt Lake, on Sunday morning.

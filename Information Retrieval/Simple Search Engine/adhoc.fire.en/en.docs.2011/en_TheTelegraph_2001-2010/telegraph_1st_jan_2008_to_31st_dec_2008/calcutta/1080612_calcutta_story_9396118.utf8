                      Celebrity profiles                    Beginning his career with painting landscapes, Samir Ghosh became interested in portrait art from the time his work with Geological Survey of India brought him in acquaintance with the evolution of pre-historic animal and human life. Creating astonishing likenesses of well-known personalities has become an obsession with him ever since. For Ghosh, his creations are never an attempt to prove his own skill. Instead, they are simple expressions of his own feelings about contemporary life and times. Personalities, the ongoing exhibition of his paintings consisting mainly portrait studies in oil on board, offers a remarkable variety of subjects, from political figures (Jawaharlal Nehru, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) and business heads (Basant Kumar Birla) to academicians (Amartya Sen, Dr Pratap Chandra Chandra), ascetics (Sree Maa, Swami Vivekananda), filmmakers (Satyajit Ray), music personalities (Lata Mangeshkar; portrait above), artists (Chintamani Kar, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay) and even sportspersons (Sourav Ganguly, Ishant Sharma).                  Event: Paintings by Samir Ghosh When: Till June 14; 12 noon - 8 pm Where: Asutosh Birth Centenary Hall, Indian Museum

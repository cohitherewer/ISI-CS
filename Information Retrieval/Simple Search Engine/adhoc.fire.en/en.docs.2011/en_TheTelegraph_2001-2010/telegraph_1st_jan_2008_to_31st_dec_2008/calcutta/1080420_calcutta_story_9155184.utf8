										      flashback                        The door at 35A Sambhunath Pandit Road; (below) a handout of the company. Pictures by Aranya Sen				                                 
	One would hardly associate this two-storeyed tumbledown house at 35A Sambhunath Pandit Road in Kansaripara of Bhowanipore with pre-Independence Bengali enterprise. But if one scrutinises the groundfloor wall facing the street, one cannot miss the legends on the arches above the windows and the door.        
	The one over the door reads: By appointment to His Excellency The Right Honble The Baron Chelmsford, Viceroy and Governor General of India. Grish Chunder Dutt and Sons. The writings over the windows advertise their skills as gold and silversmiths, jewellers, electro-platers, engravers and brass workers.        
	According to a surviving letterhead, it was established in 1872, and HE Shri Chakravarti Rajagopalacharya, the governor of West Bengal, was the last dignitary, post-Independence, to seek its services.        
	The tiny room inside is as dark and cool as an earthern pitcher. It used to be the office of Grish. Plaster has flaked off the walls. Layers of grime have turned the glass partitions and windows opaque. Two glass globes hang from the ceiling.        
	Sanjib Kumar Dutt, 79, said his great grandfather had started the business, but it flourished when his grandfather, Grish, and father, Paresh Chunder, were at the helm of affairs. The family business closed down soon after Independence, for thereafter, nobody had any use for silver salvers, tea services and cutlery.        
	Of the older generation only Sanjib Dutt and his elder brother, Prabodh Chunder Dutt, have survived. The latter, at 83, is frail and bent double.         
	Sanjib Dutt fished out some of the old promotional literature, mainly handbills and letters. A single column on one letter lists the British bigwigs  The Earl of Elgin, Baron Curzon, Earl of Minto, Baron Hardinge, Baron Chelmsford and other former viceroys and governor generals of India  who were their customers. Their other patrons were commanders-in-chief in India, former governors of Bengal and maharajas of Cooch Behar and Jammu amp; Kashmir.        
	Another handbill reproduces letters and encomiums from Chief Justice Harold Derbyshire, military secretary and the registrar of Calcutta University in appreciation of the fine workmanship and the artistic skill and promptitude in execution evinced by your firm in making a silver cup or a casket. The military secretary actually visited the shop at 10am on November 20, 1912. The handbill contains a map indicating the location of the shop. This was no mean achievement at a time when Hamiltons and Cooke amp; Kelvey of Old Court House Street reigned supreme.         
	Although not a single moth-eaten catalogue exists today, one handout contains some specimens of the objects created by Grish for superb craftsmanship at moderate price. It shows a silver tea service, gold charms  a tiny rickshaw, telephone, bell and horseshoe hanging from a chain  silver challenge shield, silver salvers, village scene embossed on silver rose bowl, the same scene on a silver cigarette case, gold rings amp; ear tups set with diamonds or jarkons.        
	Grish also made a full size carriage of silver to the order of the Maharaja of Rewa, which was presented to the Prince of Wales at the Delhi Durbar in 1921. Among his other products were three miniature models of Sanchi Stupa, one of which was presented to Jawaharlal Nehru by Mahabodhi Society. The Indian government presented the second to the Dalai Lama of Tibet, and the third one was made as a sacred pot to preserve the holy relics of two great disciples of Lord Buddha, Sariputta and Moha Moghalenna.        
	Grish received the highest award for silver model from C.P. amp; Berar exhibition, Nagpur 1908, and gold medal from Calcutta Industrial amp; Agricultural Exhibition 1906-7.        
	Sanjib says in spite of their Raj connections, Grish was a staunch nationalist. They were present at the Congress exhibition and had created the thrones of the deity at Madanmohantala in Bagbazar, and that in the shrine at PN Tagores garden house near Bally. Debi Prasad Roychoudhury lived in this neighbourhood and he helped model the thrones. Balmer Lawrie and Martin Burn were our customers and my father had himself learnt the craft. The fathers of St Xaviers College would drop by to teach him how to use the imported chemicals, says the faded gentleman, delighted to relive the past.        
	In 1945, when the Bengal governor RG Casey dropped in, policemen cordoned off the entire neighbourhood and when the Dutts received him, their feet were still bare, and they wore a dhoti and shirt as usual.        
	After 1947, as the business downturned, most of the equipment was sold. Sanjib opened a door leading to a tiny courtyard, once used as a workshop. It is a junkyard now.

	THE DIARY
 
	Rain
 
	When rain lashed my city, 

 An Atlantis it had become. 

 Mother nature had to speak, 

 For we just stood there mum. 

 Trees have lost their space, 

 And city lungs been paved. 

 Who has time to see? 

 If Mother nature is saved? 

 The rain was just a slap, 

 This time Mother was mild. 

 But the brat we know as man, 

 He won rsquo;t learn, the spoilt child. 

 God forbid the day when, 

 On revenge she is bent. 

 For man, the fool he is, 

 Won rsquo;t learn till his time is spent.

	After the Pause
 
	I was sitting under a moonlit sky 

 Waiting for something, 

 I know not what, 

 The clear sky, the twinkling star, 

 The lit candles, the people so far
 
	 I had waited too long 

 For things to change, 

 For the road to take me to my destination 

 Without moving a limb.
 
	As the moon travelled across in the sky, 

 I felt a shiver run down my spine, 

 Maybe it was not too late, 

 Maybe I could reach the finishing line, 

 The race was not over.

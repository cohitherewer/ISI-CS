                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Students lay siege to school
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Trouble broke out at Julien Day School in Madhyamgrams Ganganagar area on Thursday following an altercation between students and the school authorities.         
	A teacher misbehaved with some senior students. He has a history of misbehaviour and we had complained to the authorities several times, said a Class XII student.         
	Demanding an apology from the vice-principal, angry students shut the main gate and closed all doors and windows of the building, allowing no one to leave the premises.         
	The blockade continued till 7pm  a good three hours after school time  forcing Madhyamgram and airport police to intervene. The principal got in touch with us and we went over to the school, said Ashok Roy, the sub-divisional officer of Belghoria, under whose jurisdiction the school falls.         
	The cops held a meeting with the students and their parents in the presence of the school authorities, following which the siege was lifted.         
	Principal J.K. Sen refused comment.

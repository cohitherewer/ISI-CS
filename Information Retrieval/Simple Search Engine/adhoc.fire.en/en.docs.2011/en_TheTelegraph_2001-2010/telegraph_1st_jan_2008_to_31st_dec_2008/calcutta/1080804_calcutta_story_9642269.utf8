                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       False alarm at airport amp; Howrah
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Unclaimed luggage in the domestic and international terminals of the airport and a terror threat conveyed over phone to a Government Railway Police official at Howrah station kept the bomb disposal squad busy on Sunday.        
	They turned out to be false alarms, but passengers and visitors at all three places spent anxious moments till the experts announced that no bombs were found.        
	The panic button was first pressed at 10.20am, when Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel at the domestic terminal of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport spotted an unclaimed bag. The area was cordoned off immediately.        
	There was relief all around when the bomb squad discovered that the bag contained only toys. The owner, Vijay Kumar, turned up a little later to claim the bag. The resident of Posta, Burrabazar, said he was at the airport to receive his wife and daughter who had arrived from Guwahati, but forgot to pick up the bag.         
	He left out the bag while putting his familys luggage on a trolley. He was fined Rs 200, a CISF official said.        
	The bomb squad received a second call a couple of hours later, this time from the international terminal. A black bag found abandoned in the terminal around 12.30pm was checked for explosives, but there were only clothes, an invalid passport and a box of sweets inside.         
	Officials of the CISF said the bag belonged to Rana Vijay Yadav, a resident of UP. He was on his way to Bangkok and had left the bag behind.        
	Around 2.50pm, there was a bomb scare at Howrah railway station. A.K Singh, the officer-in-charge of the Howrah Government Railway Police, said he received a call on his cellphone from a person who claimed that a black bag kept inside one of the compartments of a Bandel-bound local train contained a bomb. The train was then on platform number 2.        
	By the time the bomb squad arrived, all passengers were off the train. A half-an-hour search of all the compartments yielded nothing.         
	Passengers had started running when word spread that there was a bomb somewhere. There could have been a stampede. Normality returned after an announcement on the public address system confirmed that it was a hoax, a police official said.         
	The train was delayed by 20 minutes.

                      Poetry in print                    The growth and development of pictorial photography as an independent genre have been possible due to the conviction of a group of committed photographers who have worked hard to popularise this medium as an art form in the city. The name of Atanu Paul and his institute, Third Eye, is synonymous with pictorial photography, and the institute has been instrumental in imparting technical education to many photography enthusiasts and has been organising annual salons to display their works. However, a dearth of space has always been a major constraint for furthering the scope of this genre. Sreeparna Mazumdar, an accomplished pictorial photographer and Pauls ex-student, had, along with her mentor, felt the acute urge to do something in this sphere. Her enthusiasm and tireless work finally paid off and Calcutta gets its first permanent gallery for photographers, aptly named, Photographers Gallery. The inaugural exhibition of photographs by Paul (a photograph taken by him appears here) and members of Third Eye is currently being held at the gallery.                    Event: A bouquet of photographs by Atanu Paul and members of Third Eye When: Till August 12; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Photographers Gallery, 59A, Southend Park, Calcutta 700 029, 65406499, 98303 31556

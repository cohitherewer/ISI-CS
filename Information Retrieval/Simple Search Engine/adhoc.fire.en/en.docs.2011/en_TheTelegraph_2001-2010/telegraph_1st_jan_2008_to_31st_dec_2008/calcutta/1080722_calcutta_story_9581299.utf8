                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rs 21 teacher to get Rs13500
  - Pranab Sengupta will believe it only when he gets cheque          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Pranab Kumar Sengupta                                        
	Schoolteacher Pranab Kumar Senguptas first pay hike in 35 years is 600 times his monthly income till last month.        
	Stuck on his starting pay of Rs 21.75 since March 21, 1973, Sengupta still doesnt believe that his 15-year legal battle for justice has resulted in the primary school education department fixing his gross monthly pay at about Rs 13,500.        
	I cannot believe that victory is mine at last. Let me have the cheque in my hand first, he told Metro after receiving a copy of the order on Monday.        
	Apart from a basic salary of Rs 5,950 plus other allowances, Sengupta will receive an ad hoc payment of Rs 3 lakh, to be adjusted later with his arrears from 1973 onwards. He had joined Patipukur Basak Bagan Primary School as a temporary assistant teacher and remained an unconfirmed employee even after the institution became a government-aided one in 1978. Tired of the red tape that delayed his confirmation, he moved the high court in 1993.         
	The first sign of hope came two years later, when Justice Paritosh Mukherjee ordered the primary education department to regularise Senguptas service with effect from 1973. But instead of carrying out the order, the department challenged it.         
	Justice K.J. Sengupta issued a fresh order to the chairman of the North 24-Parganas District Primary School Council in January 2006, asking him to fix Senguptas monthly pay on a par with confirmed teachers and give him arrears from the date of joining.         
	The council promptly filed a petition challenging the order, but Justice Asim Banerjee and Justice Tapas Giri dismissed it on June 19.         
	The sub-inspector of schools for South Dum Dum wrote to the council chairman on July 14, saying Senguptas name should be included in the monthly salary bill for regular teachers on an urgent basis.        
	Senguptas counsel Saibalendu Bhawmik, who charged no fee, said: I am happy. Now I will seek interest on the arrears.

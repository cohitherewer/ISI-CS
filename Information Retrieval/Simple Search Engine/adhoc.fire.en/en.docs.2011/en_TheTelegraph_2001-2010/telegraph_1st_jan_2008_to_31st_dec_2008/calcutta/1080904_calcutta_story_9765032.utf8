          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University has put on hold its proposal to allow affiliated colleges to conduct a single class test in a year instead of four.        
	The proposal was put on the backburner last Thursday following differences of opinion among the members of the syndicate, the highest decision-making body of the university.        
	While some members argued that the colleges should continue holding four class tests a year and a selection test, others were in favour of only one annual test, which they said was enough for maintaining the academic standard of the institutions.        
	The universitys undergraduate council had recommended that the colleges hold a single internal test a year. The suggestion was placed before the syndicate for approval. But some members felt that the matter should be discussed more extensively with the college heads and teachers before a decision was taken, said pro vice-chancellor (academic) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee.        
	The university, he added, will soon conduct workshops and seminars with the principals and teachers to discuss the issue. The final decision will be taken before Puja on the basis of the views of the participants.        
	An examination reforms committee set up by the university last year had given a series of suggestions for the enhancement of the overall academic standard of the colleges and the courses run by them. One of the proposals was that every college would hold four class tests and a selection test every year.        
	The system was introduced last year but soon after, several colleges, especially those that have a large number of students on the roll, complained that their academic activities were being hampered because of the tests.        
	They appealed to the authorities that the number of class tests be reduced.        
	The issue was referred to the undergraduate council, which suggested last week that only one internal test be held in a year.        
	The syndicate was supposed to take a decision on the matter on Thursday.        
	The 2008-09 session of the BA, B.Sc and B.Com courses started in July. If the university continues with the system of four class tests, we will have to conduct the first test before Puja, said the principal of a south Calcutta college.        
	The university should decide on the matter at the earliest, he added.        
	The examinations reforms committee had also suggested that the marks a student scored in the four class tests and the selection examination be sent to the university so that the functioning of the colleges could be monitored.

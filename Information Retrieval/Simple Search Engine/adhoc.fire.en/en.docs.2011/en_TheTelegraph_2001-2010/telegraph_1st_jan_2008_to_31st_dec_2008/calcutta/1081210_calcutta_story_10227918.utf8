                      Arts and the man                    Based in Chennai, veteran artist Mannikam Senathipathy lives and works in Cholmandalam Artist Village. In his artistic oeuvre, he reveals a cultural rootedness that remains at the heart of his works. Situating himself in the thick of tradition, he uses it as a trope to investigate social reality, interfacing it with myths to project dimensions conditioning human relationships and varied emotions like love, anxiety, alienation and insecurity. Yet, his works demonstrate his determination to be innovative; to develop a style that would be essentially Indian with marginalised modern stylistic influences. Two modernists to whom the artist acknowledges debts are Paul Klee and Pablo Picasso; the former for his enchanting, flexible and playful lines and the latter for his powerful distortion of the human form premised on primitive tribal masks. The ongoing solo exhibition of Senathipathys works finds the artist appropriating his early pedagogic influences to reveal an individual style that blends tradition and experience in a synchronous frame. His visual language weaves line, colour and texture to create a magical reality within which he foregrounds his social messages, myths and epic stories. He takes the viewer on an epic journey, narrating tales that are charming yet relevant to the present. Arbitrating human imagery to express his concepts, his paintings are essentially a pictorial critique of the times we live in.

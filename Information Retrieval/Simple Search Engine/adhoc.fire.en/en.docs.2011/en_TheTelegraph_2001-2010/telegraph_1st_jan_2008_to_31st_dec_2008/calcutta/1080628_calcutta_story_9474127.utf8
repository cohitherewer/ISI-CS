          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police arrested three persons on Friday on suspicion of their involvement in the disappearance of a Howrah electrical goods trader over a week ago.        
	A resident of Santinagar, under Nazirgunge police station, 37-year-old Tapas Dinda went missing on June 19. Superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said Dindas family named the arrested persons  Subhendu Mullick, Somnath Das and Pinki Sarkar  as his kidnappers.         
	The trio were produced in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Howrah, and remanded in police custody for five days.        
	Tapas had gone to Burrabazar on the day he went missing with Rs 1.5 lakh in a bag and four cellphones. He was to return home in the afternoon. When he did not return even after 8pm, his wife Shipra called him to enquire when he would be home. A woman received the call, disconnected it on hearing Shipras voice and switched off the phone, the family told the police.

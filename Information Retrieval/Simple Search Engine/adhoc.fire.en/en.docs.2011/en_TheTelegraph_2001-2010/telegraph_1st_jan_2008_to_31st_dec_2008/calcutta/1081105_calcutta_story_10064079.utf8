	Rajesh Kumar Gupta, a 28-year-old trader from Jinjira Bazar in Mahestala, was beaten by goons on Monday evening for refusing to pay Rs 5,000 as Kali puja subscription. He received 27 stitches on his head.        
	Rajesh was alone in the shop when four youths asked him to pay Rs 5,000 as Kali puja subscription. When he offered Rs 200, the youths punched him and hit him with a bamboo stick. They forcibly took away his cellphone and Rs 2,000, said Rajeshs uncle Mohan Prasad.        
	No one has been arrested.

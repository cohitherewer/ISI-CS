  - Hostels for first amp; second year students to reopen on Nov 17          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Students of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) cannot keep hockey sticks and cricket bats in hostels or loiter on the banks of the Hooghly. If they do, they might be expelled from the campus.        
	The Besu authorities are banking on a revised code of conduct for the students and a set of dos and donts for the teachers to restore peace on the violence-scarred campus.         
	Academic activities at the Shibpur institute are likely to resume next week, with the authorities deciding to reopen the hostels for the boys of first and second years on November 17. Classes for these students will resume the next day.         
	Classes for the students of third and fourth years will remain suspended till further notice.        
	The universitys board of management on Thursday approved the new code for the students and gave its nod to the decision to frame one for the teachers.         
	The authorities had shut down the institute for an indefinite period last Thursday following a series of clashes between two groups of students.         
	Our main objective is to restore peace on campus. So, we will not allow hockey sticks and cricket bats in hostels, said vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea. Sticks and bats are often wielded by warring students in campus clashes.        
	Before the hostels are reopened, we will inspect them along with parents of the students, Banerjea added.        
	The revised code also imposes a ban on swimming in the ponds on the campus or in the Hooghly, loitering on the river bank and playing truant. Hostel roofs have been made out of bounds for the boarders.        
	The new code also incorporates the features of the earlier one, which had prohibited ragging, possession of firearms, consumption of alcohol and drugs and wilful damage to university property.        
	Any violation of the code may result in expulsion from the campus.         
	Reacting to the authorities decision, a third-year student said: We are yet to go through the code of conduct. But if it curbs our freedom, we will oppose it tooth and nail.         
	The vice-chancellor said a panel had been formed to prepare the teachers code, which would be modelled on the codes followed by the IITs. The teachers code will be announced soon, said Banerjea.         
	The teachers, however, are opposing the move. This is an attempt by the authorities to force us to toe the government line, said a teacher, who blamed the recent violence on such high-handed measures.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       93-yr-old to regain plot
  - Acquisition for shopping complex not in public interest          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	The state will have to return a seven-cottah plot to its owner, a 93-year-old woman, after failing to convince the high court that the acquisition was for public good.        
	The division bench of Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay and Justice Tapan Mukherjee on Tuesday ordered the government to return the Dhakuria plot to Mahamaya Roy Chowdhury within a month and pay a fine of Rs 5,100 for harassing her.        
	Following a submission by the state that the CMDA would build a shopping complex on the plot, the bench observed: The land acquisition process was not proper. The government has failed to prove that the takeover of the plot was in public interest.        
	Mahamaya Roy Chowdhury lives with her daughter in a rented house on Nakuleswar Bhattacharya Road in Kalighat. Of her two sons, one is settled in the US and the other lives in Behala.        
	Roy Chowdhury had opposed the acquisition in the high court stating that she had no house in the city.        
	The government had requisitioned the plot, next to Dakshinapan Shopping Complex, in the mid-eighties and acquired it on August 8, 1996, citing public purpose.        
	Roy Chowdhury refused to accept the compensation and moved a petition before Justice S. Sinha of the high court, demanding cancellation of the government notification.        
	She had stated in her petition that building a commercial complex could not be considered serving public purpose, said Arun Maity, her lawyer.        
	Justice Sinha had on November 28, 1998, termed the acquisition illegal and ordered the state to return the plot to its owner.        
	The government moved a division bench in 1999 against the order but the appeal was rejected the next year. The state did not implement the order. My client, too, did not immediately move any contempt petition, explained Maity.        
	In 2007, Roy Chowdhury tried to file a contempt plea but the court did not accept it because of the delay. My client then moved a fresh petition, based on which Justice Dipankar Dutta issued an order on January 9, asking the government to hand over the plot to her, said Maity.        
	The state appealed against the order before the division bench of Justice Chattopadhyay and Justice Mukherjee. The bench dismissed the petition on Tuesday.        
	I am happy with the verdict, Maity quoted Roy Chowdhury as saying. But will the government return the plot to me in my lifetime? she asked her lawyer.

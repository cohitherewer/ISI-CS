                The Todi brothers and their relative Anil Saraogi cannot be arrested in the Rizwanur Rahman death case till their appeal is heard by a Supreme Court bench on November 25, their lawyer said on Wednesday. On November 10, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court had verbally asked the CBI not to arrest Ashok Todi, Pradip Todi and Anil Saraogi till November 17. Despite the CBIs opposition, the court did not change its stand on Monday (November 17), said D.N. Mitra, counsel for the trio.

            Devi Prasads picture of a Ramkinkar sculpture
             
	A popular columnist has recently expressed his reservations about the works of Ramkinkar Baij. For naysayers such as him, the splendid exhibition of the photographs of the sculpture of Ramkinkar by his student, the pioneering studio potter, Devi Prasad, will be an eyeopener. Exhibited at Anant Art Gallery in Alipore, these are wonderful black-and-white photographs of the masters works taken at different times of the day in available light, be it night or day. These photographs reveal how Ramkinkar drew inspiration not only from his European predecessors but also from our great classical traditions. 
    
	The famine victim with his ribs exposed clearly owes its existence to the Gandharan sculptures of the emaciated Buddha doing penance. The famous Yakshas at the entrance of the Reserve Bank of India building in Delhi were inspired by Maurya sculpture. The rhythm and dynamism of pieces such as Mill Call displayed in public places in Santiniketan have a continued appeal. The beauty with which Ramkinkar infused his sculpture had little to do with lyricism or grace, virtues that are easily admired. It was the terrific beauty of brutal honesty and that was quite evident in his portraits, be it the distorted visage of the starving beggar, or the face of Rabindranath with its eyes popping out like marbles. This tribute by his former student makes clear why he had become a legend in his lifetime. The factsheets and timelines too have been thoughtfully displayed.
    
	Mystery and drollery
         
	Those who like graphics are bound to fall in love with Lalu Prasad Shaws classics in black and white with their hieroglyphic flourishes, their complex mesh and juxtapositions of non-figurative geometric forms, and dramatic use of black that throws open spaces that could stimulate ones imagination. This huge exhibition is Gallery Sanskritis tribute to the artist who has turned 70, and features some pastel and pencil drawings and watercolours dating back to the 1950s.
    
	Shaw had made a name for himself by his depictions of typical Bengali babus and their beautiful consorts. But he always gave a twist to these images by adding a hint of mystery and drollery that carried them beyond cliches. Most of these works were executed recently, and they represent familiar images of a toppled vase, a line of portraits of men with beards and moustaches, contemplative beauties, sometimes decapitated, a brilliant yellow clump of radhachura blossoms and gentle human beings with pet dogs. In all these images, embellishments and colours are kept to the minimum that brings to the fore the strong graphic quality in Shaws work.

	To commemorate the occasion, the gallery has brought out two lavishly-illustrated  one exclusively on his graphics  publications with text by Sovon Som. The printing quality of these two heavy books is of a high order, but the graphics suffer a little as the lines are not very sharp. It is true that these prints were taken out quite some time ago. But a little more care could have been taken.
     
	One-woman shows
 
	Personal accounts through solo performances is the focus of Ekal Yatra Natyotsava, to be hosted by Rangakarmee and Sangeet Natak Akademi from New Delhi, from January 13 to 15. With the theatre bash, the Calcutta-based Rangakarmee led by Usha Ganguli will celebrate its 32nd birthday.
    
	The festival of one-woman presentations will include proscenium (Academy of Fine Arts and Rabindra Sadan) and outdoor (Rabindra Sadan lawn) performances. In focus will be traditional and contemporary styles, from all over the country. Ten performers will narrate biographies and creative experiences, and also interpret myths through experimental dramatic forms as well as Bhawaiyya, Chhau, Nautanki, Bhath Hari Gayen and other traditions.
    
	Its time to celebrate the fact that a lot more women are writing and performing their own plays today, said actor-director Ganguli, whose troupe currently has 450 members. The inaugural play will be A Process by Manipuri stage veteran H. Sabitri. Kalairani of Chennai will present Song of Lowino, followed by Saoli Mitras Katha Amrita Samaan. Marathi playwright Sushama Deshpande from Pune will present Tichya Aaichi Goshta Arthat Mazya Athavanicha Fad (Her Mothers Story that is My Memory) with Tamasha artistes. Nita Mohindra from Punjab will stage Buhe Barian. Surajbai Khande, the only known exponent of this Chhattisgarhi folk form, will perform Bhath Hari Gayen.

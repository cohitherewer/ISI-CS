The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Terror of tremors
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Terror of tremors

	Over 10,000 families living along Congress Exhibition Road, VIP Bazaar, Picnic Garden Road, Sridhar Roy Road and Tiljala Road feel scared in their own homes. Their houses tremble each time a vehicle passes by. Some of the buildings have already developed cracks. The trembling at times is so severe that they wake up in the middle of the night in panic.        
	The tremors are so intense that I often have to stop surgeries, said eye surgeon A.T.M. Shanawaz Hossain, who runs a nursing home at 3B Congress Exhibition Road.        
	One can feel the tremors while sitting on a sofa or lying on a bed or while in the bathroom and my relatives dont want to spend a night in my building, he added.        
	Shanawazs ground floor balcony and ceiling of the third floor are developing cracks even after repairs. He lives in constant fear that the entire building might collapse some day. In fact, the residents of the building are so used to the tremors that they feel they will not make out if an earthquake strikes.        
	People living on Congress Exhibition Road say that the tremors are more pronounced when heavy vehicles like 10-wheeler lorries, road rollers, huge containers or large concrete-mixing machine-mounted trucks pass by. The problem lies in the fact that the load-bearing capacity of these internal roads has not been augmented following the commissioning of the Bondel Gate flyover.         
	No one from the administration held out any hope for these beleaguered residents. While the motor vehicles department shrugged it off saying roads are meant for vehicles to ply, the traffic police were equally nonchalant. The Pollution Control Board (PCB) said the movement of vehicles cannot be banned  but experts insisted that the matter needs to be looked into.                     
	Governmentspeak        
	Roads are meant for vehicles to ply. Only a court order or public agitation can stop movement of vehicles on these roads, said chief additional secretary (transport) Sumantra Choudhury. Under the Motor Vehicles Act, vehicular movement on a road or a bridge can be suspended or banned only if it is damaged or the road is unsafe.         
	Policespeak        
	There is no act which bans the movement of vehicles on the basis of residents complaints, said DC (traffic) Dilip Banerjee.        
	CMCspeak        
	It is true vibrations caused by heavy vehicles may cause cracks in old buildings but the extent of damage will depend on the structural condition of that building, said the director-general (building) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), Gorachand Mondol.        
	Expertspeak        
	Somnath Ghosh, the head of the department of civil engineering of Jadavpur University, said: This kind of vibration should be measured on a vibration meter. If the amplitude of the vibration is abnormally high and above the permissible limit then there is the possibility of damage to roadside buildings. But buildings beside a rail track also experience similar tremors.         
	PCBspeak         
	PCB is a statutory body and it cannot impose a ban on vehicles following complaints of noise pollution, said an official.

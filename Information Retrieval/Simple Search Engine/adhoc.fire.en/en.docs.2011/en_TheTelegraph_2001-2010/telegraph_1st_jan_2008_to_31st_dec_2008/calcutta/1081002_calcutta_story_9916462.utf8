          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A London-based NRI in his early-60s fell ill aboard a flight to Calcutta on Wednesday and had to get off in Delhi, where he died in a hospital hours later.         
	Dulal Chakraborty, who was suffering from cardiac ailments, showed a medical certificate at the London airport to take the flight along with his wife Chitrita.        
	He complained that he was not feeling well and was examined by in-flight medical staff, said an official at the city airport.         
	The flight was diverted to Delhi when the medical staff could not stabilise Chakrabortys condition. After the plane made a priority landing in Delhi, he was treated by airport doctors before being shifted to hospital. Chakraborty died a few hours later.         
	The Air India flight reached the city about three hours late.

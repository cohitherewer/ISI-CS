The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | IPL over, game starts for trio of knights
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IPL over, game starts for trio of knights
  - T20 league opens up a world of cricket, mass adulation and mega bucks          SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY                                          
	The inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL) has made big boys out of three small-town knights.         
	For Wriddhiman Saha and Debabrata Das of Siliguri and Ashoke Dinda of Naichanpur, West Midnapore, cricket no longer begins and ends with the Ranji Trophy. While Saha and Dinda have made it to the India A team that will fly to Israel in July, Das, too, is ready to move to the next level.        
	The change has been great for us youngsters. IPL has opened up avenues, smiles the hard-hitting batsman.        
	The change is evident in appearance, too. Das now sports a spiked haircut and walks with a swagger. He has also acquired rimless glasses since the tournament started. Dinda, in black shirt and blue jeans, has his hair gelled like team-owner Shah Rukh Khan.         
	All three are tightlipped about the IPL millions. According to one estimate, they have earned Rs 20-30 lakh this season  quite a hike from the Rs 36,000 daily they got last year for the short Ranji season  but so far Das has only planned to replace his broken iPod with a new one. Dinda, who lives in a Sealdah mess with Saha, wont say if he is planning to get his own pad. I havent even got the money yet. I will decide what to do after receiving the money, adds Das.        
	Public adulation, on the other hand, has already come the trios way. Das, who travels by public transport, says it feels good when people recognise you on the street. Perhaps tired of taking too many calls, Saha did not answer Metros call on his cellphone for the past five days, even in the evening, when he was not busy playing the AN Ghosh tournament matches for his club.         
	The wicketkeeper may have been busy watching the last leg of IPL. Das says they followed the matches on TV since being knocked out of the tournament.         
	Dinda is upbeat about the Knight Riders chances in 2009. It hurts that we did not make it to the top four. We made some mistakes, but thats cricket. We will surely win the next IPL, he says.         
	The IPL journey has left the young knights with some lasting memories. Now that the tournament is over, I am missing Shoaib Akhtar and Chris Gayles antics in the dressing room, says Dinda. Das misses his friend Hus (David Hussey) the most.

  - Biswas hospitalised after chest pain in court          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    Swarup Biswas (left) in   court on Monday    
	A day of drama at the Alipore criminal court saw Swarup Biswas, brother of Trinamul Congress MLA Arup Biswas and the alleged leader of a mob that attacked cops, being denied bail on Monday.        
	Swarup complained of pain in his chest and abdomen soon after the judge remanded him in police custody till October 15 in the afternoon. He was shifted to Medical College and Hospital.         
	Nearly 100 Trinamul supporters sat inside the courtroom till 9.45pm demanding that Swarup be given bail on health grounds. Around 9.30pm, Trinamul activists submitted a copy of the leaders hospital admission certificate to the magistrate, who was still present in court.         
	Hospital sources said Swarup was admitted to the medicine ward with complaints of chest pain. His condition is stable. He will undergo some clinical tests tonight, said a doctor.        
	Swarup allegedly led the mob that attacked Charu Market police station and torched five vehicles after a private bus overturned near Rabindra Sarobar Metro station on the night of October 5. More than a dozen policemen were injured in the incident. Swarup was arrested near Kona Expressway last Wednesday.         
	About 150 Trinamul supporters were present on the court premises when the leader was brought to the premises in a van from Charu Market police station around 1.20pm.         
	The hearing started around 1.30pm. Swarups counsel Ashok Mukherjee moved the bail petition, which was opposed by public prosecutor Satayabrata Chowdhury.         
	At 2.30pm Swarup said he was not feeling well and requested us to admit him to a hospital. We provided him with water and a table fan. He started complaining of chest pain after being remanded in custody, said an officer of Alipore police station.         
	There was tension in the court throughout the afternoon with Trianmul supporters shouting slogans against policemen and demanding Swarups immediate release. A large police contingent was deployed to avert untoward incidents.         
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee gave Swarup a clean chit at a rally on Sunday.

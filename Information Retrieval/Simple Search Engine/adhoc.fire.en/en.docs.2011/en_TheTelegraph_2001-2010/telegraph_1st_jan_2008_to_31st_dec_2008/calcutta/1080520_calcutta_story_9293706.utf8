          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The chief judicial magistrate of Alipore court on Monday directed police to ensure the presence of a Delhi-based official of a nationalised bank within 15 days in a debt recovery case.        
	Ajay Bharti, an executive of SBI Cards and Payment Payments Services Private Limited, had ignored a summons issued by the court in September 2007.        
	The summons followed a petition by Jayeeta Basu, who had alleged that Bharti and two others  Shantanu Bhattacharya and Suresh Chatterjee  had made threatening calls to her father, Manotosh, demanding credit card dues that had already been paid.        
	While Chatterjee and Bhattacharya have obeyed the summons, Bharti hasnt, said Tamal Mukherjee, who appeared for Basu.        
	The Supreme Court had ruled that banks had no right to engage musclemen to recover dues.        
	The Basus lodged complaints with Tiljala police station, stating that the bank had violated the apex court order by sending goons to their Hussainpur house, on the southern city fringes.        
	Basus petition stated that Abhijit Pal and Bikash Das, who had been threatening the family members to cough up the dues, and a few other men had tried to damage furniture in the house.         
	They fled after Jayeeta shouted out at them, Mukherjee said.

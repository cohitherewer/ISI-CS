The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tree trim for football
                                                                                                            Tree trim for football
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Morning-walkers on Tuesday prevented civic workers from trimming two trees on the Park Circus Maidan to set up floodlights for the Mayors Cup football tournament.        
	According to 57-year-old Dipak Dasgupta, a regular at the park, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) workers arrived on the grounds shortly after 8pm.         
	We saw local councillor Farzana Choudhury instructing the labourers pointing at a krishnachura and a banyan tree. Some time later, the workers stated cutting off their branches. Three large branches were axed before we stopped the men, said Dasgupta, who was joined by 25 other morning-walkers.        
	Faced with resistance from local residents, the civic workers went away without completing their task.         
	Choudhury said she knew about the civic bodys decision to trim the trees but denied that she was present on the grounds. The trimming was necessary to set up temporary floodlights for the football matches. I was not at Park Circus Maidan when the trees were being trimmed.        
	This will be the first time that the annual football tournament, scheduled from January 10, will see day-and-night matches, necessitating the setting up of the towers.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya asserted that rules were not broken. The trimming was done according to the rules of the CMC and in the presence of horticulturists, he said.        
	The trees are at least 30 ft high and have been there since my childhood, stated Dasgupta.        
	A gardener at the CMCs nursery at Park Circus Maidan said the banyan tree is the oldest on the grounds, while the other tree is at least 50 years old.        
	There is no logic behind the branches of such old trees being cut off for holding football matches. Besides, it is absurd to organise night matches when there is such a power crisis, said environment activist Subhas Dutta.

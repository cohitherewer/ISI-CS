	A gate under construction at Jadavpur University collapsed on Tuesday afternoon, killing two workers and injuring as many. All four, who were casting gate No. 4 near the arts faculty, were trapped under the debris.        
	Three of them were taken to KPC Medical College and Hospital in Jadavpur, where Nirmal Gayen, 38, and Mintu Naskar, 30, were declared dead on arrival. Gayen remained trapped for more than two-and-a-half hours.        
	Madhusudan Jana, 35, is being treated for multiple injuries and respiratory distress in the intensive care unit of the hospital. Bholanath Sarkar, 28, who suffered relatively minor injuries, was treated at the health centre of the university.        
	Students  only a handful of them were on campus  said they were saved as classes have been suspended for the semester exams scheduled to be held in December.        
	The death toll and the number of injured could have been higher had the classes not been suspended, said Somsukla Biswas, a second-year student of economics.        
	We hang around very close to the gate. I am yet to recover from the shock of seeing the workers being extricated from the debris. We could as well have been among the victims.        
	The students alleged that the material used in the newly-built gate No. 3 was substandard.         
	The gate could collapse any day. The authorities should inspect it, said Avisek Chakraborty, a final-year student of civil engineering.        
	The university announced that it would bear the medical expenses of the injured and pay compensation to the families of the deceased.        
	A three-member committee has been formed to probe the mishap. The panel comprises Shailapati Gupta, a former chairman of HRBC, a professor of civil engineering and a civic engineer, said pro vice-chancellor Sidhartha Dutta. The committee will submit its report within 10 days.        
	Gate No. 4, which was being built since September, collapsed around 12.30am. Two fire tenders, two cranes and five pay loaders had to be brought in to remove the debris and rescue the workers.        
	Sarkar, who was the first to be dug out, recalled: I was sitting on a pillar when the entire structure came crashing down. Lying trapped under the wreckage, I could hear someone cry underneath me. But I was not in a position to move. Sarkar was administered stitches on the back of his head.        
	The authorities have lodged a complaint with Jadavpur police station. We have started a case against the contractor, said Sunil Kumar Chaudhury, the additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

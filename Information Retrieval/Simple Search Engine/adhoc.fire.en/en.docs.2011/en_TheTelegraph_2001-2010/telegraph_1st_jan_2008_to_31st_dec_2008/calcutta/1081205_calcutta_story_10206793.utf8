          Todays question: Do you think the transport minister is serious in his threat to get autorickshaws to convert to LPG by December?                      Sea of yellow: Autorickshaws jostle for space on a city street

	The transport minister is serious about all autos converting to LPG by December because of environment pollution. The owners of autorickshaws need to take the matter seriously. Political parties need to support the decision taken by the government. Auto manufacturers should not keep the option of using oil in the new models.              
	

P.B. SAHA,
  Salt Lake        
	The process of autorickshaws converting to LPG is long overdue.The failure of the pollution control board and the transport department to reform the autorickshaw drivers is regrettable. The transport minister is reported to have reiterated his decision to ensure that all auto-drivers change to LPG by December-end. Simply issuing threats will hardly help unless those in charge of carrying out auto emission tests execute their responsibilities properly. The maverick transport minister is known for backtracking on his promises. Hopefully, he would keep his promise this time.

	The transport minister like some of his colleagues is not interested in public welfare but most concerned about the partys welfare. Nobody knows it better than the minister himself. Depending on the autorickshaw drivers good sense, if any, is not a good idea.                  Ballygunge Station Road        
	Autorickshaws are the worst nuisance on the road. They flout traffic rules and are a perennial source of air pollution. Their ways can be traced from the time Subhas Chakraborty became a minister. Pleadings of citizens have always fallen on his deaf ears. Auto-operators irrespective of the party they support enjoy his patronage. This time it will be no different.              
	

Naren Sen, 
  Howrah        
	It is a bold step on the part of Subhas Chakraborty to push autos to convert to LPG by December. He will be lauded if his efforts materialise.             
	Debasish Chakraborty,
  Cossipore   
	Yes, I think the transport minister is serious in his threat to get autorickshaws to convert to LPG by December. He is obstinate and desperate. He does what he says. Nothing is impossible in his lexicon.           
	

Satyen Biswas, 
  Behala         
	It is not as easy as the transport minister thinks. The minister should remember the old proverb Easier said than done. It will take a lot of time.               
	

Amaresh Paul, 
  Balagarh        
	I think, the conversion will happen within the stipulated date. LPG costs Rs 25 per litre compared to petrol at Rs 52 per litre and diesel costing Rs 32 per litre, used in other vehicles like taxis, buses, lorries etc.               
	

B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park        
	I feel the transport minister is serious in his claim of getting autorickshaws to convert to LPG by December. Only then can air pollution be reduced.We will be happy if the transport minister is successful.               
	

Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
  Behala         
	A large number of autorickshaws ply on the roads without valid documents. When after so many years the autorickshaws could not be brought to book it is difficult to believe that they will convert to LPG by December. If public interest gets more importance than party interest, and the transport department and the police exercise their power sincerely to make autorickshaws run on LPG by the year-end then everything is possible.              
	

Sushanta Bhowmik, 
  Nimta        
	Whatever the transport minister said was simply to save his ministry, because he is very much aware that the task can never be completed fully.               
	

Sourish MisHRa, 
  Salt Lake         
	The smoke from autorickshaws creates a lot of pollution. The use of katatel should be stopped immediately for the sake of the environment. The government hopefully will not extend the deadline and will be able to compel the the drivers and their owners to convert to LPG. Strong action should be taken if they fail this time.               
	

Rathin Chatterjee,
  Dum Dum        
	The step taken is an important one. But I doubt if Subhas Chakrabortys threat will be taken seriously by the autorickshaw drivers. They will use diesel rather than LPG because it is cheaper.               
	

Pradip Ranjan Das, 
  Tegharia        
	The transport minister is affectionate towards autorickshaw drivers. So, there is no question of threatening them. It is a sincere attempt to dodge the accusation of violation of the court order. His indulgence and empathy have made auto drivers obstinate. But being a minister he has the constitutional power to impose order.              
	

Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Nadia        
	Given the way the pollution level in the city is rising, the minister has to be serious in his threat to get autorickshaws to convert to LPG by December. But I am not sure how keen the autorickshaw drivers would be to implement the move.              
	

AniL Chatterjee, 
  Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane        
	The transport minister is trying to make a fool of us.  
	S.M. GHOSH  
	Vehicular emission expert          
	The state transport department always wakes up whenever any pollution control deadline comes within sniffing distance, and inevitably fails to stick to it (may be by design) and I do not expect any difference this time. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty might have announced the ban on plying of autorickshaws by December-end and other commercial vehicles by March 2009 as per the high court directive, but I hardly see this happening. The minister is no magician and it is impossible to arrange such mass scale switchover of old vehicles within such a short period or make alternative arrangements without creating chaos. There are hardly any serious preparations from the government rsquo;s end yet. So once the deadline comes close the government will try to delay the process by forming another committee and requesting the court for time. The socio-economic conditions of the owners and drivers involved will be highlighted. Who cares if people of the city continue to choke from toxic vehicle fumes?

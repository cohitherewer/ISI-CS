                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Probe into drunk attack on couple
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A probe has been ordered into the harassment, abuse and assault of Rahmat Ali and wife Amina Bibi by three drunk youths at Bagmari burial ground late on Sunday.        
	I have asked divisional deputy commissioner Partha Sarathi Ghosh to carry out a detailed inquiry. Action will be taken accordingly, joint commissioner (administration) P.K Chatterjee told Metro on Wednesday.        
	When told that the cops had allegedly asked Rahmat to settle the issue mutually and that the couple were threatened at Maniktala police station by a 20-odd gang not to lodge an FIR, he said: I have asked the deputy commissioner to speak to the couple and take action if they are willing to lodge an FIR against the three men.        
	Chatterjee said the three had been taken to the police station immediately after the incident. Later, some youths from Rajabazar had turned up there.        
	The trio intercepted the couple inside the burial ground and there was an altercation between them. I have asked the deputy commissioner to find out what had happened inside the police station and also about the antecedents of the three men, he added.        
	Metro had on Tuesday reported that the couple were harassed, abused and assaulted by three drunk youths while they were on their way to meet Rahmats parents, who live in the burial ground staff quarters.        
	One of the youths slapped Rahmat. When his wife protested and threatened to lodge a complaint, another youth tried to drag her away by her hand.        
	On Tuesday, too, a gang had threatened the couple with dire consequences if they dared to lodge an FIR.        
	The authorities of the burial ground held a meeting on Wednesday evening, which was attended by the couple, Rahmats parents, the three accused and some of their friends and an officer of Maniktala police station.        
	I wanted to know what had happened inside the burial ground that night and why the police did not take action when the couple tried to lodge a complaint, said M. Hossian, the sub-registrar of the burial ground.        
	We will try to resolve the issue mutually as the three men had apologised to Rahmat and his wife, he added.        
	Local residents accused the police and the burial ground authorities of not acting against criminals who frequent the cemetery at night.

                A member of Akhanda Mandali hanged himself at Gurudham, the sects headquarters in Phoolbagan, on Thursday. Ganesh Ghosh, 34, was found in a bathroom with a rope around his neck. The water pipe was found broken. A suicide note found in his room did not blame anyone for his death. The resident of West Midnapore, who used to take care of 200 dogs in the ashram, was under treatment for depression, police said. In April, an expelled disciple had barged into the Phoolbagan ashram and killed Mamoni, the head of the sect, and an aide before being lynched by ashram members.    The body of Besu student Subhajit Saha, 19, who drowned at BE Garden Ghat on Wednesday, surfaced on Thursday evening. The body has been sent for post-mortem. Police are questioning Sahas friends who were present when he fell into the river.     Air India is planning to start daily morning flights between Calcutta and Hyderabad by October-end. The schedule of the flights will be drawn up soon, said an airline official.    A complaint was lodged with West Port police station on Thursday after a container carrying paper used to make currency notes was found tampered with. Port officials found the lock of the container broken in the Garden Reach shipyard. A probe is on to find out whether the lock was tampered with in transit.    Samiran Das, 42, died on Thursday after being admitted to Panihati State General Hospital with gastro-enteritis. An investigation will be conducted to find out whether the water supplied to Dass locality in Sukantapally was contaminated, said Charan Chakrabarty, the chairman of Panihati Municipality.    Two persons were arrested and pirated CDs and DVDs worth Rs 38,000 seized from Rashbehari Avenue and Hazra on Wednesday.

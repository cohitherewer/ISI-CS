                                                                                                               After snub, prod to act
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Manju Das points to the lid of the trunk whose latch was removed to steal Rs 70,000 she kept in it. A Telegraph picture                                  
	An inquiry was ordered on Sunday morning into the theft of Rs 70,000 from Manju Dass shanty on Raja Basanta Roy Road.         
	Officers who had kept Manju waiting for seven hours when she went to Lake police station on Thursday to lodge an FIR have been asked to find the culprits on a priority basis.        
	The policemen had made only a general diary entry of the incident, refusing to believe that a daily wage-earners wife could have so much cash at home. A general diary does not require the police to start an investigation.        
	The Telegraph had reported on Sunday how the officers had ignored the chief ministers instruction to promptly respond to complaints by the poor.        
	Deputy commissioner (south division) Rajesh Subarna made a surprise visit to the police station around 8am. He called Manju there and heard her out for almost an hour.        
	The 51-year-old woman is satisfied with the turn of events. Senior police officers listened carefully to my complaint and assured me that they would do their best to arrest the culprits and recover the money, said Manju.        
	Subarna also met the officers who were in the police station when Manju went there to lodge a complaint. He later spoke to officer-in-charge Debasish Baidya.        
	The officers have been told to act immediately. Local goons might have stolen the money. We are checking up on the suspects mentioned by the complainant, stated Subarna.         
	According to sources, an internal inquiry will be conducted by Subarna to find out why Manju had to wait to register a complaint.

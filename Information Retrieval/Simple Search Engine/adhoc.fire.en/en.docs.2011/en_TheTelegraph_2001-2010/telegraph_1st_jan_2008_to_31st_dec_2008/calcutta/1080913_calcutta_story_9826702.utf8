	The city that has given Amitabh Bachchan the most love and affection gave him another priceless gift on Friday evening  a box of sandesh from nine-year-old Mita Mondal.         
	Mita, who is suffering from heart problems and needs a valve transplant, is undergoing treatment for which Bachchan is bearing all costs. A part of Rs 2.5 lakh gifted by the superstar has already helped Mita get artificial veins. Mitas father works in a tea shop in South 24-Parganas.        
	I am extremely delighted to see that she is recovering and am overjoyed to see her here, said Bachchan, picking up a smiling Mita who had come all the way from Nila village in South 24-Parganas to meet him at a city hotel on Friday.        
	Diganta, an NGO helping with Mitas treatment, presented a Kali idol and prasad from Kalighat to Bachchan who was in town for the premiere of his first English film The Last Lear, directed by Rituparno Ghosh.         
	Bachchan couldnt stop gushing about his Bong connection, apart from Jaya being from Bengal.        
	Its wonderful to be back here in Calcutta after working in The Last Lear. The passion, affection and love that people here can give to artistes is incredible. I have been to a lot of places which have showered me with love and acclaim but nothing like Bengal. I always tell Abhishek that whenever you are low in spirits or feeling down, go to Calcutta. The people there raise your spirits and give you all the love and appreciation, smiled the 66-year-old actor, who remembered the days when he acted with Utpal Dutt in Saat Hindustani and Do Anjane. The Last Lear is based on Dutts play Aajker Shahjahan.

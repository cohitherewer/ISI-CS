          A STAFF REPORTER                           A member of the Sarogi family after the burglary.   A Telegraph picture                                        
	A women gang, led by a eunuch, has been netted on charges of robbing a New Alipore flat on March 23 night.        
	Police claim to have busted the gang with the arrest of Muskan Begum, 21, alias Hoogla  a eunuch from CR Avenue  and eight other persons.        
	Five of the gang were arrested on April 9, prompting three others to flee to Cuttack, from where they were picked up on Monday. Five of those held are women.         
	The gang had robbed cash and valuables worth around Rs 5 lakh from the rented apartment of Murarilal Saraogi in Block F of New Alipore, said an investigating officer.        
	The Sarogis had reported the loss of 150 gram of gold, 50 silver coins, a digital camera, a gold chain with a diamond locket, four silver bowls, a gold bracelet, a diamond bracelet and Rs 95,000 in cash.        
	The police have recovered Rs 15,000, the digital camera, 19 silver coins, two silver bowls and the gold chain.        
	The sleuths suspect the gang was not inexperienced. Their modus operandi was strange. After identifying the house, a few women would hang around carrying a child while Muskan would break in with the rest. They did the same on March 23, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	Most of the items stolen from Saraogis house were sold to Uttam Ghoshal, a resident of Muktaram Babu Street. Ghosal has been arrested, said an officer of the detective department.        
	All the women are from the Mahatma Gandhi Road and Madan Mohan Burman Street areas. Muskan had brought them together by promising them hefty payment, the officer added.        
	Sarogi had earlier claimed that the landlord had plotted the burglary and even tried to kill him and his family.

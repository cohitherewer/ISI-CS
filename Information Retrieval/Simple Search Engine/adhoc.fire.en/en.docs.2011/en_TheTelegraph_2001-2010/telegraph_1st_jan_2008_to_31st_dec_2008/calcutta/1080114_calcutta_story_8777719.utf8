	Raju Agarwal (name changed) is gutted. He has suffered heavy losses  in cash, rather than kind  in the Burrabazar blaze, with the sole source of livelihood of all those who owed him money being destroyed.
    
	The 35-year-old garment traders one-room address at 74 Jamunalal Bajaj Street was burnt down, but more than that, he has lost the lakhs he had loaned to families and friends with shops and establishments at the blaze site.
    
	I have lost more than Rs 25 lakh. Some people in the market owe me money, but how can I ask for payment when I know they have lost everything? wondered Agarwal.
    
	Business in Burrabazar runs on faith, where kachcha (black) is the name of the money game. The fire burning in the heart of the trade hub since Friday night has not claimed the faith, but it has claimed funds running into crores.
    
	People here depend on the unorganised money market. So, apart from the damage caused to goods, the prime casualty of the blaze will be the cash transactions taking place constantly among traders here, said an associate of Agarwal.
    
	So, even as an army team took stock of the situation on Sunday afternoon, Agarwal and his friends were huddled near the police kiosk at the Jamunalal Bajaj Street-Brabourne Road crossing, deliberating on the cash blow dealt by the blaze.
    
	The intricacies of the money transactions at Burrabazar can stump finance whizkids from the best of B-schools. In 10ftx10ft gaddis (offices), deals running into crores are struck without any written records. Its all an act of faith and defaults are few.
    
	The night of January 11 could change that for some time to come. Around 3,000 traders have suffered severe losses in the fire. So, there are bound to be payment defaults, said a garment trader.
    
	Many shop-owners in the Nandaram Market area are part of the syndicate engaged in informal money transfer  popularly known as hawala.
    
	The service comes for a fee  Rs 100 for each lakh transferred  and with a code of secrecy. All that changes hands is a currency note, used to record the transaction.
    
	The money is handed over to the man who produces the currency note bearing the numbers mentioned while striking the deal, explained a trader. So how much transfer money has gone up in flames? No one will ever know, as even those who have lost money will never admit it, he added.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lorry lane as peril point

	Nothing changed Depot Road. near Taratala, the day after 26-year-old Supratim Das was crushed under a lorry speeding through illegally parked vehicles.        
	Metro visited the two-and-a-half km death stretch on Thursday to find at least 200 lorries, trolleys, Matadors and trailers parked on both sides. Officers of Taratala police station were seen riding by on motorcycles, but none paid attention to the parking mess.        
	There have been a number of accidents on this stretch, but nothing has changed over the years. Vehicles continue to be illegally parked, some local youths make money from the parking racket and police look the other way, said Kamalkant Shau, an employee of Khaitan Electricals on Transport Depot Road.        
	Lorry drivers say they shell out between Rs 30 and Rs 100 to the local youths as parking fee for a day. The drivers revealed that officials of some factories and godowns deal directly with the youths, paying them a monthly amount for parking goods carriers.        
	Cops are also a part of the racket. They allow local toughs to extract money from us and take their cut, said lorry driver Tejindher Singh Pandher.        
	Residents and drivers named a few youths who, they alleged, are running the racket. Metro caught up with some of them, but they denied having collected money for parking.        
	A duty officer of Taratala police station, standing near the youths, echoed what the youths said. We try our best to keep the stretch congestion-free, said D. Nandy, the officer.        
	More than 2,000 lorries enter Transport Depot Road to service the 50-odd factories and godowns located on the stretch.        
	Officers of Taratala police station admitted that accidents occurred frequently, but said it was not their responsibility to clear the road of illegally parked vehicles. Only the traffic department can be held responsible for it, they said.        
	I will look into the matter to see if there is any parking racket in the area and would take necessary action against those found guilty, said Dilip Bandopadhyay, the deputy commissioner of traffic, Calcutta police.

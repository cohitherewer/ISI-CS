                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Summer brings on viral fever outbreak
  - AVOID ANTIBIOTICS, SAY DOCTORS                                                
	The advent of summer in the city has been accompanied by an outbreak of viral infections. Hundreds of patients with high fever, sore throats, diarrhoea and skin rashes are being treated daily in private and state-run hospitals.        
	The current weather condition is ideal for the spread of virus and bacteria, said city-based critical care specialist Subrata Maitra.        
	Those suffering from asthma and bronchitis are more susceptible to viral infection than others, he added.        
	In addition to fever, sore throat and rashes, headache, nausea and vomiting are the most common symptoms of viral infection.        
	More than five per cent of the patients are suffering from chest infection and respiratory distress, said Maitra.        
	Sore throat and nasal congestion are by far the most common problems at SSKM Hospitals ENT outpatients department. Almost half the patients in the department have been showing symptoms of viral infection.        
	Patients usually suffer from severe pain in the throat and fever because of infection in the pharynx. The problems persist for three to four days, said Arunabha Sengupta, the head of the ENT department.        
	According to him, patients should gurgle with lukewarm water and take paracetamol tablets. Antibiotics should be avoided as the infection does not last more than a few days.        
	The infection is not fatal and rarely leads to hospitalisation, said doctors.         
	But children are especially vulnerable. Most of the child patients are suffering from acute diarrhoea with high fever and rashes, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the city-based Institute of Child Health.        
	Almost 20 per cent of the patients in the institutes outpatient department have viral fever and diarrhoea.        
	Strong medicines like antibiotics should be avoided. Children must have plenty of water to stop dehydration, added Ghosh.        
	Doctors warned against walking into and out of air-conditioned rooms. Oily food must be avoided. The diet should ideally consist of plenty of fruits and vegetables.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A 32-year-old man was found dead at a de-addiction centre in Bagha Jatin on Tuesday, while four other inmates were found with severe injuries.        
	The body of Fabian Fleming, a resident of Santoshpur, was discovered at the Womens Co-ordinating Council De-addiction-cum-Rehabilitation Centre by residents. One of the injured has been admitted to MR Bangur Hospital.        
	Fleming, who was addicted to painkillers, was admitted to the centre by his friends last Saturday.         
	On Tuesday morning, some of us were walking past the centre when the inmates shouted for help, said Bibhu Nandi. But the authorities refused to let us in. We then informed the police and entered the centre along with the cops to find a man lying dead.         
	Some of the inmates told the residents that workers at the centre tied, gagged and beat up Fabian when he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms.         
	The youths were fighting among themselves because of severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, four of them were injured, said Swapan Pal, a worker at the centre. The doctor who was called to treat Fabian said he died of a cardiac arrest, he added.         
	Cops, however, are not buying their story.         
	Based on a complaint by Fabians uncle Keith Saviel, Jadavpur police have initiated a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and grievous hurt against some members of the organisation. A hunt has also been launched for four workers of the centre who are absconding.        
	The body has been sent for post-mortem. We will also speak to the inmates, said Ajey Ranade, the South 24-Parganas police superintendent.         
	As word about Fabians death spread, 31 inmates left the centre fearing torture.         
	There seems to be some foul play behind Fabians death, Keith said. The centre called us up to take his body, but didnt give a proper explanation about his death.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Brake for road repair 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Autorickshaw drivers and residents blocked Dum Dum Road for about two hours on Monday morning demanding immediate repair of the stretch near Hanuman Mandir.         
	The blockade, which started at 11.30am, caused severe traffic snarls on the road that connects Nagerbazar to Dum Dum Metro station and Dum Dum Junction.         
	The trench dug by the CMDA for laying electrical lines and sewage pipes near the Bagjola Canal bridge causes traffic snarls every day, said S. Banerjee, a resident.        
	Construction materials have been piled on both sides of the road for over a year, said Prasanta Kundu, the secretary of the Citu-affiliated autorickshaw union.        
	The blockade was lifted after officers from the local police station promised to look into the matter.

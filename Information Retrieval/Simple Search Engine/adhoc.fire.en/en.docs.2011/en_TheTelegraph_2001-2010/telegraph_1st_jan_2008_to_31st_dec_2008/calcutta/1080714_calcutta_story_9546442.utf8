                      Evocative expressions                    An art form requiring both aesthetic sense and technical expertise, photography is a unique medium of creative self-expression. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation For the Arts and Tasveer, the ongoing exhibitions of photographs present works by three artists from three different geographical and social milieu. Besides providing a veritable visual delight to viewers, they offer interesting, profound and often, poignant slices of contemporary life and time. The photographs of Paris-based Martine Franck (on view at 46 Satish Mukherjee Road) include humanitarian reportage and portraits of artists and writers. A British fine art photographer based in London, Tim Hall specialises in portraits, landscapes and seascapes. His works on the indigenous inhabitants of Southeast Asia and the series on the life of the people of the ancient city of Varanasi deserve special mention. The photographs by Swapan Nayak document the grim battle for survival of the people living on the banks of the turbulent Brahmaputra and the violence-stricken Northeast.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Price rise prunes puja
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Price rise prunes puja

	An unprecedented price rise is forcing many middle-class households in the city to prune Lakshmi puja fanfare.        
	The struggle between the purse and puja has left us with no choice but to cut down on festivities, said Saheli Mukherjee of Dhakuria.        
	We usually set aside Rs 1,500 every year for Kojagari Lakshmi puja and invite at least a dozen relatives. This year we have restricted the number of guests to five, thanks to the price pinch, said Maya Datta of Ganguly Bagan.        
	Ranjit Shaw, who runs a grocery shop in New Market, has never experienced such a steep price rise between Poila Baisakh and Lakshmi puja. Vegetable prices may go down after Lakshmi puja but there is no possibility that cereals, sugar and cooking oil will be any cheaper in near future. The slump in the stock market may further push up the prices, said Shaw.        
	The prices of cauliflower and cabbage are usually high during this time of the year. The recent flood in Bihar and Jharkhand has compounded the situation, as bulk of the supply comes from Ranchi. Whatever we get from Tamil Nadu and North 24-Paraganas is too little to meet the demand, said Subol Das, a vegetable wholesaler in Koley Market.        
	A spokesman for the state agricultural marketing department said Calcuttans consume around 12,000 quintal vegetables a day. On Lakshmi puja-eve, the demand shoots up by 40 per cent.

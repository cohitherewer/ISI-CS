                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wall collapse kills mason in Sector V
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The under-construction building in Sector V. A Telegraph picture                                  
	A labourer died and three were injured when a portion of a 16-storey building under construction in Salt Lakes Sector V collapsed on Friday.         
	The incident occurred at Sreejan Tech building, which is being built by the PS Group in Salt Lakes DN block.        
	On Friday morning, masons Uttam Biswas, 45, and Santosh Halder, 21, were plastering cement on the outer walls of the sixth floor. Around 10.50am, the outer wall of the 11th floor collapsed, leaving five workers hanging from ropes attached to their waists. The falling bricks hit Biswas and Halder and they fell down.         
	The bricks also injured two masons on the ground, Akshay Gopal, 25 and Biju Jana, 22.         
	Hearing screams, I rushed to the back of the building and found the labourers lying on the ground, bleeding profusely, said mason Chaitanya Mondol.         
	Biswas was rushed to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead. Halder and Gopal were admitted to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Government hospital with head and leg injuries. Jana was discharged after treatment.        
	Officers of the Nabadiganta Industrial Township police outpost later arrested three officials of M-Far, the construction agency, including construction manager Swapan Roy, site supervisor Amit Chakraborty and safety manager Girijanath Roy.         
	Adequate safety measures werent taken. There were no nets outside the building, said an officer. We are also trying to find out whether quality materials were being used... why should a wall built hardly three weeks ago collapse?

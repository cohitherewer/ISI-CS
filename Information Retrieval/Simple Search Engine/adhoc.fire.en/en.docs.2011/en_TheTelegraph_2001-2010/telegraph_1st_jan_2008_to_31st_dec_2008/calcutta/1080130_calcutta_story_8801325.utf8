	 Apropos the report Jawan belt-whips bus driver, December 22, once again exposes the brutal face of the army jawans. 
     
	Even if the minibus had hit the motorcycle on which the jawan was travelling, what right did he have to take the law in his own hands and whip the driver and punch the conductor? He did so because he, like most armymen, felt that he was above the law and could get away scot-free even after committing a crime in public. 
     
	The jawan cannot be blamed for thinking so. Not a single armyman was punished despite creating mayhem at Park Street police station on December 31, 2006. No jawan is ever pulled up for manhandling civilians on trains or terrorising innocent people in disturbed areas and places along the countrys border. 
     
	It is time the common people and the judiciary raise their voice against the violent ways of armymen. They must be made to understand that their uniform does not give them a licence to break the law.

	We, the residents of Park Circus, are relieved that the high court has prevented the holding of the Book Fair on Park Circus Maidan. This is the only large park in a densely populated area. About 5,000 people use it daily for walking and sports. Where would they have gone otherwise? 
      
	The flow of traffic around the park is chaotic at the best of times. One shudders to imagine what would have happened if thousands of extra cars descended on the area. There is hardly any parking space and the adjoining roads are not wide enough to take on the extra load. 
     
	The area also has several educational institutions, a government hospital and nursing homes. Patients being rushed to the hospital would have been held up by the Book Fair traffic. Also, visitors to the fair would have kicked up a dust storm, putting the health of local residents at risk. 
     
	We also know from experience that fairs at Park Circus Maidan lead to fatal trimming of trees. We love books and know that the Book Fair is important, but how can the ground reality be ignored?

	In a state where the majority of government buses has become junk, it is surprising that the chief ministers car didnt break down earlier (Buddha car wont budge, December 29). The explanation given  that the car didnt start because of the low temperature  is not tenable because it doesnt get that cold in Calcutta. It is the upkeep of the vehicle that must be blamed for the fiasco.

	Apropos the report Bird draw at jheel, January 8, it is pleasing that migratory birds are flocking to Santragachhi Jheel and other open places around the city. Since the number of birds in Calcutta seems to be dwindling, winter presents the perfect opportunity to head out to Howrah and spend a day with the feathered friends.

	Apropos the report Car blaze fuels LPG doubts, January 2, it is a pity that the family, which had a narrow escape when the car they had hired caught fire, cannot remember the name of the vehicle-owner. The streets have become dangerous because of dishonest people like him. Their only aim is to cut costs and they dont hesitate to use illegal LPG kit. The motor vehicles department and police should be very strict with those who flout road rules.

	Apropos the report Pond to be restored, January 1, everyone who cares for the environment will be happy that the civic authorities have taken over the management of a pond in south Calcutta that was being filled up by promoters. People are often left wondering why administrators dont act when a pond is being filled up. If the mayors team continues the good work, they will earn the faith of the people. 
      
	Bhupen Bose,

	Apropos the report Job code delay irks school, December 31, the state government should immediately allow Christian missionary schools to recruit teachers according to their own norms. The only reason the government is not giving up control is because it wants to ensure that the members of the ruling party get jobs in these schools as teachers.

	Sometimes I feel adults have locked up children inside cages; it is my attempt to set them free, said Sushanto Dutta of Nandikar, whose adaptation of Leela Majumdars play Alo was staged by the students of Dakkhin Kalikata Sevasram on November 16. Twenty-five children, between six and 14 years of age, were part of this play, for which they designed their own sets, choreographed their movements and learnt to improvise dialogues, under the direction of Dutta. Dutta gives acting lessons to the orphan boys of the Sevasram every Saturday.        
	Alo revolves around a small boy who lives with his grandfather and is fond of his parrot and cat. Shyamal Nath, who portrayed the ailing grandfather, was particularly impressive.         
	The play helped me grow as a person, he said after his performance.        
	Shubhankar Saha, 14, who was also in the play, said: The workshops help us become more independent.        
	This is Duttas third venture with the children of the orphanage. Earlier they had staged two other plays Shoishober Khoje and Chongripotar Chyangra Bhoot.         
	Other schools also performed on the occasion. Students of Kisholoy, a school for the mentally challenged in Singur, demonstrated some yogasanas, while students of Lighthouse for the Blind presented a dance drama, Prithibi Amar Ghor. Singer Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta jazzed up the evening with some popular numbers.         
	Dakkhin Kalikata Sevasram is a home for 75 destitute boys. It also runs a free primary school.

	Nandaram is on fire, the adjoining buildings are in fear. For, every second building in the Burrabazar belt is a fire hazard. Metro entered one of them on Monday afternoon...
  
	 ldquo;We were living in fear. When the gas cylinder on Sunday evening exploded in Nandaram, we began preparing to leave the area and take shelter in a relative rsquo;s house, rdquo; said Usha Singh, with a quick glance at the crimson flames leaping out of the Nandaram Market complex, barely 100 metres from the eight-storeyed building she lives in.
 
	The only way up the dark (even at 3pm) and dirty building was a narrow staircase. The 14 Pageyapatty Street address houses some 100 shops and godowns containing inflammable garment material mdash; and 22 residents.
 
	Unlike Nandaram, this building nearby has five families mdash; including eight children mdash; living on the fifth, sixth and seventh floors.
 
	It is all a maze of shops, stacks of garment material and electrical wiring, covered with soot, hanging loose from the roof.
 
	Umesh Jhawar, a garment merchant with a godown on the first floor, said he had never seen any maintenance work being carried out. ldquo;I rsquo;ve been planning to shift my godown from here, but you know, money is a problem... rdquo;
 
	The only water source available to the building is a 1,000-litre tank on the rooftop and there are no fire extinguishers or emergency exits.
 
	Every resident of the building was keeping an eye on the Nandaram blaze.
 
	What if a fire breaks out at 14 Pageyapatty Street ? After a pause, Pankaj Jha, a resident of the building, said: ldquo;Well, we will die. The building will crumble. rdquo;

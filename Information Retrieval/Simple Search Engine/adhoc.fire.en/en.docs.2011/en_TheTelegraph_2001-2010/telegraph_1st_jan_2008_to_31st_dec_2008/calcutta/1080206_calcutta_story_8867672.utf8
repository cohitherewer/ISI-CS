                                                                                                            Teen singers in highway crash     - Aneek hits the stage after head scan, Sanchita attends to injured father          OUR BUREAU                          Aneek Dhar on song at City Centre. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Reality show champions Aneek Dhar and Sanchita Bhattacharya met with a road accident in Assam early on Tuesday.        
	The young singers from the city were on their way to Guwahati to catch a flight back home when their vehicle collided with two trucks. Lil Champ 2006 Sanchita suffered scratches on her face and a sprain in the leg while Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2007 winner Aneek had bruised his head. Two others in the car, including Sanchitas father, suffered serious injuries.        
	Both the teenaged stars were back in Calcutta by the evening. Aneek is all right. We just received the MRI scan report, said his father Dr Pankaj Dhar. Sanchita was by her fathers side at a nursing home. He received 23 stitches on his head, she said.        
	Aneek was rattled by the accident but had no time to recuperate. By Tuesday evening he was back on the road, off to Burdwan for a show. We had no plans of going but news came that the crowd there was becoming restive. Aneek will put in an appearance, but not sing, said his father before leaving town.        
	But the Lake Gardens lad had other plans. I am an artiste; I will sing, Aneek told Metro. And sing he did  from Kal ho naa ho to Dard-e-Disco  after being given a heros welcome in Burdwan.        
	Police in Guwahati said Team Aneek-Sanchita was driving down after performing at a programme organised by Kokrajhar District Sports Association late on Monday. The accident took place near Dudhnoi, 120 km from Guwahati, around 4.30am.                                          
	The driver lost control while trying to overtake a coal-laden truck as another truck came speeding from the opposite side. The driver hit the back of the truck he was trying to overtake. The windscreen and the left window pane shattered under the impact of the collision.        
	Alerted by the crash, local residents rushed to the spot and took the injured to a nearby health centre. From there, they were taken to Goalpara Civil Hospital.        
	Aneek and Sanchita (picture above) were released after first-aid, while the two others were admitted to a private nursing home in Guwahati.        
	Sanchitas mother Rupa was in shock when Metro called up the Bhattacharya home in Howrah. Please pray, she said. When they hit the truck, her father was hurled from the back seat to the front, Sanchita added.         
	This was the 15-year-olds final stage show before her Madhyamik, from next week.

                      Call of the deep forest                    Krishna, the archetypal beloved and epitome of all beauty and delight, is the predominant theme of Siddhartha Senguptas works. But Sengupta stresses this theme surpasses its portrayal on canvas. Sengupta identifies himself with the shepherd boy Krishna. Looking at the world with Krishnas eyes, his works like Vrindaban (depicted here), are full of sensuous renditions of his concept of Krishnas existence. Shibani Senguptas works are also on display. Her sylvan landscapes are created with enigmatic nuances on the canvas.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Siddhartha Sen Gupta and Shibani Sen Gupta When: Till January 29; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery

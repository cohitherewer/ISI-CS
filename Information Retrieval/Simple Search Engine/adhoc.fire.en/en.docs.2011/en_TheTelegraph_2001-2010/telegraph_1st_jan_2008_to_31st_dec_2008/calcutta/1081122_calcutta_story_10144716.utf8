                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       28 out of 20 in varsity exam
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University has issued incorrect marksheets to nearly 1,500 BA Part-II sociology honours examinees four months after the examination.         
	The students appeared for a 30-mark practical test as part of paper IV (under the 1+1+1 system) but their marksheets allotted only 20 marks to practical. Correspondingly, the full marks for the theoretical part of the paper were mentioned as 80, when it should have been 70.        
	A student of a central Calcutta college found that she had scored 28 out of 20 in the practical test.         
	We are shocked to see that the university has issued incorrect marksheets despite taking nearly four months to declare the results, said an examinee.        
	The results of BA and B.Sc Part-I and Part-II examinations were declared on Wednesday and the marksheets were distributed to the students on Thursday. The authorities of many colleges overlooked the mistake and handed over the incorrect marksheets to students.        
	A CU official said till last year, the theoretical part of paper IV was of 80 marks and the practical portion of 20 marks.        
	It appears that the university authorities had forgotten to change the format of the old sociology honours marksheet. The mistake has created a lot of confusion among examinees, said a sociology teacher of a central Calcutta college.        
	After receiving complaints from college heads, the CU authorities decided to recall the marksheets and issue fresh copies.        
	We started the process of correcting marksheets as soon as the mistake was brought to our notice on Friday. We will send the revised marksheets to the colleges within a few days. The students will have to return the marksheets already issued to them and collect the correct ones, said Debashis Biswas, the deputy controller of examinations of the university.        
	He assured the students that it was a minor mistake and their results would not be affected.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A murder case has been lodged against the superintendent and other officers of Presidency jail following the death of an undertrial on Tuesday night.        
	Mohammad Azharuddin, facing an attempt to murder charge, died hours after a warder allegedly hit him on the head with a baton during a clash between two groups of inmates.        
	Azharuddins father Mohammad Fakruddin lodged a complaint with Hastings police station on Wednesday, accusing the jail staff of killing his son.        
	A case under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC has been lodged against jail officials, including superintendent Khairul Alam. A team from Hastings police station visited the jail on Thursday, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	A preliminary medical examination found a number of injury marks on Azharuddins body. The wounds might have caused the death. We are yet to get a detailed report, said an investigating officer.        
	We are waiting for the post-mortem report to ascertain whether the undertrial suffered the injuries when the warders launched a baton-charge to disperse the warring inmates, the officer added.        
	Trouble broke out at Presidency jail on Tuesday afternoon over the attempt to shift a group of inmates to Dum Dum Central jail.        
	Led by Gudda and Azharuddin, the group refused to budge, but another gang of undertrials demanded that they be immediately shifted to the Dum Dum jail.         
	The two groups clashed, armed with bricks and iron rods they collected from a construction site on the jail premises.        
	The jail authorities then rang the emergency bell and stepped in to restore order. Azharuddin suffered a blow to his head and he died within a few hours in the jail hospital, said an official.        
	The jail authorities have lodged a complaint against Gudda and his accomplices, charging them with rioting.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Classes for third and fourth year students of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), suspended since November 6, will resume next week.        
	The dates will be announced after the universitys board of management discusses the matter on December 29, registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay said on Monday.        
	The university was indefinitely closed on November 6 following student violence and undergraduate boys were asked to leave the campus. Classes for first and second year students resumed on November 18. The authorities had then announced that the dates for the resumption of third and fourth year classes would be announced later.        
	Six Opposition MLAs visited Besu on Monday and demanded an explanation for the decision to hand over the campus to police after the violence.

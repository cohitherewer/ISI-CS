          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Haradhan Dhara, 65, was found hanging from the ceiling of his Swami Vivekananda Road house on Tuesday.         
	Two of his sons lodged a complaint against their elder brother and his wife, with whom he was staying, of abetment to suicide.         
	They alleged the couple forced Dhara to hand over the money from the sale of a building he owned in Hem Chakraborty Lane.

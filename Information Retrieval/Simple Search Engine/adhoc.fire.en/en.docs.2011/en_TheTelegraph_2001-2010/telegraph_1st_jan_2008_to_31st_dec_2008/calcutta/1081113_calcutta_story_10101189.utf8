                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bus race mishap, despite pleas
  - Student recalls how driver stepped on gas          A STAFF REPORTER                          Debarati Saha, a management student, undergoes treatment at a Bypass hospital. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Two state-run buses ignored passengers pleas and raced till one smashed into the other on EM Bypass on Wednesday morning, injuring 25.        
	The injured were taken to Ruby General Hospital, from where everyone was released after treatment, except for two first-year students of the Heritage Institute of Technology.        
	The passengers of both buses  run by the state surface transport corporation on the Dum Dum Central jail-Anandapur route  complained that the drivers had ignored their repeated pleas to slow down.        
	The mishap resulted from rash driving. Both buses have been impounded and the drivers have been arrested, said an officer of Kasba police station. The buses were going at more than 70 km per hour, though the speed limit on the Bypass is 60.         
	The passengers and the police said the buses  bearing registration numbers WB-19D/3230 and WB-19D/3237  started speeding after crossing the Salt Lake stadium.         
	Debarati Saha, a management student of Heritage Institute, was on the WB-19D/3230 bus. She suffered injuries to her lips and tongue as her face slammed into the handle of the seat in front.        
	She told Metro from her hospital bed: Our driver started speeding after spying the other bus through his rear-view mirror. He asked the conductor what the time was. On being told that it was 10 minutes to nine, he really stepped on the accelerator.        
	The two buses overtook each other a number of times, ignoring our pleas to slow down. When will the authorities put an end to this death race? asked one of the injured passengers.        
	Near the Manovikas Kendra bus stop, the WB-19D/3230 bus rammed into the rear of the other vehicle while swerving in its bid to race ahead.        
	Riya Roy Chowdhuri, also of the Heritage Institute, was standing near the drivers seat on the same bus as Debarati.        
	We had been urging the driver to slow down but he turned a deaf ear to us. I fell down under the impact of the collision and others trampled on me, said the computer science student nursing injuries on her right leg.        
	The condition of both girls is stable. They are under observation, said an official of Ruby General Hospital.        
	Drivers are not bothered about speed limits. They accelerate dangerously the moment they spot a bus on the same route travelling in the same direction, said Samir Mukherjee, a government employee who commutes daily on the Dum Dum Central jail-Anandapur route.

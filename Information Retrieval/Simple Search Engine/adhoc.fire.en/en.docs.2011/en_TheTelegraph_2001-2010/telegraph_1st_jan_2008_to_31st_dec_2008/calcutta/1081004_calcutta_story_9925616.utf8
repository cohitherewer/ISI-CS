                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       10-day revamp plan for runway tools 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta airports instrument landing system (ILS) will not be functional for around 10 days from October 17 as the old equipment will be replaced. This could cause flights to be delayed or diverted in the event of bad weather.        
	The decision was taken at a meeting between the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and airlines on Friday afternoon.         
	The replacement may lead to disruption in flight services at the airport if visibility drops below 1,300 metres.         
	The secondary runway does not have ILS yet and under such circumstances, flight operations would have to be closed. Aircraft will have to hover or, if the bad weather persists, may have to be diverted, airport sources said.         
	The ILS operation will be closed from October 17. The old equipment has become obsolete and will be replaced with state-of-the art equipment imported from the US, said P. K. Singhal, the regional executive director (eastern region) of the AAI. He said the project cost is Rs 1 crore.        
	This may cause inconvenience to passengers but we have to instal the new equipment to ensure smooth operations during winter. According to the weather forecast, there is less possibility of poor visibility around this time, he pointed out.         
	The existing ILS was installed in March 1993. It should have been replaced after 10 to 12 years. A similar equipment was installed at the Gaya airport a few days back, the executive director said.         
	Air Indias Haj flight, which will fly 535 passengers daily, will begin this years operations from October 30 and the installation is expected to be completed by then.         
	Airport officials said although the notice to airmen (Notam) has been issued for 10 days, they would try to finish the work within a week.         
	At a similar meeting last month, airline operators had objected to the project being started this month. They had requested the authorities to first instal the ILS on the secondary runway and then take up work on the main runway.         
	However, the ILS can be installed on the secondary runway only after its extension, which could take more than a year. Installation of the ILS on the secondary runway will take six to eight months, an official said.        
	The replacement of the old ILS was necessary. So we gave our consent, said an airline official who was present at the meeting.

          LES DANGERFIELD                        Les Dangerfield clicks away at one of the stops on the final True Spirit tour on Ashtami				                                           
	My first experience of Puja was last year, when I had spent an evening pandal-hopping. I had focussed mainly on the artistic qualities of pandals. This year, as a judge for CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Award, I had to assess the utilitarian qualities of pujas instead of their aesthetic appeal. It was a rewarding and instructive experience.        
	We were looking not only for crowd-control and fire safety measures but also evidence that the puja committees had applied common sense good citizenship to their work  by paying for power, not encroaching on roads, arranging for waste disposal and providing access to the physically challenged. The award made me and, Im sure, the puja organisers more aware of these important issues.        
	Others had done the hard work of paring down the over-250 participant pujas to a shortlist. My fellow judges and I only had to tour five pandals in different parts of Calcutta.        
	We were warmly greeted at each puja and spent about 20 minutes looking around and assessing the extent to which the organisers had met the key criteria.        
	The choice was tough as all five organisers had put in a lot of effort to make their pujas both attractive and safe. It was sometimes difficult not to be swayed by the creativity and workmanship.        
	In fact, the first pandal we visited was, for me, the most impressive from the point of view of workmanship and creativity. The narrow gates and the hub, however, presented too great a risk to the crowd that thronged the puja. The main fire exit was also blocked.        
	Some of the pujas provided wheelchairs but had designed the pandals in such a way that the physically challenged could not access all parts.        
	Five hours later we were back at Bengal Club for the final reckoning. What decided the winner was probably the fact that the pandal had an open plan, allowing for free and safe crowd movement.

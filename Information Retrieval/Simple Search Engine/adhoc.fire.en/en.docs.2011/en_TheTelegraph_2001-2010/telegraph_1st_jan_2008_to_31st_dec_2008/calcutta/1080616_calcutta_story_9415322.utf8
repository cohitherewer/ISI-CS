The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Where power burns illegally
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Where power burns illegally
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Illegal power lines in Howrahs Pilkhana. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                  
	In Pilkhana, you can get an electricity connection legally, only if your are brave enough to take on the might of local thugs thriving on power theft. Three children died and one is battling for life after being electrocuted by an illegal connection in the Howrah neighbourhood on Saturday afternoon.        
	Sakil Ahmed, 36, an embroidery worker, wanted to save on his power bill but had to pay a heavy price as one of his two sons died of electrocution and the other is battling for life. Yes, we have an illegal connection in our house. That is the norm here, said Sakil.        
	In Pilkhana and its adjoining areas, most families depend on illegal connections.        
	I wanted to have a legal connection and deposited all papers to CESC. A few days later, a youth came and told me that he would provide electricity to my house. Since then, he has been supplying electricity illegally, said a local resident.        
	Saturday nights tragedy will recur unless the illegal lines are snapped and the racket, involving local thugs and a section of CESC staff, is busted, said another resident.        
	The racketeers are all known faces but none could summon the courage to name them. Who will come to my rescue if they attack me? said CPM councillor Reshma Ali.        
	Sources said the racket has divided Pilkhana into four zones, each looked after by a criminal. The stretch between Nanda Ghosh Road and Kath Bridge is allegedly under the control of a relative of a local CPM leader. Part of Madartala Lane and the entire Madartala 3rd Bylane is ruled by a relative of a local Congress leader.        
	Aurobinda Bose, the general manager of CESCs loss control cell, said: Power theft is rampant in Pilkhana. We snap the lines but as soon as our men leave the area, the thieves restore the connection. He denied that any CESC employee was involved in the racket.

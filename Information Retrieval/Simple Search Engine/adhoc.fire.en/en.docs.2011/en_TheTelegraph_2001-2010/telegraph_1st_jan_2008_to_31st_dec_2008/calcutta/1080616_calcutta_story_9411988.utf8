The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Taste of inflation in eating out
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Taste of inflation in eating out
          SAIONEE CHAKRABORTY AMP; KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                            
	Inflation has struck not just your kitchen but your favourite restaurant, too, and the next lunch or dinner outside home could cost you 7-15 per cent more.         
	Although no restaurant has hiked prices yet, chances are each one of them will do so in the next few days.         
	Prices in our restaurants will eventually go up. We will wait for another 10-15 days Suppliers have approached us already (with new rates) and prices may go up by 7-8 per cent, said Debashish Ghosh, the regional business manager of Mainland China.        
	 The price hike wont be limited to non-vegetarian food. At Tamarind, a popular South Indian eatery, a meal for two could be costlier by 15 per cent.         
	A meal for two now costs Rs 500. That might, henceforth, cost you Rs 600. We havent lost our clientele, but as businessmen, inflation has really affected us, said Goutam Purakayastha, one of the partners in Tamarind.        
	The footfall in restaurateur Navin Pais upmarket ventures like SOI 11 and Blue Potato has declined even without prices being increased.         
	It has gone down by almost 30 per cent. Smaller eateries like Coffee Pai and Malgudi Junction have, however, not been affected so far. I think this is a temporary phase that will be gone by June-end. I might increase prices, though, by 15 per cent, Pai said.         
	Prices of edible oils and pulses have increased by 10-15 per cent, green vegetables by Rs 2-3 per kg, and of boneless chicken, mutton, cheese and cooking gas.         
	We usually review our prices every one-and-a-half years and hike them by 5-10 per cent, but this time it might be more because of the unprecedented rise in prices of all items. We have increased our prices four times in the last six years, said Kallol Banerjee, the manager of Marco Polo.         
	Small-time caterers have been affected the most. Sibsankar Chakraborty, who supplies lunch to employees of offices across the city, said his profit margin had shrunk since prices started to rise.         
	A plate of chicken and rice that used to cost Rs 25 now costs Rs 35, and many are not willing to pay that much. For me, there is the additional cost of gas and petrol. Using cheaper alternatives is not an option. I have been forced to reduce the portions instead. The pieces of chicken that I serve are now smaller, he said.         
	Families, too, are eating out less frequently. I used to eat out with my family at least four times a month, but its now only once, media professional Manasi Sinha said.         
	Vineeta Singh, who works in a finance company, hoped elections and a possible change of guard at the Centre would bring down prices. Previously, Rs 200 was sufficient for a weeks quota of food. The same amount now buys food only for three days, she said.        
	The only places that are not making consumers pay the price of inflation are the clubs. We charge just enough to cover our losses and we have no plans to increase prices, said Deepankar Nandi, the CEO of CC amp;FC.         
	Space Circle, Dalhousie Institute and Calcutta Swimming Club havent increased food and beverage prices either and have no plans to do so.        
	The club stores have, however, reported a decline in sales. People who used to blindly buy things are now picking up only daily necessities like groceries. Our sales have gone down because of inflation, said Ajay Mimani of the Convenio Store at Calcutta Club.

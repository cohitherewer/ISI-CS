                      Afghan expressions                    Liberated from the shackles of an erstwhile tyrannical political regime, Afghan women are now coming forward to document their sufferings and express feelings that provide a key to their psychological needs. A group of talented young women have chosen the medium of art to articulate their vision of life in their country. Working together in a common art environment, they have shared stories of the trials of their lives, painting uninhibitedly to express their thoughts and emotions. This exhibition of paintings by young women artists from Afghanistan is the first of its kind in the art history of that country. Conveying the creative ideas of a young generation, it symbolically expresses their experiences of life within the framework of new art concepts. Featuring works by students between the ages of 16 and 25, it focuses in general on the life of women in contemporary Afghanistan. The artworks display the honour, pride and exceptional achievements of Afghan women, instead of portraying their deprivation and oppression. Nevertheless, they depict the reality of the situation of women, giving silent, yet eloquent expression to the problems caused by their subjugation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Engineer dead in park
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Soumen Dey                                  
	A 43-year-old engineer was found dead in a park in Salt Lakes BF block on Sunday.         
	Police suspect Soumen Dey had died of poisoning. A case of unnatural death has been registered.         
	A preliminary investigation revealed he might have consumed pesticide. We have sent the body for post-mortem, said Ashoke Biswas, the additional superintendent of police, Salt Lake.         
	Soumen, a resident of Purbachal apartments in the township, had resigned his job about 10 years ago and used to stay with his widowed mother in a ground-floor apartment. His elder brother, Somnath, stays on the third floor of the same cluster.         
	Since our mothers death four years ago, Soumen stayed alone at home, usually reading books. He sometimes came to eat with us, said Somnath.         
	According to him, Soumen would often leave the house for a couple of days without informing anybody. But he always called up later to keep us informed about his whereabouts, Somnath said. So, when he did not turn up for breakfast on Sunday, we didnt worry. But when he did not ring us till late at night, we became anxious, he said.         
	On Monday, Somnath realised his brothers cellphone was still in his room. I immediately sensed something was amiss and went to the police, he said.

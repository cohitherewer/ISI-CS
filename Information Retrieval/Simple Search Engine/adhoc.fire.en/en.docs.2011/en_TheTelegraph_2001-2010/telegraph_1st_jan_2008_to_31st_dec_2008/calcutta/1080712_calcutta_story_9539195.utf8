                      A rocking evening                    Formed a couple of years ago, Glass Onion is a city-based English rock band playing covers but mainly interested in their original music. The group derives its name from a song from The White Album by The Beatles, borrowing from the Fab Fours idea that their songs did not carry profound meaning and were simply meant to be enjoyed for their own sake. Diverse influences, from the Beatles to Jaco Pastorius and The Ventures, come into play in the bands performances. Rock n Roll, Glass Onions performance this evening, pays tribute to the groups mentors. On the cards are numbers like Pride and Joy by Stevie Ray Vaughn, Memphis Tennesee by Chuck Berry, Proud Mary by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Come Together by The Beatles, Hound Dog by Elvis Presley and Dance With Me by The Wonders. After this, the band will play some of its original compositions like Big Fat Elephant, Coded Lies and Fake Stars, among others, giving the audience a taste of the bands own music. All in all, the concert has all it takes to make a fun-filled Saturday evening.                    Event: A performance by music band Glass Onion When: Today at 6 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts,94 Ballygunge Place,

	A city-based NGO has come up with an interactive CD-ROM to help teenagers handle problems related to growing up.        
	Teen Friend, the self-learning CD-ROM put together by Adolescent Resource Centre of Child In Need Institute, has a girl and a boy discussing bodily changes during adolescence, menstruation, incest, drug abuse and stress management.        
	The other topics covered include contraception, teenage pregnancy, sex determination, sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS.Teen Friend is an attempt to provide youngsters complete information on reproductive, sexual and psycho-social health. Young people discuss these matters with friends and often have a lot of misconceptions, said Sanchita Banerjee, the assistant director of CINI.        
	We have utilised our experience of working with teenagers. Queries at our tele-counselling service also helped us to choose the topics, said Atashi Gupta, the co-ordinator (counselling unit) of the centre, which deals with reproductive and sexual health issues of young people.        
	Each section of the CD-ROM has interactive games, quizzes and puzzles that will allow users to test their knowledge of a particular topic.        
	The NGO is using the CD-ROM in West Bengal and Jharkhand. A couple of schools in the city have shown an interest in using the CD-ROM for life skill classes, added Gupta.

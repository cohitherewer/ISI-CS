  - REPEATED SNAGS STALL METRO          A STAFF REPORTER                          A policeman waves away commuters at a Metro Railway station on Wednesday morning, after a stalled rake played havoc with train schedules. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	Office-goers had a harrowing time on Wednesday morning when a Tollygunge-bound Metro Railway train developed a snag and remained stuck at Belgachhia station for half an hour and in the tunnel between Belgachhia and Shyambazar for 15 minutes.         
	Train services were disrupted for over an hour and 18 Up and Down trains were cancelled. According to a Metro Railway spokesperson, the train first developed a snag after reaching Belgachhia around 9.20am. It started moving again after half an hour of repairs, only to come to a standstill in the tunnel on the way to Shyambazar.        
	The passengers had no option but to wait in the tunnel. When the train reached Shyambazar after another round of repairs, they were asked to get off.        
	The rake was defective. It had slowed down on the way to Belgachhia, where it got stuck. I reached office an hour late as a result, said Utpal Das, a central government employee.         
	I was trapped inside the tunnel for the first time today. It was scary and I was gasping for breath. The Metro Railway authorities are not bothered about the safety of passengers, said Vishal Sharma, another passenger.         
	The rake is very old and developed snags after setting off from Dum Dum. The problem was aggravated because of faulty air pressure, which caused the train to stop abruptly, said the spokesperson.        
	The rake was taken to the Tollygunge railway shed for repairs.        
	Most of our rakes are being used since we started operations in 1984. They often develop snags. We have commissioned 13 new rakes. The problem will be solved only when the old rakes are replaced with the new ones, added the spokesperson.

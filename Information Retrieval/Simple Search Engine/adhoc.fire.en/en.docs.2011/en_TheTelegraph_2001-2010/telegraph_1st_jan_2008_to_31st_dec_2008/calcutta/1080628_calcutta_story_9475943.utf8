                      Staging a start                    Literary buffs in the city are in for a double treat this weekend. To mark the opening of Penguins Classics Collection, a month-long exhibition of some of the best books ever written (from Greek and Roman literature to Victorian and modern classics), Starmark hosts The Evening Show, featuring the performance of three short plays. Sure Thing (written by David Ives) is an experimental comedy about a couple talking in a restaurant. Whenever they say anything wrong, a bell rings to signal their slip-up, as if to allow them to put it right. In this way, a series of ringings enables the couple to converse agreeably with each other until they bond happily in the end. The Philadelphia (also written by David Ives) is about a man in a situation in which everything happens exactly opposite the way he wants or expects it to happen. Based on a short story by Kaushik Baruah, The Road to High Holborn (written by Dhruv Mookerji) tells the story of a young couple who meet in a London underground train and strike up a conversation over a book. It offers a touching exploration of the interaction between two virtual strangers over a short period of time. All three plays are directed by Dhruv Mookerji.                    Event: Three short plays in English, presented by Theatrecian When: Today at 7 pm Where: Starmark, 3 Lord Sinha Road

	Addition to the basket of courses and augmentation of infrastructure  2008 will see a slew of changes at Presidency College. 
    
	Sanjib Ghosh, the principal of the college, announced the plans on Sunday, after a meeting on the 191st foundation day of the institution.
    
	Apart from students and teachers, representatives of the colleges alumni association took part in the meeting.
    
	State womens commission chairperson Jasodhara Bagchi, former Presidency principals Mamata Roy and Amol Mukhopadhyay and Presidency College Alumni Association vice-president Jyotirmoy Pal Chaudhuri were among those who attended the programme. 
    
	According to Ghosh, the state government has already sanctioned the posts of 17 adjunct professors to fill up vacancies. 
    
	The college has also been allotted Rs 4 crore from the MP local area development fund for upgrade of the central library building, which will house the science library and bio-informatics facilities.
    
	We have got funds for our molecular biology and geology departments from the government and we want to boost the facilities in these wings, said Ghosh. 
    
	The college will also receive funds for a seminar room, to be built in 2008, and for the renovation of the girls hostel and Hindu Hostel. The University Grants Commission has provided Rs 45 lakh to the science departments for the development of laboratories.
    
	We are also trying to start a masters course in material and nanoscience with the Indian Association for Cultivation of Science in the 2008 academic session, said Ghosh. 
    
	The initiative is part of the colleges effort to improve life science and material science education.
    
	There will be an attempt to increase the number of working days in the academic calendar by reducing or shifting holidays. 
    
	We will be shifting some of the holidays to periods when there are traditionally fewer classes, like April, said Ghosh. The former students of the college who were present at the programme welcomed the initiatives.
    
	We, the alumni, need to work towards setting up a corpus fund to help the college during a financial crisis, said Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, the chairman of the Indian Council of Historical Research and the chief guest on the occasion.

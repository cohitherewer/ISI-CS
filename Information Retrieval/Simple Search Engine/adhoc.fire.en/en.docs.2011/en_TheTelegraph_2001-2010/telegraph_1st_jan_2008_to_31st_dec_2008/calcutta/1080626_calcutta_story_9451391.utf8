The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bill boost to civic fire norms scan 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bill boost to civic fire norms scan 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A bill awaiting clearance by the Assembly seeks to empower the civic authorities to close down a business running without a licence.        
	The municipal affairs department will place the bill in the next session of the Assembly.         
	Currently, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) cannot shut down a business running without a licence. It can only revoke a trade licence or refuse to renew it.        
	The CMC issues licences for 206 categories of trade. The civic body has announced a new licence policy that makes it mandatory for 18 categories of trade to obtain clearances from the fire services department to renew their licence. Over 1.2 lakh traders with licences will have to produce clearance from the fire services.        
	Currently, the civic authorities cannot enforce fire safety norms while issuing a trade licence. But whenever a fire breaks out in a business establishment, everyone, including the traders bodies, blame the CMC for issuing a licence, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharjee.        
	According to him, the amendment to the CMC Act of 1980 will force traders who are running establishments without trade licences to abide by the fire safety norms.         
	Traders associations foresee trouble. The president of the Federation of Traders Organisation, Taraknath Trivedi, said: The bill will lead to inspector raj and corruption in the civic body as well as the fire services department.        
	Moreover, the fire services department, added Trivedi, does not have the infrastructure to handle the over two lakh fire clearance applications it was likely to receive in a year.        
	We have started discussions with the fire services department for quick disposal of the traders applications and they are strengthening their infrastructure, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	About 3.5 lakh trade licences are issued and renewed every year by the civic licence department. The total income of the department is to the tune of Rs 30 crore.        
	The new law would reduce the revenue collection of the licence department by a few crores, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	But money cannot be more important than the safety of human lives, he added.

	With the Internet, television and video games claiming students short attention span, books are being relegated to the background. The Cambridge School, near Hazra, has come up with a novel concept for taking youngsters back to the written word.         
	Throughout July, the school is organising a library festival for students from classes VII to X where they compete to write the best book reviews for cash prizes. A minimum of three reviews must be sent in, on books borrowed from the school library, although it is not mandatory to do so.         
	By giving them an incentive, we would like to bring them to books, as there is no substitute for reading, says principal Nonda Chatterjee.         
	In the review, the students have been asked to stress on a storys theme, plot, characters and the socio-cultural context. The 15 best reviews will be selected for cash prizes.         
	Though many of the avid readers are not participating, it has not daunted the organisers. For the purpose of the fest, says Chatterjee, is to create new readers.        
	The idea seems to have caught on. Though I did not read regularly, now I come here whenever I am free, says Deepshika Dhar of Class IX who has decided to write a review of Sylvia Nasars A Beautiful Mind. While writing a review, I note the authors writing skills. For me, the main criterion is that the story must touch the reader, she adds. Sachiko Seth of Class X has always been a voracious reader.         
	My first book was by Enid Blyton. It was given to me in Class II, he says as he looks up from Chicken Soup for the Indian Soul. I will be writing a review of The Class and Doctors by Erich Segal and of Chicken Soup, he adds.         
	The effort is already bearing fruit. The number of borrowers has gone up by 60 per cent. PG Wodehouse and Agatha Christie are by far the most popular authors. Amitav Ghosh and Paulo Coelho are a big hit among the students, says teacher Nandini Dutta.         
	The little ones are also joining in. I prefer coming here as our own library is just a cupboard of books, says Class V student Olivia Das. A dumb charade on books is also on the cards. This way, the students will become acquainted with new titles, feels Chatterjee.

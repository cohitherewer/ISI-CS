     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	The newly-constructed Milan Mela, which is hosting the 21st India International Trade Fair, is likely to be the venue of Book Fair 2009, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said on Monday.
    
	The trade fair, being organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI), is scheduled from January 17.
    
	Deb said the government wanted Book Fair 2008 to be held on the Bypass plot which is being developed as a permanent fair ground.
    
	But BNCCI had booked the dates for the trade fair from January 17 to 27. We hope the Book Fair can be organised there from next year, Deb added.
    
	To avoid such overlapping, the government has decided to prepare a calendar of events for Milon Mela in 2009.
    
	The first phase of the Rs 40-crore complex, spread across 4,400 sq metres, is ready. It has four non-airconditioned halls. 
    
	We want to hold fairs on the ground and get feedback from the public. Based on the inputs, we will plan the second phase. A big airconditioned auditorium will come up in the second phase, said Sabyasachi Sen, the principal secretary in the department of commerce and industry.
    
	The entire ground will not be covered. We want to keep some space open, Sen added.
    
	There is a recurring cost involved in running the whole complex and we urge the industry to participate in the management and partial upkeep of the premises, the official said.

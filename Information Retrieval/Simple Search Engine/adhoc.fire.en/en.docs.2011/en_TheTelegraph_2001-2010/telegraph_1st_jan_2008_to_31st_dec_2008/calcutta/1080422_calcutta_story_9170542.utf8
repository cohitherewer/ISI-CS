	Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP) held its annual concert on April 10 at its campus in Taratolla. The event saw students performing before a packed house and impressing all with their coordination and enthusiasm.        
	The programme started off with children swaying and clapping to Lopamudra Mitras song Dakchhe akash, dakchhe batash. Although many were wheelchair-bound, there was no dearth of enthusiasm. This was followed by a humourous skit, Dadkhani Chal.        
	After the warm up, it was time for some action. As the popular number Bum bum bole from Taare Zameen Par filled the auditorium, students were joined on the stage by teachers and mothers who sang and danced along with their wards.         
	Their efforts got a thundering applause from the audience. But the best was yet to come. After the interval, students staged a drama Kakatuar Keramoti.         
	Clad in colourful costumes, the actors delivered their dialogues like professionals with little help from prompters.         
	Their emotive skills stole every heart. Reena Sen, director of training and research, IICP, said: Todays programme is a celebration of the students will power. It shows the heights one can scale even in the face of adversity.        
	The guests for the evening were quizmaster Barry O Brien, Odissi dancer Alakananda Roy and writer Sashthipada Chatterjee. Roy said: I was overwhelmed by the performance. A lot of hard work went behind the concert.         
	Suchitra Dey, mother of 18-year-old Boon, was happy to see her daughter on stage. The event has boosted Boons spirit and will egg her to perform well, she said.         
	IICP had initially started with two children. Now it has spread to other districts of West Bengal and to other states. Students are imparted vocational training ranging from catering to computer training.        
	The programme ended on a bright note with Barry OBrien declaring that Shah Rukh Khan had decided to reserve 30 IPL seats for these challenged children.

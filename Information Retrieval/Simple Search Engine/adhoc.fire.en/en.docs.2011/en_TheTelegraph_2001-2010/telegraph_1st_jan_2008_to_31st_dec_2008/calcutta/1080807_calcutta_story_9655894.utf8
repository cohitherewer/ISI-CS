          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                      
	After sending warring couples to the seaside to kiss and make up, the high court is now sending one on a patch-up pilgrimage.        
	Justice Asim Banerjee on Wednesday asked a couple to visit Kamarpukur and Jayrambati  the birthplaces of Sri Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada. Whats more, the judge himself contacted the Ramakrishna Mission authorities in Belur and arranged for the couple to stay under the supervision of Prabir Maharaj.        
	Go and stay there for two days. I am sure that after returning from the holy places, you will stay together, Justice Banerjee told Sandip Chakraborty, 32, and his wife Mousumi, 25.        
	This was the second effort by the judge to unite Sandip and Mousumi. On July 14, he had asked them to spend a night together and then come to court. After spending a night with his wife, Sandip told the judge that his wife was ready to stay with him but her parents didnt want to let her go.        
	Justice Banerjee then asked Mousumis parents to come to court. On Wednesday, when Mousumi came to court with her father, the judge called her to his chamber and spoke to her. He then arranged for the couple to go to Kamarpukur and Jayrambati.        
	Sandip, who lives in Chinsurah, had married Asansol resident Mousumi in 2004. From the beginning, Mousumi and her in-laws did not get along well, but Sandip did not want to live separately.        
	Mousumi walked out of her in-laws house in October 2007, when she was pregnant. In January this year, she gave birth to a girl. After the birth, she did not want to return to her husbands house. Sandip had moved a case in Chinsurah court demanding restoration of his marriage, but the court declined to accept his prayer, said Udaysankar Chatterjee, Mousumis lawyer.        
	When Mousumi moved the court in June, requesting the case be shifted to Asansol, Justice Banerjee started the reconciliation process, said Kaushik Chanda, Sandips counsel.

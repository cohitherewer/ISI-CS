          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A Bangladeshi national was arrested from central Calcutta on Wednesday night with fake currency worth over Rs 4 lakh.        
	Following a tip-off, police laid a trap for Pulok Banik, 43, who came to Calcutta on September 12, apparently for medical treatment.         
	Banik, a resident of Chittagong, was supposed to turn up at Jyoti cinema with a consignment of counterfeit notes. We found 400 currency notes of Rs 1,000 denominations each in his bag, said a senior officer of the Special Task Force.         
	Baniks interrogation may throw up information on other currency rackets in the city, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	Banik was produced in court on Thursday and remanded in police custody for 14 days.         
	According to the police, Banik runs a transport business in Bangladesh and had visited Calcutta several times in the past few years.         
	We are checking the documents he had furnished with his visa application, said an officer. His local contacts, too, are under the scanner.

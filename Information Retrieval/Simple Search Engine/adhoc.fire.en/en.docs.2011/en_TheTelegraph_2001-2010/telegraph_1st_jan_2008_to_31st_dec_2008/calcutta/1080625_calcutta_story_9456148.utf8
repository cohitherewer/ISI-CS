                      Many moods of nature                    Transparent watercolour artist Shyamal Sen and upcoming painter Chhanda Singh unveil their latest creations in the ongoing exhibition, Different Strokes. Built upon the theme of the beauty of nature in all its colour and splendour, it captures aspects of nature that are often overlooked. Shyamal Sens paintings are all about light and the way he depicts it in his works. The artist leaves the white of his background surface, or tints it in various ways, providing value contrasts, setting up colour relationships and allowing colours to blend. Taken together, his brushstrokes reveal the moment, character and effect of light. Chhanda Singh has recreated the magic of colour in nature on her canvases. Her work demonstrates her depth and range of technical acumen. The most striking feature of her paintings is apparent through bright and dark oils, signifying contrasting textures and lending her creations a multi-dimensional effect.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Behala blame game
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Behala blame game

	A project meant to solve the citys waterlogging problem for good has been blamed for parts of Behala becoming marooned after a few spells of rain.        
	A senior engineer said thousands of families were wallowing in misery because those engaged in the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP) did not bother to maintain the flow of water through surface drains before laying underground sewer lines.         
	With the surface drains choked and the underground sewer lines incomplete, people have had to wait for the accumulated rainwater to evaporate naturally.         
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has ordered an inspection of the work sites at Barisha, Silpara, Rabindranagar, Subhas Pally and Sabarnapara next week. It will be a joint inspection by engineers of the drainage department and the environment project. Till that happens, I cannot say anything regarding the waterlogging situation in Behala, said project engineer Soumya Ganguly.        
	Another member of the CEIP team argued that they were not supposed to tamper with the surface drainage network before starting work on the underground sewer lines.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the civic authorities were doing their best to drain out stagnant water in the low-lying areas of Behala. The CMC (Calcutta Municipal Corporation) has so far installed 175 portable pumps in Behala to lift the accumulated rainwater and drain it out directly into Charial Khal and Moni Khal.         
	The chief engineer of drainage amp; sewerage, Tushar Ghosh, said parts of Behala would remain waterlogged for several weeks if pumps were not used to drain out the water.        
	According to a senior engineer, urbanisation of Behala began over two decades ago, but the waterlogging problem had never been so severe as it was now because the surface drains were working. The surface drainage system collapsed after the CEIP team started work last year, he said.        
	The drains along most narrow lanes were damaged during excavation. At places where the structures were intact, scooped-out earth stacked beside the road spilled into the drains and choked the flow of water.

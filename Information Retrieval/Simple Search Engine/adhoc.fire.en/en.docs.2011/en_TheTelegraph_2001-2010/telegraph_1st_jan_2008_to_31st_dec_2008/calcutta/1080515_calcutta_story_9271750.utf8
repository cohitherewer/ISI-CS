                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Arrest in police job scam
  - Driver who got job via dummy last year held for role in racket          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A police driver who joined the force last year with the help of a dummy candidate and used to work for the racket since then was arrested on Wednesday.        
	The number of arrests in the job scam has, thus, gone up to 13, including two policemen and six constables who were undergoing training.        
	A dummy candidate had appeared in place of Jahar Majumdar in the physical fitness test of last years constable recruitment examination, said police. The man from Mallikpara, in Serampore, was appointed a driver after undergoing training.        
	Our investigation revealed that Majumdar not only qualified for the job through unfair means but had also been playing a key role in the racket after joining duty. We arrested him at headquarters force in Lalbazar, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.        
	According to officers, Majumdar used to coordinate between Gopal and Bappa, the masterminds of the scam, and staff at Central Reserve Office (CRO). Majumdars arrest is likely to lead to the arrests of the guilty CRO employees.        
	Nanda Kumar Pal, an assistant sub-inspector posted at the CRO, was arrested recently in connection with the scam.        
	We came to know that Majumdar was one of Pals associates and had joined the force with his help. Gopal and Bappa decided to plant Majumdar at Lalbazar to spread the racket, said an officer working on the case.        
	The reach of the racket is yet to be estimated, according to him.

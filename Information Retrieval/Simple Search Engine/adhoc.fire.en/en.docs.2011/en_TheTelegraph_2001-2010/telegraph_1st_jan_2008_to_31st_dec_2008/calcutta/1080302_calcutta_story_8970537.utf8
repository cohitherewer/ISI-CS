	Power is wasted daily in the corridors of power. The sprawling red Writers Buildings at the heart of the city, the ultimate symbol of babudom for any Calcuttan, can easily be tagged one of the most climate insensitive buildings in the city.

	Writers Buildings is the source of thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide emission annually. And the hundreds of ministers and senior officials whose offices the building houses dont seem to care.          
	According to the state public works department, nearly 8,500 tubelights, 6,000 fans and 500 air-conditioners are used at Writers during peak summer months. The demand for electricity in the building is in the range of 1,200 to 1,500 KW per hour. The monthly bill is close to Rs 8 lakh.          
	It is common to find rows of tubelights lit in the corridors of Writers in broad daylight. Many more lights are kept switched on in the rooms during the day.           
	If the electricity consumption is converted to emission, we see about 1 tonne of carbon dioxide is released every hour due to power consumption in the building. If we consider the electricity consumption over a year, the total carbon dioxide emission may be in excess of 1,000 tonnes, says an environmental expert.           
	We know that a lot of energy is used at Writers and we are working to reduce the consumption, says S.K. Kundu, the chief engineer (electrical) in the public works department, which is responsible for the upkeep of the building.          
	According to Kundu, though steps have been taken to reduce electricity use in state government buildings like Banga Bhavan in New Delhi or New Secretariat building in the city, the roadmap for Writers is only on the drawing board. We have an energy audit committee, which will decide on the modalities of an energy audit at Writers. Once that is done, we will be able to decide on the way to cut down on electricity consumption, states an official.           
	Bringing down energy consumption at Writers is definitely possible, feels S.P. Gon Chowdhury, the director of West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Authority.          
	The power consumption at Banga Bhavan was reduced by using solar water heaters in the entire building, explains Gon Chowdhury. The solar water heaters are functioning smoothly. We have already removed geysers from most of the bathrooms at Banga Bhavan, says a PWD official.          
	Charity should begin at home and at the earliest. The building that determines the policies in the state  including those on climate change  should lead the way when it comes to reducing power consumption and emission of greenhouse gas, observed an environment expert.          
	The only constructive effort has been the use of electronic chokes in tubelights and energy-efficient lights in a handful of rooms belonging to PWD officials at Writers. This has brought down electricity use by as much as 30 per cent in these rooms.           
	A change is needed in the understanding of power use by the powers that be.

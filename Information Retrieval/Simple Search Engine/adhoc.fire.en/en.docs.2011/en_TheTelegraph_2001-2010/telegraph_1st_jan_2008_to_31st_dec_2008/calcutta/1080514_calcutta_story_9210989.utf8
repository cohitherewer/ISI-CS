	Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) is opening a number of centres for specialised research. Two such units  Kshitindranath Tagore Centre for Preservation and Studies on Manuscripts and the Centre for Studies and Research on Modern Dance  opened on the Jorasanko campus last month.        
	The executive council and the court of the university have approved our proposal to open 28 centres, said vice-chancellor Karuna Sindhu Das. Most of the courses to be offered by the new centres will be self-financed.        
	Those who will do research from the new centres will be awarded a diploma or a certificate.        
	Indian Theatre Centre is one of the new wings that will come up on the BT Road campus. The course structure and the fees are yet to be finalised, said stage personality Soumitra Basu, who will head the centre.        
	The Centre for Studies and Research on Modern Dance is being headed by an expert on Manipuri dance. The authorities are also expecting help from local practitioners and foreign dancers who occasionally visit the city on invitation from various consulates.        
	Experts from the National Mission for Manuscripts will help the centre for research and studies on manuscripts, said vice-chancellor Das.        
	Among the other centres that are in the offing are the Bankim Chandra Centre for Comparative Studies in Indian Languages and Literature, Vidyasagar Centre for Indological Studies, Centre for Women Studies, Centre for Human Rights and Human Development, Centre for Counselling and Disability, Centre for Nepal Studies, Centre for Multimedia and Animation and the School of Indian Folk Music.        
	The courses are slated to start in September, said a university official.

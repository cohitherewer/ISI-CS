                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The City Diary
                The high court on Friday allowed Bidhannagar municipality to temporarily shift the shops in BD market to BD park for expansion and renovation of the building. A division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice D. Dutta directed the municipality to acquire only what was needed to shift the stalls and to clear the grounds after the expansion was over. The bench refused to grant a stay on the shifting work as sought by some residents of the block.    Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi has expressed deep distress at the way his convocation speech at the West Bengal University of Technology has been reported.  To present this (his comments) as a negative comment on the incumbent mayor is grossly unfair to him and to the governor. The governor, who is at Santiniketan now, has also spoken to the mayor on the phone about this, the Raj Bhavan said in a statement on Friday.  hile referring to the challenges which climate change will pose to cities by 2030, the governor had said in the speech that cyclone and high-intensity rain in narrowed time-frames were expected to pose challenges by 2030 to the civic body in terms of inundation management.  Referring to Calcutta, which faces rain-associated problems regularly, the intensified situation will require the mayor at that time to be stronger than even the very strong mayor we have now, the statement said.    Film director Tapan Sinha was released from Calcutta Medical Research Institute on Friday. He was suffering from chest infection. Doctors said his temperature and blood pressure were normal.    Pradeep Saha, 45, a resident of Baishnabghata Patuli, has been missing since Wednesday. The businessmans family members have lodged a missing diary with the local police station. Police said Saha had left on Wednesday afternoon for his newly-purchased flat in Ramgarh.    Precious stones were found in a TV set at Calcutta airport on Thursday evening. A passenger had left the set at the airport two months back after arriving from Bangkok. The airport authorities wrote to the owner of the set asking him to take it away. The stones were revealed while officials did an X-ray on the set. The owner did not turn up.     Purna Das Biswas, a 57-year-old resident of Shantipur in Nadia, collapsed near Shahid Minar on Friday afternoon. He was declared dead at SSKM Hospital. Biswas, who had been suffering from malignant malaria, came from Surat.

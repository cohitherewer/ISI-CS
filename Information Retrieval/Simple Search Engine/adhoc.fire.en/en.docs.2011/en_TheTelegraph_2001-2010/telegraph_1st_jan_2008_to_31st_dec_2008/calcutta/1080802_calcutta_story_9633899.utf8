          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the civic body to demolish an unauthorised two-storeyed building constructed by a club in Garia.        
	The court also directed the police to deploy adequate personnel to assist the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in demolishing the structure built on a 102-cottah plot belonging to a family.        
	The building, constructed in 1990, was usually rented out for marriage and other ceremonies.         
	Since the plan of the building was not sanctioned by the CMC, it issued a demolition order in 2004.         
	The club members filed a case in the high court challenging the CMC order. In 2005, a trial bench dismissed the petition.        
	The club moved an appeal before a division bench of the court in 2007 against the order of the trial court. The appeal was dismissed.        
	When the civic workers, armed with the court order, went to demolish the building, they were allegedly driven away by the club members.        
	The club then moved a special leave petition before the Supreme Court demanding the quashing of the high court order. The Supreme Court did not grant a stay on the high court order.         
	The CMC, however, did not take any further step towards demolishing the building even after the Supreme Courts order. So my client Briprorshi Guha, who is one of the co-owners of the plot on which the club constructed the building, filed a case in the high court in July this year, said advocate Bilwadal Bhattacharya.        
	According to a CMC survey report, at least 50 unauthorised buildings have been constructed by clubs in the city. Most of them are rented out as ceremony houses and the club members make money out of them, said Alok Ghosh, a lawyer who represented the civic body.

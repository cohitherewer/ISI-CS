The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop curb on Holi   revelry
                                                                                                               Cop curb on Holi   revelry
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Police arrangements have been stepped up for March 21 to ensure that Holi  coinciding with Good Friday and Fateha Doaz Daham  is observed without a hitch.        
	Holi revellers stand the chance of being arrested for splashing colours from rooftops or burning the Holika on roads the night before.         
	Forty-eight hours before the celebrations, cops on Wednesday warned revellers against unruly behaviour. Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti met senior officers and discussed additional arrangements to ensure order.        
	At least 44 processions will be organised on the occasion of Fateha Doaz Daham across the city. There will be other processions as well. So, we have decided that any group trying to celebrate Holi by moving around in an open vehicle will be arrested, said Vineet Goyel, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).        
	A 6,000-strong force will be pressed into service in the city on Friday and Saturday, and almost all the processions will be escorted.         
	About 300 police pickets will be set up and mobile patrolling vans will keep watch all over the city to prevent any untoward incident.

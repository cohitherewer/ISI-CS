	They are wannabe lawyers who aspire to improve the world. Overcoming obstacles like gruelling academic schedules, lack of resourcesand even political resistance at times, a small community of students of South Calcutta Law College has been working to make the underprivileged aware of their rights in areas like Topsia and a village in Baruipur.        
	The students took the initiative to set up a legal aid society in their college on February 14 last year, with former chief justice of Sikkim High Court Moloy Sengupta as co-faculty advisor. Every law college is supposed to have a legal aid cell as part of the curriculum, but few students are actively involved in them, says Subhashis Dutta, the convenor of the society at South Calcutta Law College. Since last year, around 30 members and volunteers have been trying to provide legal assistance to those in need.         
	This year, in February, about 13 of them undertook a survey of the schools in wards 59 and 66 in Topsia. Working in association with CRY (Child Rights and You) and local organisation SAKET (Sarfaraz Ahmed Khan Educational Trust), the students have prepared a report on the lack of basic educational infrastructure in government and private schools alike in the minority-dominated and child trafficking-prone area.         
	Most of the private schools are without affiliation. Often, they are run from one dilapidated room, partitioned into two or three classrooms. There is a total absence of basic facilities. The toilets are filthy, often without separate facilities for girls and boys. Garbage dumps line the roads in front of the schools. Two or three teachers shuttle between classes. Many schools have a shop, garage or a warehouse located within the premises, adding to the pollution in the area, says Shaunak Ghosh, a member of the cell who worked on the survey.        
	Shaunak and his classmates have also conducted seminars in schools and colleges on domestic violence, sexual harassment and atrocities on women. Their first major project was holding a legal camp at Mullickpur village near Baruipur with the help of veteran legal practitioners.         
	Although we got around 18 cases  mostly related to Section 498A of IPC (matrimonial cruelty on women)  and the response from villagers was good, the local panchayat did not take our efforts kindly. They wanted us to stay clear of the cases that they had already tackled, Subhashis added.At Mullickpur railway station the students also staged a street play on human trafficking.        
	Seeking answers for the apathetic conditions in the Topsia schools, the members have sent three letters to the state education departments under the Right to Information Act. But the government officials have been quick to pass the buck, they say. But that has not demoralised these young fighters. We plan to file a PIL if the government refuses to act, says Subhashis, not willing to give up on their first major project.

	QUIZ TIME  
	As if being asked questions wasnt tough enough, the rules of this quiz required students to answer in Japanese. But to save the walk-in participant the blushes, participation was open only to students of the language.   
	The 11th Nihongo Quiz Contest took place in the auditorium of Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society on May 31. We have divided the participants into senior and junior groups  depending on whether they have completed 300 hours of classes in Japanese, said Ruma Chatterjee, a teacher of Japanese and past president of Nihongo Kaiwa Kyookai Society, the organisers of the quiz.         
	Kazuko Nigam, the chief patron of the society, explained how the organisation has translated Tagore and Hindi film songs and even stories by Tagore and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay into Japanese and staged drama in Japanese through the year. But the afternoons action would be quiz.         
	The first segment had thrown up winners in the junior segment  Nikita Baid and Soumendu Das. Nikita, a second year student of English at Bhawanipore, had landed her partner through a draw of lots before the event. She helped me a lot, Soumendu confessed. We got lucky, Nikita countered.         
	Araki Kazue meanwhile was arranging the questions she would ask the seniors. They would have to identify kabocha as pumpkin and gunjin as army, know Yasuo Fukuda to be the Prime Minister of Japan and 1964 as the year when the Tokyo Olympics were held. There would also be challenges of grammar, idiom and the Chinese characters called Kanji in Japanese script. The quiz provided them with an opportunity to learn more but they have come to enjoy themselves, smiled senior vice consul, consulate general of Japan, Akihiro Oikawa.        
	After the afternoons worth of quizzing, in which the teams failed to recognise sushi in a visual clue, allowing audience members to pick up a prize, Sangita Chanda and Koel Sur emerged the winners. The prizes were given away by Kenichi Ohshima, cultural secretary of Japanese Association.

	Whats on your mind this week  Bandh culture  
	While the rest of the country works to make up for the rise of petrol and diesel prices, West Bengal goes not for one bandh, but two. The politicians are like holiday makers, to declare a bandh for every issue. What right do they have to curtail peoples freedom of movement and bring the city to a standstill? The chief minister might flaunt that he comes to work despite a bandh, but what about the business it hampers? This is perhaps why Bengal is not preferred as a business destination. If this continues, we will never rise above the parody, what India thinks today, Bengal thinks tomorrow.

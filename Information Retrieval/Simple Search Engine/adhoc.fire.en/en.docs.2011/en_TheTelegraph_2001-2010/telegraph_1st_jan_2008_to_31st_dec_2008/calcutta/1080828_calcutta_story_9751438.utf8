                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Trains hit by new culprit
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Rajdhani Express passengers after their delayed arrival at Howrah. Picture by Bishwarup Datta		    
	Blockades at 13 rail stations held up thousands of passengers for hours and threw the schedules of Eastern and South Eastern railways haywire on Wednesday.         
	Most of the stranded passengers thought the Trinamul Congress dharna on Durgapur Expressway had been extended to the train tracks. But it was the Jharkhand Disom Party that organised the agitation to demand inclusion of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore in Jharkhand.         
	The main and chord lines of the Howrah-Burdwan and Seoraphuli-Tarakeswar sections of Eastern Railway and the Adra division of South Eastern Railway were blocked from 6am to 12.15pm.         
	According to railway officials, 43 local trains had to be cancelled in the peak hours and 15 long-distance trains headed for Calcutta were stranded. Ten long-distance trains from the city were rescheduled, said an official.         
	The Howrah and Sealdah Rajdhanis were stranded at Panagarh for more than three hours and later at Mankar station.        
	The train was stuck in the middle of nowhere and we had no clue when it would move again, said Kamala Sharma who was on the way to Calcutta for the first time on the Howrah Rajdhani. Her joint pain was aggravated by the delay. Those who turned up to receive her at the station had to cool their heels from 10am.         
	Army officer Dhheraj Modgil, who was also on the train, faced worse. My luggage was coming from Shimla. I was to pick it up at Howrah. But I could not locate the bags after reaching the station late because of the blockade. Even the vehicle that was supposed to pick me up did not turn up as I couldnt tell the driver when the train would reach Howrah, said the officer, who has been transferred to Calcutta.         
	Passengers on the other long-distance trains also suffered. I saw children crying for food and water but their parents were helpless as the train was stranded in the middle of a field, said Kaustav Bhattacharya, who was on Poorva Express. The software professional was returning to the city after a holiday in Uttaranchal.

	The body found in a Sealdah hotel on Thursday night is that of 44-year-old Tarak Ghosh. A resident of Beleghata Main Road, Ghosh changed soiled currency notes in Sisir Market, under the Sealdah flyover, for 20 years, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.        
	There were four gashes, 3.5 to 5 inches deep, around his neck, apart from six wounds on his hands and body. It seems there was a scuffle before the murder, added Shamim.        
	Ghoshs brother-in-law Debesh filed a complaint at Beleghata police station on Friday morning, stating that he had not returned after leaving home around 10.30am on Thursday. Relatives identified the body at Calcutta Police Morgue on Friday.        
	A man, who identified himself as Ripon Das, checked into the second-floor room of the hotel, in which the body was found, on the evening of May 26. He was last seen by the hotel employees walking into the room with Ghosh around Thursday afternoon. In the hotel register, Das had mentioned his address as Panchpora, Bungalow Bazar.        
	Das used to come out of his room only for meals. He said on Wednesday that he was expecting a guest, said an investigator. However, no one came to visit him that day.        
	According to the hotel employees, Das left the hotel around 10.30am on Thursday. He returned around noon with Tarak Ghosh and instructed the staff not to disturb them. No one saw him leave the hotel.

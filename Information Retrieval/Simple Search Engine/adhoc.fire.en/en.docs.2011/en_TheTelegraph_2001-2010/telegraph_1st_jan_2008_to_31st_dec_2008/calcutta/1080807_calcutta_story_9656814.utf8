          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Industry leaders are coming together to address the problem arising from lack of soft skills among engineers graduating from state colleges.        
	The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has tied up with Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) and the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) to make students more industry-ready.        
	Itll be a knowledge partnership for employability which will see industry experts provide soft skill inputs to students, said Sougat Mukherjee, the regional director (eastern region) of CII.        
	The CII is trying to form a consortium of major IT companies in the east, such as Hewlett Packard, Flakt India, Acclaris, Webel and Metalogic Systems. The firms will work with the universities to boost skills of the students.        
	Engineers in Bengal are superior at hard skills but falter when it comes to soft skills and teamwork, said Besu vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea. What the industry needs are team workers and the future engineers need to be trained according to that requirement.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A letter purportedly sent by Indian Mujahideen has warned of blasts at Sealdah station on Ashtami and Navami. The inspector-in-charge of Chakdah police station, in Nadia, received the letter on Monday. A GRP team visited the station for reviewing the security arrangements. The letter seems to be fake, but we are not taking chances, an officer said.

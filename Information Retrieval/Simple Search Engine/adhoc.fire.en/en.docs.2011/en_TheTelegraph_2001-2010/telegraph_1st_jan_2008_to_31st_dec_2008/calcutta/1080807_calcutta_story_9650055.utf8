                      A spiritual odyssey                    Drawing from extensive research, undiscovered letters, journals and memoirs, biographer Deborah Baker has woven a many-layered literary mystery from American poet Ginsbergs 1961 journey by boat from New York to Bombay. A Blue Hand: The Beats in India follows the poet and his fellow Beats companions as they travel from the ashrams of the Himalayan foothills to Delhi opium dens to the burning pyres of Benaras. They encounter an India of charlatans and saints, a country of spectacular beauty and spiritual promise and of devastating poverty and political unease. In their restless, comic and often tortured search for meaning, the Beats looked to India for answers while India looked to the West. It is a story of their search for God, for love and for peace in the shadow of the atomic bomb. It is also a story of India  its gods and its poets, its politics and its place in the American imagination. This evening, Penguin Books India hosts the launch of the book, along with a panel discussion based on it. Participants: Nabaneeta Deb Sen, Nabarun Bhattacharya, Utpal Kumar Basu and the author. Baul singer Laxman Das Baul will present a suite of baul songs on the occasion.

	Perched on the 15th floor of the New Secretariat Building near Calcuttas Dalhousie Square, a weather radar scans the skies, its tracking beam sweeping Jharkhands Chhotanagpur plateau twice every minute.         
	For radar operators this time of the year, the Chhotanagpur plateau is a zone of special interest  the origin of Norwesters, the thunderstorms that batter Bengal and eastern India year after year during April through May.         
	But today there was no sign of a Norwester.         
	Its a bit unusual, said Devendra Pradhan, director of the India Meteorological Departments radar centre in Calcutta. We havent had a thunderstorm since April 15.         
	A wind from the Bay of Bengal is bringing in moisture. A good sign, Pradhan said. Conditions are turning favourable for a thunderstorm.         
	The topography of the Chhotanagpur plateau, the summer heat, and moisture from the Bay combine to produce the Norwester. When the conditions are right, hot air rises high into the atmosphere, where a tall column of cloud  sometimes 18 to 20-km high  builds up.         
	This is the only region in the world where vertical cloud thickness reaches up to 20 km, said Pradhan. Its these systems that evolve into Norwesters.         
	Theyre more frequent than cyclones, and can cause much trouble, said Someswar Das, an Indian meteorologist now on deputation at a South Asian Regional weather centre in Dhaka. Norwesters cause houses to collapse, bring down trees, and even cause electrocution.         
	Since March this year, Pradhan and his colleagues have tracked 14 thunderstorms  seven in March and an equal number in April to date.         
	But over the past week, theres not been enough moisture flow from the Bay.         
	Moisture from the Bay would increase the chance of a Norwester. But scientists cant predict Norwesters.         
	They develop fast and decay fast  were still trying to understand the mechanisms, said a weather scientist in Pune trying to model thunderstorm behaviour.         
	But the weather radar with a range of 300 km allows scientists to track cloud and moisture build-up in the Chhotanagpur plateau  about 250-km away.         
	Once a thunderstorm begins, the radar readings allow scientists to calculate its speed and path.         
	We can predict thunderstorm movement about two or three hours in advance with accuracy, said a scientist.        
	Whether a Norwester reaches Calcutta depends on its structure.         
	Thunderstorms may emerge as single storms or appear in clusters. A multi-cell thunderstorm moves faster than a single cell storm, said Pradhan.         
	Bay wind              
	The Met office said the maximum temperature in Calcutta and the districts was unlikely to increase in the next few days, adds a staff reporter. On Friday, the maximum temperature was 35.5 degrees Celsius.        
	The southerly wind is blowing strongly from the sea and the hot wind from the west has shifted course, said G.C. Debnath, of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.

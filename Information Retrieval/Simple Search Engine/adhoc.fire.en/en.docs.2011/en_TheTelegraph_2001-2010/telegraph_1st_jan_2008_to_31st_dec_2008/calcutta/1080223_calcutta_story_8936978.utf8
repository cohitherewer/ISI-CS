                                                                                                               Art works under the hammer
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Premium works of art will go under the hammer on Saturday evening at Emami Towers, on EM Bypass.        
	The auction house, Emami Chisel Art, that is conducting the sale, has got together 85 paintings and four sculptures, some by masters of Indian contemporary art, such as Amrita Sher-Gil, Ganesh Pyne, Swaminathan, Tyeb Mehta, Souza, Ramkumar, Manjit Bawa and Rameswar Broota.        
	The total estimated value of the works on the lower side is Rs 17 crore and Rs 23 crore on the higher side.         
	Online auction began from February 16. There were 181 bids on 58 lots till 8.15am on Friday. Online bids have been received from residents of Hong Kong, the US, the UK, Italy, Mauritius, Singapore and France.        
	Ganesh Pyne  bidding on whose works has already crossed the highest estimate  said: This is a very valuable occasion. If the auction is successful, it will turn the tide in favour of Bengal. Their stress on authenticity is something new. Collectors wont have doubts about what they are putting their money on.        
	The sale room at Emami Towers is a double-storeyed affair, with plenty of glass and chrome. Only about 150 invitees will be allowed in.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dowry proof claimed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dowry proof claimed
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Smita Chakrabartty Ganguly, the daughter-in-law of theatre director Usha Ganguly, handed over some papers to police on Sunday claiming that her mother-in-law and husband Hirakendu had taken dowry.        
	Accompanied by a woman rights activist, Smita produced bank account details and other papers at Lake police station to back her claim that her father had issued a cheque for Rs 1 lakh for dowry.        
	She mentioned the cheque number and the name of the nationalised bank and the branch that purportedly issued it, said Debasish Baidya, the officer-in-charge of Lake police station.        
	Usha and Hirakendu, who works with a foreign bank, denied Smitas charges. We are seeking legal help. We wont comment now, Usha told Metro on Sunday evening.        
	On Saturday afternoon, Smita, who graduated from Presidency College with philosophy honours in 2007, lodged a complaint against Usha and Hirakendu, alleging that the duo used to torture her. I was constantly insulted by Usha Ganguly because my father was unable to fulfil her financial expectations, she had stated.        
	The complaint followed a diary lodged by Hirakendu, accusing Smita of torturing him.        
	The officers of Lake police station assured Smita of help. She wants to stay at her in-laws house on Prince Anwar Shah Road. Weve given her the contact numbers of our officers and the police station. Help will reach her within 10 minutes of her informing the police station, Baidya said.        
	The police, however, did not start any probe. Smita did not seek any lawful action against her mother-in-law and husband. She only wanted police protection, said an officer.

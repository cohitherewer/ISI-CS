The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mamata in Singur, break   for city
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mamata in Singur, break   for city
  - Traffic thin, protesters not many and spoiler rain          A STAFF REPORTER                          Traffic slow but steady during the Trinamul Congress blockade on Friday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                              
	When Mamata Banerjee is blockading Singur, Calcutta escapes a siege. At least some parts of Calcutta do.        
	During the 4-5pm blockade called by the Trinamul Congress all over Bengal, VIP Road and central Calcutta came to a standstill but not Hazra, Mamatas backyard, and some other places.        
	On VIP Road, her party supporters put up as many as six blockades with the obvious intention of stopping travellers to the airport. People headed to Howrah station or trying to enter the city from Howrah were subjected to the same torment with roadblocks on either side of the bridge.        
	Madhav Sahoo, a businessman stuck on Strand Road, said: I had to see off my niece whos leaving for Delhi by the Rajdhani. I got stuck because of the protest. Theres no way I can make it on time. Shell be on her way and I wont meet her for almost a year.        
	Down south, at Hazra, the flashpoint of many of Mamatas protests, around 50 supporters of Trinamul and its allies blocked the crossing. But only about four buses and an equal number of cars moving south to north were stuck because traffic was thin.        
	First, there was the rain through the afternoon that would have discouraged people, possibly including Trinamul supporters themselves, from coming out. Second, police were diverting vehicles away from potential blockade points. But, knowing that there would be blockade for an hour in the evening, many people had not ventured out on the roads at the time.         
	For instance, in the Reserve Bank office at Dalhousie, over 60 per cent of the staff had left by 3pm.        
	I had to leave earlier than usual because of the demonstration. I stay near Uttarpara and theres no way I can afford to get held up today. Theres a social gathering at home. Doesnt Trinamul have anything better to do? said one of the employees.        
	On the Park Circus-Bypass connector Trinamul could actually have done a lot worse. Javed Khan, the local Trinamul MLA, led a procession of about 100 supporters from the east to the west down the connector and up to the seven-point crossing.        
	There was no blockade, though traffic had to stop as the procession passed. From the seven-point crossing to the Bypass, movement was possible. But traffic was light in any case.        
	Khan said: Under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee, we will continue to campaign for the rights of the farmers who have lost their land to the Tatas.        
	In the meantime, however, students of South Point going home on a school bus were made to wait on one of the roads leading to the connector.         
	Were stuck here for 45 minutes and were hungry. Why cant they do this on Saturdays and Sundays when schools are closed? said Aditya Roy, who studies in Class VIII. Some schools such as Birla High, Abhinav Bharti and The Heritage had let the children go long before the blockade started.

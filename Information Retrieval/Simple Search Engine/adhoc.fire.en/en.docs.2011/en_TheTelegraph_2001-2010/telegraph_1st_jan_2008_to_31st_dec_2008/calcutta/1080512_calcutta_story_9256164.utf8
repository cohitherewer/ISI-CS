                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jewel thief in cop trap
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The long run of jewel thief Basant Phumra ended at Dum Dum airport on Saturday night. Plainclothesmen put handcuffs on him while he was looking for a taxi outside the domestic lounge.        
	Phumra, who escaped from Shakespeare Sarani police station last month, had travelled far but could not escape the long arm of the law. He flew to Calcutta from Delhi. We laid a trap for him after receiving a tip-off, said deputy commissioner (south division) Rajesh Subarna.        
	The 44-year-old from Behala was arrested on April 20 by officers of Shakespeare Sarani police station on the charge of stealing diamond jewellery, worth Rs 14.5 lakh, from a Camac Street shop. He was remanded in police custody.        
	At the police station, Phumra was allowed to sit outside the lock-up because of his respiratory problems. On April 22 evening, he slipped out unnoticed and walked away. Two officers of the police station were suspended and the officer-in-charge was showcaused. According to the police, Phumra had gone to Kharagpur from the city. He did not risk taking a long-distance train from Sealdah or Howrah stations. Instead, he boarded a train to Delhi from Kharagpur, added Subarna.        
	Phumra went to Brindavan and Mathura and stayed there for seven days, before returning to Delhi on Friday.         
	He booked a Spice Jet ticket for Calcutta. Our officers were monitoring his movements by tracking his cellphone. Phumra was in regular touch with his family members and it helped us track him down, said an officer.

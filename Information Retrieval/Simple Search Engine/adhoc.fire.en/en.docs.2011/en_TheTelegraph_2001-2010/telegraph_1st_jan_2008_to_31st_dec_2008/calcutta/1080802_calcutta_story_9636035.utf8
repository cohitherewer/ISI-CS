                      The secret strategy                    An entertaining and inspirational tale that sets out the fundamentals of good management, The Yellow List has been adapted from Patrick Lencionis leadership fable The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive. Rich OConnor and Vince Green, CEOs of Telegraph Partners and Greenwich Consulting, respectively, were students at the same business school before they started their consulting firms in Californias Bay area. Though both have similar business acumen, they are set apart by their value systems. Unlike Vince, Rich inspires the awe, respect and loyalty of the entire business fraternity. Vince, surprised at Richs continuing success, struggles to know the secret. When he is on the verge of giving up, Jamie Bender, an ex-employee of Richs firm, lands up in his office. He unveils to Vince the various facets of his ex-employers unique operation policies. The contents of Richs Yellow List are a real eye-opener for Vince. Instead of any shrewd strategy, it contains the four well-known principles of business management that are taught to students of all B-Schools! Script: Jhumur Ghosh. Direction: Aloknanda Roy.                    Event: Play in English, The Yellow List, presented by Future Business School When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Rabindra Sadan

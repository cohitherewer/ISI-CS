The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CBSE show disappoints
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CBSE show disappoints
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Calcutta was left bemoaning a below-par performance in the CBSE Class X examinations just a day after celebrating its ascent to the top of the Madhyamik charts.        
	Although the pass percentage increased marginally from last year, it wasnt a patch on what city schools achieved in the Higher Secondary, ICSE, ISC, CBSE Class XII and Madhyamik examinations.         
	Teachers said the number of students who aggregated above 90 per cent was low across Bengal this year, but the exact figures werent available. Low scores in the language papers, particularly Bengali and English, brought down the overall performance, they said.        
	Anindita Bose, a Kendriya Vidyalaya student from IIT Kharagpur, was the Bengal topper with 97 per cent.         
	Heads of Kendriya Vidyalayas and some private schools said they were convinced that the revised evaluation method for Bengali and English was not executed properly. The marks scored by students whose second language was Bengali indicates that the examiners did not grasp the revised marking techniques. We will request the CBSE authorities to look into it, one of the principals said.        
	The CBSE had altered the question-paper formats and evaluation methods in all the five subjects taught in Class X.         
	Salt Lake-based Bharatiya Vidya Bhavans best performer aggregated 95 per cent, 1.8 points lower than last years top score.         
	The overall performance of our school is good. The students have done well in mathematics, science and social science. The scores of a number of examinees of our institution would have been above 95 per cent had they got more marks in Bengali and English, principal Anindita Chatterjee said.         
	Ifs and buts were heard elsewhere, too. Malini Bhagat, the principal of Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, and Mukta Nain, head of Birla High School, said the Bengali scores were disappointing.        
	Rita Chatterjee, the principal of Apeejay School, was one of the few who admitted that low marking was not the only factor. Since the focus of the syllabus is on communicative English, children studying in English-medium schools do not take the subject seriously. They do not study well and, therefore, score less marks.

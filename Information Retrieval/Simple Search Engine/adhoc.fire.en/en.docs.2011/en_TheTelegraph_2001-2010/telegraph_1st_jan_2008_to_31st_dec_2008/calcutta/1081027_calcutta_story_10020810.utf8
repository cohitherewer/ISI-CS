The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Same Nano, different puja 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Same Nano, different puja 
          SUBHAJOY ROY                          Nata Mano, which will be displayed at the Pragati Sangha pandal in Rajarhat. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	More than three weeks have passed since Ratan Tata announced the decision to move the Nano factory out of Singur but Calcutta is still clutching on to the small wonder.        
	A replica of the Rs 1-lakh car has travelled 15 km  from Sealdah to Rajarhat  in this period. Nata Mano, as the replica is called, was the star attraction at the Durga puja pandal at Santosh Mitra Square near Sealdah. It will now set to draw crowds to the Kali puja pandal of Pragati Sangha at Rajarhat Niranjanpalli.        
	While Nata Mano was used at Santosh Mitra Square to call for the reopening of nearly 50,000 shut factories in the state, the Kali puja organisers are more direct. A large flex put up opposite the Pragati Sangha pandal urges youths to oppose the forces that are trying to negate the state governments industrialisation drive.        
	The theme of the puja, Hirak Rajar Deshe, also conveys the same message, claim the organisers.         
	In the Satyajit Ray film, one of the kings used to brainwash his subjects into toeing his line. In West Bengal, some people are trying to brainwash others into thinking that industrialisation is not needed, said Soubhik Maitra, the cultural secretary of Pragati Sangha.        
	Our aim is to make people aware and build public opinion for industrialisation. We hope that by worshipping the goddess, forces opposed to industrialisation can be defeated, he added.        
	Nato Mano, for which about 1,000 other puja organisers had applied for, will be displayed on a waterbody opposite the Pragati Sangha pandal. There will be announcements to attract peoples attention to the Mano, added Maitra.        
	Another big budget puja in the area, Netaji Sangha, hopes to attract attention with its artwork. The organisers have commissioned Sanjit Ghosh, the art director of Ramoji Fim City in Hyderabad, to do up their pandal.         
	Ghosh, who is making the clubs pandal for the third consecutive year, has created a fictional royal palace. The place is called Garbaibhavpur.        
	The king and other men of the royal family used to torture women. Even the idol of a goddess was lying in neglect in the house. This infuriated the deity. Not a single member of the family is living today. The entire house has been destroyed except the portion where the goddess was kept, said Ghosh.         
	Spread over 7,000 sq ft, the model of the palace looks like the set of a television serial. Jute, plaster of Paris and plywood have been used to make the Rs 7-lakh structure.        
	Inside the pandal, visitors will hear screams of women being tortured. Two idols, the goddess neglected by the family and Kali, are being worshipped simultaneously.

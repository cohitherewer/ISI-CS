          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Lakshmi Kanta Mondal, who was undergoing training to become a constable, and Tarun Bera were arrested on Sunday night in connection with the police job scam.         
	Mondal, who lives in Kanaipur in Hooghly, did not appear for the selection tests. He allegedly admitted to paying Rs 3 lakh to Gopal Das and Bappa, the two ex-cops who are behind the scam. Bera, from Pingla in Midnapore, allegedly helped the duo.        
	Mondal and Bera have been remanded in police custody till May 18, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.         
	Beras brother Barun is absconding. The brothers used to strike a deal with the candidates sent by Bappa and Das, added Shamim. Five constables had been held earlier in connection with the scam.

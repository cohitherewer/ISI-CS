The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Institutes tap alumni help
                                                                                                               Institutes tap alumni help

	IIT Kharagpur is setting up a social and professional networking site for former and current students.        
	The website, expected to be ready in three months, is part of the institutes initiative to keep in touch with its alumni. Other premier institutes, too, are exploring ways to utilise their alumni.        
	We are thinking of allowing the spouses of the alumni to become members, so that the network truly becomes a community, said Amit Patra, the dean (alumni affairs) at IIT Kharagpur.        
	It is not easy to keep track of the alumni. We will ask them to register at the website, added Patra.        
	IIM Calcutta hosts annual meetings to touch base with alumni. The institute also organises regular sessions with former students who have become industry leaders so that the current students can benefit from their experience.        
	IIM officials feel their ability to network is limited because of the lack of an exhaustive database of alumni.        
	Our alumni are a valuable asset. We try and engage them in various activities, said Anindya Sen, the dean (programme initiatives) at IIM Calcutta.        
	The Indian School of Business (ISB) in Hyderabad is also trying to foster interaction between past and present students.        
	A student at the B-school can choose an alumnus as a mentor for guidance regarding courses and career.        
	V.K. Menon, the director of the Career Advancement Centre at ISB, said the system has proved very useful.        
	Lectures by the alumni are also common at the institutes. IIT Kharagpur is offering interested alumni the post of adjunct professor, as well as organising one-off lectures by them.        
	We have started doing this informally and already have two alumni adjunct professors. Once the networking site is up, we will ask the members to state their area of interest and expertise so that we can utilise the resources better, said Patra.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Signature forged on cheques
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have stumbled upon a gang, following the arrest of a youth, that had fraudulently withdrawn Rs 60,000 from a bank account.        
	Samrat Das was arrested last Wednesday following a complaint from the Dunlop branch of ICICI Bank. We are looking for two of his accomplices, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	The police said Samrat deposited a bearer cheque for Rs 15,000, purportedly signed by Bijay Kumar Prahladka, to the Dunlop branch of the bank.        
	The cashier became suspicious on seeing the signature and called Prahladka, asking him to come over. Prahladka denied having issued the cheque and claimed that his signature had been forged.        
	A probe revealed that earlier in the day, Samrat had withdrawn Rs 60,000 from Prahladkas account by submitting forged cheques at the Sarat Bose Road and Chowringhee branches of the bank.        
	The youth spent Rs 4,000 and was carrying the rest. The money has been recovered. Six other cheques, two of them bearing the forged signature of Prahladka, were seized from Samrat.         
	The police are clueless how the gang got hold of Prahladkas cheque book.

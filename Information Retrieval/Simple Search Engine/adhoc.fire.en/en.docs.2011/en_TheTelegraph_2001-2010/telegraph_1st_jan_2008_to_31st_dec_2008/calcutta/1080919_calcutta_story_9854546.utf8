The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Writers raps 7 employees
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Writers raps 7 employees
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The disciplinary duel at Writers Buildings intensified on Thursday with the state government starting departmental proceedings against seven employees who had allegedly heckled an official on September 9.        
	The move was greeted with threats of a shutdown from defiant workers.        
	An inquiry report held seven employees responsible for breaching discipline on September 9. Four of them are from the finance department and the finance secretary will carry out departmental proceedings against them. The names of the rest have been forwarded to the chief secretary, said finance minister Asim Dasgupta.        
	This is the second time in the past week that the government has taken disciplinary action against its employees. Last week, eight were showcaused for joining a demonstration demanding a pay hike during duty hours at Writers Buildings on September 11.        
	On September 9, a group had allegedly stormed into the room of Swapan Kumar Mitra, an assistant secretary in the finance department, after word spread that a few employees of the Central Despatch Office would be showcaused for joining a sit-in on August 26, skipping work.        
	The protesters allegedly manhandled Mitra and some other officials of the finance department. The government set up a one-member panel of special secretary (finance) Bickram Sen to probe the matter.        
	The employees appeared unfazed by the disciplinary move and threatened a shutdown in the secretariat. We are spreading the protest to other state government offices as well and are heading for a complete shutdown, said Samir Majumder, the joint secretary of the West Bengal Government Employees Union (Nabaparjay).        
	On Thursday afternoon, while finance minister Dasgupta was announcing the disciplinary move, around 300 Nabaparjay members went around Writers protesting the vindictive action.        
	Later, members of 10 other organisations comprising the Mahakaran Sangram Committee announced that protests would rock Writers from now on. All seven employees against whom Dasgupta announced action are members of the committee.        
	Our protest against the governments indifferent towards the employees will continue. Our rank is swelling by the day and even members of the Left Front-backed Coordination Committee are joining our movement for a pay hike, said Moloy Mukherjee, of the Intuc-backed employees union.        
	We will decide on our course of action after going through the order notifying departmental proceedings against our seven colleagues. Taking part in protests is our basic right, said a protester.

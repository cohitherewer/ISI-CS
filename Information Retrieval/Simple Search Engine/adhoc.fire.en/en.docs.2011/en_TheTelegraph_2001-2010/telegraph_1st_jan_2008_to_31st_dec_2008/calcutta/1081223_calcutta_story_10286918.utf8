	Tears rolled down 81-year-old Monoranjan Halders cheeks on Monday morning as he was shifted from a tiny bed in the male ward of Sodepurs Panihati State General Hospital to the residence of Dipak Kundu, who adopted him.        
	Halder was admitted to the hospital in April 2007 with a shoulder injury.         
	He recovered in a few months. But abandoned by his family, he had nowhere to go. The frail octogenarian was languishing in hospital for the last year and a half.        
	Dipak is a local resident. When he heard about Halders plight, he told us he would like to take Halder home. He then approached the chief medical officer and the local sub-divisional officer, said Moloykanti Das, the hospital superintendent.        
	The authorities granted him permission but asked him to inform the local police and the hospital about Halder once every month, Das said.        
	On Monday, clad in a new dhoti, Halder was taken to Kundus home in Ghola in a car.         
	Kundus family was supportive. We are familiar with our fathers humanitarian work and are proud of him, said Sangita, 22, Kundus elder daughter. He has another daughter, Swarnali, and a son, Suvajit. We got a new grandfather, smiled Sangita as they took Halder to his room.        
	Kundus wife Tripti said, We had some money saved for a holiday and we used it to build a room for Halder.        
	But Kundu, 47, a railway employee, doesnt want to project himself as a good Samaritan. I realised that the only way to comfort Halder was to keep him in a family atmosphere. I am grateful to my wife and children for their cooperation, said Kundu, who has also donated money for the lone ambulance in the locality.         
	Halder became emotional in his new home. Ajke onek din bade nijer loker kache ghumote parbo. Khub kosto hochhilo (after many days I will be able to sleep among my own people. I was suffering a lot), he said.

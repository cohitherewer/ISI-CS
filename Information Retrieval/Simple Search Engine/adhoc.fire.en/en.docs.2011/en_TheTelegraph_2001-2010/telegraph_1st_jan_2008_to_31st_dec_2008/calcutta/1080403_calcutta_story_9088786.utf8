The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Grocer missing for 5 days
                                                                                                               Grocer missing for 5 days
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A grocer in Howrahs Domjur, who went missing on Friday, is yet to be traced.        
	Upendra Shaw, 24, cycled half a kilometre from his Piplai Notunpara home to his shop in a bazaar around 6.30am on Friday. Without opening the shop, he handed the key to Haru Sau, who runs a tailoring shop adjacent to his. Around 7.30am, Shaw left his bicycle with a mechanic for repairs and disappeared.        
	Shaws 22-year-old wife Dibya did not notice anything unusual in her husbands behaviour.        
	Sau said: Upendra generally opened the shop immediately after arriving at the bazaar in the morning. On Friday, he told me that he had to attend to some urgent work but would be back shortly.         
	Upendras elder brother Ananda said the business was not doing well for the past few years. Upendra, naturally, was tense about the state of affairs. But his disappearance is mysterious. We contacted our relatives and enquired at hospitals and railway stations.        
	We have questioned some people, said Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh on Wednesday.

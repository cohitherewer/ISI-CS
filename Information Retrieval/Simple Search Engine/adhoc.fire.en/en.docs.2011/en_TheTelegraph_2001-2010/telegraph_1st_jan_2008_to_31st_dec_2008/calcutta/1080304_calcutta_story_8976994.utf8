     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	The Met office on Monday said winter had finally bid adieu to the city as there was no indication of any immediate sharp drop in the minimum temperature.
    
	The minimum temperature has been climbing steadily over the past few days.
    
	On Monday, the minimum temperature rose to 23.6 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal.
    
	There is, however, heavy incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal as a cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) has developed over Jharkhand and adjoining Gangetic Bengal giving rise to the spectre of rain this week.
    
	Also, there is a southerly flow of wind from the sea. Under the combined effect of the two phenomena, moisture is flowing into Bengal from the sea. We expect a partly cloudy sky from tomorrow, which may lead to rain or thundershowers in the coastal districts, including Calcutta, a Met official said.
    
	The weatherman clarified that even though the minimum temperature is expected to drop a few degrees, it would not be sharp enough to bring in another cold spell.
    
	We can more or less say that we have bid goodbye to winter this season. However, if there is a thundershower, there may be a drop in minimum temperature by three or four degrees, said a Met official.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rock on, this Puja eve

	The Fine Arts Society of St Xaviers College will usher in the Puja weekend with a western music concert, in the tradition of concert hall shows, at the college auditorium at 4pm on Saturday. Primarily a platform to showcase inhouse talent, the concert will be conducted by Bertram Da Silva, the dean of Arts, St Xaviers.        
	The concert will be a first of its kind in the college. It will be an acoustic show, with a few electric guitars thrown in, said Ashwika Kapur, the secretary of the Fine Arts Society.         
	Over 120 students auditioned as vocalists, with professor Da Silva conducting the process as the president of the Fine Arts Society. Eleven singers were selected.         
	They will be backed by the official St Xaviers band, comprising Jivraj Singh of Pink Noise on the drums, Ritoban Chattopadhyay of Span on the guitar and Raul Dutta, who fronts funky alt-rockers Gravy Theory. With a set list of mostly covers, like Whiskey Lullaby by Brad Paisley, Hand In My Pocket by Alanis Morisette, Message In A Bottle by The Police and Nobody Knows Me At All by The Weepies, the show promises to touch upon a number of styles.         
	The college has a lot of talent, and this is a great way of showcasing it, said the dean of Arts.         
	Earlier this year, we had organised photography and art exhibitions. The Society has about 300 students from all the departments, explained the Societys secretary.         
	One note of disappointment though: Bertie, as the dean of Arts is better known, will not be singing in this concert. Well keep it to the students, smiled the popular professor, who has recently made a comeback as a singersongwriter.         
	He is scheduled to take the stage with his band on November 18 at the GD Birla Sabhagar.                    ARKA DAS

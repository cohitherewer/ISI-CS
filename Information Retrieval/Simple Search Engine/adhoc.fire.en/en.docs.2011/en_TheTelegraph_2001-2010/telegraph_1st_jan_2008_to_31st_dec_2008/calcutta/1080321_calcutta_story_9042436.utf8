                                                                                                               Clash, arrest amp; eviction
  - Hostels vacated after fresh round of violence at Besu          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Violence rocked the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) campus yet again with two students being arrested and the hostels vacated late on Thursday.        
	Fresh trouble erupted on the Shibpur campus after students clashed on Wednesday night in a hostel. Seven students were injured.        
	On Thursday evening, four students were injured in another round of clashes. They were taken to Howrah District Hospital even as the Rapid Action Force descended on campus to keep the peace.        
	Two students were arrested for breach of the peace on the Besu premises, recently granted the status of Institute of National Importance.        
	We have asked the students to vacate the campus. We do not want to take any responsibility in case there is further violence, said registrar Biman Bandopadhyay.        
	The students can return on Sunday evening as the mid-term exams start the day after, said an official.        
	Under the supervision of Howrah superintendent of police (SP) Niraj Singh, arrangements were made to wheel hostel inmates away.        
	Late on Wednesday, second-year students fought with third-year seniors with brickbats and sticks in front of the Wolfenden Hostel following an altercation.        
	Registrar Bandopadhyay rushed to the troublespot along with students-in-charge Anjan Ghosh. But they failed to restore order and so the police had to be called in.        
	Vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea was alerted and he arrived on campus at 3am. By then the warring students had been separated and the injured given first aid. Two students who sustained head injuries were later taken to SSKM Hospital.        
	Last nights violence was a students clash. There was no political issue involved, said Bandopadhyay.         
	SP Niraj Singh later said: A few students were drunk and they got involved in a brawl, but we have not received any complaint from the university authorities. We have initiated a suo motu case against a number of students. We have started investigations and will interrogate the seven injured students.         
	The tension on campus triggered a second round of violence despite police presence.        
	The registrar said the university was thinking of increasing security by employing private agencies. The police will remain on campus till April 1, the end of mid-term exams.

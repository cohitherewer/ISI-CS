                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Heat push for power demand

	The hot spell sweeping the city will continue on Saturday, Met officials said.        
	The weather-induced discomfort on Friday was compounded by prolonged power cuts in various parts of the city. The shortfall in the CESC-served areas shot up to 160 MW in the evening.        
	Met officials said the maximum temperature did not rise much since Thursday but the humidity level was high. The maximum humidity on Friday was 91 per cent.        
	The maximum temperature on Saturday is likely to be 38 degrees. On Friday, it was 36.6 degrees, said G.C. Debnath, of Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore. The maximum temperature is rising across central India and it could have an impact on Bengal.        
	The demand for power in the city during the day touched 1,400 MW. The state power distribution company had supplied about 492 MW to the CESC grid on Thursday. But, today, the supply came down to 334 MW because of increased demand and the shutdown of a unit in Santaldih for repairs, said an official.

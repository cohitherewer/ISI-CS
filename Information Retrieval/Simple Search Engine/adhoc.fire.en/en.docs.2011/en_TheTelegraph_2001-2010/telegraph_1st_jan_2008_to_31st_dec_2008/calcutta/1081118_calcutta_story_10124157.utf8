The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bruised Bond takes a Bolly beating
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bruised Bond takes a Bolly beating
  - Dostana dominates the box office as quantum of solace eludes secret agent          PRATIM D. GUPTA                        John Abraham in Dostana            Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace                                       
	Dare-bare Bollywood has beaten a broken-hearted Bond. At least at the city box office.        
	John Abrahams body beautiful, flaunted true-blue Casino Royale style, has taken the pants off Daniel Craigs Quantum of Solace. The start has been good... hope it continues to do well... fingers crossed, a tense Karan Johar told Metro from Mumbai after Dostanas first weekend.        
	The much-hyped Bollywood release arrived last Friday with 64 multiplex shows daily and almost blew away all other films. James Bond bore the brunt with the daily multiplex count of Quantum of Solace sliding from 43 to 21 shows.        
	The audiences havent dismissed Quantum of Solace, but they have certainly come looking for the 007 touch and left disappointed. Its just another action film with a thin plot, not really a Bond movie, and so there is no hope of repeat audience or word-of-mouth buzz, said a trade analyst.        
	Dostana on the other hand is playing the curiosity-cum-comedy card well. The movie got off to a flying start and hasnt stopped soaring, not just for the Karan Johar brand name but also because of its theme (John and Abhishek Bachchan pretend to be gay), said Vikas Syal, the general manager of INOX (Forum), where nine of the 10 shows on Sunday went house-full.        
	The Dostana party is also on in full swing at Fame (South City) where the 19 daily shows have raked in an average of 70 per cent occupancy over the weekend with the Sunday footfall one of the best ever for the eight-month-old Prince Anwar Shah Road property. We had 17 shows for Karzzzz but we had to bring it down drastically in the second week. With Dostana, we plan to keep as many of the 19 shows as possible, was the word from Fame (South City).        
	That would be a tough task given the size of Subhash Ghais Yuvvraaj, coming this Friday. We have to take off all the other movies, revealed Syal from the Elgin Road plex. That means another body blow awaits Bond this weekend.        
	When Casino Royale had come to Calcutta in November 2006, it had ridden out the Dhoom:2 storm but this time Bollywood has denied Bond even a quantum of solace.

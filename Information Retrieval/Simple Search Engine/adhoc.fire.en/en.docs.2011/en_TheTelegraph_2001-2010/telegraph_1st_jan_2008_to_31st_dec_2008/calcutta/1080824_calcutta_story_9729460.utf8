The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A life less ordinary 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A life less ordinary 
										      Book bazaar                        Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi at the launch of Krishna Boses memoirs An Outsider in Politics 				                           
	The very first day of the week marred by sporadic showers and a procession at Esplanade couldnt stop the citys literati from attending the high profile launch of Krishna Boses memoirs An Outsider in Politics published by Penguin at the Grand banquet hall on August 18.         
	There was no dearth of VIPs on the guest list, all of who wanted to be beside Krishnadi in her moment of glory. The evening soon turned into a congregation of the citys cerebral celebs.         
	There was Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi along with Visva Bharati vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray on the dais. Uma Dasgupta came in quietly to take a seat. Mamata Shankar, with her mother Amala, greeted Krishna Bose with a pranaam. Trinamul MLA Saugata Ray joined former mayor Subrata Mukherjee at his table when the current mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, looking dapper in a black kurta, ambled over for a courteous hello.         
	Bharati Ray, author, academician and politician, done up in a Gadwal and trademark danglers, was calling out loudly to all and sundry. Appropriately for the evening, there was German consul-general Gunter Wehrmann with Simon Wilson, the British deputy high commissioner, as witness to Subhash Chandra Boses daughter-in-laws book launch.         
	Why would the launch of a history/politics book be sponsored by CII went unanswered. But it did allow Sandipan Chakraborty, the MD of Tata Ryerson, who, one presumes, has little to do with history or politics, to preside over a largely academic evening (he happens to be the CII chairman, eastern region).         
	Gandhi introduced the book, saying it dwelt largely on Krishna Boses public life and those public figures who were eager to find out what she wrote about them, would have to actually read the whole book to find themselves, for it lacked an index. Rajat Ray commented on how the Gandhi and Bose families came together on the occasion, burying the hatchet, so to say.        
	The memoirs, he said, spanned six decades in which parliamentary democracy succeeded in India while it failed time and again in the neighbourhood.         
	In this rather erudite and invigorating evening, conspicuously absent was Mamata Banerjee, who had given Krishna Bose a political life by offering her the Jadavpur seat to fight the Lok Sabha elections. Bose recalled her through anecdotes. But Mamata was perhaps too busy gearing up for the Nano showdown.        
	P.S.         
	In Delhi, the UK-based Women in Publishing (WiP), a group that promotes women publishers and employees in the industry through interactive meets, grants and other events, opened its India chapter last week.         
	Zubaan Books has been instrumental in bringing them to India and was working on it for a year. So it was celebration time at Agni in Park last Sunday as the stalwarts of Indian women publishing came together. Alcohol, music and merriment followed with the doyens of Indian women publishing, Urvashi Bhutalia, Ritu Menon and Indu Chandrasekhar, burning the Agni dance floor to Mallika Sherawat numbers. Real woman power, this?

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A pickpocket being chased by a mob was mowed down by an unidentified vehicle on the Park Circus-Bypass connector late on Tuesday.        
	The body of Sheikh Raju, with injuries on the chest and left hand, was found on the pavement of Bridge No. 4. He was taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	Witnesses who live in a nearby shanty told police that Raju was caught while picking a pocket on a bus. Surrounded by the commuters, he took out a blade and slashed his chest and hand.        
	The commuters were taken aback and Raju, taking advantage of the situation, fled. While being chased by the commuters, he was run over by an unidentified vehicle, said an officer of Karaya police station.        
	Police records revealed that Raju had been arrested several times for picking pockets.

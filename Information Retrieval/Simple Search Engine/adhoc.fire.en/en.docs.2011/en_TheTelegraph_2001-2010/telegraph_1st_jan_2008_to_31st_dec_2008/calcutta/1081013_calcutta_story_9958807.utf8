                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Woman falls to death from eighth-floor flat

	A 50-year-old woman died after falling from the balcony of her eighth-floor flat in Chetla on Sunday afternoon.        
	Gayatri Sarkar was hanging clothes out to dry on a nylon rope, leaning against the railing fitted with a wooden armrest on top.        
	The armrest suddenly gave way and the woman toppled over after losing SP her balance. She was rushed to SSKM Hospital where doctors declared her dead on arrival, said an officer of Chetla police station.        
	It seems to be an accident. There was no hint of foul play. The woman suffered serious head injuries. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said Shyamal Sengupta, the officer-in-charge of Chetla police station.        
	Pradip Mondal, a guard in the housing estate, was the first to rush to the spot after hearing a loud thud. I came to work around 1.40pm, a little earlier than usual. I ran to the spot after hearing the sound and was shocked to see her lying there bleeding.        
	Gayatri, a divorcee, lived in the Chetla Co-operative Housing Society flat on Gobindo Auddy Road with her businessman father Biswanath Chakraborty.        
	Gayatris father, her daughter Gitanjali and nine-month-old grandson, her younger sister Jayati Bhowmick and her two children were in the flat when the mishap occurred.        
	Gitanjali lives in Mumbai and Jayati in Siliguri. They had come to Calcutta with their children for Puja.        
	The police questioned Chakraborty, who has been living in the flat for the past 28 years, and Gitanjali.        
	Her father told us that they ate lunch together. He then went to bed and Gayatri stepped out to hang clothes on the balcony, said an officer.        
	Its unbelievable. She was so cheerful. We celebrated pujas together, said Ena Chowdhury, a resident of the estate.

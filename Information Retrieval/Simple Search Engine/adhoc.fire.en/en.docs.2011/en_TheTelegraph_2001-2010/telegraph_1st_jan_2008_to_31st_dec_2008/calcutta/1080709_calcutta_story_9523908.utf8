                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Man mowed down by bus

	A middle-aged man who was trying to cross a road in central Calcutta was mowed down by a private bus that was racing another on Tuesday afternoon. The victim, yet to be identified, was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	The vehicle was impounded and taken to Muchipara police station but the driver and conductor fled the spot, right in front of Surendranath College on Mahatma Gandhi Road.        
	A traffic snarl followed as people tried to ransack the bus. The mob was stopped by sergeants and other police officers who rushed to the spot.         
	A search is on for the driver of the bus that plies on route 28, said an officer of Muchipara police station.         
	Eyewitnesses said the man, aged about 45, was trying to cross the road when he was knocked down by the bus and then crushed by the rear wheels. He didnt get time to react, said Arup Roy, who had escorted his daughter to Surendranath College for her undergraduate examination.         
	Some witnesses said the killer bus was behind another bus and lost control while trying to overtake it from left.        
	A bus suddenly came to a halt in front of Surendranath College, blocking a part of the road. The route 28 bus came rushing from behind and swerved to the left in an attempt to get past through a narrow gap between the other bus and the sidewalk. It was then that the driver lost control and knocked down the man, said Vineet Baidya, who runs a roadside tea stall.         
	Residents complained that vehicles often drove recklessly on the stretch as no policemen were deployed there.         
	Traffic management should be much more strict here, with so many educational institutions around, said a protester.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two cyber cafe owners were arrested in Ripon Lane and Eliot Road on Sunday for violating the police commissioners directive on maintaining a record of the users.         
	They were arrested under Section 188 of the IPC (violation of a government order). If they fail to maintain the records again, we will ask civic officials to cancel their trade licence, said a senior officer of Park Street police station.        
	Police have asked all cyber cafe owners across the city to maintain a register of the users and instal closed-circuit cameras. Work is on to upgrade the server at Lalbazar to assess the data from any cafe, an officer added.

                              An event at Seagull Bookstore                            
	When foreign publishing houses like Random House, Routledge, Hatchettes, Simon Schuster are discovering the Great Indian Market and setting up shop in India, one Indian publisher is doing exactly the reverse.         
	Seagull Books, Calcutta, which began in 1982 as a niche publisher of works in drama, the new Indian cinema, culture studies and fine arts now has a global presence as Seagull Books: London, New York, Calcutta.         
	Shrugging off their third world tag, Seagull Books have set up shop in London and New York and are publishing an amazing array of international books by authors like Edward Said, Richard Gott, Jean Paul Sartre, Guillaume Apollinaire, Tariq Ali, Pablo Picasso, Antonin Artaud, Guy Debord, Gayatri Spivak, Judith Butler, Hans Marcus Enzensberger, Paul Celan and many others.         
	Many of these are out of print or are being translated for the first time like the Apollinaires Letters to Madeleine or African artist and activist Aime Cesaires A Season in Congo.         
	Seagull is even buying rights of titles from Indian publishers like Permanent Black for the global market. Traditionally, Indian publishers sold foreign rights of their books to foreign publishers. A very small part of their list were showcased abroad in this manner because the number of such tie-ups were limited.         
	Now Seagull London buys rights to a lot of Indian books for the UK and the US markets in a regular and systematic manner thereby offering a mutually beneficial service to specialist Indian publishers. This way more Indian books get a chance to be seen in bookstores across the world.         
	At the same time when Seagull Londons books are imported to India, the books are highly subsidised thus making them accessible to more number of buyers, said Naveen Kishore.         
	For 25 years we were persistently defeated by the paucity of distributors abroad who were unwilling to take a risk with specialist Indian books. But then we decided to change tactics and try and meet them at par. Our books today are being distributed by Berg Publishers in UK and Europe and Palgrave Macmillan in the USA, said editor Sunandini Banerjee, who has designed a special catalogue that looks like a tabloid complete with fake advertisements of Seagull soaps and inks.         
	The catalogue is really a presentation of our areas of interest. The designs created at 26, Circus Avenue are emailed to various printing presses in India, London or wherever we need our stocks. You can say it is the best of globalisation, smiled Naveen Kishore.

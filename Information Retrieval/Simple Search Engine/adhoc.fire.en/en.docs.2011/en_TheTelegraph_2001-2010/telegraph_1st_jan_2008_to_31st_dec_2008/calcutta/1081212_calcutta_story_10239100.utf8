          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Educational institutions run by minority groups have formed an organisation to fight government policies that they claim are hampering their functioning.        
	The West Bengal Association of Minorities Educational Institutions is the first of its kind in the state and will fight the discriminatory policies of the government, said Herod Mullick, the general secretary of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba and a member of the association.        
	The association members will meet school education minister Partha Dey next week and submit a charter of demands. We will intensify our movement if the demands are not looked into, said Abdur Rauf, the working president of the association.        
	More than 2,500 schools run by Christians, Sikhs, Muslims, Buddhists and other communities have joined the association.        
	Various minority groups have long been protesting the faulty policies, such as granting the minority status certificate only for three years, Mullick said. The other sore point is the delay in issuing a no-objection certificate for switching affiliations.        
	An association member said a number of non-madarsa schools run by Muslim groups could not get help from a funding agency as the state government did not grant them the minority status.        
	Maulana Azad Foundation, a national-level funding body, had shortlisted some non-madarsa schools run by Muslims for extending help.        
	But since the government denied the minority status to these schools, they could not avail themselves of the aid, said a member.        
	The attempt by the three Khalsa High schools, run by a Sikh welfare organisation, to move from the state education board to the Delhi-based Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has run into procedural hurdles.        
	The 4,000-odd students in the three schools have long been demanding CBSE affiliation.         
	Over the past two years, the schools have been writing to the government but there is no progress yet, said a source.        
	We want to set up more schools in localities where the Sikh population is high but the complicated procedure is standing in the way, said Jagmohan Singh Gill, a member of Central Gurdwara Committee (West Bengal).

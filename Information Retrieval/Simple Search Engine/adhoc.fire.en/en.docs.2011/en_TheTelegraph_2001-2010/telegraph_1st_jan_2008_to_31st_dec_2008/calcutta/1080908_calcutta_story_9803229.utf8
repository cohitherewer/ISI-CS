                      Philosophy of modern art                    Contemporary art in India has no benchmark exhibition similar to or resembling those in the West; the Biennials, Documenta and Project Muenster, to name a few. The annual exhibition, Concepts amp; Ideas, is a step towards creating and evolving a benchmark event, which also coincides with the launch of the cultural season. Started in 2004, this annual show has established itself as a significant series in the world of art and artists. As in previous years, Concepts amp; Ideas 2008 features the works of a select few who have been invited to participate in this prestigious event. As suggested by its intriguing title, it embodies a search for situations and events within the precincts of common, sanctioned practices, that demand second thought and reinterpretation, often with astonishing results. The show is, however, not driven by ideologies and isms, but by intellect and thought. It does not abandon clarity of expression in any way. Rather, it encourages a perception that art, even conceptual art, belongs to everybody and is not exclusive to postmodernists. Participants: Sanjeev Sonpimpare, Rm. Palaniappan, Avishek Sen, Kingshuk Sarkar and Kabir Mohanty.

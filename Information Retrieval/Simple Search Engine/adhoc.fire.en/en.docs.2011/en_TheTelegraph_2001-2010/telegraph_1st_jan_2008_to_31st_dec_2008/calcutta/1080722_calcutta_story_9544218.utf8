The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A journey through craters
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A journey through craters
                                        
	Around 20 students of Shri Shikshayatan had a close shave recently when their school bus slid down a slope beside Lorry Road, in Entally, and the students were trapped inside. The left rear wheel got stuck in slush and sank deep, causing the bus to tilt dangerously. Metro checks a few other streets that are in as precarious a condition as Lorry Road.        
	Old Galiff Street        
	Four craters, each a foot deep and with a diameter of at least 14 ft, line the 1.3-km stretch from BT Road to RG Kar Road. With the entire left side of the road being taken over by encroachers, motorists have no option but to drive through potholes.        
	A large number of private buses, cars, school buses and lorries ply on the road daily. Twice our bus had overturned after the wheels got stuck in the craters, said Soumen Dutta, a conductor of a bus on route 91, which has its stand at the end of the road.        
	Local youths have chipped in to make a fast buck from such mishaps  they help drivers pull out their vehicles from the pits against money.        
	The situation turned worse after residents blocked Ballav Street. We had to shut the road as trucks and buses used to make a detour through Ballav Street to avoid the cratered thoroughfare, said Ananda Ghosh, a resident. We hope the authorities will wake up to the problem and take steps to repair the road.        
	The residents alleged that civic officials often visit the stretch and make notes but there has been no attempt to start repairs. I cannot recall when Old Galiff was last attended to, said Navin Shaw, who runs a tyre shop on the stretch.        
	Officialspeak: Talks are on with Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) officials for reconstruction of the stretch. Hopefully, things will be finalised in a month or two, said Pundarikaksha Roy, an executive engineer (canals) of the irrigation department.              
	Tiljala Road        
	The thoroughfare along the right side of Park Circus No. 4 bridge (on the western slope) starts with a big pothole. Vehicles often fall in the pit. The rain has worsened the situation, said Ananda Maiti, a taxi driver.        
	The stretch, till the Bondel gate flyover, is lined with a number of craters and open culverts, manholes and drains. Besides, there are pockets of slush, thanks to the drainage revamp work, making driving down the stretch risky. Vehicles often skid and fall into the open drains, said Mohammed Hossain, a resident.        
	The road falls on the routes of a number of minibuses, school buses, cars and taxis.        
	Officialspeak: The stretch will be restored once the drainage revamp work, under Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, is over, said a senior civic engineer.              
	James Long Sarani        
	Popularly known as Behala bypass, the 6-km artery is mostly unmotorable because of a series of potholes often filled with slush and stretches dug up during the drainage revamp work. Among the most risky spots on the road are 29 Pally crossing, Roy Bahadur Road-James Long Sarani intersection, Chowrasta crossing and the ones in front of National Gems Higher Secondary School and the State Bank of India branch.        
	Once I had a close shave near the Roy Bahadur Road crossing when my car tripped after hitting a pothole. The car was packed with students at that time, said Rabi Mullick, who drives a pool car.        
	The students of six other schools  Orient Day School, MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School, Behala Girls School, Barisha High School, Gurukul Vidyamandir and Vivekananda Mission School (Joka)  use the stretch regularly.        
	The situation could have been slightly better had there been a divider from Taratala till the Chowrasta crossing.        
	Officialspeak: We will inspect the stretch. If needed, we will certainly try and start repairs after monsoon, said a PWD official.

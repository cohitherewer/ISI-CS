	The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has sanctioned Rs 1 crore to Calcutta University (CU) for space research.        
	As part of a scheme to strengthen space research in the country, Isro has decided to provide funds to five universities in the country. CU has been selected as one of the universities, said Tapan Mukherjee, the CU pro vice-chancellor (finance).        
	The radio physics department of CU will take up the research projects.        
	Nine institutes were shortlisted by Isro for the grant. Five institutes were selected after a final screening in Bangalore in May. The institutes that made the cut include the University of Pune, University of Hyderabad and Benaras Hindu University.        
	Four Isro-sponsored projects are in progress at CU. The quantum of grant varies between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 65 lakh. The new grant will enable advanced space research, said a teacher of the department. The first instalment of Rs 5 lakh has been released.        
	The new projects will soon be underway, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das. The decision to start work was approved by the university syndicate last Tuesday. There is no deadline for the projects.        
	Five teaching posts will be created under the programme. Isro will pay the salaries for five years.We will urge Isro to provide funds for continuing the posts after five years. But we may also have to approach the state government, said a university official.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Singapore-based company made a presentation on a 43-km elevated road around the city at Writers Buildings on Tuesday. The proposed ring road will start and end on Strand Road.         
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, finance minister Asim Dasgupta and senior officials watched the presentation.         
	The company gave us a clear idea about its plans, said Chakraborty.        
	The Singapore firm and five other companies are conducting a feasibility study of the proposed road.        
	The government decided on Tuesday that the companies would have to submit the detailed project report by May 26.        
	We will float the tender after going through the project reports, said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury.        
	Sources in the transport department said the project was likely to be executed in two phases. The cost has been estimated at Rs 4,000 crore.

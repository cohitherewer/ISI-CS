The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Leaking roofs in govt quarters
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Leaking roofs in govt quarters

	The Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) quarters in south Calcutta, built to accommodate families that were displaced during the construction of Tollygunge Metro station, are disasters waiting to happen. Metro visited two such quarters to highlight the problems.              
	Where: 50 Prince Anwar Shah Road, opposite Dhaka Kali Bari        
	Situation: Damaged roof, broken beams, water leaks from damaged tanks are common problems faced by the 100-odd families that live in this address. The ceilings of all the rooms are damaged. A few months back, the ceiling fan in our room fell and my husband escaped with minor injuries. We couldnt afford to wait any longer and were forced to do some repairs on our own, said Sipra Das, a resident of the building for 22 years.         
	The problems are similar in all the seven buildings that make up the housing complex. During monsoon, water seeps in through the roof. When it rains heavily, our room gets flooded. Often, we have to shift to our neighbours flat, said Asha Das, who has been living in the quarters since they were built.        
	The residents complained that the CIT had stopped providing basic facilities. It was built in the early 80s, to rehabilitate those evicted from the site where the Tollygunge Metro station now stands. We had an agreement with the CIT that said that we had to pay them Rs 42,200 in 60 years. They were supposed to hand over the owners deeds of the flats to us as and when we paid the full amount. But during the early 90s, they doubled the price. We refused to pay that amount and CIT stopped providing all facilities, said Ashis Gupta, the secretary of the flat-owners association. From then on the residents had to arrange their basic amenities themselves.               
	Where: 247 Deshapran Sashmal Road, near MR Bangur Hospital.         
	What we saw: Like the Anwar Shah Road address, this apartment was also built to rehabilitate those evicted during the continuation of work of Tollygunge Metro station and widening of Deshapran Sashmal Road.         
	No repairs have been undertaken. The damaged sunbeams and ceiling are a problem for all the 200 families residing here, said Avijit Das, assistant secretary of Tollygunge CIT Abasik Samiti.         
	There are two pumps in our apartment. One of them does not work ever while the other works but with a capacity that is not enough to provide water to all the families. When this pump stops working, all the families face severe water crisis, he added.         
	Most pipelines are damaged and have not been repaired. As a result, there is slush on every floor, said Samir Pal, the secretary of the samiti.         
	The tenants have to pay CIT Rs 30 each month for maintenance. This amount is very little and the CIT wants to hand over the ownership to the tenants but many do not agree as there are families here who cannot afford maintenance work on their own, admitted Das.               
	MLAspeak: The temporary facilities of conservancy and water at 50 Prince Anwar Shah Road are provided by the municipal authority. Being the borough chairman, I cant do anything more. I have written three letters to the municipal affairs minister requesting him to immediately undertake repair work. Portions of the building are in a very dangerous condition and a major accident may occur anytime, said Aroop Biswas, the Trinamul MLA from Tollygunge and chairman of borough 10.               
	Ministerspeak: The amount charged as monthly rent from the residents of CIT quarters is very little, between Rs 30 and 40 each month. It is very tough to undertake regular maintenance work with that money. Even then we carry out repairs. If any building is in a dangerous situation they should immediately inform the CIT authorities. We will take appropriate steps. But it is our policy to hand over ownership to the tenants if 70 per cent of the residents agree with this decision. We offer them flats at a price of around Rs 35,000. What more can we offer? Moreover, those who were original allotees have left, said Ashok Bhattacharya, urban development and municipal affairs minister. The CIT falls under his department.

	Thirteen months after an explosion at McDonalds killed a pedestrian on Park Street, a court prod has finally prompted the company to cough up compensation and inch closer to reopening the address.        
	McDonalds India on Tuesday paid Rs 10 lakh to the family of Aftab Hussain Ansari, the 24-year-old who died in the impact of the blast on the morning of August 12.        
	The family of six lives in a small room at Queens Mansion, across the road from the McDonalds outlet.        
	The belated move from the fast-food giant comes three weeks after Calcutta High Court restrained the franchisee owner of Park Street McDonalds from continuing renovation of the premises till September 12.        
	The court was responding to a petition filed by Aftabs father Mohammad Alauddin. The family was given a compensation of Rs 10 lakh and they will not proceed with the case, said their lawyer R.K. Khanna.        
	Our point of fighting till the end was that no one from McDonalds had bothered to even pay us a visit or speak to us after my sons death. Today was the first time someone from McDonalds offered condolences. I wont get my son back but I hold no grudge against anyone, said Mohammad Alauddin.        
	We look at it as the money that could have been earned by Aftab, he added.        
	Aftabs father, his mother Rauzana Khatoon and his elder brother Afzal received the compensation in the presence of Justice Dipankar Dutta and representatives of McDonalds India.        
	This should have happened long ago, said Afzal, who made at least 10 trips to Bankshal Court and six visits to the high court.        
	A statement issued on behalf of McDonalds India (North and East) said: We have... addressed the legitimate needs of the family.... (and) we reiterate our faith... in the efforts of the administration to resolve this case.

	One person died and five were critically injured in four accidents on Sunday.        
	A 25-year-old motorcyclist, Rajen Singh, died on Sunday evening after being knocked down by a truck near Kidderpore Bridge. Officers of Hastings police station took him to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	A 36-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman were critically injured when the Honda Accord they were travelling in collided with a truck on EM Bypass around 3.10am.        
	Manoj Gupta, who was driving the car, fractured his left hand and leg and Poulami Mukherjee her both legs. They also suffered serious head and chest injuries. Poulami was sitting beside Manoj.        
	Police said the two were heading towards a Bypass hotel from Park Street. Manoj was drunk and driving at a high speed. The car rammed through the divider and hit the wrong flank before colliding with a truck. The car was smashed and got stuck under the truck, said an officer of Topsia police station.        
	The two were trapped for over two hours, as cops, armed with gas cutters, tried in vain to rescue them. Fire-fighters finally brought them out around 5.40pm.        
	Manoj, a resident of Alipore, owned a multi-gym near his house where Poulami, who lives in Behala, works. Both were admitted to nursing homes in south Calcutta.        
	In yet another mishap, a speeding Tata 407 rammed into the road divider, uprooting part of it, and knocked down two pedestrians in front of Behala police station around 7.30am.        
	The injured  11-year-old Sananda Sinha and and her uncle, 42-year-old Shyamal Sinha  are being treated at CMRIs intensive care unit.        
	A hospital official said Sanandas condition was critical. She underwent a surgery to remove a blood clot from her skull and is now on ventilator. A CT scan will be done tomorrow, the official said.         
	The two had to be pulled out from under the wheels, said Aloke Mullick, one of the first to reach the spot. The driver, who was allegedly drunk, has been arrested and charged with rash driving.        
	A 40-year-old woman was run over by a Matador on the EM Bypass, near Chingrihata. She was admitted to NRS Hospital with head injuries.

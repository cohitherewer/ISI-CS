	Are you as cool as a cucumber, following every rule or one who does what he pleases? Or are you the red hot chilly pepper, expressing all your feelings with gusto? What do you do if your friends are in trouble during a simple game like passing the ball? Do you offer them a helping hand or just laugh and sit back without concern?         
	These were some of the questions faced by the 26 participants at Seagulls annual Peace Works workshops held from June 27-29 at Thema on Satish Mukherjee Road.        
	Conducting workshops is one of the activities undertaken by Peace Works, an initiative of Seagull Foundation for the Arts to enhance peace, strengthen values of mutual coexistence and respect all communities.         
	The workshops centre around diverse issues like print media, film and theatre. Well-known personalities like Anand Patwardhan, Jayant Kripalani, Tom Lai, Radharani Ray, and Sumit Roy have helped conduct earlier sessions in schools and non-formal organisations.         
	This years workshop was an intensive three-day cooperative gaming session for those above 16 years, conducted by Pune-based couple Agyatmitra and Swati Bhatt. They are the founder members of global organisation Peace, Leadership And Young-people (PLAY) which has, since the last decade, helped people bond well with all communities.         
	Agyatmitra and Swati have also worked in conflict-prone areas of Hyderabad, Gujarat and Israel with teachers, children and relief-camp workers.         
	The games initiated by them have helped participants lose their inhibitions and rediscover the pleasures of caring, making them peacemakers in their own way.        
	The games were non-competitive in nature. Most were drawn from a growing international game bank that helps the youth deal with problems ranging from drug addiction to enhancing corporate skills. The final day saw a public interaction session where two music videos on peace by Anand Patwardhan were screened.

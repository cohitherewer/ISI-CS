The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State lends might to consumer rights
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       State lends might to consumer rights
          SANJAY MANDAL                                        
	The state government has taken up the cudgels on behalf of the consumer against big companies and banks.        
	The department of consumer affairs and fair business practice, as part of a drive, has been filing cases at the state consumer disputes redressal commission and similar forums in the districts against organisations prima facie guilty of violating consumer rights.        
	In one such case, the state panel has ordered textile major Raymonds to pay a token fine of Rs 10,000 for suppressing information from the public.        
	More cases are in the pipeline. The government has taken the move to ensure that consumers are not taken for a ride, said P.K. Agarwal, the principal secretary of the consumer affairs and unfair trade practices department.        
	The department is also planning to sue a soft drink company and a public sector bank.        
	The soft drink company had offered attractive gifts to consumers to promote its products. We had asked the company to submit its audit report so we could verify how many consumers had received the gifts. But it has failed to provide the papers. We are preparing to file a case against the company, said Agarwal.        
	The charge against the bank is that its credit card unit has been sending inflated bills to users.        
	A 2002 amendment to the Consumers Protection Act, 1986, had empowered the state government to represent consumers, said an official in the consumer affairs department. The amendment came into force on March 15, 2003.        
	The case against Raymonds was first filed at Calcutta District Forum (Unit I) which dismissed the petition. The consumer affairs department appealed to the state commission in March 2008 and the order imposing the fine on the company was issued on December 12.        
	The Raymonds shop on Park Street had published an advertisement in 2004, offering up to 40 per cent discount on garments. The advertisement did not state any reason for the discount, said Prabir Basu, the lawyer for the consumer affairs department. During the trial, the company disclosed that the discount was offered as the stocks were old. The consumers were obviously misled, he said.        
	...the advertisement only spoke of reduction of up to 40 per cent of the prices... there is no disclosure that the reduction depended on the age of the product and that there was no offer on fresh products, Justice Aloke Chakraborty, of the state panel, said while passing the order against Raymonds.        
	We may appeal to the national commission once we get a copy of the order, said a lawyer for Raymonds.

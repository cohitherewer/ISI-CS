	Torches and emergency lights were used to complete surgeries at RG Kar Hospital during an hour-long power disruption on Friday. Four surgeries had to be cancelled.         
	The hospital has two power lines. The supply could have been restored earlier if the key to the room where the switch to the other line is located could be found.         
	A feeder supplying power to the hospital tripped around 11.40am, causing disruption in three blocks  gynaecology, academics and casualty. Several surgeries were taking place then, said hospital officials.        
	The surgeries that were in progress were completed with the help of torches and emergency lights. The surgeries scheduled later had to be put off, said Utpal Dutta, the principal of RG Kar College.         
	Caesarean deliveries had to be cancelled because of the power disruption. Child delivery is often an emergency. Thankfully, there were no emergency deliveries today, said a hospital official.        
	CESC officials said workmen from the Shyambazar district office rushed to the spot after the feeder tripped. However, they could not enter the switch room as the key could not be found, said a CESC spokesperson. After waiting for nearly an hour, they entered the room by breaking the lock, he added.        
	The power supply was restored around 12.40pm. The hospital authorities said the key was with the employees of the public work departments electrical wing posted at the hospital. They were careless and lost the key, said an official.        
	The state health department had sanctioned three generators for gynaecology, casualty and cardiology buildings of the hospital two months ago, but they are yet to be installed.

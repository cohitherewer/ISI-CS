 - Mela parking space inadequate, vehicle spillover wreaks havoc on motorists
    A STAFF REPORTER
             Cars of visitors to Milon Mela, parked in two to three rows, clog the Park Circus connector. The snarls spill over to the EM Bypass. This picture, taken on Sunday by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya, is a reflection of the scene on the spot every day. 
                    
	A fair at Milon Mela, organised by the state government and two trade bodies, has reduced traffic to a crawl on the high-speed corridor to Sector V and the airport.
    
	Visitors to the 21st Industrial India Trade Fair, being held at the permanent fairground from January 17, have been parking in double, and even triple, rows on the road, causing snarls on the Park Circus connector and choking the EM Bypass.
    
	On an average, over 250 cars are being parked on the road at a time since the fair started, said a traffic sergeant, who was on duty near the fairground at the EM Bypass-Park Circus connector crossing.
    
	The allotted parking space is full. Cars are being left in three rows on the road. Two-wheelers are parked all over the place. This is creating a bottleneck, said the officer. 
    
	On Saturday, more than 8,500 people visited the fair. On Sunday afternoon, over 300 cars were parked on the main road, bringing traffic to a standstill. On Monday and Tuesday, too, the footfall crossed 8,000.
    
	Nobody approached us for permission to keep vehicles on the Park Circus connector, said deputy commissioner (traffic) M.K. Verma.
    
	According to the organisers, there is no harm in parking on the road. Whenever there is a fair here, the cars are parked on the road. There is nothing wrong in it. This fair happens only once a year, said A. Mukherjee, a senior assistant secretary of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has organised the fair with the government and Indian Trade Promotion Organisation.
    
	There is a 300-metre stretch on the fairground where the cars of our members and participants are being parked. Besides, a lane between the boundaries of ITC Sonar Kolkata and the fairground is also being used to park cars, said D.P. Nag, the secretary of the chamber.
    
	Not more than 500 cars can be accommodated in the two spaces. By the conservative estimates of the organisers, parking space for at least 1,000 cars is required.
    
	When asked about inadequate parking space, Nag said: What can we do if visitors park their cars on the road after the parking space fills up?
    
	Industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen admitted: We know parking is a problem at Milon Mela. But the fairground is not complete yet. We are monitoring the problems that are cropping up and trying to find ways to solve them. Holding the fair is part of the learning process.
    
	The learning process for the government is a nightmare for the motorists. Many have started avoiding the route. I have not been taking the Park Circus connector for the past six days. Theres bumper-to-bumper traffic on the stretch because of the cars parked on the road, said Ratan Singh, an engineer at a Sector V firm.
    
	When told that the state government was an organiser of the fair, he stated: Sector V and New Town are the chief ministers pet projects. How can he allow their main road link to be clogged like this? 
    
	An official of the chamber said: The fair has been organised without proper preparation. The problems will continue till it ends on January 27.

                      Rhyme and reason                    The undisputed master of nonsense verse in Bengali, Sukumar Ray has delighted and enthralled generations of readers with his humorous poems. Perhaps the most famous Indian practitioner of literary nonsense, his collection of poems Abol Tabol, novella HaJaBaRaLa and short-story collection Pagla Dashu, among others, are considered nonsense masterpieces and comprise some of the most valuable treasures of Bengali literature. This evening, Mahul, a band of recitation artistes, pays tribute to Ray with Ayre Pagol Abol Tabol. It will commence with recitations from Rays evergreen Abol Tabol and also includes renditions of poems by contemporary poets. The latter part of the programme features a presentation of Mahuls own compositions, providing a wholesome, refreshing mix of fun and seriousness, nonsense and sense.                    Event: A programme of recitation presented by Mahul When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Sisir Mancha

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Assault on rogue driver
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Assault on rogue driver
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Another rogue bus driver got his comeuppance on Thursday when 30-odd passengers, led by a young woman who had been shouting at him not to drive recklessly, decided he needed to be disciplined right away.        
	Atasi Bose, in her late 30s, told police that she felt unsafe as the driver of the bus on route 219 raced down Bidhan Sarani around 10pm on Wednesday.        
	He was driving at breakneck speed I asked the conductor to tell him to drive safely. But he did not pay heed, Bose, a resident of Beadon Street, said in her complaint.        
	Seeing Bose protest and realising that she was justified in asking driver Raj Mollah to slow down, the other passengers alighted the moment the bus stopped at Hedua More and blocked the road. Some of them dragged out the driver and beat him up.         
	When conductor Tomtom Mollah protested, he was beaten up, too.        
	Someone called up the police control room in Lalbazar and a team from Burtola police station reached the site shortly after.        
	Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Vineet Goyal said Raj and Tomtom were arrested for reckless driving, but were granted bail on Thursday. Another officer said the police would pursue the case.        
	Bose said she was not in favour of people taking the law into their own hands, but admitted that she and her fellow-passengers could not stop themselves from assaulting the driver and the conductor before calling the police.        
	This is the fourth instance this month of rogue bus drivers facing street justice.

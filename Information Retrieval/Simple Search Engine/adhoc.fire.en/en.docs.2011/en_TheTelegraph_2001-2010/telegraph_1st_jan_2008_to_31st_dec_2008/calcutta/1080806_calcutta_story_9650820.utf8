The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Defiance through dress
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Defiance through dress
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Kasturi Sen in a salwar-kameez in the classroom. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                  
	Teacher Kasturi Sen entered the classroom in a salwar-kameez for the first time on Tuesday and, at the end of the first period, went to the headmistresss chamber to ask what was wrong about that attire.        
	Outside the gates of Akra Krishnanagar Girls High School stood a police van, just in case the crowd that had gathered there to witness her act of defiance turned unruly. Kasturi had announced her intention to break the schools sari-only rule for teachers on Monday, inviting support from some quarters and a chain of blank calls to her cellphone through the night.        
	I could not make out who made the calls. So I decided to inform the police. Moreover, I am feeling harassed both mentally and physically, she told Metro.        
	Wearing a pale yellow salwar-kameez and sunglasses, Kasturi arrived at the Mahestala school in a rickshaw around 10.40am and walked into the compound without casting a glance at the onlookers.        
	After signing the attendance register in headmistress Dipanwita Pals chamber, she went to the staff room and, unlike on other days, did not change into a sari before joining the 11am prayer session. She then entered section A of Class V in the same attire.         
	Class over, Kasturi went to Pal with a written request to explain why female teachers of the school were not allowed to wear anything but a sari.         
	I have requested her to explain the rule because as far as I know, there is no dress code for teachers (on paper). Even school education minister Partha De has said so, she said.         
	The headmistress denied receiving any such application. The final decision will be taken on August 9 at the guardians meeting. Till then, I shall not utter a single word, she said.         
	Tapati Basu, the head of the department of journalism and mass communication at Calcutta University, said she wasnt repelled by the idea of an institutional dress code.         
	I dont think it would be wrong on the part of the authorities of any school to ask their teachers to come to school in saris. At the same time, we should not raise questions if a school asks its teachers to come only in a salwar-kameez. Many organisations like clubs, hotels and hospitals have dress codes for their staff. So there is no reason why an educational institution cannot impose certain restrictions on the attire of their staff.         
	For Kasturi, who joined the school eight months ago, wearing a salwar-kameez is as much about convenience as about freedom to choose ones attire. You will support me for wearing salwar-kameez when you know the reason for my taking such a decision. My father Kalyan Sen was the head of the department of Bengali at South City College. He died in an accident in February 1995. Since then, I am a little worried whenever I am out of home. Wearing a salwar-kameez gives me better mobility.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Seat slash cloud over tech colleges

	Private engineering colleges without proper infrastructure will face a seat slash if they do not set their house in order before the next admission season.        
	The West Bengal University of Technology  to which the 60-odd private colleges in the state are affiliated  has set a June 30 deadline for the institutions to plug their infrastructure loopholes.        
	The colleges must be ready with the required infrastructure by June 30 in order to admit students for the 2009-10 academic session, which starts in August, said vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Sengupta.        
	The university has decided to conduct a seat audit following complaints from students about poor academic infrastructure and placement opportunities in the private colleges.        
	The three-phase audit will start with an inspection of the colleges by December 31. The ones found lacking in infrastructure will be cautioned.        
	There will be a second round of inspection by March 2009, to be followed by the final appraisal before the start of the next academic session.        
	By June 30, the colleges that are lacking in infrastructure must do the needful, said vice-chancellor Sengupta.        
	Say a college has been allowed to enrol 60 students in IT. If our assessment shows the infrastructure can support only 50 students, the college will be asked to slash 10 seats, said a university official.        
	The All India Council of Technical Education is responsible for keeping a tab on the infrastructure and other facilities  such as laboratories, workshops, libraries, computer-student ratio and placement opportunities  in the 60-odd colleges.        
	Every college submits an annual report on its infrastructure to the council by June 30, following which the apex body of technical education conducts an inspection.        
	The affiliating university is informed about the deficiencies, if any. It is up to the university to take action. But by the time the reports reach the university, the admission process gets over, making it difficult for us to take any drastic measure. So, we have decided to conduct the inspection ourselves this year, said a university official.        
	Our aim is not to slash seats. We only want the colleges to impart proper training to the students, said Sengupta.

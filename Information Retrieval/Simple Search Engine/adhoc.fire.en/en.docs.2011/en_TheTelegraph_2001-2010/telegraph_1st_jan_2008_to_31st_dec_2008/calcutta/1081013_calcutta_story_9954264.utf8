	Calcutta is set to witness a German slugfest in the ultra-luxury car segment.        
	Audi, the premium Volkswagen product that many Indians would probably identify as the car cricketer Ravi Shastri won in Australia in 1985, will get its first showroom in the city in January. Volkswagen plans to open a separate showroom for its VW models and is in the process of selecting a dealer.        
	The Audi showroom at Tagore Park, on the EM Bypass, will have a floor spread of 6,000 sq ft, according to a spokesperson for the dealer, Imperial Auto.        
	The other German companies in the fray are Mercedes and BMW.         
	Audis entire range, including the A4, A6 and A8 sedans, the Q7 SUV and the sports car TT Coupe, will be available at the EM Bypass address.         
	 Audi is very proud to have arrived in Calcutta, the gateway to the east, managing director Benoit Tiers said.        
	The Calcutta showroom is one of 12 new Audi dealerships across the country but only the first footprint in eastern India.        
	The response to Audis foray into India, Tiers said, had been overwhelming. Our sales grew over 190 per cent in the first eight months. We are strengthening our dealership network and the one in Calcutta will give customers the opportunity to experience the world of Audi and our premium services.         
	But is the Calcutta market large enough for several ultra-luxury car manufacturers? Tiers said: We acknowledge the potential of the eastern India market. We received a lot of enquiries specifically from Calcutta, which is why we decided to come here at the earliest opportunity.         
	Apart from the Tagore Park showroom, Audi will set up a workshop at Rakhaldas Auddy Road with five bays.         
	Shruti Bagaria, the principal dealer of Imperial Auto, said customer satisfaction would be the priority. Our showroom will be a world-class one. It will adhere to global Audi standards in terms of premium service.         
	The interiors of the showroom are being done up with materials from different countries  furniture from Germany, lights from Japan, flooring from Austria and tiles from Italy.         
	We are spending Rs 4-5 crore just to get the look of an international Audi showroom, which is more than the cost of the land, Bagaria said.

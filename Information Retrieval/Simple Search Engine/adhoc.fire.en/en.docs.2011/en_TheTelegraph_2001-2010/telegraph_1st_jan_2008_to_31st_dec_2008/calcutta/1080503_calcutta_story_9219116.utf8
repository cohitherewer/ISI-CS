          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A fire broke out in the godown of a printing press on Canal South Road on Friday morning. Nearly 800 litres of inflammable chemicals were stored in the godown.         
	Firemen took about six hours to douse the blaze. No one was injured.        
	The cause of the fire and the extent of damage could not be ascertained. Workers at a nearby factory saw the smoke and informed the fire brigade.

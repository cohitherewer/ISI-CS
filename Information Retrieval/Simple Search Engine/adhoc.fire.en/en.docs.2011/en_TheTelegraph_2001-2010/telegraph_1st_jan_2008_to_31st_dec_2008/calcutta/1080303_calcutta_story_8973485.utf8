                      Art and authenticity                    Gallery Kanishkas, in association with Birla Art Gallery, Mumbai, presents new works by Vijay Bondar (a painting by him appears left) and Ritesh Meshram. Bondars works speak of a life filled with sensitive observation and the will to articulate every minute of it. Reminisces of childhood, games and memories occupy small pockets in his works, often merging with urban experiences and maturity of expression gained over the years. Ritesh Meshram uses the abstract form of art to express tangible, practical realities. Bold and brilliant, his works on charcoal are particularly interesting.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by Vijay Bondar and Ritesh Meshram When: Till March 15 (except Sunday); 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Kanishkas, 2/1 Hindustan Road

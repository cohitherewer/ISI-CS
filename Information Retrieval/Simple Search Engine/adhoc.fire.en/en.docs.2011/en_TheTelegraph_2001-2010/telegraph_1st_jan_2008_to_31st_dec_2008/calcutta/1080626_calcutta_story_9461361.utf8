                      Rediscovering Australia                    Considered one of the most innovative and challenging young photographers of his generation, Australian lensman Trent Parke has little interest in photography as evidence, but a lot in finding human truth through emotions. His images are like tools that help us discover the deeper meanings of life underlying its simpler, more obvious ones. Though his form is like the traditional black-and-white documentary photography, his sensibility appears to be rooted in tough melancholia. In Minutes to Midnight, the ongoing exhibition of his photographs, Parke has documented his journey around his native country over a two-year period, examining the current and changing state of the Australian nation. Capturing the mood of a still young and emerging country, he has compared the disjuncture between the popular perception of the Australian way of life with its nostalgia, romanticism and the more complex reality. Exhibited for the first time at the Sydney Arts Festival in 2005, the series is brought to India as part of a touring exhibition of Chobi Mela IV, by the Australian High Commission in India, Drik and Drik India, with the support of the Australia International Cultural Council.

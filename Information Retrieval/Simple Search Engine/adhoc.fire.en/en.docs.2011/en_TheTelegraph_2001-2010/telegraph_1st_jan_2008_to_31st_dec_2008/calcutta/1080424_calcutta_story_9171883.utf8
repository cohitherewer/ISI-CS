          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A fresh unrest is brewing at Jadavpur University, with the students hinting at protesting the authorities proposed move to curb ragging and disruption in academic activities.        
	The authorities have proposed to keep first-year students in a separate hostel to stop ragging. We oppose the idea and have let our views known to the authorities, said Abhisekh Chakraborty, the general secretary of the faculty of technology and engineering students union (Fetsu).        
	There are reports that the administration also wants to impose curbs on the venues and timings of cultural programmes, entry of outsiders and use of microphones on campus. The students are not happy with this move either.        
	The authorities have said they would take us into confidence before announcing the decisions. We will launch protests if this does not happen, asserted Fetsu vice-chairman Anujit Chakraborty.        
	The executive council of the university has appointed a committee to look into ways to enforce discipline, including curbing ragging and preventing disruption in academic activities, on campus.        
	Parthapratim Biswas, a senior teacher and member of the council, said the committee will meet shortly to finalise its proposals.        
	The university wants the cultural programmes organised by students to be held during the lean season on the academic calender. Besides, the soirees should not be held late at night.        
	The authorities also want to stop free entry of outsiders into the campus, especially at night.        
	The university was on the boil after some students, accompanied by outsiders, raided a guards quarters on the campus and beat him up. The guard had asked the students not to smoke ganja during a cultural programme. We want to stop such incidents, said an official.        
	People living around the university often complain that microphones are used on the campus even during Madhyamik and Higher Secondary exams. We need to stop the practice immediately, the official added. Similar curbs on the use of microphones will be imposed on the employees union as well.

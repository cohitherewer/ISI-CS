                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gunman trail to Khadims kidnap
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Securitymen outside the American Center after the January 2002 attack. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Sadaquat, the alleged motorcycle-borne shooter in the American Center attack in January 2002, was also involved in the Khadim kidnapping the year before.         
	He did not himself abduct Partha Roy Burman but had a role to play in the operation, said Rajiv Kumar, the special inspector general of the special task force of Calcutta police.        
	Sadaquat, who was arrested in Mumbai a month and a half ago and confessed to firing at policemen guarding the Center on Saturday, will be tried in a special court in the city.        
	We will bring him to Calcutta on transit remand. The trial will start in a special court once he is brought here. He will also have to face charges in the Khadim case, added Kumar.        
	In 2005, Aftab Ansari, who plotted the American Center attack in Dubai, and six other accused in the case were awarded death penalty by a special court. They are now lodged in Alipore jail.         
	Ansari had also plotted the Khadim kidnapping.        
	According to senior officers at Lalbazar, Sadaquat had travelled to Dubai. He then went to Pakistan, where he was trained by Huji. His mentor Amir Reza Khan was already in Pakistan. Both recruited youths to form Indian Mujaheedin, said an officer of the task force.         
	Sadaquat was recruited by Asif Reza Khan, Amirs elder brother, in 2000. He later met Aftab Ansari. In 2001, Asif was killed in an encounter in Gujarat. Amir, Sadaquat and Aftab Ansari attacked American Center to avenge his death, he added.         
	Amir is suspected to be hiding in Pakistan. Calcutta police are likely to seek the help of Interpol to nab him.        
	Sadaquats statements will be crucial in our attempt to locate Amir. We will also ask him if there were others involved in the American Center attack, said an officer.

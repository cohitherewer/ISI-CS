                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pariah finds new home
  - GANGRENE WOUND DRESSED          A STAFF REPORTER                          Tapan Mukherjee at Nirmal Hriday, where he was admitted on Thursday afternoon. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Tapan Mukherjee finally found a home on Thursday afternoon, courtesy an NGO.        
	Hours after Metro reported his plight, the 59-year-old with a rotting wound in his left leg was admitted to Nirmal Hriday. He had been lying in neglect on a Kasba road for the past few days.        
	We got in touch with Nirmal Hriday early in the morning, after reading the news in Metro. The authorities said they were ready to admit the patient. We went to Kasba police station and located the man, with help from the officers. After dressing up his wounds and giving him a fresh set of clothes, we took him to the home, said Netai Mukherjee, the executive director of HIVe India, the NGO that came to Tapans rescue.        
	The police officers accompanied our volunteers to Nirmal Hriday, Netai added.        
	There is still a little discomfort in my leg but I am feeling much better, Tapan said from his bed at Nirmal Hriday.         
	Sisters at the home said Tapan, suffering from severe gangrene, was brought to them four months ago by civic employees.        
	He went missing a fortnight ago. He had almost recovered and could walk on his own when he left, said the Nirmal Hriday authorities. He had gone out for a walk with other inmates, but did not return.        
	Tapan, however, could not remember how he reached Kasba from Kalighat.        
	I will not go out for a walk even if I can, he said, touching his forehead with folded hands.

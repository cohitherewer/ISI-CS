                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       High court fixes township tax rate
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday allowed Bidhannagar Municipality to collect property tax at 30 per cent more than the 1996 rate. The civic body has not been collecting the tax since May last year after the apex court criticised the process of tax calculation.         
	Justice K.J. Sengupta of the high court, however, is yet to decide whether the municipality had the authority to collect tax on the basis of West Bengal Valuation Board (Amendment) Act, 2007. The 1996 rate was fixed after the original act came into force.         
	The viability of the act will be decided later by the court, said Justice Sengupta while delivering his interim order on Tuesday.        
	In 1996, Salt Lake residents had moved court challenging the rate fixed by the Central Valuation Board. Justice P. Samanta had set aside the boards rate. The high court division bench, however, allowed the civic body to collect the tax according to the 1996 rate.         
	The residents then moved an appeal before the Supreme Court. The apex court upheld Justice Samantas judgment.        
	After the Supreme Court ruling, the state had enacted West Bengal Valuation Board (Amendment) Act, 2007, and included provisions for hearings for tax payers.        
	The residents maintained that the tax rate was fixed on the basis of documents collected by unauthorised persons.

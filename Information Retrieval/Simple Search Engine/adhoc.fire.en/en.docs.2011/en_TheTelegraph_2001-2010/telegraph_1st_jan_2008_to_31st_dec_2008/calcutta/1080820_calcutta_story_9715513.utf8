                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tech hub resigns to shutdown
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The first ice-breaking meeting on Singur will keep Writers Buildings busy on Wednesday, but the rest of the city will have to stay indoors.         
	With the nation-wide industrial strike snowballing into a full-fledged bandh in Calcutta  courtesy, the might of the Citu  kids will not be able to go to school, techies will have to work from home and tourists will have to change their travel plans.         
	Our office will remain open but I will prefer to work from home, said an IT professional working for IBM.         
	Most major IT companies in Salt Lake Sector V will also keep their offices open but not many are making arrangements to ferry the employees to office.         
	As the Citu is one of the sponsors of the strike, it is difficult to make transport arrangements. So, we are not even trying to hire buses to bring our employees to work and drop them home, said a senior official of a leading IT firm.        
	The 6am-6am bandh is coming in the way of the companies maintaining their 24x7 schedule.        
	In any case, productivity suffers on bandh days. We also have to look into the cost of arranging alternative arrangements So, we have decided to keep our office closed on Wednesday, said S.P. Mukherjee, the managing director of Databazaar.         
	Companies like Databazaar have decided to stay shut despite promises of help from the Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which looks after administrative matters in Sector V.         
	At a meeting with the representatives of 80-plus IT companies, officials of Nabadiganta and district police announced emergency telephone numbers, including of the police control room. Any techie facing problems on bandh day can dial one of the numbers and seek help. The authorities also promised help to ferry staff.         
	Those willing to work on Wednesday should not face any problem in the IT sector, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta.         
	The authorities move is encouraging but it is difficult to run an office on a bandh day when the entire support system collapses, said a senior official of an IT company.         
	The concern was echoed by a transport department official, who admitted that running state buses would be difficult on Wednesday.         
	Tomorrows strike is being sponsored by Left trade unions. So, we are doubtful whether state buses would ply, he added.         
	Airport operations, too, would come to a halt. All domestic airlines have decided to cancel flights from Calcutta during the bandh while most international carriers have rescheduled flights.        
	The airlines have informed us that they would not operate flights during the bandh, an airport official said on Tuesday. The decision was taken after a marathon meeting between the Airports Authority of India and the Airlines Operators Committee.         
	Though the airlines said they would operate flights till 6am on Wednesday, their plans may go haywire as bandh backers are planning to start picketing from Tuesday night.         
	Railway sources said trains would run provided there was no obstruction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bazaars take a beating
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bazaars take a beating
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Only a few stalls were open in Gariahat market on Thursday morning, and there were even fewer takers. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	From Behala to Belgachhia, most markets were deserted on Thursday as bandh and bad weather combined to keep sellers and shoppers confined to their homes.        
	There was hardly a shop open at Shyambazar Market at 9am. I have shopped here for 20 years now. This is about as bad as it gets, said local resident Archan Ghose, 66.         
	Ghose later found that a few greengrocers had not opened shop because there are no customers. They fished out from their gunny bags the vegetables Ghose wanted to buy. Formally, we are closed, they said.        
	Behala market, which bustles on a normal day, fared a little better. A couple of vegetable sellers and flower shops could be spotted with their wares in the morning, along with a shop selling fish and three selling chicken.         
	Business was negligible in all the civic markets till 6pm. The superintendent was absent in some of them, a controlling official of Calcutta Municipal Corporations market department said. But business went on well in some smaller markets, including Tiretta Bazar, near Poddar Court.         
	Gariahat Market also bore a deserted look at 9.30am, with wares neatly stacked away under tarpaulins, excepting a fish shop and a greengrocer. Cutting a rohu into two, the shop-owner said: This consignment is for a hospital. Ill pack up after this, because there are no customers. Greengrocer Shyamlal Saha said his stocks for the day had arrived and he would wind up after readying the stuff for the evening, when he expected business to be brisk.        
	Jadubabus Bazaar, in Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjees backyard, however, was in sharp contrast to the rest of the markets. Mamata has mocked the CPM bandh since it is part of the Centres UPA government, which has sanctioned the fuel price hike.        
	No seller wants to lose out on a days earning, no matter where he sets up shop. We have opened our shops today, and vendors at Gariahat are closed Tomorrow, the scene may be different, a flower shop-owner told Metro. But he refused to say if the vendors at Jadubabus Bazaar had been told to keep their shops open.

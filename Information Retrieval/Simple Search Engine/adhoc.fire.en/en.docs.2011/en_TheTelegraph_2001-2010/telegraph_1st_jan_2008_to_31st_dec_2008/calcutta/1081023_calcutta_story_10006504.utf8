	The aviation sector was handed a temporary crutch on Wednesday with the cancellation of trains to north India filling up seats on flights to and from Delhi.        
	There were several last-minute bookings on all evening flights leaving Calcutta for the capital, airport sources said. Air Indias 8pm flight to Delhi went full, said an airline official. There is a rush for the 5pm Delhi flight but not for the evening flight. There were lots of bookings since afternoon following the Bihar violence.         
	Sources said the evening flight last went full during Puja. Private airlines Kingfisher, Deccan and IndiGo also recorded an unusually high number of last-minute bookings on evening flights to Delhi.        
	Tour operators said the rush is likely to continue till the weekend. Passengers who cannot take trains to north India will fly to Delhi at least for the next couple of days, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	Passengers stranded at Howrah station were left chalking out air-travel plans. Debasish Chakraborty, an executive with a private firm, who was to take the Rajdhani Express on Wednesday, said he had no option but to take a morning flight to Delhi on Thursday to attend a meeting.        
	The Guptas returning to Calcutta after their Puja holidays cancelled their train tickets from Delhi and booked seats on an IndiGo flight on Thursday.

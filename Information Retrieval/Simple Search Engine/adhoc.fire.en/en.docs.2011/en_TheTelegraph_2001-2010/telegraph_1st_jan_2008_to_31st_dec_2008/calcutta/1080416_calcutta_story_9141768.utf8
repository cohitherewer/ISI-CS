The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Norm flout stifles Anwar Shah Road
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Norm flout stifles Anwar Shah Road
                                        
	Prince Anwar Shah Road has more traffic than it can hold, thanks to a crowd-puller mall and a busy EM Bypass connector. Since traffic norm violation is rampant on the thoroughfare, snarls are a regular occurrence.         
	The situation is likely to worsen as apartment-owners move into the South City housing estate within a year.        
	Metro runs a check              
	Bus terminuses        
	A part of the road near Jadavpur police station is blocked by parked buses on route 240. Eight to 15 buses are parked on the bus bay near the police station. Though prohibited, they take U-turns off the Bypass connector-Anwar Shah crossing, slowing down traffic further, said a shop owner.        
	The stretch in front of the South City Mall is blocked by parked buses (routes 47A and 47B) and autorickshaws parked near the Lake Gardens crossing.        
	We had asked the owners of the buses on route 240 and 47 (both A and B) to shift their terminuses to Gangulypukur and Golf Green, respectively. But the owners of the buses on route 240 moved court. The verdict should be out soon, said a senior police officer.        
	The mall        
	South City Mall draws huge crowds on weekends, which add to the clog on the stretch. The rush of mall-bound vehicles from the Lords crossing necessitates allowing U-turns near Poddar Nagar on Sundays. More than 20,000 cars and 15,000 motorcycles enter the mall on Sundays.        
	The steep incline that cars have to negotiate to get on to the mall tarmac is dangerous and time-consuming, feels Souvik Ghosh, a regular shopper.               
	Residential estates        
	About 90 per cent of the 1,672 South City apartments on Anwar Shah Road have been sold. Flats are likely to be handed over soon in phases. As most buyers own cars, the traffic situation on the artery will take a major beating once they move in.        
	Besides, the residents of other housing estates like Mecon Towers and Merlin Towers also use the stretch.        
	Pedestrians        
	The sidewalk on Prince Anwar Shah Road is blocked with makeshift eateries, tyre shops and trees. People are forced to walk on the road dodging the traffic.         
	Mall-hoppers, instead of using the zebra crossing, often sneak in through the gaps in the divider near Usha Gate. The mall, however, has a well-maintained sidewalk.              
	Officialspeak        
	Local councillor Ratan Dey (ward number 95) said: Citu has been posing a few problems regarding the removal of the bus terminuses. I believe they will be shifted soon.         
	There are also plans to construct a road at the rear of South City Projects, near Bikramgarh, so that residents of the estate can avoid Prince Anwar Shah Road, he added.        
	CMDA officials said a flyover will be constructed from the Bypass-Anwar Shah intersection to Lake Gardens, with one arm descending near South City Mall.        
	The mall authorities have pledged to share the construction cost, an official said. Besides there are plans to widen the four-lane stretch to eight lanes.              
	 Rith Basu

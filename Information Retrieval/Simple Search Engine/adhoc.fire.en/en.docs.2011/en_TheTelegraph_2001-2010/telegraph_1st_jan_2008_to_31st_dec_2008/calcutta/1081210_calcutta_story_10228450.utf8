                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Winter winds in slow motion
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Winter hasnt bypassed Calcutta but its in no hurry to hit town either.        
	The Met office said on Tuesday that the city would start feeling a nip in the air from Friday, after which the minimum temperature would drop steadily.        
	The requirements for a perfect winter are snow in Kashmir, a clear sky and strong winds from the north. We have lacked all three this December, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	The minimum temperature in the city has been between three and four degrees above normal over the past week. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature in Alipore was measured at 18.9 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal.        
	We dont expect much change in the minimum temperature over the next 48 hours, Debnath said. But the temperature should start dropping from Friday, heralding winter.        
	Rain and snow occur in the north around this time because of western disturbances. These are low-pressure systems that travel from the Mediterranean Sea to the northern part of the country. From there, they travel eastwards. After the western disturbance blows over, the sky clears up and the North Wind starts coming in from the north and north-western parts of the country, a Met official said.        
	The minimum temperature in Calcutta had dropped in late November because of rain in the north. When those western disturbances headed eastwards, the North Wind was strong and the minimum temperature in the city dropped below 16 degrees on one occasion, the Met official said.        
	But the signs of winter disappeared as quickly as they appeared. There has been no western disturbance since and the North Wind has been weak, Debnath said.        
	Another factor that has kept the minimum temperature above normal is the incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal, thanks to a depression near the Tamil Nadu coast.

        The builders of Hiland Park say they are self-reliant to tackle fires in any of its towers. A Telegraph picture 
   
	Can a Burrabazar happen in the two tallest towers in town mdash; Hiland Park and South City? Most unlikely, since Calcutta rsquo;s new-age highrises are not dependent on the fire department rsquo;s resources, say the developers.
 
	 ldquo;The world over, in highrises beyond 10 storeys, it is always difficult to douse flames from the outside. So, most of the modern buildings have in-built fire-fighting systems equipped to detect and fight fires, rdquo; says Pradip Chopra of the PS Group, a past secretary of Credai Bengal, the umbrella body of city realtors.
 
	Fire presents a threat only when it acquires critical mass and hence, it rsquo;s imperative for every building to have a very good detection system as the first line of defence, feels Sumit Dabriwal, whose Calcutta Metropolitan Group gave Calcutta one of its first contemporary highrise buildings, Hiland Park.
 
	 ldquo;We had jointly ideated the fire-safety norms and fire-fighting systems with the state fire department when we were planning Hiland Park. However, we are now totally self-reliant to tackle any fire in the towers by virtue of the detection and suppression systems we have installed, rdquo; stresses Dabriwal.
 
	In today rsquo;s highrises, there are smoke and heat detectors, carbon dioxide systems, pressurised sprinklers, fire hydrants, dampers in the air-conditioning ducts, wetrisers for access to water high up, dedicated water reservoirs, and an evacuation mechanism mdash; as ldquo;basic hygiene rdquo;.
 
	While in most cases, the detection and suppression system should suffice to control any fire, it rsquo;s extremely important to shore up the last line of defence, which is efficient evacuation, concur developers.
 
	 ldquo;In South City, we have pressurised our staircases to prevent smoke from travelling. Besides, there are fire doors and multiple exit points to ensure speedy evacuation, rdquo; says Sushil Mohta, the director of South City Projects.
 
	The preparedness of Forum mall, on Elgin Road, was put to the test a few months ago when a fire broke out on its terrace. ldquo;We could douse the flames on our own even before the fire engines arrived, and we could do that because our fire-safety device is integrated with the mall rsquo;s building automation system, which ensures early detection, rdquo; points out Subir Das, the deputy general manager of Forum.
 
	Four years ago, Credai Bengal held a seminar on fire-safety in the city, in tandem with the fire department, to increase awareness. There was also an exhibition displaying all kinds of fire-fighting equipment and techniques, including modern fire-fighting systems installed in highrises the world over.

                      An abstract tradition                    The butterfly effect is a phase which encapsulates the modern technical notion of sensitive dependence on initial conditions in chaos theory. Small variation of the initial conditions may produce large variations in the long-term behaviours of a system. The same may happen in art. The concepts of abstraction arise when such changes occur with respect to tradition. Rolling over several centuries and breaking across geographical barriers, the tradition of abstract art lives on  from Piet Mondrian to Gaitonde, Ramkumar, Raza and the young Partha Shaw. The exponents of abstract art, who are showcasing their works in The Butterfly Effect, the ongoing group show, are Kalicharan Gupta, Kazi Ghiyasuddin, Kishore Shinde (a painting by him appears above), Partha Shaw, Pradip Rakshit, Sheetal Gattani, Shambhavi, Sunil Das and Yusuf.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Laptop thieves strike   again in Salt Lake 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Laptop thieves strike   again in Salt Lake 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                 The table from which the laptops were stolen		    
	Thieves in Salt Lake have taken a liking to laptops.        
	Two laptops were stolen from a working couples house in BE block early on Tuesday, taking the number of similar thefts reported to police in the past few months to seven.        
	 We had two laptops at home, one mine and the other belonging to my wife Chaitali. The laptops were on a table in the room adjacent to our bedroom. We woke up in the morning and found the laptops missing, said Arindam Chakrabarty, a financial analyst with a private company.         
	 The two of us are professionals and have lost all the data stored in our laptops, he said.        
	Arindam said in his FIR at Bidhannagar (north) police station that he had worked till late in the night and gone to sleep around 12.30am after closing the doors and the windows.         
	With nothing else missing from the room and the doors and window grilles intact, the police were clueless about how an outsider could have taken away the laptops.        
	 We arrested three persons from Rajarhat on Tuesday, though that was part of our investigation into previous laptop thefts. We are checking whether they were involved in the latest incident too, the additional superintendent of police for Salt Lake, Ashok Biswas, said.        
	Another police officer said laptop thefts were a new trend in Salt Lake, the residential locality of choice for many notebook-carrying professionals employed by companies that have offices in Sector V.        
	 Earlier, we used to receive a lot of complaints about mobile phone thefts but laptops disappearing from homes is a recent phenomenon. We are trying to ascertain whether the same gang was behind all seven instances that have been reported.

	The fear of demolition pushed aside for now, the traders of the fire-ravaged Nandaram Market are looking forward to resuming business on the first six floors this week.
    
	Initially, our future seemed uncertain, as there were talks of demolition. But now, we are hopeful of resuming our dhanda this week. We can start on the floors that have not been gutted, said Darshan Shah, a garments trader on the fifth floor.
    
	The hope among the traders can be linked to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyyas comment on Sunday: The civic body had sanctioned the construction proposal up to the sixth floor of Nandaram Market in 1957. Since there has been no structural damage to the first six storeys, trading may be allowed there. 
    
	Earlier, the mayor had said that the building was illegal and would be demolished. 
    
	I will issue a notice on Monday asking people not to climb beyond the sixth floor. I think the market will resume business from Monday afternoon, Purushottam Agarwal, the president of Nandaram Market Traders Welfare Association told Metro on Sunday evening.
    
	We have learnt the chief minister will visit the market tomorrow. The formal approval for resumption of business may follow that, said Rajiv Lodha, whose cosmetics shop on the third floor has escaped damage in the 100-hour blaze.
    
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has submitted a detailed report on the market to the chief minister.
    
	From the original building plan to violations of building norms over the years  the two-page report gives the full history of the building, said a civic official.
    
	The report has also pointed out that the plan sanctioned by the civic body was for an office building. The promoters later converted it into a market.
    
	The illegalities do not matter now, as Nandaram Market has become a political issue, said a CMC official.
    
	On Sunday evening, the market wore a deserted look, with some constables guarding the entrance. The traders said they were ready to move in with their products any time.

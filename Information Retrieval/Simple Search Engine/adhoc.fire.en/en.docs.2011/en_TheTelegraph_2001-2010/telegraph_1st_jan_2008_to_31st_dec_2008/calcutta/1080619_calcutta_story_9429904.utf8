          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Parts of a dilapidated two-storeyed building collapsed on an adjoining house, burying a 60-year-old man in front of his family members in Taltala early on Wednesday.        
	Rajinder Sau was drinking water around 1am when portions of a wall of 20 Durga Charan Doctor Road came crashing down through the tin roof of his single-storeyed house.        
	Rajinders wife Santi said all the members of the family were awake then. They, with help from neighbours, took Rajinder to NRS Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	The abandoned building had been declared unsafe by the civic body. Our team is now demolishing the other parts of the building, said mayoral council member (building) Dipankar De.        
	Police are trying to trace the owners of the building, said deputy commissioner (central) Ajey Ranade.        
	Residents of the area said the owners had not repaired the building despite repeated requests.

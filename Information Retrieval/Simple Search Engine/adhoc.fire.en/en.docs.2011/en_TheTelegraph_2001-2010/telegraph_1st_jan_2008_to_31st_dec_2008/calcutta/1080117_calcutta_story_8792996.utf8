	Movies on children got a special boost at the fourth edition of Dubai International Film Festival held in December. However, most films upheld the darker side of childhood, where children are precocious, abused and disillusioned. 
 
	Haresat Al Ma rsquo;a Waterguard was one such film in Arabic. Winner of the Special Jury Prize, the film is more than what its tagline suggests mdash; ldquo;birth in the time of drought rdquo;. Narrated through the voice of a young girl, the story is about growing hope after years of distrust. The movie begins with the movement of the swing on which a young girl is perched. Then the camera traces the barren land all around her where, she says, even the thought of planting trees is laughed at. 
 
	Cut to her home. The walls are filled with graffiti, geometric figures drawn with black charcoal ndash; emblematic of death and despair. Her father tells her to bring water from the pipe. For his wife is pregnant and water is necessary for a new life. The girl treads the bylanes of her village in fear as the young male gaze stands in wait. 
 
	This is where the director achieves his mark. A few glimpses of the road, the boys, and the gurgling pipe of water far away is interspersed with images of the girl who allows her fear to turn into terror. When she reaches the pipe, there is another man in a black robe waiting as she collapses. The man helps her up, perches her on a swing, brings the pipe to her home. Finally the girl says that there should be more greenery in the area and the charcoal lines on the walls of her home should not be only in black. Thus, hope is born.
 
	Ezra, by director Newton I. Aduaka is about a child soldier. The story begins with a group of young boys being trained for a rebel group. Ezra is a confused boy who has grown up following military orders that he has been taught to believe in. He traces the growth of a young man in a terrorist organisation and his questioning of the principles of war.
 
	It was The Kite Runner, a movie based on Khaled Hosseini rsquo;s book that made others fade in comparison. Chosen for the closing night, the film remained true to the novel of the same name. What, however, drew gasps of wonder was the performance by the young boys who were rightly termed ldquo;the stars of the show rdquo; by the producer. The plot deals with cruelty, child abuse, grave errors and redemption. It traces Amir, a well-off Pashtun boy played by Zekeria Ebrahimi, as he grows up in Afghanistan and goes on to throw his friend and servant Hassan, played by Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada, out of his house. 
 
	Evicted out of Afghanistan by the Soviet invasion, Amir must face his past and the fate of his father rsquo;s illegitimate child, Hassan. There is only one way to redemption for Amir ndash; he must travel to Afghanistan and rescue Hassan rsquo;s orphaned son from a Taliban, Sohrab. But the images that linger are the ones that trace human characteristics. Hassan rsquo;s agility in fetching kites is an indication of the pride of a servant in the master. ldquo;For you, a thousand times over, rdquo; is Hassan rsquo;s phrase that will haunt Amir.

	Children had a blast this Christmas with Star Theatre organising a five-day carnival from December 24.
 
	The carnival turned out to be a perfect hangout for both kids as well as teenagers. They were treated to a magic show in the open-air theatre on the first day. Day 2 had a scrap-writing contest where children between six and 12 years were asked to pen down a message to his/her dearest person. Twenty four participants took part in the event with Pallavi Das, Sumanta Pal and Argha Pattanayak emerging as the winners.
 
	Santa Claus distributed goodies to kids and played games with them at the food court. In the evening a talking doll show was presented by Shounavo of Mirakkel fame. This was followed by a fashion show for children between six and 10 years. Rima Tapaswi, Swastika Bhattacharya, and Bandita Dey bagged the prizes. Child artist Aritra Ghosh Dastidar enthralled the audience with his performance on the fourth day while Unish Kuri Madhur Kantha talent winner Nilakshi held fort on December 31 with her songs.

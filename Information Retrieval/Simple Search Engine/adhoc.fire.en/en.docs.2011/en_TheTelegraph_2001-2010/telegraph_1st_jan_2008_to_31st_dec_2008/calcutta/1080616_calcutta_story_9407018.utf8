The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scanner on jail employees
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Scanner on jail employees
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Jail employees will be frisked when they report for duty and leave for home to prevent inmates from getting hold of cellphones and razors. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Jail staff will be frisked when they report for duty and leave the premises because SIM cards and razors have been found on inmates.         
	The jail department recently issued a directive to the superintendents of correctional homes asking them to start the frisking. The order is likely to be implemented from this week.         
	An investigation by the department suggested that a section of workers were carrying items in demand among the inmates in and out of jails against hefty payments.        
	Seizure of items like razors and SIM cards in jails earlier led to frisking of inmates. This time, the employees, too, have been brought under the scanner.        
	In addition to daily frisking, the workers in all the jails will have to face sudden checks by senior department staff, said inspector-general (prisons) B.D. Sharma.         
	One of the incidents that have shaken up the top brass of the department is the recovery of a cellphone with a SIM card from Abu Nasser, a suspected ISI agent with several cases against him in Delhi and Calcutta. He is lodged in a special cell of Presidency jail.        
	This came close on the heels of the recovery of seven cellphones  four from Presidency jail and three from Alipore jail.         
	Last week, three were injured in a scuffle among six undertrials while they were being taken from Presidency jail to the sessions court in a prison van. One of the undertrials had a razor.         
	He may have procured the razor after stepping out of jail. Still, we have decided to install scanners and metal detectors in jails, Sharma said.         
	According to sources, each metal detector will cost about Rs 20 lakh. They will initially be installed in the bigger jails, including Presidency, Alipore and Dum Dum.

	Eighteen girls at Calcutta Universitys Hastings Hostel fell ill over the past two days allegedly after drinking water contaminated by dead crows.        
	Four boarders of the Alipore hostel who complained of severe abdominal pain and dysentery on Monday were taken to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan.        
	Arpita Shaw (MSc first year) and Rupa Biswas (BSc third year) have been released, while Dipanwita Mistry and Tamali Roy (both MA second year) are still in hospital.        
	Fourteen students had complained of similar problems on Sunday but they did not need hospitalisation.        
	The water was stinking for the past three days. We saw crow feathers and insects in the water on Sunday, said Swapna Biswas, a student of human development department of Viharilal College of Home and Social Sciences. The college is in the same compound as the hostel.        
	The students gheraoed vice-chancellor Suranjan Das when he visited the campus on Monday, demanding the removal of hostel superintendent Banani Pradhan. They also demanded proper drainage and security in the hostel. Sources said Das had assured the students of setting up of a probe team.        
	The authorities later sent plumbers, six water tankers and a two-member medical team to the hostel. But the team ran out of medicines after treating only 20 students  the hostel can accommodate 165. We came in a hurry, said a doctor.

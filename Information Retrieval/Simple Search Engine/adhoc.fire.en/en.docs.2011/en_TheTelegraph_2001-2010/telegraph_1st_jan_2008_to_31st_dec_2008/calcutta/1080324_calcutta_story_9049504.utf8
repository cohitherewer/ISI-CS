	The next 48 hours will be pleasant with the sky remaining overcast and the maximum temperature likely to drop below normal, the Met office said on Sunday. There is a chance of rain or thundershower in the city and the coastal districts.        
	The conditions are also favourable for Norwesters, said the weatherman.        
	The maximum temperature is expected to dip below normal over the next 48 hours. The minimum temperature is expected to remain around normal, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The maximum temperature on Sunday was 30 degrees Celsius, five degrees below normal. The minimum temperature was 26.2 degrees, four degrees above normal.        
	Met officials said thunder squalls with wind speed between 50 and 60 km per hour are likely to hit isolated places in Gangetic Bengal in the next 24 hours.        
	According to Met officials, a trough of low pressure over Gangetic Bengal has been sucking in moisture from the Bay of Bengal.        
	A wind from the south is blowing for the past few days, bringing in moisture from the sea. The trough of low pressure has intensified the incursion of moisture, said a Met official.        
	Moreover, a cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) has developed over adjoining Bangladesh which is also bringing in plenty of moisture. This huge quantity of moisture over the Bengal districts led to the heavy cloud formation, he added.        
	The city and its adjoining areas received light rain on Sunday morning. The sky was grey throughout the day. Alipore Met office office recorded rainfall of 1.4 mm in 24 hours till 5.30pm.        
	The maximum temperature in Calcutta on Saturday was 35.8 degree Celsius. The cloudy sky and drizzle brought down the temperature by five degrees within 24 hours.        
	Very light to moderate rain was recorded in parts of Gangetic Bengal.

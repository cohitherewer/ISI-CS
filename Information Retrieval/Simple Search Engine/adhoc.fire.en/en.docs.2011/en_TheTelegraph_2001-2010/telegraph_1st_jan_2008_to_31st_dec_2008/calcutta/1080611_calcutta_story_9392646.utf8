                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Couple knew killers
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Policemen at the apartment doorstep of the Varmas. The couple were found dead on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Ramprasad Varma and wife Sunita Devi were killed by people known to them, police said on Thursday.        
	The way the couple were dressed suggested that some guests had turned up at their flat on Saturday evening. Those guests might have killed the Varmas, said an investigating officer.        
	Ramprasad, who would normally be in pyjamas and singlet at home, was wearing a shirt and trousers and Sunita Devi was in an expensive sari.        
	The post-mortem report has made it clear that the couple were killed at least three hours after dinner. This indicates that the guests had spent some time with the couple and probably had dinner with them, the officer added.        
	The Varmas were found dead in the living room of their Kings Road apartment in Howrah on Sunday night. A nylon rope was tied around their necks and blood stains were seen below Sunita Devis eyes.        
	The sleuths think the murder was not for gain, though some cash and a few ornaments were missing from the apartment. The valuables might have been taken away to mislead the investigators, the officer said.        
	The police have interrogated Trinath Dalai, who had taken Ramprasads Dobson Road shop on lease. The couples two sons  Sandip and Abhishek  and Ramprasads brother Mahendra have also been questioned.         
	We are probing all angles. The motive of the murder is not clear. No one has been arrested, said Milan Kanta Das, the additional superintendent of police (town).

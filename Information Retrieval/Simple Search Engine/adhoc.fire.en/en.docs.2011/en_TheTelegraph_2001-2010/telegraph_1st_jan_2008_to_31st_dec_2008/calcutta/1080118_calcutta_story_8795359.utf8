	Burrabazars most famous old boy is returning briefly to his roots  not with a magic balm for victims of the areas worst blaze, but to attend a wedding in the family mansion at Alipore and address a select gathering of the citys glitterati at a five-star address.
    
	Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, the fifth richest man in the world, will be spending the weekend in Calcutta, the city he had come to at the age of six and left as a young man driven by ambition.
    
	The 57-year-old steel tycoon will be checking into Taj Bengal on Saturday morning. Later in the day, he will be present at the ceremony to mark the wedding of Sanchita, daughter of Heera and Ratan Mittal, to Ashish, son of Shashi and Mahesh Rasiwasia. The card mentions 24 Alipore Road  Mittal House  as the venue.
    
	The main purpose of his visit is the wedding in the family. Ratan Mittal, who is Hyderabad-based, is L.N. Mittals uncle, said a friend of the family, who preferred to remain anonymous.
    
	But he will also be meeting and interacting with members and guests of Madhuban on Sunday afternoon at Taj Bengal, added the source.
    
	Madhuban is a social and cultural club in south Calcutta. The current president is Alka Dalmiya, wife of Kunal Dalmiya, who is the brother-in-law of L.N. Mittal, said an office-bearer of Madhuban.
    
	At the interactive session, the president and CEO of ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel company, will talk about his own experiences, fielding questions from the anchor and the audience.
    
	His is a remarkable life story, from the bylanes of Burrabazar to the palace in Britain, from a humble Hindi-medium school to a personal fortune of $51 billion (according to Forbes), said the family friend.
    
	Calcutta was where Mittal first went to a restaurant  when I was 14 or 15, on Park Street... probably Trincas, he has said  and where he completed his education  at St Xaviers College, topping the class of 69 in commerce.
    
	But his two-day trip to town this time is unlikely to take him back to his alma mater. There was some talk of L.N. Mittal spending time on his old campus, but as things stand now, he will probably meet the St Xaviers principal at the Madhuban get-together on Sunday, said a source.
    
	Mittals contribution to the cause of the new campus of the college also remains unclear.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rain ends shutdown

	The twin bandhs ended on Friday evening amidst heavy showers and waterlogging, just as they started off on Thursday morning.        
	Many traders in the low-lying areas did not open their shops even after the bandh ended at 4.30pm, fearing inundation. The worst-affected stretch extended from Chandni Chowk to Hatibagan, which, according to civic body sources, received 60 mm of rainfall.        
	Even an hour after the rain stopped, most parts of MM Burman Street, Thanthania, Rajendralal Road, Muktaram Babu Street, Colootola Street, Vivekananda Road, Sukeas Street, Keshub Sen Street, Narkeldanga and Bagmari were under knee-deep water.        
	Thanthania, the most waterlogging-prone area in the city, received 81 mm of rainfall, the maximum in the city, said Tushar Ghosh, the chief engineer in the civic sewerage and drainage department.        
	The accumulated water is not likely to recede before 11pm from the low-lying pockets of north Calcutta, said a civic engineer who was supervising the drainage operations at Thanthania on Friday evening.        
	The overall situation in south Calcutta was better, as it received only 10 mm of rain. Still, parts of Panchanantala, Picnic Garden Road, CN Roy Road, Sapgachi and parts of Kasba were waterlogged.

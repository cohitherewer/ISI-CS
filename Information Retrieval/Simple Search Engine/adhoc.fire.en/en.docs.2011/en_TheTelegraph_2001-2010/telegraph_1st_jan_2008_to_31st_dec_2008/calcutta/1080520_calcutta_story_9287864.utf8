The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Sector V ideas set to bear fruit
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sector V ideas set to bear fruit
  - Administrative authority takes up company proposals placed a month ago           CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                                  
	The Sector V administrative authority is trying to implement suggestions made a month back by companies in the tech hub.        
	The township, which doesnt have a drug store, is likely to get a health clinic soon. According to plans, doctors will be on call at the clinic 24x7. Medicines, oxygen cylinders and ambulances will also be available.        
	We are in talks with a company for setting up a clinic in Sector V that will provide health services round the clock. The company is waiting for a drug licence, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority.        
	The authority is also planning to introduce mobile food kiosks. We will select some food vendors to operate the kiosks, added Ahmed.        
	A cooperative of the selected vendors will be formed and they will be given trade licences. The kiosks are likely to be commissioned by the end of May and will be operational by the first week of July.        
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority has floated a tender for the construction of a food park on plot No. 6 in DN block of Sector V. The public-private partnership model will be followed for the project.        
	On the anvil is a bus service within the tech hub. A company in Sector V has offered to sponsor the trial run of a bus. We have to popularise the concept among employees and see if the project will be commercially viable, said Ahmed.        
	The authority has approached the urban development department regarding construction of two and three-star hotels in the tech hub.        
	The wish list submitted in April included middle-rung eateries, a pre-paid taxi stand and a crche for working mothers.        
	Social infrastructure is as important as physical infrastructure for attracting investments, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris.        
	Sector V employees are reluctant to laud Nabadiganta until the projects are completed.        
	We have been promised better roads, improved drainage system and better traffic management, but Sector V still gets waterlogged and we still spend a lot of time stuck in traffic, said an employee of IBM.        
	Traffic management, storm water drainage and sewage plans are virtually absent in Sector V. Septic pits have to be built and tubewells dug in the tech hub, said architect and urban planner Partha Ranjan Das.        
	According to him market complexes and more open space were needed in Sector V. There is no police station or post office. There is not even a fire station, which is a must in a place full of highrises, said Das.

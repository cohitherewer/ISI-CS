                      The distressed warrior                    Portraying the mortal anguish of a man unsure of his identity, Karnavaram (written by Bhasa in 500 BC) is based on an important episode of The Mahabharata. The time and space of its action is the 11th day of the battle of Kurukshetra. It begins with Duryodhana calling Karna to fight for his side as Bhishma has fallen. Karna, the fearless warrior, is found to be in despondent mood on the battlefield. The play explores and analyses its reasons. Conscious of his questionable birth, caste and social status, Karna, the protagonist, is heroic and pathetic at the same time as he tries to find his place between the mockery and adulation of social forces on the one hand and the taunting challenges of fate on the other. His troubled mind moulds his vision and makes him understand the utter futility of a war where men kill one another. His fatalistic realisation that war is a waste irrespective of his own win or loss adds to his mental turbulence. Karna also understands that no matter how bravely he may fight, he is pitted in a losing battle against destiny and the gods. The treatment of the play takes it beyond its epic dimension, relating it to the social realities of the present. Karna lingers in the audiences consciousness as the symbol of the universal man trying to solve his existential dilemma and discover his own self. The play ends with a revitalised Karna proceeding to his ultimate fate heroically. Design and direction: Chandradasan.                    Event: Play in Malayalam, Karnavaram, produced by Lok Dharmi (Kerala) When amp; Where: Today at Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB 201 Salt Lake; 6 pm amp; tomorrow at Rabindra Sadan; 6 pm

                      Spontaneous strokes                    A restless, effusive and prolific artist in search of an indefinite goal, Eleena Banik appears to wear her heart and art on her sleeves. Life and human beings are the main source of inspiration for her art. Sometimes painting with the unbridled joy of a child or, with the gentle and loving instincts of a mother and still, at other times, with the harshness and violence of wild beasts, she spontaneously portrays the agonies and esctasies of her own life. While her early works were of a more symbolic nature and invested with multiple layers of meaning, her recent compositions, on show at the ongoing exhibition, are more colourful, direct and representational. Free of the confines of contemporary urban issues that dominated her earlier themes, they transport the viewer to a world of beauty, dreams and imagination. Warm and sensuous in appeal, her portrayal of flowers, birds and still life are endowed with a raw, earthy power that reminds us of our roots.                  lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by Eleena Banik lWhen: Till March 15 (except Sunday); 2 pm - 7 pm lWhere: Akar Prakar, P 238 Hindustan Park

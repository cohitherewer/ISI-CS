	Residents of Metiabruz and Garden Reach are living in fear following a clash between two gangs on Sunday night.        
	Since then, the majority of women and children on Rameshwarpur Road are staying indoors while the men are returning home before sunset. Many believe that another clash between the gangs is on the cards.        
	Both sides are fully prepared. It is only a matter of time before they clash again, said Mohammed Zameer, a barber on Rameshwarpur Road. He had to shut down his shop because the chairs and glasses were damaged.        
	According to residents and police, Khurshid and Shahzada alias Angrez, associates of a Diwan Bagan-based gangster Mukhtar, visited a shanty on Rameshwarpur Road to buy ganja around 9pm on Sunday. When Sajid, who runs the makeshift shop, demanded money for the contraband, the youths beat him up.They could not, however, leave the area. A gang of Sajids men blocked the duos path and beat them up with iron rods. Shahzada was badly hurt in the clash.         
	Around 10pm, 150 youths from Diwan Bagan, carrying iron rods, choppers and pistols, came to Rameshwarpur Road on motorcycles and started looking for Sajid and his men. Failing to find them, the mob vandalised shops and residences on the ground floor. The residents alleged that the youths took away cash, jewellery and even goats and chicken from shops.         
	Mohammed Akbars ground-floor flat at P-219 Rameshwarpur Road was among the worst affected. Nothing in the three rooms was left untouched.        
	It was a nightmare. Over 100 youths with rods, pistols and choppers were running amok. They destroyed everything they could lay their hands on. They broke our refrigerator, television and the main door of the house. They also attacked passers-by, who luckily escaped with minor injuries, said Akbars wife Khadija Begum.        
	The youths from the locality are planning to attack Diwan Bagan for revenge, said residents of Rameshwarpur Road.        
	We have arrested three persons. Raids are on to arrest more criminals, said the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, Ajey Ranade.

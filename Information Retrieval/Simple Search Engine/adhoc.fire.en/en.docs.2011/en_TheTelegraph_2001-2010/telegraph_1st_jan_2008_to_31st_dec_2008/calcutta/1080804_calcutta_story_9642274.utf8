                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mail probe focus on youth
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sleuths probing Tuesdays hoax terror mail are now looking for a youth in his mid-20s.        
	Sabitri Dandapat, who worked in the Salt Lake cyber cafe from where the mail was allegedly sent, had spoken of a youth who came on a motorcycle on Tuesday evening and was on the Net for around 10 minutes.        
	Taking Sabitri along, a team from the detective department of the city police carried out a door-to-door search in IA block, where the cyber caf was located, and its adjoining areas on Saturday night.        
	Based on Sabitris description, the sleuths have prepared a sketch of the youth. She saw the youth talking over his cellphone. He was looking nervous. It seems the youth had sent the hoax mail, said an investigating officer.        
	Sabitri told the police that the youth was a familiar face at the cyber caf.        
	She said the youth had spent not more than 10 minutes at the cafe. She also noticed him surfing the Net and checking his mail box, the officer added.        
	Hours after the mail threatening serial blasts in Salt Lake and parts of the city was sent, we arrested the cyber cafe owner Kaushik Basu. The next day, Sabitri was held. But we have not come across any evidence to prove that the mail was sent either by Kaushik or Sabitri, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department.        
	Both Kaushik and Sabitri, in police remand for 14 days, told the police that they had never allowed customers to use gadgets like CDs, floppies and pen drives to protect computers from virus.        
	The terror mail was sent barely 10 minutes after the ID, khalid50rocketmail.com, was created. We suspect the youth had saved the content of the mail in the draft box of another account and pasted it after creating the new account. We are yet to trace the other ID because the records were all deleted, said an officer working on this case.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Patients suffer in hospital

	Treatment of patients at Medical College and Hospital was affected for the second consecutive day on Sunday, with nearly 150 junior doctors continuing their indefinite relay hunger strike and cease-work.         
	Hospital sources said patients at the emergency had to wait for a long time for treatment, with few junior doctors showing up for work.         
	Jorasanko resident Biswajit Jha, 27, who sustained injuries in his limbs while playing football, had to wait for two hours at the emergency before the doctors examined him.        
	One of the doctors said I had fractured my arm while the other said it was a minor injury. I could not decide whom to trust, so I approached a private practitioner, said Jha.        
	The agitating junior doctors threatened to stop work at the department from Tuesday if their meeting with the authorities on Monday afternoon did not yield satisfactory results.        
	The interns, who are members of the Medical College Democratic Students Association, started the agitation after the authorities asked 200 boarders of the main hostel to leave on Friday, following a clash between two groups.        
	We know that the patients are being inconvenienced but we cannot work unless our demands are met, said Soumya Bag, a leader of the association.        
	We will try to resolve the issue on Monday. We have appealed to the interns to join work. Their demands can be met through discussions, said Anup Roy, the medical superintendent of Medical College.

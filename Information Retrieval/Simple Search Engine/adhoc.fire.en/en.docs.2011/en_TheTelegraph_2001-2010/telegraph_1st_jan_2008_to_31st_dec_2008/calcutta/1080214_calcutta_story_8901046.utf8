                      Epistle of memories                    A pioneer of the New Wave, progressive cinema in India, Saeed Akhtar Mirza is known for his passion for simplicity, authenticity and verisimilitude. His debut novel, Ammi: Letter to a Democratic Mother, gives a deeply lyrical, personal and polemical account of growing up in an India that is transforming itself. Making everyday events tell a complex story, Mirzas narrative interweaves memories of his mother with the living political creed she believed in  the egalitarian ethos of a democratic faith coupled with a deep inquiring faith in religion. This evening, Starmark, in association with Westland Books, will release the book. A tale that enmeshes love, personal memories and history with a critique on war, it promises to provide the reader an exotic bouquet of experiences.                  Event: Release of Saeed Mirzas Ammi: Letter to a Democratic Mother When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Starmark Bookstore, South City Mall

Hail a convoy!
  - Governor stops to offer father-daughter duo airport ride          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	The cool cab is passe, the cool convoy is here.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi bent protocol early on Monday to stop and offer a lift to two airport-bound passengers trudging down AJC Bose Road flyover after their car had broken down. The two lucky travellers hopped into one of the cars in the convoy without even knowing who their pre-Diwali benefactor was.        
	According to Raj Bhavan sources, Gandhi was on his way to the airport to catch a morning flight when he spotted an elderly man and a young woman making their way towards the Park Circus crossing with bag and baggage.        
	The governor instructed his driver to stop and sent an official accompanying him to find out where the two were headed. The father-daughter duo said they were on their way to the airport but their car had broken down on the flyover and there was no cab in sight on the cloudy and windy morning.              
	The official narrated their plight to the governor who promptly asked him to offer them a lift in one of the convoy cars, said a source at Raj Bhavan.        
	The father in his 60s and the daughter in her 30s were seated in one of the cars and the convoy sped off towards the airport.        
	We would have missed our flight if you hadnt offered us a lift, the two told the official.        
	Throughout their journey to the airport the father and daughter did not realise they were part of the governors convoy.         
	When the driver finally revealed that the vehicle in which they were travelling was part of Gopalkrishna Gandhis convoy, the father-daughter duo were stunned.        
	They were initially tongue-tied but after reaching the airport they met the governor and thanked him for extending a helping hand to ordinary citizens, the Raj Bhavan source said.

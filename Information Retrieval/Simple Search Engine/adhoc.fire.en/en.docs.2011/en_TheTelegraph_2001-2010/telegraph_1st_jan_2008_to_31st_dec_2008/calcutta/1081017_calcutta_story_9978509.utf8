The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Techies seek a shield
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Techies seek a shield
  - Union goes from bad word to buzzword in Sector V          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                                    
	A bad u is suddenly becoming a good u for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees blue-eyed tech brigade.        
	Union was always a bad word to utter in Sector V. But now things have changed so dramatically that many of us are desperately seeking union support for the sake of job security, admitted 28-year-old Sangeeta Ghosh (name changed), who has been with an information technology (IT) major for 15 months.        
	The squeeze in the IT sector linked to the economic crisis in the US has seen pink slips, pay freeze and cancellation of bonuses spreading fear in the tech township. And now the sacking in the aviation sector has sent a shiver down the spine of Sector V.        
	We need a proper forum where we can voice our grievances and which can come forward to rally against exploitative practices that have become a part of Sector V, said an employee of an IT giant, puffing away on a Benson amp; Hedges Lights, in front of the companys sprawling campus.        
	So what does the young techie pursuing the great American dream turn to in his nightmare hour? The necessary evil called unions.        
	We are aware of the role played by unions in the flight of industry from Bengal. But when ones job is at stake, one does not really think of the implications of unionisation on the IT sector in Bengal. Today, a strong union in Sector V is something of a necessary evil, said a techie who has an appointment letter dated June 2008 but no joining date yet.        
	The West Bengal IT Services Association formed in November 2006 is a Citu-affiliated union for employees of the IT sector. But few techies know about it and even fewer are convinced about its role.        
	Where was the union when pink slips were being handed out by companies? demanded a benched employee of an IT company. We need a forum with representatives from all companies in Sector V monitoring the situation constantly instead of just surfacing during bandhs.        
	With pro-union whispers doing the rounds of call centres and canteens, leaders of the West Bengal IT Services Association stopped short of saying we told you so.        
	IT employees have looked upon the association as a disruptive influence till now though we have been very restrained, said one.        
	No senior manager was willing to comment on the growing union buzz in Sector V, but employees confirmed that affiliation with unions could lead to action being taken against them by the companies.

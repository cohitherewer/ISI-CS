                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HC glare on Besu for student dilemma
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Besu has been asked to issue a clarification on its admission rules. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) is facing judicial scrutiny for allowing a student who had got provisional admission to a masters course to write the first semester test without confirming that she had passed the B.Sc examination.        
	Calcutta High Court (HC) on Monday asked Besu to clarify which rule empowered it to allow Tanushree Dutta to enrol for an M.Sc course in nutrition and sit for the first semester test without receiving her B.Sc Part I and Part II marksheets.         
	Tanushree had moved court after learning that she had passed the B.Sc Part II examination, but failed for the second time in a Part I paper. She wrote both examinations last year and gained entry into Besu after clearing an entrance test.         
	The arrangement  common in universities across the country  was that she would submit the two marksheets to Besu after Calcutta University declared the B.Sc results.        
	The results were published in March, by which time Tanushree was through with her first semester test. The high court petition was in anticipation of trouble in continuing her M.Sc studies when Besu would ask for her marksheets.        
	Now what will my client do? Her second semester examination will be held this year. So she has filed a case, seeking the courts order to Calcutta University to clarify who is responsible for this situation. She has also sought a court directive to Besu to allow her to sit for the second semester exam, the girls counsel, P.K. Chatterjee, said.        
	Besu counsel Subrata Mukhopadhya will give the clarification sought by the court on Tuesday, when Justice S.P. Talukdar will resume the hearing.        
	Tanushree studied chemistry for her graduation and failed in the same Part I paper in 2006 and 2007.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Howrah weapon untraced
                                                                                                               Howrah weapon untraced
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police have failed to trace the knife with which Srabonti Ghosh was stabbed and also to retrieve the alleged intimate pictures of Samir Barik and Somasree Das that the Jagacha resident had captured on her cellphone.        
	Samir had told the police that Somasree had taken the knife with her after the duo killed Srabonti and her eight-year-old daughter Prapti on February 26.        
	A police team searched Somasrees house, within shouting distance from Srabontis, but could not find the murder weapon.        
	As for the pictures, an officer of Jagacha police station said: Our technical experts are trying to retrieve them. Once recovered, they will help us nail the duo.        
	Samir reportedly took the phone away after the murder and sold it Sanjit Raha, a resident of Duttapukur, in North 24-Parganas, for Rs 2,000.        
	Raha, 35, was produced in a Howrah court during the day to record his statement. He is a key witness in the case, said the officer.        
	Raha told the cops that when he bought the phone, it only contained clips of a few pornographic films downloaded from the Internet. Samir must have deleted the pictures before selling the phone, the officer pointed out.        
	The cops said Samir and Somasree had been to Digha together twice in the past few months. On each occasion, they had stayed there for three days. They introduced themselves as husband and wife in the hotel register, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of police (Howrah).        
	Over the past few weeks, Srabonti, too, was reportedly having an affair with Samir.

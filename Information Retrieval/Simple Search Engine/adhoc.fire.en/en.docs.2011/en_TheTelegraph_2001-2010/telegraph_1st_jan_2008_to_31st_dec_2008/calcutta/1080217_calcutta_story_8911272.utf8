	It is not easy writing novels about India sitting in the West. One of the many literary agents who rejected the manuscript of Neel Mukherjees debut novel, Past Continuous, demanded that he put in more of Indias heat and dust. But Mukherjee has no patience for the petty exotica-mongering and defilement of all things Indian going by the name of Indophilia.         
	Past Continuous is set in Calcutta and Britain. But if Calcutta means nostalgia and College Street and adda and Leftist politics, then this is not your usual Calcutta novel. Neel Mukherjee has no patience for these either. I suppose it would be fair to say that I loathe Calcutta, he says. But his upcoming graphic novel (in collaboration with Tom Uglow) is entirely set in Calcutta circa 1979. A novella awaiting publication has a fair bit of the city. And the novel he is labouring on at the moment is again divided between Calcutta and Britain.        
	If this sounds like too much of a paradox, at least Mukherjee does not shy away from an explanation. Yes, the city has too many unpalatable associations for him and not enough fond memories to urge frequent homecomings since he left it 15 years ago. But the place that one leaves may not leave one as easily. And thus, Bengali cuisine and literature have become the ties that bind. Mukherjee dreams of a history of Bengali food writing, of going boldly into the henshels of Prajnasundari Debi and her sorority as no one has gone before. And a joint family saga, perhaps        
	But writing has become so terribly professionalised in the West that it is difficult to make any headway without an agent, Mukherjee says. In fact, getting access to them is one of the reasons he took a creative writing course at the University of East Anglia after finishing his Ph.D in 1999  even when he wasnt convinced by the idea of being taught how to tell his story. The fact that all 21 in Grantas list of American writers have been to creative writing schools may have helped him decide, though.        
	He did eventually get an agent, but not before having to hear that he should tuck in an affair between Miss Gilby and Nikhilesh in the sub-plot of Past Continuous. The sub-plot tells the story of Miss Gilby, Bimalas teacher and companion in Tagores Ghare Baire. But Mukherjees Miss Gilby is inspired more by Jennifer Kendall in Satyajit Rays film than by Tagores novel, where the British lady is a wink-and-you-miss-her character.        
	Like Ritwik in Past Continuous, who is trying to write the story of Miss Gilby, Mukherjee too swears by a tale well told. As a literary critic, he reads new novels all the time, and has been quite taken with William Maxwell, Elizabeth Taylor and Jhumpa Lahiri in recent times. But it is Austen, George Eliot and Henry James that he loves going back to. A page of James before going to sleep every day has become a habit now. Neel Mukherjee is currently reading The Portrait of a Lady.                    SREYASHI DASTIDAR

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A vacation bench of Calcutta High Court (HC) on Friday asked Calcutta University to allow seven BA and B.Com students, who had been barred from the Part I examinations, to take the test, commencing next week.        
	Justice Aniruddha Bose not only ruled in favour of the seven candidates, but also fined their institutions  Dinabandhu Andrews College and KK Das College  Rs 10,000 each for not ensuring that the university issued them admit cards. The university had penalised the students on the ground that they did not register for the examination within the stipulated period.         
	The students counsel, Subrata Mukhopadhyaya, told the court that his clients paid late fees along with the recommended examination charges but were told by their colleges  three of the students are from Dinabandhu Andrews and the rest from KK Das  that the university had abolished the late-fee system.         
	There was no official circular from the university in this regard, Mukhopadhyaya said.        
	Advocate Sambuddha Basu, who represented Calcutta University, said the two colleges were yet to send the application forms of the petitioners.         
	Although the students can now appear for the examinations, their results will not be disclosed till the court gives the green signal. The case will be heard by the regular bench after the high court reopens on June 2, Mukhopadhyaya said.

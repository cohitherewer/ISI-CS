        Celebrating candid clarity
   Celebrating all that is good and beautiful about our world, the current exhibition of photographs by Bibek Guha reminds us of the possibility of finding true peace and happiness in spite of all the hatred and cruelty that has ravaged our existence. Realising the importance of communicating with nature, Guha rsquo;s photographs symbolize his conviction that proximity with nature can restore mankind to its inherent softnesses, its inherent humanity. He almost pleadingly reminds us of the need to love ourselves, capturing everyday moments and freezing them to make us realise what all we may be leaving behind in the mad rush to get ahead. Through well-defined images of sparkling clarity, he expresses his own love for truth and honesty, which, he believes, can cause a universal purgation of evil mdash; both within and without, making our world a beautiful place to live in. 

 Event: Celebration of Life, an exhibition of photographs by Bibek Guha When: Till January 9; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Gaganendra Pradarshashala, Calcutta Information Centre, Ground Floor

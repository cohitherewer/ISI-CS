          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 62-year-old man and 12-year-old girl died in government hospitals on Thursday, allegedly waiting for doctors and nurses to attend to them. Relatives of both lodged complaints with the hospital authorities.        
	Prahlad Parui, who was admitted to the cardiology department of SSKM Hospital on Sunday evening, died on Thursday morning, allegedly after being denied medical care at night.        
	There was neither a doctor nor a nurse around. Around 2am, my grandfathers condition began to deteriorate but no one attended to him. Patients in adjacent beds gave him water and tried to comfort him till he passed away, said Paruis grandson, Uttam Jana.        
	According to him, Parui was fine the night before and had dinner at the hospital.        
	A middle-aged man undergoing treatment on a bed near Paruis said he woke up to the sound of the old man on bed V2 gasping for breath and asking for water. We looked around for a nurse or ayah but they were all gone. We gave him water and tried our best to ease his agony but he passed away before morning.        
	Paruis family submitted a written complaint to Ashok Ghosh, the medical superintendent of SSKM.         
	The hospital has started a probe. We will speak to the nursing superintendent and find out who was responsible for the lapse. I have asked the patients relatives to meet me after a week, said Ghosh.        
	At Chittaranjan Sishu Sadan in Bhowanipore, thalassaemia patient Sujata Naskar died at 11.30am, barely three hours after she was admitted with high fever.        
	We repeatedly asked the nurses to call a senior doctor but they didnt budge. The child died after a doctor finally came and asked the nurses to immediately arrange for blood transfusion, said Sujatas aunt Sabita Naskar.        
	The family members alleged that they had pressured nurses and junior doctors to arrange for blood transfusion, but they kept saying that it was just a fever.        
	Sujatas family members and their friends agitated outside the hospital and submitted a written complaint to the authorities. Local councillor Manila Chowdhury said she would lodge a complaint with the state health department.        
	The hospital authorities said the girl was critical when she was brought in and died of respiratory distress.

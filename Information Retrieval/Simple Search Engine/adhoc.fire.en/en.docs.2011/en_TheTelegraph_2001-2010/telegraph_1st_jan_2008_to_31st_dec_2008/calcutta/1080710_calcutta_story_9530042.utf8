	Showers lashed the city on Wednesday, with the Met office recording the seasons second highest rainfall so far.        
	Calcutta received 51.4 mm of rainfall in 24 hours, till 8.30pm on Wednesday.         
	The Met office warned of isolated heavy rainfall in Calcutta and its adjacent areas in the next 24 hours.        
	The seasons highest rainfall  114 mm  was recorded in 12 hours from 8.30pm on June 16 to 8.30am on June 17. The 24-hour rainfall recorded on Wednesday night is the second highest, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	Civic officials claimed that except for Thanthania, no other city pocket suffered major waterlogging. But Metro found Mahatma Gandhi Road waterlogged on Wednesday. With the tracks submerged, tram services were disrupted for over an hour in the morning.        
	Traffic movement was slow in parts of central Calcutta because of the rain.        
	Met officials said the rain was triggered by a low pressure area over interior Orissa and adjoining Jharkhand and a cyclonic circulation over Gangetic Bengal and the north Bay of Bengal. The cyclonic circulation moved closer to the low pressure area on Wednesday. The combined effect triggered the rain, said an official.        
	Child dies         
	A two-year-old girl drowned after accidentally falling into an open drain adjacent to her house in Ramnagar Lane, Garden Reach, on Wednesday evening.        
	The drain was overflowing after the downpour. Police said Sania had stepped out of her house alone around 6pm and failing to make out the drain, fell into it. Neighbours could not rescue the child.         
	The body, entangled in garbage that had clogged the drain, was finally fished out by a disaster management team around 10.22 pm.

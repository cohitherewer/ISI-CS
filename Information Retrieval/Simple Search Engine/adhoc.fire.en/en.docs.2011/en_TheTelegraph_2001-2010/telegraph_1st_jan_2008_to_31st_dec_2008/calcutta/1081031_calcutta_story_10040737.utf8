          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A senior official of a nationalised bank who was arrested on Monday fell seriously ill during interrogation in police custody and had to be hospitalised on Wednesday evening.         
	On Thursday, the colleagues of Tarun Kumar Chatterjee alleged that he fell ill because of police excesses in the lock-up.        
	Chatterjee, who is admitted to Medical College and Hospital with breathing problems and low pulse, was arrested by the detective department after a dairy owner accused him of siphoning off Rs 42 lakh from his account.         
	He is in a serious state, said a colleague. Its because of the torture he was subjected to in police custody.        
	Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief, said tests revealed Chatterjee had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. We have set up a three-member medical board to look into the matter. The question of police excesses doesnt arise. There was no hurry since he would be in custody till November 6, he said.

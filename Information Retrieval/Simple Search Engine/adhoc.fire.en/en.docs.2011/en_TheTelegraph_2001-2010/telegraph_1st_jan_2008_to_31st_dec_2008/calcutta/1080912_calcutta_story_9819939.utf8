  - Upgrade infrastructure, NAAC tells university          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Jadavpur University has earned kudos from a central watchdog for its academic excellence but was rapped for poor infrastructure on campus and outdated teaching techniques.         
	A five-member team from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), which was on a three-day visit to the campus, pointed out that the classrooms, laboratories and libraries needed immediate upgrade.         
	Jadavpur Universitys academic standard is better than many institutions across the country. It has the potential to grow further. But the infrastructure on campus calls for immediate improvement, a teacher quoted a team member as saying.         
	Most classrooms are cramped and do not have modern seating arrangements. The instruments used in most laboratories are obsolete. The libraries, too, should be more spacious, the member said.         
	The team expressed surprise that the university was yet to implement modern teaching techniques, such as the audio-visual system.         
	As for the campus, the visitors felt it should be more spacious and more tastefully decorated.         
	The team also suggested that the university overhaul its office support system and make administrative work.         
	While praising the academic standard, the NAAC experts also questioned the functioning of some of the departments.         
	They cited that a teacher in the international relations department had not commented on any major national or international issues outside the campus.         
	The Sanskrit department, too, came under the scanner.         
	The NAAC team had come to the campus  the visit ended on Thursday  in connection with the renewal of the universitys accreditation.         
	Five years ago, the NAAC assessed it first, awarding a five-star rating, the highest.        
	Before leaving for the NAAC headquarters in Bangalore on Thursday, the team submitted a preliminary report to the university. Based on the final report, to be prepared shortly, the NAAC will issue a fresh rating.        
	JU vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh admitted that the panel had pointed out a shortage of space on campus and stressed the need for upgrading the infrastructure.         
	In the preliminary report, the team has praised the university for imparting quality education in all three faculties  engineering, science and arts. The panel appreciated our interdisciplinary courses, he added.

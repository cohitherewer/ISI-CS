The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slow Net hits IT hub
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Slow Net hits IT hub
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Business in Bengals tech hub in Sector V continued to suffer on Monday because of slow Internet connectivity.        
	Most companies have multiple service providers. But as three undersea cables are down, even the alternative routes are getting clogged with the additional traffic, said Kalyan Kar, the managing director of Acclaris, a city-based BPO firm.         
	Bigger companies like Wipro, Cognizant Technology Solutions, Tata Consultancy Services and Tech Mahindra, have, however, said the snag hasnt affected them.        
	Vishnu Solutions, another city-based call centre, had reported Internet downtime of five to six hours on Friday. There was very little sign of improvement on Monday.        
	When connectivity is poor, calls do not mature and the rate of call drops go up, which affects our productivity, said Aditya Bajoria, the CEO of Vishnu Solutions.

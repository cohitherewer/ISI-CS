	Mukhtar Ahmed and Tausif Rehman, arrested for allegedly procuring SIM cards that were used by the terrorists in Mumbai, were denied bail on Friday and remanded in judicial custody till January 2.        
	Mukhtar, 39, has been claiming that he is an undercover agent of the Jammu and Kashmir police but there is no confirmation of that yet.        
	Sandip Ghosh, who appeared for the accused in the chief metropolitan magistrates court, said neither the Kashmir police nor Mukhtars family had told him that he was an undercover agent.        
	On December 5, police first netted Tausif who had allegedly picked up 32 SIM cards from the city and handed them over to Mukhtar. A team rounded up Mukhtar in Delhi for passing on the cards to terror groups.        
	The Kashmir police are still mum on Mukhtar. I have no idea who he is. We have not received any communication about him from any quarter, said Kashmir police chief B. Srinivas.        
	Rajeev Kumar, the chief of the state Special Task Force that arrested the duo, however, said he had written to Srinivas on January 11, seeking information about Mukhtar.        
	In Srinagar, Mukhtars family members said they were in the dark about his arrest. I am in touch with my son over the phone. He works for the Kashmir police. The arrested one is my sons namesake, a man identifying himself as Mukhtars father told Metro.

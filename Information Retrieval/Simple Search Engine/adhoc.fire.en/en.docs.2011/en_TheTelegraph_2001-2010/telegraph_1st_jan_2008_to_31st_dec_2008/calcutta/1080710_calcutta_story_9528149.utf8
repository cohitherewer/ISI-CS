                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rail tracks restored partially
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	The damaged railway tracks between Kharagpur and Bhadrak have been partially restored but would take at least six months to be fully operational, the South Eastern Railway said on Wednesday.        
	The tracks were damaged in flash floods last month.        
	We have restored one pair of tracks. The first round of strengthening (of the tracks) was completed on July 1 and trials were conducted successfully,  said an official.        
	The damaged tracks extend over 6.5 km between Bakhrabad and Narayangarh stations in Midnapore West.        
	Following the partial restoration, the South Eastern Railway will run the Chennai Mail the Jagannath Express on the normal route from Thursday and Friday, respectively.        
	The Chennai Mail is being run on a diverted route and the Jagannath Express stands cancelled. A large number of south-bound trains from the Northeast will start running on the normal route from Friday, the official said.        
	He blamed the delay in restoration on the continuing flood situation and fresh rainfall.        
	The area is still under water, which is hampering restoration work. To make matters worse, there has been no let up in rainfall. Engineers and workers are finding it difficult to carry out the repairs, he said.        
	Calcuttas links with south India were snapped following last months heavy showers and the flood. Trains that ran on diverted routes reached destinations hours behind schedule.

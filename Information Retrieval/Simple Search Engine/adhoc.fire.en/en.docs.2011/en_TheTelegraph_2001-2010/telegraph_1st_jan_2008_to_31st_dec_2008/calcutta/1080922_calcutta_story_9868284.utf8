          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Fifty-four cases of dengue have been detected in the past month in ward 30, comprising Narkeldanga and Phoolbagan.        
	The civic authorities, however, claimed that they had not come across any dengue patients in the area.        
	The figures emerged from a study conducted by the National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases, as part of an initiative by the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Seoul-based International Vaccine Institute to develop a dengue vaccine.        
	The state health department was in the dark about the findings till two days ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Huff, puff and holiday
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Huff, puff and holiday
        OUR BUREAU              Bye bye, hookah                 Old habits...                Unhealthy!                 Catch me if you can                    (From top)A guest at Shisha enjoys his last hookah before the smoking ban took effect at midnight;   A Coffee House regular flicks ash under his chair; A person smokes at Medical College and Hospital;A man takes a drag a metre away from a Sealdah bus stop. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha, Bishwarup Dutta and Amit Datta                                                                
	At the stroke of midnight, DJ Girish D of the Camac Street hookah bar Shisha signalled the end of freedom to smoke in a public place by playing the anthemic Sutta one last time. He then welcomed guests to a smoke-free Calcutta. But as the day dawned, it became clear that Calcuttas puff brigade was not only reluctant to give up its freedom but also defiant about the ban. Metro went around town sniffing for smoke and came back choked.  
	Last Sutta at Shisha  
	Place: Shisha        
	When: Midnight, October 1         
	Scene: The watering hole wasnt chock-a-block as usual, probably because the bar was to close at midnight. When the clock struck 12, cigarettes were stubbed out and the hookahs put away. Ladies and gentlemen, we will never play this song again at Shisha, DJ Girish D said, pumping up the volume with Sutta (slang for cigarette) for the last time.         
	Smokers voice: I will miss my hookah. I dont care much about drinks but sitting with a hookah in the company of friends is my idea of chilling out, said Shisha regular Ankit Anchalia.         
	Officialspeak: Business could initially decline by 35 per cent. But once people get used to the smoking ban, we expect it to settle at 10 per cent, said Sovan Mukherjee, the manager of Shisha.  
	Ifs and butts  
	Place: Coffee House        
	Scene: The usual haze of smoke in one of the oldest institutions of College Street was absent on Thursday because of the national holiday. The other noticeable difference was that the tables had no ashtrays and the waiters werent providing matchboxes to those who wanted to smoke. But many of the regulars did not hesitate to light up and blow smoke rings in the air.        
	Smokers voice: I am aware of the ban and I know that smoking here means breaking the law. But I cant help it. Its such an old habit. I was born and brought up in this area and I have been a Coffee House regular. You cant expect me to kick the habit in one day, can you? asked an elderly man who did not want to be named.         
	Had there been a smoking zone, I would have definitely gone there to smoke, he added, flicking the ash off his cigarette under the chair.        
	Officialspeak: People have always been coming here to enjoy a cup of coffee with a cigarette. Many of our regulars argue that it will be difficult to impose the ban on smoking.         
	But we cannot disregard the government notification. We have unofficially told the waiters to remove the ashtrays and request our clients not to smoke, but it will take some time for the ban to be followed by everyone. We will frame newspaper clippings on the ban and put them up for everyone to see the moment they enter this place. We wish the government would give us an official circular to display, said Dipankar Dasgupta, a spokesperson for Coffee House.  
	Stub it out  
	Place: Medical College and Hospital         
	Scene: Some of those who were spotted smoking  mostly relatives of patients admitted to the hospital  claimed to be unaware of the ban. They stubbed out their bidis and cigarettes on being told the ban had come into effect at midnight. Personnel from the Bowbazar police outpost on the hospital premises, too, were unaware of the new law. One of them even lit up near the emergency ward.        
	Smokers voice: I had no idea smoking on the premises was banned, said Sudhir Dutta, a daily-wage worker from Howrah whose 22-day-old grandson was undergoing treatment for pneumonia. It is a good rule. One shouldnt smoke in a hospital, the elderly man said, stubbing out his bidi.        
	Officialspeak: The ban has just come into effect. It will take a few days for everyone to become aware of it. We are in the process of raising awareness among our staff so that they can help implement the ban. We will also speak to the police personnel at the hospital outpost about this, said Anup Roy, the medical superintendent and vice-principal of the hospital.  
	Thin red line  
	Place: Bus stop near Sealdah flyover        
	Scene: Quite a few of those waiting for buses were puffing away, with at least one of them even demarcating a smoking zone at the bus stop.         
	Smokers voice: This ridiculous law cant stop me from smoking, said Samir Dey, a resident of Bagha Jatin. Smoking at a bus stop is not allowed but I am almost a metre away from it and on the road, which is not a public place if one goes by the book.         
	The new law empowers conductors to slap fines but many of them were themselves smoking bidis, leaning against the doors of the buses that came and went.

  - Beniapukur O-C asked to submit report        A STAFF REPORTER                          Lawyer Vimal Kumar Shahis vandalised rooms. A Telegraph picture                                        
	A probe has been ordered into the alleged police vandalism in lawyer Vimal Kumar Shahis rented house in Beniapukur on Monday.        
	Shahi had alleged that two cops from Beniapukur police station and a couple of goons had ransacked two rooms of his house after he protested against illegal constructions and refused to pay extortion money.        
	It seems the lawyer had a dispute with the landlord. A probe is on to ascertain who had vandalised the rooms and why, a senior officer at Lalbazar said on Wednesday. We have asked for a detailed report from the officer-in-charge of Beniapukur police station. Action will be taken if the allegations are found to be true.        
	A team comprising men from Beniapukur police station, special branch and the intelligence wing visited the spot in the morning and spoke to Shahis neighbours.        
	I have narrated the events to the officers and am happy with the proceedings, said Shahi, who practises at Calcutta High Court.        
	The lawyer had alleged in his complaint to additional commissioner (I) S.N. Sarkar and other senior officers that the officer-in-charge of Beniapukur police station, Tarun Kumar Mitra, had engineered the attack.        
	He had stated that Mitra had threatened to put him behind bars when he asked him why the rooms were vandalised. Shahi had planned to set up an office in the rooms.        
	His hostility with the local goons began eight months ago, after he raised his voice against illegal constructions in the area. When he wanted to set up the office, the goons demanded money and threatened to evict him if he refused to pay.        
	Last month, when he went to the police station, Mitra reportedly refused to register his complaint.

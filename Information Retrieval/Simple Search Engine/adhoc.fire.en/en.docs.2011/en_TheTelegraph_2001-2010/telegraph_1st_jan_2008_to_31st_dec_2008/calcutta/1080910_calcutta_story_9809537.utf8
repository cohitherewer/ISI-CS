The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Net safety tips for students
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Net safety tips for students
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Students seeking safety tips for their online jaunts need no longer do a Google search. The popular search engine has teamed up with Calcutta police to teach youngsters how to BeNetSmart.        
	The Internet is extremely popular with the Indian youth. So we decided to launch a programme to educate them about online safety, said Rishi Jaitly, the policy analyst of Google India.        
	In Calcutta, Google India and the police have conducted an awareness campaign in schools and interacted with over 5,000 students in the last seven days.        
	The campaign was taken to Delhi Public School (New Town), St Thomas Girls School, Pretoria High School, Aurobindo Institution, Assembly of God Church School, Mahadevi Birla Girls School, The Heritage School, Abhinaba Bharti School and Ballygunge Government High School.        
	BeNetSmart is an interactive campaign focusing on students from Class VI and above.         
	Between Classes VI and XII, almost every student uses the Internet. And with increasing instances of cyber crime, such a programme has become imperative, said Rupak Home Roy, the principal of Ballygunge Government High School.        
	The students were warned against providing information like their names, phone numbers and dates of birth to strangers on the Net, adding unknown people to their list of friends, filling up fun questionnaires without consulting elders and meeting up with people they have known only online.        
	They were also asked to be careful about posting pictures of themselves and friends online and advised to consult parents before downloading any applications.        
	The police, who selected nine schools for the campaign, have requested Google to do a similar programme in colleges.

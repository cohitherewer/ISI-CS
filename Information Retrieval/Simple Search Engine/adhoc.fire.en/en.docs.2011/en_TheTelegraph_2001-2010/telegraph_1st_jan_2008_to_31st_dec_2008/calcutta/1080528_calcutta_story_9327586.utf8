                      Vignettes of a souls inner vision                    Creativity arises out of the tension between spontaneity and limitations, the latter (like the river banks) forcing the spontaneity into various forms that are essential to the work of art or poem. Nothing can be more apt to describe the works of the gifted sculptor/singer Durgadas. A devastating vision problem that led to total blindness at a critical juncture of his life could not daunt Durgadas, the blessed soul, born with the vision and power of the third eye. When introducing his disciple, Durgadas mentor and teacher Ramananda Bandopadhyay argues and insists a person who has succeeded in kindling his inner spirit with the fire of creativity needs no external illumination at all. True, indeed. Durgadas finds greater assistance for his creativity through physical contact and feeling with clay, a medium introduced to him by Bandopadhyay. His works are simple, mostly symmetrical and comprises human figures in groups or in isolation, in various postures. The pieces are medium-sized, vibrant and pulsating with a life force infused by the sculptor himself.                  Event: Inner Vision, an exhibition of terracotta sculptures by Durgadas When: Till May 30; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place, Telephone: 2460 4245

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The National Commission for Minorities has asked Jadavpur University (JU) to submit a report on the procedure it follows to appoint a teacher in the geological science department.        
	A source in JU said the commission had sent the letter following a complaint from Babar Ali Shah, a research scholar in JUs geological science department, who had alleged that he had been denied lectureship as he was from a minority community.        
	Shah, who is doing post-doctoral research in applied geology, had sent copies of the complaint to the President, Prime Minister, Bengal governor, Lok Sabha Speaker, University Grants Commission, state and national minority commissions, and the state minority affairs department.        
	He had urged the national minority commission to take action against the university.        
	Responding to Shahs complaint, the national panel had written to the university on November 17, asking the authorities to send a report on the selection procedure within 21 days.        
	We are preparing the report. It will be sent to the commission very soon, said pro vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta, who is now officiating as vice-chancellor.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who is also the university chancellor, has asked the authorities to look into Shahs complaint and take appropriate action.         
	JU officials said a copy of the report to be sent to the minorities panel would be forwarded to the chancellors office.        
	Shah had mentioned in his complaint that the person who had been selected for the post, a research fellow from IIT Mumbai, was less qualified than him. Shah has a Ph.D but the research fellow from Mumbai hasnt.        
	Its unfortunate that I have not been selected even though I feel I am adequately qualified... This is an ideal example of deprivation of a minority community, Shah had written.

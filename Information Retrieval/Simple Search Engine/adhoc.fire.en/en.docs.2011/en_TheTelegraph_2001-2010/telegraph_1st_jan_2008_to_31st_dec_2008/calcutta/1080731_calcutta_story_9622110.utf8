                      Natural soulscapes                    The familiar and the fantastic merge in uncanny fashion in the paintings of Sukanta Das. Portraying a beautiful relationship between man and nature, his works are primarily figurative expressions of an ideal world. Colorscape II, the ongoing solo show of his paintings, finds the artist using symbols and motifs from everyday life that add a dash of magic and romance to otherwise realistic compositions. Juxtaposing the mundane with the exotic, his paintings are unique in terms of style and technique. The feminine form is one of his most cherished, recurrent themes. A fleshy, contoured form with an air of other-worldliness, his women are placed in context against a foreground of exotic, ornamental foliage. Done in acrylic and mixed media on canvas, the paintings reflect the artists romantic, happy spirit.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Sukanta Das When: Till August 3; 3 pm - 7 pm Where: Kanvas Art Gallery, 53 Syed Amir Ali Avenue, 2nd floor

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | B.Com makes a debut
                                                                                                               B.Com makes a debut
  - 100 seats in honours course          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Scottish Church College, in north Calcutta, will go with commerce from the 2008-09 session. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Scottish Church College will introduce a B.Com (Honours) course from the 2008-09 academic session. There will be 100 seats and classes will be held between 6am and 10am.        
	The timing will help students who want to pursue a job simultaneously. The students can also take part in campus recruitments, said principal J. Abraham.        
	Admission forms will be distributed from May, along with those of the other courses starting in July. We are yet to decide on holding an admission test or on the cut-off marks, Abraham added.        
	The course will be run by four to five full-time teachers and a few guest lecturers from the corporate sector.         
	A National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) team had visited the college in 2004 and advised the authorities to start an additional course to ensure optimum use of the infrastructure.        
	We were receiving a number of queries about commerce studies from within and outside the state, prompting us to start the course. Calcutta University gave the go-ahead in 2007, Abraham said.         
	The college will buy books worth Rs 2-3 lakh for the B.Com students before the session starts.        
	There are no plans to start M.Com, though. We offer Bachelor of Business Administration and are thinking of starting a Master of Business Administration course. But now, there is a space crunch, said Abraham.        
	The college had fetched a Grade A rating from NAAC and the University Grants Commission has recognised it as a college with potential for excellence.

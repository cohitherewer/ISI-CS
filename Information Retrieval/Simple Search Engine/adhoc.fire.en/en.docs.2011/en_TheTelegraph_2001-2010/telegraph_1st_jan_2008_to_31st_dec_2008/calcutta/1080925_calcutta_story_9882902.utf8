                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Morgue body nibbled
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Family members of a homemaker who committed suicide refused to accept her body at the NRS Hospital morgue on Wednesday after finding her face nibbled.         
	According to Uma Sais relatives, animals had nibbled at her nose, fingers and legs. They sought action by Entally police station and the hospital authorities. After persuasion by senior policemen, the family members accepted the body after almost five hours.        
	The 27-year-old woman hanged herself on Sunday in her Raja Rajendra Lal Mitra Road home in Beleghata reportedly over her husbands financial problems.        
	Swapan Kumar Adhikari, a neighbour of the couple, said: The police took a few snaps and sent the body for post-mortem in the afternoon. On Monday, we met workers at the morgue and asked them to preserve the body for one more day as Umas family members, who live in Orissa, had not yet reached the city.         
	The workers allegedly demanded Rs 1,000 to preserve the body properly. We showed them a letter from the local councillor requesting the hospital employees to cooperate with Umas relatives. The workers took Rs 200 and asked us to go away, added Adhikari.        
	Hospital superintendent L.K. Ghosh said: I am not aware of the details of the incident. Though the matter pertains to the forensic department, I have sought a written complaint so that I can inform my superiors for necessary action.

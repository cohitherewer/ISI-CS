                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Civic funds to fix nawabs relics
  - ASI TO DRAW UP RS 42-LAKH RESTORATION BLUEPRINT          A STAFF REPORTER                          The imambara of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah in Metiabruz is set to be restored with civic funds. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Wajid Ali Shahs relics in Metiabruz will finally get a sheen as the civic body has agreed to fund the Rs 42-lakh restoration project undertaken by the South 24-Parganas administration.        
	The last nawab of Awadh, or Oudh, spent the last 30 years of his life in Metiabruz, after being dethroned by the East India Company.        
	The restoration will be undertaken under the guidance of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), said an official. The ASI will restore Shahs tomb, the imambara where he lived, the concert hall or majlishi and the mosque where the deposed nawab used to offer namaz.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation had earlier decided to offer Rs 10 lakh to the district authorities for the project. But following a request from district magistrate Sanghamitra Ghosh, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya agreed to shoulder the entire cost. The district magistrate is an ex-officio member of the Sibtainabad Trust that looks after the properties.        
	Calcutta is indebted to Wajid Ali Shah for the nawabi flavour in its culture, cuisine and dance. He was a poet, playwright, dancer and a patron of the arts, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	We are happy that the CMC has alloted funds for the nawabs relics. The imambara and the mosque at Iron Gate need immediate repairs. The structures are more than 150 years old, said trust secretary Hasan Naqbi. An ASI team has visited the site and is preparing a blueprint of the restoration.        
	More than two lakh tourists from Ayodhya, Lucknow and even abroad visit the relics every year, said a trust member.        
	Shah (1822-1887), the 10th and last nawab of the princely kingdom of Awadh, had ascended the throne in 1847. But he was deposed, imprisoned and sent to exile in Calcutta by the East India Company a few days before the ninth anniversary of his coronation.

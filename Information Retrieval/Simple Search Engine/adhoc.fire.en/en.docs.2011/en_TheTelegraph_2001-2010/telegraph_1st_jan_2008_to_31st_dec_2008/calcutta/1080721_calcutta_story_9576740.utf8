          A STAFF REPORTER                          Firemen try to douse the blaze at Nandaram market. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The fire services department is raising a special force for quick intervention during a blaze.        
	We will introduce the force within two months, fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee said.        
	Modelled on Rapid Action Force of the state police, the force will comprise 600 firefighters, including 50 women. This is the first time women are being recruited in an active fire-fighting team.        
	Earlier, women in the fire services department were only assigned clerical work. Appointing women fire-fighters was deemed necessary as we often face problems while rescuing women victims, the minister pointed out.        
	Graduates and postgraduates in science and engineering diploma holders will be recruited in rapid action team. The recruits, to be trained at the Institute of Fire Services, in Behala, will be in the age group of 20 to 27 years. Once they cross 27, they will be absorbed into the general fire-fighting team, the minister said.        
	During a major blaze, like the one that engulfed Nandaram market in January, the rapid action team will rush to the spot first, to be followed by general fire-fighting teams.        
	The announcement on raising the special force follows the governments decision to procure advanced fire-fighting equipment, including heat and fire-proof proximity suits and 20 seven-layered proximity suits.         
	The state has sanctioned Rs 30.60 crore for the procurement from abroad.

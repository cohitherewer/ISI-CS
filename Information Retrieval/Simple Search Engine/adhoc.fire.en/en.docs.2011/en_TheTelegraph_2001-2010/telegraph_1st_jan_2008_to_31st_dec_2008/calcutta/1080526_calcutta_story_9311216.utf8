The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC sweats over property tax table
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CMC sweats over property tax table
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	After trying unsuccessfully for four years to work out a formula for calculation of area-specific property tax, the civic authorities have realised that it is a task best left to the experts.        
	The valuation committee that will now carry out the job includes a deputy municipal commissioner of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and representatives of the Institute of Surveyors and Valuers, National Institute of Urban Studies and the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta.        
	We will introduce area-wise house tax in April 2009. The idea is to benefit those flat or house-owners who live in areas that are not as developed as some parts of the city but pay the same amount of tax, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said.         
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) decided to reform the tax structure at the behest of the Asian Development Bank, which had set five conditions for granting a $220 million loan in December 2001 for the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project.         
	Over the past 50 years, tax has been calculated on the basis of the notional rent a flat or a building could fetch, if let out. The concept of notional rent is arbitrary and, by all accounts, encourages corruption.        
	A team of senior officials, led by the municipal commissioner, left for Ahmedabad on Friday for first-hand knowledge of the area-wise tax structure in that city. The team includes the director of the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, Santanu Basu, and chief manager (revenue) Aniruddha Mukherjee.         
	The valuation committees brief is to break up the 187-sq-km municipal area into blocks, based on valuation of land. The office of the inspector-general of registration is helping us determine the area-wise value of land at government rates, Bandyopadhyay said.

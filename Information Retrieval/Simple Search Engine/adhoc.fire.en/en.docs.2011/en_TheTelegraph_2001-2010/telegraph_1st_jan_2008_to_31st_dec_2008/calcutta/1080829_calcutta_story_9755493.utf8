The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Another flight to Dhaka
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another flight to Dhaka
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta will get one more flight to Dhaka, to take off on September 24.        
	United Airways of Bangladesh will operate the flight, becoming the fifth airline to enter the route. Around five flights now operate on the route.        
	Calcutta will be the first international destination for the airline which launched its domestic operations in Bangladesh 14 months ago. The second international destination will be Kathmandu, said Jilanee F.R. Chowdhury, the director (sales and marketing) of United Airways.        
	The Bangladesh government allowed the airline to start international flights eight months after it launched domestic operations. The government has eased the regulations for starting international operations. There are 14 criteria which an airline should fulfil to operate international flights, said Chowdhury. In India, an airline has to be in domestic operations for at least five years before it is granted international flying rights.        
	United Airways will operate a daily flight between the two cities. We hope to get the permission to operate a second daily flight on the route soon, Chowdhury added.         
	The minimum one-way fare will be around Rs 3,800. In Air India Express and GMG Airlines, the minimum one-way fares are around Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,800, respectively.        
	The airline will operate a 37-seat Dash-8-100 aircraft in the sector. The small aircraft is ideal for short-haul destinations like Calcutta and Kathmandu. We are planning to purchase six more aircraft, said an official. It is planning to add Airbus 310 or Boeing 737-800 aircraft to the fleet for Southeast Asia and Dubai.

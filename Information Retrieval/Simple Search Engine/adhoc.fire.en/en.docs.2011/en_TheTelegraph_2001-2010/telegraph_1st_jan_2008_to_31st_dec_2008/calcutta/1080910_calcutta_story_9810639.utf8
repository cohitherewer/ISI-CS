                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       JU quota berth for general student
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday asked Jadavpur University (JU) to admit a student from the general category to a seat reserved for an SC/ST candidate that has been lying vacant.        
	Justice Tapen Sens order will allow Indrani Mukherjee to take provisional admission in the B.Tech (architecture) course, where seven reserved seats have been lying vacant.        
	The judge, however, ruled that Indranis admission could be cancelled depending on the final outcome of the case.        
	The resident of Dakshineswar had ranked 42,725 in the Joint Entrance Examination (engineering) in 2008. During counselling, she had sought a seat in the B.Tech (architecture) course in JU but was offered one in the pharmacology department.        
	Indrani, who has also cracked the National Aptitude Test in Architecture (held to select candidates for private colleges), moved the court seeking an order directing JU to admit her in the architecture course.         
	My client should be given a berth in the architecture department where SC/ST seats are lying vacant, said Indranis lawyer Nandini Mitra.        
	Justice Sens order followed state counsel Subrata Mukhopadhyays submission that the government had decided to convert reserved seats into general ones in its educational institutions if there were not enough SC/ST candidates in a particular year.        
	A recent Supreme Court ruling had empowered state governments to do so, explained Mukhopadhyay. Citing an example, the state counsel said Besu had admitted five general category students in the reserved seats for the B.Tech (architecture) course.

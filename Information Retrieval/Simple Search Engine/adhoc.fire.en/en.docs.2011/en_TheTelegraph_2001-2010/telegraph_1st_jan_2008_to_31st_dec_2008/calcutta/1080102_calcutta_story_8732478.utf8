 - Campus violence inquiry blames CPM-backed unions
     MITA MUKHERJEE
                         
	The report of a one-man commission, set up by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee after violence at Jadavpur University (JU) last April, has landed the campus authorities in a fix.
    
	The 250-page report, prepared by Ashoke Mohan Chakraborty, the additional chief secretary in charge of higher education, is yet to be made public, but Metro has learnt of its contents.
    
	From raising questions on the role of the CPM-backed employees union in fuelling campus violence to holding the SFI partly responsible for the trouble, the red-hot report has not spared the unions supported by the ruling party (see box). 
    
	This is a major loss of face for the authorities. Probably thats the reason why the report has not been made public, said a source. 
    
	Chakraborty submitted his report to Bhattacharjee on October 17. It was forwarded to JU and the education department.
    
	According to the report, members of We the Independents and the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union (Fetsu)  anti-CPM students bodies  could not be held fully responsible for the April 5 violence.
    
	JU was on the boil for a fortnight in April after the student body elections in the science faculty. Skirmishes followed alleged attacks on members of We the Independents on April 5, and the office of Karmachari Samsad was ransacked and allegedly set ablaze.
    
	Sources in JU told Metro that the report highlighted lapses on the part of the university authorities in maintaining internal security.
    
	Besides questioning the role of the Samsad and SFI activists in maintaining peace on campus, the authorities attempts to distance the SFI from the trouble have also come under the Chakraborty commissions scanner.
    
	But the university is yet to act on the report. 
    
	JU vice-chancellor P.N. Ghosh refused to elaborate on the report but said necessary steps were being taken to place it before the executive council.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Heavy rain in next 24 hours
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Met office on Tuesday warned of heavy rain at isolated places in Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal districts in the next 24 hours.        
	A cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) had developed over Gangetic Bengal on Monday evening, leading to rapid development of thunderclouds over Calcutta and its adjoining areas. Also, a trough of low pressure, common during the monsoon, passes over Gangetic Bengal.        
	Under the combined effect of the two atmospheric systems, there may be heavy rainfall at isolated places in Calcutta and elsewhere in the districts, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	Tuesdays satellite picture showed dark clouds hanging over Calcutta and the rest of south Bengal.        
	Dense thunderclouds have been forming over Calcutta since Monday night, leading to several spells of sharp showers, said an official. Till 8.30pm on Tuesday, the Met office recorded 48mm of rainfall.        
	The intensity of the rainfall, however, will reduce from Wednesday afternoon. The city will receive most of the showers in this phase by Tuesday night. From Wednesday afternoon onward, the intensity will decline unless a new system develops. The sky over Calcutta is likely to remain cloudy on Wednesday, the official said.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The MD degree of a city-based doctor has come under the legal scanner.        
	The doctor, Indranil Chakraborty, moved a petition in the high court on Friday, challenging the state medical councils chargesheet which accused him of flaunting a fake MD (diabetology) degree.        
	Hearing will start in a couple of days, said an official.        
	According to the council, Chakraborty had claimed that he had obtained the MD degree from California University. He did his MBBS from Calcutta University.        
	This is a serious offence. Chakrabortys registration can be cancelled, said a lawyer representing the council. Police had moved the council following a complaint from a patient.        
	Terming the councils action discriminatory, the doctor said: I never said I held an MD degree. The MD certificate was issued by the American Diabetic Association, which is registered with California University. MD stands for Medical Doctor.

                      Bandonen rhythms                    It is hardly known that the bandonen is not an Argentinian original, but the invention of a German music store owner called Heinrich Band. Band named it bandonion in Krefeld in Germany in 1850. From this small city in the Rheinland, the bandonion found many admirers, first in Germany, where whole bandonion-orchestras were founded, then, all around the world, specially in South America and Argentina, where the renamed bandonen remains the most important instrument for tango music. One of the most well-known soloists of the instrument in the music world, Lothar Hensel presents this evening a solo bandonen recital, Die Klage des Bandonen (Lament of the Bandonen), taking the audience on a musical voyage from Bach to tango to the Beatles. In his critically acclaimed performance, Hensel introduces this fascinating instrument and traces its musical roots and traditions from Germany to Argentina and beyond.                    Event: A bandonen recital by Lothar Hensel When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Max Mueller Bhavan

										      Calcuttan of the week                                    
	Name: Mohammad Rafique (picture left by Sanat Kumar Sinha)        
	Age: 49        
	Why is he special? For four months, Rafique has been holding classes for underprivileged children who live near his home in Rajabazar.         
	English and Urdu classes are held for 40-odd children between five and 10-years-old for two hours every morning at SM Zakir Hussain Academy and Health Care. The classroom is a 250 sq ft room spared by Rafiques friend Naqi Akhtar, a businessman.        
	Some of the children go to school regularly but the rest cannot because they have to help their families financially, says Rafique.        
	In the evening, students of Class IX and X are taught the Madhyamik curriculum, he adds. Most of the students cannot pay fees. Those who can, pay Rs 50 per month. Most of the teachers do not take money.         
	The cost of running the centre, including electricity and stationery bills, amounts to nearly Rs 5,000 per month. Most of the money comes from Akhtars pockets. Rafique tries to raise funds and sometimes contributes himself.        
	I stress on science. Three teachers teach the science subjects, said Rafique. The classes were started for the boys but now the girls outnumber them.         
	A homoeopathic doctor treats residents of the area at the centre every morning.         
	Background: I started studying at the age of 17 and had to arrange for my tuition fees because my father died when I was young, said Rafique. He worked in a press to help his family. But later switched over to making bidis since it allowed him time to study.         
	Rafique completed his MA in Urdu from Calcutta University in 1993. Now he is a senior assistant at the undergraduate council of the university. Rafique is always at the centre when he is not at work.         
	Problem points: He visits homes in his locality and tries to convince parents to send their children to the classes. Most parents want their children to be educated but they need their help to run the family also. At times it is tough to convince them since they are illiterate themselves. Rafique tries to make them understand by citing his own example.         
	Future plans: I want to start night coaching classes for dropout students and coach students of Classes XI and XII, says Rafique.

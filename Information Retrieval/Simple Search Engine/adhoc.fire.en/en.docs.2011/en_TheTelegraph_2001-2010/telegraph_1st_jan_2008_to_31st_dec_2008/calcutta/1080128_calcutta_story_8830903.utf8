The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire hazard at markets 
                                                                                                            Fire hazard at markets 
                    
	The blaze in the Nandaram Market complex followed by the one at Mullickbazar have put the fire-fighting measures at city markets under the scanner. The fire department has norms in place (see box), but few care to abide by them. Metro visits three civic markets to run a check.         
	New Market         
	Traders: About 2,000         
	Present: About 30 fire extinguishers (most of them damaged), six water tanks and sand buckets (without sand in them).        
	Absent: Fire alarms, people who know how to operate the extinguishers and clearly designated emergency exits.        
	Fire threat: The authorities have not learnt a lesson from the 1985 blaze. There are exposed wires on the first and second floors and water drips on electrical joints. Many of the shops are stacked with combustible material.        
	Traderspeak: The wiring is in a bad state. A fire at New Market will be worse than the one at Nandaram, says confectionery shop-owner Jahangir Alam.        
	Entally Market         
	Traders: About 650         
	Present: A small water reservoir, three hand pumps and small fire extinguishers in 20 shops.         
	Absent: Large fire extinguishers, sand buckets, fire alarms, people who know how to operate extinguishers and emergency exits.        
	Fire threat: Wires hang from the open meter boxes near the Dwarik Grandson sweet shop. The florist corner is also a maze of electrical wires. Combustible material like paint and garments are sold in the market.         
	Traderspeak: We have complained to the authorities several times. Food is cooked on the premises every day, said garment trader Taraknath Trivedi.         
	Park Circus Market         
	Traders: About 550         
	Present: Three fire extinguishers and one water source.         
	Absent: Sand buckets, fire alarms, people trained in operating the extinguishers and emergency exits.         
	Fire threat: Naked wires and open meter boxes are a common sight. Gunny bags and fuel shops increase the danger.        
	Traderspeak: The fire extinguishers do not work. There is plenty of combustible material and hardly a water source, says stationery shop-owner Girin Pal.              
	Official word               
	D.P. Biswas, director, fire and emergency department: The 23 civic markets lack the minimum fire fighting arrangements.         
	Joint municipal commissioner Sahidul Islam: Chief engineer (lighting) and director general (water supply) have been asked to submit a status report with suggestions.                    TAMAGHNA BANERJEE

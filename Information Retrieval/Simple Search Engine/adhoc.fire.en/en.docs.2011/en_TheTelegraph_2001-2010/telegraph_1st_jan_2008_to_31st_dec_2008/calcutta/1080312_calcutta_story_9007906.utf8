          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two people were killed in accidents in the city on Tuesday, prompting pedestrians to go on the rampage and set up a road blockade.        
	The first accident took place on Majherhat Bridge, when an unidentified vehicle knocked down Parvati Turia, 53, around 7.50am. The resident of 11 Garagacha Road was rushed to SSKM Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries.        
	The second took place opposite BR Singh Hospital, in the Sealdah court area, around 8.45am. Ayesha Bibi, 41, was killed after a private bus, plying on route 45B, hit her while she was crossing the road.        
	Local residents alleged that the driver was trying to overtake another bus on the same route. Pedestrians stopped the bus and smashed its windscreen. They also smashed the windscreens of three other private buses.        
	The pedestrians set up a road blockade around 9.20am. Senior police officers rushed to the spot to control the situation.        
	Things would have gone out of control if we didnt arrive on time, said an officer of Entally police station.        
	The pedestrians demanded immediate arrest of the driver and steps to make traffic policing in the area more stringent.        
	The blockade was withdrawn after officers from Sealdah Traffic Guard reached the spot, along with their counterparts from Entally police station.

  - Court prods estranged parents to spend 10 days together          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                    
	The pleas of the four-year-old child of an estranged couple prompted the high court on Wednesday to try for a reconciliation between her parents.        
	Zeenat Parveen told the division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice P.S. Banerjee that she loved her mother more than her father but wanted to live with both parents.        
	The girl, who had been living with her father for the past year, ran into her mothers arms as soon as she saw her in court on Wednesday.        
	The bench asked the parents  Habibur Rahman Sardar and Shaukat Ara Begum  to stay together for at least the next 10 days to try and save their marriage for the sake of their only child.        
	In the best interests of the child, the reconciliation of the parents is needed, the bench observed. The couple will have to appear in court with their daughter after 10 days.        
	Additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said Shaukat Ara had alleged that her husband and his family members had forcefully taken away the child from her custody a year ago.        
	When she was produced before the court today, Zeenat said she loved her mother more than her father but she wanted to stay with both, said Goswami.        
	Shaukat Ara, from Hooghlys Pandua, married Habibur, a resident of the Park Street area, on October 17, 2002. Zeenat was born in June 2004. Relations between the couple started souring since early 2007 because of various reasons. Shaukat Ara left for her parents house with her daughter in July 2007, said Deep Kabir, who is representing her in the case.        
	She lodged a complaint with Pandua police station against her husband under Section 498A of the IPC (torture of housewives by husbands and in-laws).        
	On August 2, 2007, Habibur and his family members went to Pandua and requested Shaukat Ara to return home. She agreed and set off for the city along with Zeenat and her in-laws in a car that Habibur had hired. But on the way, Habibur stopped the car, pushed Shaukat Ara out and fled with Zeenat, Kabir alleged.        
	Shaukat Ara then lodged another complaint against her husband, accusing him of kidnapping their daughter. With the police failing to trace the child, she moved a habeas corpus petition in the high court this August, demanding that Zeenat be produced before her.        
	On September 11, the bench asked Habibur to produce the child. Zeenat was brought to the high court on Wednesday and reunited with both parents, for 10 days.

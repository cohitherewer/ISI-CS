The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Problem of plenty for plexes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Problem of plenty for plexes
          PRIYANKA ROY                           A still from Bachna Ae Haseeno                                  
	What would Gabbar Singh have said if he had seen the roster of this Fridays releases at city multiplexes? Bahut na insaafi hai. The reason? Too many films, too few screens.         
	In what is a first in 2008, six films  four Hindi and two from Hollywood  are set to hit screens on Friday and the 25 plex screens in Calcutta are falling short.         
	Giving this weeks big-ticket film Rock On!! an average of five shows at each multiplex has meant that the other releases  Tusshar Kapoors comic caper C Kkompany, Chamku starring Bobby Deol and Priyanka Chopra, the Angelina Jolie action adventure Wanted, espionage thriller Mukhbiir and an animation flick Wall E  have had to settle for far less. In some cases, two shows a day or less.        
	Limited screens and multiple releases in a week make it difficult for the exhibitor to do justice to all films. A scattered release over a period of two or three weeks helps in preventing this squeeze, says Abhishek Raina, the marketing head of Fame Cinemas.         
	Adding to the screen squeeze is the continuing run at the box office of Bachna Ae Haseeno, Singh Is Kinng and Phoonk. The decision to release a film on a particular date and the economic responsibilities that come with it rests with the producer and the distributor. If six films are releasing this Friday, we are bound to screen them, says Virendra Marya, the regional director of INOX.        
	Out of the lot, Mukhbiir is the one feeling the pinch the most. Despite the much hyped money-back offer  where the producer has offered to reimburse the first 5,000 viewers who dont like the film  the Suniel Shetty-Om Puri-Jackie Shroff starrer has managed a lone show at most city plexes, with Fame (Hiland Park) giving it a miss.         
	A larger number of shows would definitely have been welcome, but if the film is good then there is every possibility that it may get many more shows in its second week, says Debashish De of Kapurchand Films, the distributors of Mukhbiir. And with just three screens to show, the Sector V Adlabs has had to drop Wall E from its Friday the 29th list.         
	The worst hit is the viewer. Multiple releases in a week pose the problem of show timings that may not suit most. Some films get pushed to the afternoon slots, making it next to impossible for office goers to watch them, says software professional Moumita Banerjee.

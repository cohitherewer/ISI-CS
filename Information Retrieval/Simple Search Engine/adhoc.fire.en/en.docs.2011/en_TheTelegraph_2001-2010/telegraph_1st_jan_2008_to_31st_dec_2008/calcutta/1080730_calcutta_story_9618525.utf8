The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Screens for south biggies 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Screens for south biggies 
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          A still from Kuselan                                  
	You dont have to wait for the DVD release to watch Rajanikanths trademark flip of the cigarette in his latest Tamil release. Thanks to his own Sivaji  The Boss and then Kamal Haasans Dashavatharam, Calcutta is now invited to the first day first show of all the big south Indian releases.        
	Releasing this Friday will be the new Rajanikanth film Kuselan whose Hindi version Billo Barber will be Shah Rukh Khans Diwali release this year. Both the INOX and Fame multiplex chains will screen Kuselan, making the film a simultaneous release across all the metros.        
	Says Vikas Syal, the general manager of INOX (Forum): This is why multiplexes originated in the first place, to cater to all kinds of tastes for movies. In Calcutta, there is a demand for south Indian films and we are just trying to meet that demand by releasing new Tamil films.        
	He is right because Dashavatharam was quite a rage  it was a sell-out on the first weekend at most of the city plexes. And by the time the 10-in-one Kamal Haasan film went off the screens, it had achieved more than 60 per cent occupancy. Even Sivaji had done an average occupancy of more than 50 per cent.        
	No wonder, just like they did in Dashavatharam, the plex chains will play the original un-subtitled print of Kuselan. We are just looking at the south Indian pocket in Calcutta and we know there is one, says Abhishek Raina, the marketing head of Fame Cinemas. Its similar to the scenario we have in Mumbai when we play Bengali films and a certain section of people come and enjoy watching a film in their language.        
	Ask working professional S.V. Karthik, who was willing to travel to Chennai to catch Rajanikanth in Kuselan. Thank God that it is releasing in the Calcutta plexes, he says.        
	Last time when Dashavatharam got a release here, we went in a big group to catch the film and this time, too, we plan to do the same. We would hope that more and more Tamil films have simultaneous releases here in Calcutta.        
	Earlier Priya and Roxy were the standalone theatres which would play the odd single show of a Tamil or Telugu film. Now with plexes joining the party, variety sure is the name of the game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Doctor, clinic guilty of neglect
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Doctor, clinic guilty of neglect
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The health department committee that probed bank official Kuntal Chowdhurys death found anaesthetist Sanjay Patwari and Woodlands Medical Research Centre guilty of negligence.         
	The 37-year-old cancer patients condition deteriorated severely after the anaesthetist allegedly administered a chemotherapy injection into his spinal cord instead of a vein on June 18. He died on July 9 in another hospital.         
	Woodlands authorities had claimed that since Patwari was a visiting consultant, the nursing home should not be blamed for Chowdhurys death.        
	The report by the two-member committee held anaesthetist Sanjay Patwari mainly responsible for negligence in treatment which led to Chowdhurys death. The hospital also cannot avoid responsibility, according to the committee, said a senior health department official.        
	The report, which was filed on Wednesday, pointed out that the nurse who was present when the chemotherapy was administered into the spinal cord was a paid staff of the hospital though Patwari might not have been one.        
	The committee criticised R. Jindal, under whom Chowdhury was admitted, but stated that he had trusted someone else and could not be held responsible for the death.        
	I am happy if the report has indicted the doctor and the hospital. I demand that the culprits be brought to book, said Chowdhurys widow Barnali. She said the family was thinking of moving the consumer forum for compensation.        
	A. Banerjee, the medical director and CEO of Woodlands, said he had not received the report and would not comment.         
	Patwari also refused comment. I dont know the contents of the report, he said.

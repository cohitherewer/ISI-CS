	Main ne itni badi aag bahut din baad dekhi hai. Pura market jal gaya (I am witnessing such a big fire after a long time. The entire market has been gutted)
    
	Major Anurag Triwedi, who along with his 12 men had been fighting the blaze since Saturday, entered the burning Nandaram complex on Sunday afternoon to assess the situation. 
    
	The armymen were wearing special jackets and were armed with water jets and fire extinguishers.
    
	We took the staircase and walked up to the eighth floor. All the shops on each of the floors were gutted. It was a terrible sight. Everything was burnt and the stench was unbearable, the major told Metro.
    
	Over 36 hours had passed since the blaze had started but the seventh and the eighth floors were still burning. It was dreadful. We could not proceed beyond the eighth floor and had to climb down, added the major. 
    
	The team members had broken open locks on collapsible gates on the third and fourth floors to make their way up. There was debris all around and electrical wires were dangling precariously. We had to use torches, as it was completely dark inside. The staircase seemed like a tunnel, recounted Triwedi.
    
	Most of the shops in the building sold garments or household items, all of which are inflammable. The molten plastic and water sprayed by the firefighters had made the stairs very slippery. We had to climb slowly, carefully avoiding the obstructions.
    
	On the way down, two members of the team lost consciousness. The other men carried the two out of the building. They had to be taken to hospital, where they were discharged after treatment. The two fell unconscious after inhaling carbon monoxide, said Triwedi.

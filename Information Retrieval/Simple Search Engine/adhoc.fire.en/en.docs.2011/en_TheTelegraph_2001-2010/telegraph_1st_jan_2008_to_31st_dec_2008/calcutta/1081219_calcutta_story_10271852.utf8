	Ashok Todi, the prime accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case, was rushed to SSKM Hospital from Presidency jail on Thursday after he complained of chest pain. He was brought back to the jail after tests did not reveal any irregularity.        
	Todi, who has been admitted to the jail hospital since December 1, complained of chest pain and discomfort around 2pm, said jail sources.        
	Police escorts took him to the cardiology department of SSKM Hospital. A team of doctors, led by cardiologist S. Banerjee, examined him. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was conducted. It did not reveal any complication.         
	Cardiologists examined him physically. The ECG report was also normal and so he was not admitted, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Post Graduate Medicine and Research at SSKM.        
	Todi reached the hospital around 3pm and was there for nearly an hour and a half, said an SSKM official.         
	The businessmans bail plea will be heard in the Supreme Court on Friday. Todi moved the apex court after being denied bail by Calcutta High Court on Wednesday.        
	Todi had surrendered before a special CBI court in Calcutta on December 1 and remanded in jail custody.         
	A division bench of Calcutta High Court headed by Justice D.P. Sengupta will hear the bail petition of Ashok Todis brother Pradip, another accused in the case, on Friday. He surrendered before the CBI court on December 8 and was remanded in jail custody.        
	 The chief justice of the high court on Thursday assigned Justice D.P. Sengupta to hear the bail plea moved by Pappu, another accused in the case.

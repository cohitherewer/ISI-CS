                      Celebration of life and art                    The aim of every artist is to arrest the dynamic motion of life through his/her creations and capture it for posterity. The art thus born retains its power to come back to life even a hundred years later upon being viewed, preserving every essence of its living original. Freedom, flexibility and expressiveness are the characteristics of true art that life hopelessly tries to replicate. Yet, life and art are inextricably interwoven; any change in life inevitably leads to a new movement in art. Art is simply not a matter of painting visuals of life. Rather, it is about giving life to a painting. Capturing the quintessence of life through their individual art styles, The Pageant of Life, the ongoing exhibition of paintings and sculptures by 15 well-known artists, is a colourful celebration of Indian art traditions. Showcasing visually stunning masterpieces, it brings together works that present life in all its fascinating dimensions. A special feature of the show is the way in which paintings and sculptures have been paired and complemented, each reflecting the unique creative genius of its creator. Participants include Suhas Roy, Prokash Karmakar (a painting by him appears here), Ramananda Bandyopadhyay, Subrata Pal, Bratin Khan, Kartick Pyne, Aditya Basak, Sanatan Dinda, Subroto Gangopadhyay, Gourango Beshai, Sibsaday, Tapas Sardar and Atin Basak.

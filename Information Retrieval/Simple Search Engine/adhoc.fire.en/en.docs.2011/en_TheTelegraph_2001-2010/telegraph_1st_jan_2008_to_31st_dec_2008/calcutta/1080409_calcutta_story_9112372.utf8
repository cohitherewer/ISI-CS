          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	An 18-year-old college student, who was teased near her Baruipur home, tried to commit suicide on Tuesday after being allegedly scolded by her parents.        
	The girl, who took poison, is admitted in MR Bangur Hospital. Doctors said she is not out of danger.         
	On Monday evening, Dipak Pandit, a resident of Phultala, in Baruipur, allegedly passed comments at the girl despite her repeated protests.         
	Some residents of the area beat up Pandit, who had to be admitted in a hospital. About 200 youths then laid siege to the area and damaged houses and shops to avenge the assault on Pandit.        
	A police team prevented the situation from spiralling out of control. Three men were arrested in connection with the violence.         
	When the girl returned to her Surya Sen Nagar home, the police later said, her parents took her to task for being involved in the incident.         
	On Tuesday morning, her father Anukul Sen found that she was frothing at the mouth and took her to hospital.        
	Doctors said she is improving gradually but not yet out of danger.        
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said that raids were being conducted in the area and more arrests are likely. We will also interrogate the main accused, once he is released from the hospital, Kumar said.         
	The local MLA and a section of residents said hoodlums had used the opportunity to foment trouble in the area.

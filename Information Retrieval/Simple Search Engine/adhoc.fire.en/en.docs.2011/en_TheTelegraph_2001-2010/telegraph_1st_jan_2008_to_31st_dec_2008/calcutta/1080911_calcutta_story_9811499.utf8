                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dodge the kidnapper amp; ride back home 
  - Young recipient of courage award recounts how presence of mind saved the day          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                          Sakshi, 10, receives a certificate of honour for courage at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence                                        
	A 10-year-old girl is kidnapped from her house and is taken to the nearest railway station. She doesnt panic. Instead, she seizes upon the slightest opportunity to give the kidnappers the slip and even takes a rickshaw back home.        
	Straight out of the pages of a thriller, the heroine of this drama in real life is little Sakshi Singh, one of the youngest winners at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence 2008, where the girl from Howrah received a certificate of honour for courage.        
	Sakshi was in the middle of her Class V annual exams at Howrahs Agrasain Balika Shiksha Sadan on January 11. She got back home to Uriapara in Howrah and sat down to study in the main hall of the familys second floor flat. That was where her mother, Priyanka Singh, last saw her before she went missing. I realised she was not at home around 5.15pm. We looked for her everywhere but she was nowhere to be found, she recalls.        
	Sakshi rattles off the rest of the story in one breath. I heard a knock on the door and went to open it. A stranger told me my grandmother was waiting for me outside the house so I went with him. When I couldnt see her anywhere and asked the man where my grandmother was, he told me to walk along quietly if I wanted to see her alive.        
	Another man soon joined in and the two shepherded Sakshi to Howrah station. I was scared but I knew that I had to get away from them. I saw my chance when the first man got busy talking on his cellphone. I just ran, she says.        
	The little girl ran straight to the first rickshaw in sight and promised the rickshaw-puller any amount of money he wanted to take her home as fast as possible.        
	By the time Sakshi reached home around 6.30pm, her mother was in tears and her father had lodged a complaint with Golbari police station. Sakshi was very nervous and scared but she did not shed a single tear, recalls Priyanka, proud of her daughters pluck and presence of mind.        
	The little braveheart did not allow the kidnap drama to rattle her. She sat for her history paper the next day and scored 89 per cent in her annual exams.

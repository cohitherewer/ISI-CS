                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Joker amp; Jaane Tu in hit parade
  - The Dark Knight connects with audience, Kismat Konnection doesnt          A STAFF REPORTER                          A still from The Dark Knight                                            
	Heath Ledgers maniacal laughter in the new Batman franchise may be reverberating across Calcutta halls, but the city hasnt quite stopped humming Kabhi kabhi Aditi         
	The Dark Knight, in which Ledger is the Joker in the pack in more ways than one, has had filmgoers wrapped in its shiny black cape from the very first show, while Jaane Tu Yaa Jaane Na has gone from strength to strength in Week 3.        
	Christopher Nolans dark take on the popular DC Comics characters has not only smashed box-office records in the US, but has also had a flying start in Calcutta. This is despite the fact that the new Batman film has not been released in the INOX chain of multiplexes, automatically robbing it off screenings at three properties in the city.        
	At the Fame plexes in South City and Hiland Park, The Dark Knight has commanded almost 90 per cent occupancy in its opening weekend.         
	For an English film with nine plex shows daily, that is a big number.         
	Abhishek Raina, marketing head of Fame Cinemas, said as much. There was a lot of anticipation around the film for sure, but no one expected a Batman film to do better than movies of more popular superheroes like Spiderman and Superman.                  A still from Jaane Tu... Yaa Jaane Na       
	Ledger might have something to do with that. The Australian-born actors penultimate screen appearance before he died of drug overdose in January is being treated as his swansong.                     
	Hes phenomenal in the film, said Madhurima Chatterjee, a Ledger fan. That he is not around anymore makes the performance all the more special.        
	On a different plane but doing just as well as The Dark Knight is the Aamir Khan-produced Jaane Tu... Yaa Jaane Na, starring newcomers Imran Khan and Genelia.        
	The film, with music by A.R. Rahman, is bidding to become the biggest hit of the year so far. In terms of total revenue, Race is still bigger but if you consider their respective budgets and their distribution prices, Jaane Tu... doesnt fall short, said INOX (Forum) general manager Vikas Syal.         
	Last Fridays big Bollywood release, the Shahid Kapur-Vidya Balan romcom Kismat Konnection, has been struggling after a buoyant weekend.

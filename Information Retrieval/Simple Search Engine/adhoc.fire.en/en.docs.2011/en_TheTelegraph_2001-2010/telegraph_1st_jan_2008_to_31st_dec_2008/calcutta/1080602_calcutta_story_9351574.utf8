Rakesh Yadav, 8, and his friend Prasanta Sikder,10, were produced before the chief judicial magistrate of Barasat, who remanded them in Dhrubashram, a state-run home at Ariadaha. They will be produced in the juvenile court on Monday. Police had initially passed off the death as an accident. But the duo were arrested after Pitus father Prasanta Roy lodged a complaint with Baguiati police station on Saturday night.     Three criminals armed with a pistol and bhojalis were arrested on Sudder Street late on Saturday. Police said a gang of six had assembled to commit a dacoity in the area.

The knife with which college student Abhijit Dutta was stabbed to death on Wednesday has been found near Dankuni Canal, close to the railway station. Police on Sunday interrogated the mother, maternal uncle and five friends of the alleged murderer, Nakari Chatterjee, to find out whether the murder was the fallout of a rivalry in romance.

The flat belongs to Ashok Dugar, for whom Passi worked. Dugar was interrogated on Sunday.    An unidentified, mentally challenged man was caught by Metro Railway officers, after passengers saw him walking down the tunnel at the Belgachhia station on Saturday evening. The man had walked down the tracks from Dum Dum and was heading for Shyambazar.     Work on the flyover near Nicco Park remained suspended on Sunday following the death of a labourer working on the project. He was killed on Saturday after being hit by a heavy hammer. Officials of the construction agency have been summoned by Bidhannagar (North) police station for investigation.     A 26-year-old homemaker was found dead after being allegedly tortured by husband Swarup Das in Kanchrapara.

A complaint was made to the police but withdrawn after Swarup promised to mend his ways. Residents of the area demonstrated when the police went to recover Gargis body.     A woman was crushed under the wheels of a vehicle on Karl Marx Sarani on Sunday morning.

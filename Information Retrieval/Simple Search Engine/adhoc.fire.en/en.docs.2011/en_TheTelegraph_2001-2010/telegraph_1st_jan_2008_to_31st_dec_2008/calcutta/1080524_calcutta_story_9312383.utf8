          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A five-member committee will start work on May 26 to assess the fire-prevention arrangements in large shops, malls, and commercial establishments across the state, a move prompted by the fire at Readymade Centre in Sodepur on May 16.        
	The team will submit its report within a month, after which strict action will be taken against violators, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Friday.        
	Among the members are the special secretary in the municipal affairs department, CMDAs chief engineer, a representative of the fire department and an additional police superintendent from the district the committee is visiting.        
	Dasgupta said the government would cancel the trade licences of shops lacking in fire-prevention measures, demolish buildings that have come up flouting norms and withhold completion certificates to structures that do not have safeguards.        
	The committees recommendations will be enforced without delay, Dasgupta added.        
	The state has declared compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the families of each of those who died in the Sodepur garments shop fire. The cost of treatment of the injured will be borne by the government.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Souvik Biswas, 13, was crushed under the wheels of a private bus on National Highway 2 near Rajchandrapur toll plaza, in Bally, on Sunday morning.        
	The mishap occurred around 11.30am when Souvik, a Class VII student of Uttarpara Government High School, was cycling home from a local market. The bus on route 26C hit him from behind.        
	His head was smashed. He was taken to Jaiswal Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival, said an officer of Bally police station.        
	Local residents caught hold of the driver and handed him over to police. The bus was towed to Bally police station.        
	He was my only son. I bought him the bicycle a month ago. He went to Bally market in the morning to get a tattoo painted on his hand, said Asim Biswas, who works with the railways.        
	Residents alleged the busy stretch has become accident prone because of a lack of vigil by traffic cops. Several fatal accidents occurred in the past few months, said a resident.

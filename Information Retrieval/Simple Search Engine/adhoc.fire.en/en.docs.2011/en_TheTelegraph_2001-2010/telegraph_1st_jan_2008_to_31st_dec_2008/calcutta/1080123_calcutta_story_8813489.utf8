     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	A passenger carrying papad was detained for eight hours at Calcutta airport on Tuesday morning after security personnel suspected that he was carrying narcotics. He was later released, but his flight had taken off by then.
    
	Santosh Dube, 30, a resident of Gorakhpur, in eastern Uttar Pradesh, was scheduled to take an Air India Express flight from Calcutta to Bangkok.
    
	The flight was to take off at 7am and Dube, who exports food items to Thailand, had reached the airport two hours early. He was carrying 10 kg of papad, along with other goods in cartons.
    
	After collecting the boarding pass, he proceeded to the security hold area around 6.30am. The testing equipment beeped during the check-up, indicating there were narcotics in the papad. He was immediately detained and his luggage taken off the aircraft. 
    
	He was carrying food items that are routinely checked with drug detection equipment, said a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officer.
    
	But CISF personnel could not find any narcotics. The officers then called Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) experts from the city.
    
	We tested the food items with our devices and though there were beeps, no traces of narcotics or psychotropic (synthetic) drugs were found, said an NCB official. 
    
	It seems the carton containing the papad was used for storing narcotics earlier. That is why the equipment was giving positive indications, said an NCB official.
    
	Dube was interrogated at the airport for several hours. He was finally let off at 2pm but the flight had taken off long back.
    
	He was not at fault, but we could not have taken chances, a CISF officer said.
    
	The airline offered to accommodate him on another flight, although the tickets of low-cost carriers (Air India Express belongs to that category) are non-refundable.
    
	We will accommodate him on our Bangkok flight on Thursday, an airline official said.

	This New Year rsquo;s day, have your cake but do not try to eat it; if the one on your plate has been gifted by the students of Aban Kala Kendra, that is. The Kidderpore-based art school teaches students to make wax modelsso life-like that one feels like trying out a slice. 
 
	 ldquo;I first saw wax apples on a trip to Himachal Pradesh. They used dies but I tried to mould it by hand, rdquo; says teacher Kali Saha. Saha passes on the method free to students above 14. ldquo;The maker has to be old enough to deal with molten wax. rdquo;
 
	You have to put a bowl of wax on slow fire, wait till it melts and add powdered colour when it cools a bit. Then it rsquo;s up to the mastery of the fingers.
 
	Not all are into cakes and pastries yet. ldquo;I love making bitter gourd, rdquo; says Rima Saha, a 17-year-old studying geography in Women rsquo;s Christian College. She does not like a meal of the bitter vegetable but the rough surface, she says, throws up a challenge to the model maker. Arpita Banerjee, who has picked up making flowers and candles in five months, finds the process easy. Next on her wish list are fruits and ornamental leaves.
      
	The process involves painstaking detailing. For instance, zinc oxide is used to prepare the froth in a glass of lassi mdash; in its wax avatar, of course. Arpita herself had taken a fruit cake, complete with cherries and nuts, prepared by her teacher, as real. ldquo;I was shocked when told it was a wax model. I didn rsquo;t try to bite into it but who knows what a child would do? rdquo; laughs the girl doing her graduation in Bengali.
 
	What would their New Year resolution be? Learn to make a cake to gift to friends next Christmas, they chorus.

	Rajiv Anand has never played baseball before. Yet the graduate from Delhi University managed to strike at 76 metre per hour on his first tryst with the game. 
 
	Baseball has come calling to India. lsquo;The Million Dollar Arm rsquo;, a talent hunt for the best pitcher (baseball parlance for bowler), was kickstarted at Buland Cricket and Football Academy in south Calcutta on December 28. 
 
	It is the brainchild of Jeff Bernstein, managing director, 7 Figures Management, a California-based sports and talent management company. Bernstein explained: ldquo;My business partner, an Indian, introduced me to cricket and I familiarised him with baseball. We realised the similarities in the two games and felt such a venture would be popular in the country. rdquo; 
 
	A pre-contest practice session held at Vivekananda Park saw eager youngsters trooping in for a trial with the ball. Said Rajiv: ldquo;We were playing cricket nearby and my friend persuaded me to participate rdquo;. 
 
	A joint venture of PDM International, the event was, according to Vaibhav Bassi, senior manager, PDM International, the ldquo;first talent hunt in the country to train a promising youngster and give him international exposure in baseball rdquo;.
 
	Any Indian male between 15-25 years of age can try his hand at it. The preliminary rounds are being held at 12 cities including Calcutta, Delhi, Chandigarh, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore The Calcutta rounds will be held on February 14 and 15. ldquo;There is a wealth of unrecognised potential for the game in India. This is what we hope to tap through the hunt, rdquo; added Bassi. 
 
	Contestants will have to pitch the ball at a minimum speed of 60 metres per hour. At the next level, those selected will have to cross the minimum speed of 80 metres per hour. The youngsters chosen in this round will undergo a rigorous five-day training camp under international scouts and trainers.
 
	The finals will be held in Mumbai on March 22 and 23 after a week rsquo;s training. Each contestent will make 10 attempts. The winner will be the one who manages to pitch the most number of times at a speed greater than 90 metres per hour. The winner gets to take away prize money worth $100,000 along with a 12-month training contract in San Francisco. ldquo;The winner will take part in international baseball games, playing with professional teams in USA. The contest winner may also vie for an additional grand prize of $1,000,000 by making three consecutive strikes at more than 95 metres per hour. rdquo; informed Bernstein.
 
	An added attraction for contestants might be the opportunity to grab their 15 minutes of fame as a television channel airs their attempt.

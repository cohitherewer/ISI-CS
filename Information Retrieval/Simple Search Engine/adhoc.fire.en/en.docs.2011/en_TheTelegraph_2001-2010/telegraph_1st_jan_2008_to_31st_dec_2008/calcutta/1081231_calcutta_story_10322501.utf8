                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Murder for pocket money
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Namita Guhas 22-year-old neighbour had slipped into her Narkeldanga house to steal cash for a trip to Digha and killed her after she spotted him, police said on Tuesday.        
	Soumen Adhikary, who lives next door with his parents, was arrested on Tuesday. He said he had entered the house to steal as he needed money for a trip to Digha with his parents the next day, an officer quoted Soumen as saying.        
	The 76-year-old woman was found lying on the floor of her drawing room on December 18 with blood oozing out of her mouth. There were strangulation marks on her neck. The almirah had been ransacked and valuables were missing.        
	I scaled the boundary wall of didas house and found her lying on an easychair with her eyes closed. As I was tiptoeing to her bedroom, she woke up and saw me. I pushed her when she stood up, said Soumen, who helps his father run a small leather bag manufacturing unit.        
	Namita suffered injuries on the back of her head after being pushed to the ground. Soumen gagged her with a piece of cloth and strangled her with his hands. He then ransacked the almirah to establish that the murder was the work of professional robbers, said an investigator.        
	The gold ornaments and camera Soumen took from the house have been recovered.        
	He has been remanded in police custody for 14 days.

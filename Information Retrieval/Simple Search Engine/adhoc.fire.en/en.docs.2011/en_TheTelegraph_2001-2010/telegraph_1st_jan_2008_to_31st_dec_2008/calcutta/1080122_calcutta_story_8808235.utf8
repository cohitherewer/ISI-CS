        Soulful strains that fill the winter air
   Way back in the Fifties, some intrepid music lovers got together to organise a classical music soiree in Dover Lane in south Calcutta. That was a humble beginning. Gradually it became the city rsquo;s premier annual event and is now a part of Calcutta rsquo;s rich heritage. The Dover Lane musical soirees have done the local classical music lovers proud and is the highpoint in their annual calendar of events. The spirit of the 1950s is still very much alive. Performing legends look forward to the event and music history continues to be made.The Dover Lane podium has been graced by the stalwarts of Indian classical music. This year marks the birth centenary of the great saint and social worker Swami Prajnananda and the inaugural day rsquo;s conference is dedicated to him. The four-day programme, presented by Desh, begins today at 7 pm. The evening rsquo;s soirees include a flute recital by Hariprasad Chaurasia, vocal recitals by Padma Talwalkar and Jasraj and a sarod recital by Amaan Ali Khan.

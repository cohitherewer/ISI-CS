          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Two youths were arrested from Bihars Nowada district on Monday for stealing Rs 28 lakh from a garment shop in New Market last week. Police recovered Rs 27.63 lakh from the duo and brought them to the city on Tuesday.        
	Uday Kumar Singh and Manoj Paswan, who had started working at the shop a year back, were asked to hand over the amount to a businessman on Park Street on October 15. When they did not return after a long time, the manager of the shop contacted the businessman and found that he hadnt received the money.         
	The manager then called the police. But shopowner Bimal Goenka could not be informed about the incident because he was in Jaipur.        
	Singh, a resident of Nowada, and Paswan, of Nalanda, could not be traced as they were not carrying a cellphone. A police team was sent to Nalanda. Sleuths traced the duo by tracking the cellphones of their relatives and found them living with Singhs in-laws.        
	The two were produced in a city court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody till October 31.

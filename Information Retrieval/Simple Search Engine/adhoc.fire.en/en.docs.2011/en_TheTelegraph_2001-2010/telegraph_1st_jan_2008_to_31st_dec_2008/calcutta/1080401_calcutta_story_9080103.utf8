The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Swoop with pot of sweets
                                                                                                               Swoop with pot of sweets
  - Thieves posing as relatives turn up with mishti to rob house          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	An earthen pot, supposedly containing mishti, was the calling card of a couple of thieves posing as distant relatives to enter a house and rob it.        
	The sweet-laced swoop late on Sunday left the Ghoshs in Uttarayan of Naihati with a bitter taste in the mouth, and poorer by Rs 50,000 in cash and jewellery.        
	According to North 24-Parganas police officers  who admitted that the relatives-with-mishti routine was a novel one  two arrests have been made but the hunt is on.        
	When Nimai Ghosh, a 62-year-old fish trader, answered the doorbell at 9.45pm, he found two men armed with what looked like a pot of rosogolla, who introduced themselves as relatives from Ranaghat.        
	Ghosh could not recognise the duo, but let them in out of politeness. As my wife Mridula and I began talking to them, we realised something was wrong. But it was too late. One of them held a revolver to my chest and demanded the keys to the safe. A third youth entered the house and took the keys, Ghosh recounted.        
	The goons then gagged the couple, locked them in the bathroom and looted cash and jewellery. Their parting shot: Kakababu, be careful. We will be back.        
	Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24 Parganas police, termed the robbery unusual.

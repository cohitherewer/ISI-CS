	Krishna on a swing under a Kadamba tree with Radha and dancing figurines of gopis greeted devotees at Shri Radha Krishna Temple on Jhulan. Strains of Jhulan ke din aayo rendered by Kishan Budhadev rent the air.         
	Floral decorations and strings of lights hung around the carved pillars and walls of the temple as it celebrated the three-day Jhulan festival for the 13th year from August 12 to 15 and geared up for Janmastami on August 23.         
	Through the four days of Jhulan, the temple gates were open from 5.30am to 11am and again from 4.30pm to 9.30pm. Intricate jhankis designed by Shibu Paul of Kalighat recreated mythological scenes.         
	We get thousands of visitors on these festival days. The crowd swells during the weekends, said V. M. Agarwal, the manager of Shri Radha-Krishna temple.         
	Devotees were treated to bhajans by Maruti Mohta, Dhrubajit Bhattacharjee and Dhiren Sanghvi.         
	On Janmashtami, the temple will be open from 5.30am to 11am and from 5.30pm to 1am.                                  Dalia Mukherjee

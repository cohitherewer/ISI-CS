                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Emergency steps to restore rail link
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The railway authorities are taking some emergency measures to restore the citys link with the south, disrupted since the flash floods in early June.        
	We are taking several measures to restore regular service on the route. The situation is likely to become normal by the Puja, said a South Eastern Railway official.        
	Two long-distance trains from Howrah  the Bangalore-bound Yashwantpur Express and the Hyderabad-bound Falaknama Express  are still running through diverted routes, reaching destinations seven-eight hours behind schedule.        
	The Howrah-Bhubaneswar Dhauli Express, Bhubaneswar-Janshatabdi Express and Howrah-Vasco Da Gama Amaravati Express are yet to resume service. Apart from these, several other trains from the Northeast and eastern India are running on diverted routes.        
	On Sunday morning, many residents of Jaleswar in Orissa had blocked tracks demanding restoration of normal service. The blockade, which continued from 6am to 10.40am, further delayed the Down Coromondel Express and Bangalore-Guwahati Express.        
	Trouble started on June 17 when the flood waters breached the tracks at several places between Kharagpur and Bhadrak in South Eastern Railway.         
	A bridge on the Keleghai river, between Bhakrabad and Narayangarh stations, was almost washed away.        
	Another bridge will be built 14 metres from the old bridge, said Soumitra Majumdar, the deputy chief commercial manager (customer interaction) of South Eastern Railway.        
	Officials said a temporary bridge is being set up. A special team from Northeast Frontier Railway, comprising experts in restoration of railway bridges damaged by natural calamities, are building the temporary bridge at a cost of Rs 2 crore. It is likely to be operational by the Puja.        
	For smooth running of trains on a single pair of tracks, a signal cabin with communication system has been installed at one end of the bridge and special signal posts are being erected on both sides. Track crossovers have been set up at both ends.        
	This has cut delays as a train need not be held up at a distance while another from the opposite direction is crossing the bridge, an official said.

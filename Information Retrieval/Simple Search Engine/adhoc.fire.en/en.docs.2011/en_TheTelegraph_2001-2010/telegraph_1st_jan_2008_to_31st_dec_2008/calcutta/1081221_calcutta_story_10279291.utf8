- Is it possible to start afresh year after year ?            made in MANHATTAN                                            
	Its that time of the year again, a time to review the months gone, checklist our accomplishments and failures, make fresh resolutions and look forward to the new. I have hardly ever managed to stick to the resolutions I made, but I persist in making them. So, what is it that makes us do this year after year, to believe that we can put this past year behind us and start afresh next year?         
	Its all warm and fuzzy on American television right now, with Christmas and the New Year around the corner. Companies are pulling out all stops with glitzy advertisement enticing the viewer to start anew whether it is to sign up at the gym, buy a new car or to join match.com and find a life partner. Shopping malls and stores are bombarding consumers with mails and flyers with leggy models and showy merchandise, pumping up the numerous sales (in AFP picture above) and consumer deals, perhaps even more than previous years given the weak economy. But is this belief in fresh starts driven only by consumerism? Or is it driven by our inherent belief in change?         
	Whether its kicking a bad habit or starting a good one, its basic human nature to want to have a few more days of indulgence and push all changes to the new year. It is as if the first day of the new year has some magical power which will change us into better, or fitter or better looking human beings.         
	Even beyond the personal, as one year ends and another begins, there is always an air of anticipation. Dont we all take stock of what had happened in the year gone by and hope to make it better in the next?         
	Whether its the girl next door looking for life partner, or the Olympics athlete who failed to get the medal he worked so hard for or the Tibetan student who protested on the streets of New York this summer, I imagine there will be many who are looking forward to better, brighter days.         
	This year has been particularly rough for many. What kind of a year end will it be for the immigrant from Punjab who came to the US with his own American dream earlier this year and started working double shifts at the gas station in my town, only to lose his job because of lower sales, or for the family of the young hotel staff who died in the Mumbai shootings last month?         
	For America, the new year will be more than just symbolic. Come January, one political era will end and another begin. With the first-ever black President in the White House, there is a deep sense of anticipation and expectancy in the air. Hopes are running high for him to not only turn the economy around and bring an end to the wars, but also to give America a new beginning, a fresh start that will revive the global communitys faith in the country.        
	Will all these expectations personal, political, and otherwise be met in the new year? I dont know, perhaps some will and others wont. But even if most of them failed, you will probably find me in this same place at this time next year, making new resolutions and looking forward to change. For perhaps it is only this inherent belief that there are better days ahead that makes the end of a year magical. It brings hope that things can change overnight, when the clock strikes midnight and a new year begins.

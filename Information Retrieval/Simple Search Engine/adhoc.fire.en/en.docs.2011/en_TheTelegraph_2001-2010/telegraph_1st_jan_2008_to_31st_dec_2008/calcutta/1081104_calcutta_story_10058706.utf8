                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Witness shot at in shop
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four youths fired at a witness in an attempt to murder case in a sweet shop at the Park Circus seven-point crossing around 10pm on Sunday. One of the bullets grazed the back of Dipu Pandeys neck and the other hit a showcase of the shop.        
	Several people saw the incident but none dared to stop the four as they rode away on two motorcycles towards the EM Bypass.         
	Pandey, who works as a time keeper in a bus terminus in Tangra, tried to duck the first bullet but it grazed his neck. The second missed the target, said bystanders.        
	Pandey was admitted to CMRI Hospital. He was kept under observation.        
	According to police, the attack was a fallout of a business rivalry between two cousins.        
	Arshad and his cousin Naushad wanted to open a shop in the same place at Phalpatti in Jorasanko. This led to a rivalry. In 2005, Naushad fired at Arshad in front of Pandey. We suspect that Naushads men tried to kill Pandey on Sunday, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner (detective department).        
	The trial of the attempt to murder case is on. Pandey was scheduled to depose before the magistrate soon, said an officer of the detective department.        
	Pandey, who had entered the shop to buy sweets on the way to his Tangra home, identified all the attackers, said investigators.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The civic body admitted in the high court on Monday that it was building a water treatment plant on the East Calcutta Wetlands.         
	The court has prohibited construction on the wetlands.        
	The 20-acre plot on which the project is coming up is part of the East Calcutta Wetlands. But only a small portion of the plot has the characteristics of a wetland. In the remaining part, vegetables are cultivated, Shaktinath Mukherjee, the counsel for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, told the court.        
	People United for Better Living in Calcutta had moved a public interest litigation in the high court, challenging the legality of the Rs 98.75-crore project.        
	According to the NGO, the plant, for which both the centre and the state governments have sanctioned funds, is coming up by violating East Calcutta Wetlands Management Act.        
	Mukherjee said the construction would take place only on 6 acres of the plot while the remaining area would be developed keeping in mind the wetlands character of the area.         
	The lawyer claimed that the act allows constructions that aim to protect the wetlands.         
	The civic authorities had stated that the proposed plant would ensure supply of treated water on the eastern and northern fringes of the city.         
	Deep tubewells are the only source of drinking water in some fringe areas, where the government agencies have detected arsenic contamination, said the civic counsel.         
	The court will resume its hearing on Tuesday.

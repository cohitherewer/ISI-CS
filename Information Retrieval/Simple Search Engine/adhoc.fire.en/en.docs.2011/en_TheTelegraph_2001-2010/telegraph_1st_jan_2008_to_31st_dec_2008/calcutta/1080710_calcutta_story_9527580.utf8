          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court is hearing two petitions raising the question whether the Right to Information (RTI) Act empowers students to see their answer scripts after evaluation.        
	Calcutta University and the state board of secondary education have moved separate petitions challenging the scope of the RTI Act.        
	The university has challenged an order of a trial bench of the court which forced it to show the B.Sc Part II mathematics answer script to the examiner, Pritam Rooz from Presidency College.        
	This case will be heard next week by the division bench headed by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar.        
	The board has filed a petition before Justice Soumitra Pal, challenging the legality of an order of the state information officer asking the board to produce two answer scripts before the examinees under the RTI Act. The petition will be heard on July 16.        
	Both petitioners have argued that the rules followed by their organisations do not leave any scope for producing answer scripts before the examinees.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Recycling pill to cure plastic ill

	The focus of the battle against plastic has shifted to recycling with the ban on small carry bags having fallen through.        
	The government has realised that the most effective way to tackle plastic menace will be to recycle the items and use them in constructing roads and manufacturing other plastic products.        
	A recent meeting of the state plastic management committee at Writers Building resolved that big plastic manufacturing units would be asked to set up recycling units.        
	The meeting was attended by senior officials of various municipalities, police and the environment department.        
	The ban on the production, sale and use of thin plastic bags, announced last year, could not be sustained after the initial success. The civic authorities and the police (who are mostly responsible for executing the ban) are so occupied that it is becoming difficult for them to maintain a regular vigil on plastic items, said M.L. Meena, the principal secretary in the environment department.        
	The department may consider giving financial support to civic bodies who will join the plastic battle. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation is yet to respond but some other civic bodies have shown interest.        
	The Chandernagore Municipal Corporation has said it would set up a plastic recycling unit. Kalyani Municipality wants to use plastic waste in road construction, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer in the environment department.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rain, but no fear of deluge 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	The Met office on Monday predicted rain and thundershowers in the city over the next 48 hours, but probably not with the intensity that had led to a deluge last week.        
	Officials said a low-pressure area had developed over Jharkhand and adjoining Gangetic Bengal. Under its influence, there will be rain and thundershowers in Calcutta and in almost all the Bengal districts, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	In Calcutta, the rain will be light to moderate. But we have issued a warning for heavy rain in parts of East and West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, Debnath said.        
	He said the monsoon current was normal for this time of the year, leading to accumulation of a lot of moisture in the air.         
	The city had received 114mm of rain between 8.30pm on June 16 and 8.30am the next day.        
	Flash floods in West Midnapore damaged rail tracks, leading to disruption of train services of South Eastern Railway. Disruptions could continue for at least another week, an official said.        
	The chief public relations officer of South Eastern Railway, Archana Srivastava, said track repairs were on to restore train services. We are also participating in the evacuation of marooned people and sending relief materials to the flood-affected areas, she said.        
	Some express trains from Howrah and Shalimar, including those bound for Chennai, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram and Puri, have been cancelled till June 30.

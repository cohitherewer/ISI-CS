          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Police have filed a chargesheet against Samir Barik, 35, and Somashree Das, 28, in the Jagachha murder case.         
	The duo are the prime accused in the murder of Srabonti Ghosh, 27, and her nine-year-old daughter Prapti. Neighbours found their bodies in the bedroom of their Jagachha home around 5pm on February 26.        
	Forensic experts said the murderers strangled Srabonti and slit her throat. Prapti was also strangled. The almirah was ransacked but nothing was missing from the room except a cellphone.        
	Barik, who lived in Duttapukur, in North 24-Parganas, and ran a small factory, was allegedly having an affair with Das, a homemaker who lived near the Ghosh family in Jagachha.         
	The two have been booked under sections 302, 201, 34, 379 and 411 of the Indian Penal Code for murder, conspiracy and suppressing evidence.        
	The 350-page chargesheet was filed on Tuesday afternoon in the court of the chief judicial magistrate in Howrah.        
	According to the police, the chargesheet has been drawn up on the basis of statements of 53 witnesses. The call records of Das and Barik and a written statement by Barik were attached with the chargesheet.         
	Barik said in the statement that he and Somashree decided to kill Srabonti after being blackmailed by her. Prapti was killed as she saw the two strangling her mother, said a senior district police officer.        
	Srabonti had allegedly taken intimate pictures of Barik and Das on her cellphone camera.        
	The accused met at Phoolbagan, in Jagachha, on the day of the murder, said an investigator. Somashree had made 900 calls to Samir in the two months before that, he added.

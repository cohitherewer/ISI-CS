The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Held for Rs 47-lakh fraud
                                                                                                               Held for Rs 47-lakh fraud
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	A 54-year-old stock market operator was arrested on Wednesday night on charges of duping a woman of Rs 47 lakh by promising high returns at regular intervals through portfolio management.         
	Police said Vinod Juthani of Suresh Sarkar Street, in Entally, had promised Surekha Doshi, a woman in her early 50s from Ballygunge Circular Road, that he would ensure a steady stream of returns from her dormant share trading account and, in the process, robbed her of the shares.        
	The wife of a rich businessman, Surekha was impressed with Juthani, owner of Riddhi Siddhi Consultants, a share-trading agency in Bowbazar. Juthani assured Surekha that she had nothing to worry, since he was a qualified portfolio manager and produced some documents to back his claim.        
	"He had promised a monthly return of 15 per cent against the shares placed with him. Surekha was convinced and the entire set of over 44,000 shares were transferred from her Demat account to that of Juthani's," said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.         
	The police have found that Surekha's portfolio included shares of blue chip firms like ITC, Satyam, Infosys and Tata Power.        
	As Surekha could not track the daily movements on the bourses, she transferred the shares from her account with Stock Holding Corporation of India to Juthani's account at Vedika Securities, police said.        
	"But instead of trading in her shares and reinvesting the proceeds to generate returns, he sold off the shares. Within three months, Surekha smelt a rat, as the promised returns were not credited to her account. Initially, Juthani promised to deliver returns of three months at one go. But when he failed to meet the payment deadline, Surekha lodged a complaint with the court in March 2007," said one of the officers of the investigating team.        
	The sleuths realised that Vinod had left the city and was hiding somewhere in Asansol, where he was trying to start the same business. Acting on a tip-off that he was in town, police raided his Bowbazar home and arrested him.         
	"We have got him in our custody and are checking if he is involved in other such economic offences. We have already sealed his bank and Demat accounts," said an officer.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The undergraduate council of Calcutta University on Wednesday reminded city colleges not to admit students in excess of the numbers fixed on the basis of their infrastructure and faculty strength.        
	The admission process for BA, B.Sc and B.Com courses began on June 2 and the university has since received several complaints about colleges taking in more students than they can handle.         
	Inspection teams from the university have visited some of the colleges to examine whether they are admitting students in excess of their capacity and found a few doing exactly that. We have again asked colleges to strictly abide by the universitys admission rules, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, the pro vice-chancellor of academic affairs.        
	The undergraduate council has asked colleges not to admit more than 150 students in a single section of a general course. Colleges are also required to have at least one teacher for every 150 students in a particular subject (general). The institutions have to appoint additional teachers if they intend to add an extra section for any subject (general).         
	Most colleges are known to have admitted more undergraduate students than stipulated over the past few years. This, the university authorities believe, has led to a fall in academic standards.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Mishaps on VIP Road and the EM Bypass claimed the lives of a motorcyclist and a cyclist on Friday morning.        
	Sudipta Chatterjee was thrown off his motorcycle after being hit by a truck and crushed under its wheels around 6.30am near Kaikhali. The 32-year-old was returning home after night duty at a soft drink plant.        
	The motorcyclist was riding at a moderate speed almost along the edge of the airport-bound flank of VIP Road. The truck hit the two-wheeler while trying to steer past it, said Mohammad Firoze, who saw the mishap.        
	Chatterjee was rushed to a local nursing home, where he was referred to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. He died on the way.        
	The truck driver sped away towards the airport. He was not arrested till late on Friday.        
	A couple of hours later, Asit Kumar Manna was crushed under the wheels of a private bus on the EM Bypass, near Hudco. The 50-year-old suffered head and spine injuries.         
	Manna was cycling to Non-destructive Test Appliances Pvt Ltd in Sector V, where he worked, said the police. His cycle was mangled and hurled several feet away after being hit by the bus, which sped away.        
	Pedestrians found Manna lying by the side of the road in a pool of blood. He was taken to ESI Hospital (Maniktala). A doctor declared him dead on arrival.         
	Manna was a resident of Amulya Chandra Pal Street in Ariadaha. His family learnt about the mishap after a couple of hours.

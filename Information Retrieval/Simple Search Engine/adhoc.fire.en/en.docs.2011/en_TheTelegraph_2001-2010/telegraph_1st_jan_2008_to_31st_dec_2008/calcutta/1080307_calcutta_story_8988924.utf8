The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Justice 20 yrs after sack, 2 yrs after death
                                                                                                               Justice 20 yrs after sack, 2 yrs after death
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	For Kamalesh Chakraborty, justice delayed was, indeed, justice denied.        
	Twenty years after his suspension as bank peon  and over two years after his death  Calcutta High Court on Thursday ordered that all his statutory dues be cleared.        
	Kamalesh Chakraborty, former peon of State Bank of India (SBI), Pursura branch, in Hooghly, died in 2005.        
	Justice Maharaja Sinha of Calcutta High Court on Thursday directed the bank authorities to pay all the statutory dues to his legal heir, calculated with 10 per cent interest.        
	The judge also slapped a fine of Rs 30,000 on the bank for not having cleared Chakrabortys dues in time.        
	Chakraborty was suspended in 1986 and then had his service terminated in 1995 after being accused of helping a person borrow Rs 50,000 from the bank by depositing spurious gold.        
	The bank authorities did not clear his statutory dues as they used the amount to recover the loan amount.        
	Justice Sinha said since the disciplinary action by the bank authorities against the peon was not in accordance with the law, they had no right to deny him his dues.        
	Chakraborty was appointed peon of SBIs Rishra branch in 1984. After two years, he was transferred to the Pursura branch.        
	In 1987, a customer came to borrow money by depositing gold. Chakraborty helped him by standing in as his introducer.        
	After a few months, the bank discovered that the gold was spurious, and slapped criminal charges on the borrower and Chakraborty. The peon was suspended for violating service rules.        
	Challenging the decision, Chakraborty moved a Hooghly court. Even though the court dismissed the suspension order, the bank authorities in 1995 terminated the service of my client by paying him Rs 24,000. The authorities said the rest had been deducted to recover the loan amount, said lawyer Tanmoy Chowdhury, representing the late peon.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The day after the body of 32-year-old Raja Bhattacharya washed ashore in Digha, police sources said there might be more to the case than accidental death by drowning.        
	Raja, a resident of Kabi Nabin Sen Road in Nagerbazar, had been living alone since his parents passed away recently. Neighbours said Raja was unemployed and lived on the money left by his father. He kept to himself and was popular in the locality.        
	The police said Raja left for Digha on Friday with friends Chanchal Chatterjee and Sanjay Singh. According to Rajas friends, the trio got drunk on Sunday night on Old Dighas Sea Hawk Beach. Early on Monday, Raja went for a swim in the sea and drowned.        
	The police, however, have found several discrepancies in the statements provided by Chanchal and Sanjay.         
	The duo, however, could not be detained as Rajas uncle Sujit Bhattacharya and cousin Samrat  who reached Digha on Tuesday to identify the body  have not lodged a complaint.        
	The police suspect Raja may have been murdered for his property since he was the lone heir of his parents.        
	The friends claim they raised an alarm as soon as they saw Raja drown. But nobody in the area saw or heard anything. Thats very unlikely on a Digha beach, said a police officer.        
	He might have been made to drink too much and then pushed into the sea on a desolate spot. We are waiting for the post-mortem report, said an officer of Digha police station.        
	Though no injury marks were found on the body, the police are not ruling out death by strangulation, sources said.        
	Rajas uncle and aunt declined comment on the suspicions raised by the police.

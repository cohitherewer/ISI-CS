                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       City flavour in first Asian F1
          SUBHRO SAHA                          A part of the Formula One racing circuit in Singapore                                   
	Calcutta is set to make its Formula One debut next month.        
	Besides Vijay Mallyas Force India, the only Indian presence at the Singapore F1 Grand Prix  the first-ever night race in F1 history  will be from Calcutta, in the form of delicacies like chicken-stuffed triangles and hot gulab jamuns.        
	Between September 26 and 28, as the Lewis Hamiltons and Phillipe Massas set hearts racing, an Indian food kiosk will be opened by three Calcuttans close to the pit stop of Asias first F1 street-circuit.        
	The three young entrepreneurs behind Ivory, the popular Camac Street restaurant, are using the Singapore GP to introduce their new format  ready-to-eat pre-packaged authentic Indian cuisine called Go India Express  before an estimated 100,000 guests on raceday, among them 40,000 overseas visitors.        
	The F amp;B director of the Singapore GP invited us to put up an outlet at Marina Square as part of the events official spectator catering spread. We will be the only standalone unit from India there, Pankaj Tandon, the managing director of PDK Shenaz Hotels Pte Ltd, Singapore, told Metro.        
	The Singapore subsidiary of the Calcutta-based PDK Shenaz Group  proprietors of Ivory and Shisha  hopes to make hay while 3,180,000 watts turn night into day on the streets of the island nation in what is being billed as Asias answer to Monaco.        
	The patrons will be either seated in grandstands or hold walkabout tickets for the Circuit Park. There will be a constant flow of people throughout the Circuit Park during both race and non-race hours. We also plan to invite Vijay Mallya and the Force India team to our kiosk, said Nitin Kohli, the director of the Group.        
	The F1 organisers have uploaded our logos on their website and on the sponsors chequered map and also given us billboard space on location. This is a huge fillip to our brand and we hope to roll out two more Express outlets in Singapore by the year-end, says Arvind Bhatnagar, the executive director (operations).        
	The Go India Express at the Singapore GP will not only deliver a contemporary twist to traditional regional cuisine of India, focusing on grilled dishes cooked in the tandoor, sigri and tawa, but will also offer takeaway options.        
	Freshly cooked Indian food will be blast-chilled and packaged into individual or combo meals at a central kitchen with ingredients and shelf-life details given on the package. The consumer can mix and match items and then come forward to the cash counter to request for fresh Indian breads from a display menu.

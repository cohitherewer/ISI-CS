                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fever claims one, malaria on campus
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	The city continued to be under the siege of vector-borne diseases on Tuesday with another person dying of unknown fever in Behala and four employees of Scottish Church College being diagnosed with malignant malaria.        
	Goutam Chandra Deb, a 48-year-old resident of Rai Bahadur Road in Behala, had been suffering from fever for the past two weeks.        
	According to a Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) official, he was admitted to a local hospital a week back after his condition deteriorated. He had high fever, joint pain and was feeling nauseous. He died today in hospital, said a civic official.        
	Four Group D employees of Scottish Church College were diagnosed with malignant malaria on Monday. All of them stay in the staff quarters on the college premises.        
	Three of them  57-year-old Sukumar Prasad, his wife and Raja Khela  have been admitted to a nursing home in the area. Rohit Hela, the fourth employee, is being treated at home.        
	My brother had high fever a week ago. We immediately got a blood test done and found that he was suffering from malignant malaria. He responded to treatment and so we did not have to admit him to a nursing home, said Rohits brother Rajen Hela.        
	College officials said the condition of all four was stable. The 30 employees who stay on the college premises urged the authorities to take steps to keep the surroundings clean.        
	We have been staying here for several years. It is the first time so many people have been suffering from malaria, said an employee.         
	The principal said the college would start an awareness campaign on Wednesday to motivate students, teachers and employees to keep the premises clean.        
	More than 300 students stay in the five hostels of the college, situated within a km of the campus.        
	The hostels reopened after the Puja vacation two days ago. We have sought help from the local councillor to ensure that the disease does not spread to the hostels, said a student.

	A special screening of Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Black engaged a bunch of visually challenged students in the story of young Michelle McNally and her ageing teacher on a rain-soaked Wednesday afternoon last week.         
	Around 200 students from various schools, including Blind Boys Academy, Lighthouse for the Blind, Voice of the World and National Association for the Blind, turned up for the show, specially scripted for them, at Vidya Mandir.         
	A running audio commentary with voiceover by actress Sushma Seth brought alive the silent moments  actions, movements, costumes and changing backdrops  of the Amitabh Bachchan-Rani Mukerji-starrer that deals with protagonist Michelles struggle to overcome her sight, hearing and visual disabilities.         
	The screening was held as part of the bicentenary celebrations of Louis Brailles birthday. It was hosted by the National Association of Blind (NAB) in association with Calcutta Round Table 4 and Calcutta Park Street Round Table 34.         
	Four years ago, we had screened Munnabhai MBBS using this special technology for our blind students. After Black, we would also like to show them Fanaa and Taare Zameen Par as these films portray disability in a more humane way, said Kanchan Gaba, the secretary of the associations West Bengal branch who had lost her sight when she was in Class III.         
	But many of the students werent watching Black for the first time. I have seen Black before but this time I could understand the situations much better. The voice describing the background and expression on each characters face really helped, said 25-year-old Amal Sardar from NAB.         
	As part of the ongoing celebrations, 11 visually challenged students were chosen for a trekking trip, while few others took part in a braille reading and writing competition at St Xaviers College. We have started the Louis Braille Memorial Scholarship that will be awarded to 100 poor students based on their merit, said Gaba.               
	Say no to drugs        
	What should you do when a close friend or sibling does drugs? Talk him out of it or take him to a counsellor? The concerns were many as several students, teachers and anxious parents got together at Oxford Bookstore on Thursday evening to attend a discussion on how to counter the social menace. June 26 was International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.         
	The panelists included educationist Bijli Mullick, superintendent of the narcotics control bureau D.K. Ghosh and clinical psychologist Rajyasree Bandyopadhyay. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya was the chief guest. The audience comprised students of La Martiniere for Boys and teachers of Shri Shikshayatan and Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan.         
	Clinical psychologist Bandyopadhyay came forward with possible steps to counter the growing trend of drug abuse among the youth. An addict goes through five stages  experimental, moderate, abuse, dependent and death. Psychological help is more important than rehabs that detoxify the body, said Bandyopadhyay.         
	Superintendent Ghosh, who has conducted raids on drug dens, stressed the need to restrict the supply of drugs. Calcutta does not have cocaine addicts because it is not available in this region but heroin addiction is a cause for concern. Poppy plantations and chemical precursors to make opium and heroin need to be destroyed, said Ghosh.

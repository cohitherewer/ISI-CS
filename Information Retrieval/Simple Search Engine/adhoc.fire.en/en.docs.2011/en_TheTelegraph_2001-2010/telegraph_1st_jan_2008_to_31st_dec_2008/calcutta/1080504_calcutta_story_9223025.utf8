The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Why we cant host concerts 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Why we cant host concerts 
                            Jamshed Bhaba Theatre            Tata Theatre                           
	Just so that Calcuttans can turn green with envy or, more fittingly, grow red with regret, heres news that Britains Royal Opera House Covent Garden is negotiating with Mumbais National Centre for the Performing Arts to take its productions there.  
	Royal Opera House is   not talking to an organisation in Calcutta or any other   Indian city. The reason: the   Tata-funded centre is the   only complex in the country   that has not one but two   auditoriums equipped to   host operas and symphony   orchestras.  
	Among the two,   Jamshed Bhabha   Theatre, built at a cost of   Rs 50 crore in 1999, is pre
  ferred by visiting conductors like Zubin Mehta because of the acoustics and   also because the stage is   large enough to hold 90   musicians and more.  
	Concerts can be performed in Tata Theatre, too,   but this one was built   specifically for the require  ments of Indian music and   dance.  
	It rsquo;s not just that Calcutta   doesn rsquo;t have an auditorium   where symphony orchestras can play, it even does  n rsquo;t have one built to suit the   needs of Indian classical   music. At Tata Theatre, Indian music can be played   and heard without electronic amplification.  
	 ldquo;The reason why there   are no such theatres in   India is of course the cash   constraint. In our country,   theatres are generally constructed as multipurpose   theatres to make them cost   effective. They are devoid   of the superior acoustics   required for such performances, rdquo; said D.B. Biswas,   the chief technical officer of   the centre.																   
	Biswas has been with   the centre since its   inception and has designed   all the theatres in the   complex, which has   three other smaller auditoriums.  
	 ldquo;A concert hall requires   natural acoustics of a high   order, which means availability of the original sound   quality produced by the   performer to every member   of the audience achieved   without use of microphones   or amplifiers. At the same   time, it should include  some elements in its structural design to cut out other   irrelevant ambient noises, rdquo;   Biswas added.  
	Jamshed Bhabha Theatre also has an orchestra   pit where performing musicians sit during an operatic   production, such as the   one that Royal Opera   House will present if it does   come visiting.  
	Multipurpose theatres   are common in India, which   is what Calcutta has and   some more of which Calcutta is planning. Which is   why whatever it builds will   not be right for any of the   performing arts.

	Relatives of a 30-year-old woman who died at SSKM Hospital on Sunday alleged that an injection meant for her had been administered to a patient on an adjacent bed on Saturday night. They blamed medical negligence for the death.        
	The hospital denied the charge, saying Suku Hembram was given medicines as prescribed the doctor.        
	The West Midnapore resident, who leaves behind her husband and two children aged seven and 10 years, was admitted to the hospital on June 28 with a severe head injury. She was injured after allegedly being hit by her husband.        
	Sukus sister, Tuntuni Murmu, who was staying with her in the New Casualty block, said she used to be administered the painkiller-cum-antibiotic at midnight. But on Saturday, the injection was given to a patient on the next bed with a headache.        
	My sister was on bed 37. Last night, the nurse injected the medicine into Anuradha Pal, who was on bed 38, and then asked whether it was bed 37. When we said it was bed 38, the nurse said OK and left. My sister was given the medicine only the next morning. I believe she died because of the hospitals negligence, said Tuntuni.        
	A complaint was lodged with Bhowanipore police station. Hospital superintendent Ashok Ghosh said: The patient was regularly administered medicines as prescribed by the doctor. She was brought here in a critical condition.

	Winter festival        
	The Cambridge School held its fifth Winterfest at Uttam Mancha on February 2. Students from lower KG to Class XII organised a host of programmes with nature as the main theme.        
	Environmental awareness is now a part of childrens consciousness, said principal Nonda Chatterjee.        
	Subhas Dutta, environmentalist and chief guest at the fest, spoke about rainwater harvesting, reduced power consumption and waste management. The contribution of each individual is vital for countering global warming, he said. He also mentioned the recent debate over the Book Fair in this context.        
	The students of nursery regaled the audience with Earth Songs. Children dressed as birds, rabbits and alligators delivered messages like Dont use plastic and If you love our world recycle. They staged a skit, The Crazy Scientist, that depicted a perturbed scientist trying to make children aware of natures hidden beauties and imploring them not to spoil them.        
	This was followed by a music, mime and dance extravaganza by the middle school. The students also staged a play, The Village, which depicted the plight of villagers in the wake of land acquisition.

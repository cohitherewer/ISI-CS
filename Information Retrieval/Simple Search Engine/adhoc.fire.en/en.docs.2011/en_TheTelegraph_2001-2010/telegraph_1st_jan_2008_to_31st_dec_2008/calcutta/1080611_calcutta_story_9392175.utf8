	Apropos the report B-school tips for zilla heads, May 15, it is heartening that the government has decided to provide modern management training to sabhadhipatis. The lessons at IIM Calcutta, especially those on e-governance, will improve the efficiency of the zilla panchayat heads and pave the way for adoption of modern management techniques by the administration. A majority of people live in rural areas in our country. Training sabhadhipatis is the first step towards improving the lives of these people.             
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park           
	B-school training for sabhadhipatis is a step in the right direction. In a fast moving globalised world, reorientation of outlook is needed to make the administration more dynamic. The government should have taken the initiative earlier to train sabhadhipatis in modern management.

	Apropos the report Boy conquers grief and Long walk to success, May 22, the inspiring stories of Dilesh Shaw and Shalini Wrightman are worth telling. They did not let their humble backgrounds dampen their zeal for success.             
	In our country, there are many such meritorious students who cannot flourish because of financial constraints. The government should set up a programme to help needy students. With proper training, they will contribute handsomely to future of India.           
	Atif Ayaz, 
  Serampore                               
	The report Baretto baiter shifted, June 6, carries a wrong impression about my transfer. It is therefore necessary to set the record straight.             
	The Brazilian footballer was arrested on March 20 under Customs Act for attempted smuggling of foreign exchange worth Rs 8,16,910 he procured illegally, as per his own admission, from some unauthorised source in the New Market area. His remand application was moved by the department on the same day just as the Barasat court was closing for the next three days for Holi. The court granted interim bail on the condition that the accused should meet the investigating officer once a week and allowed the department to detain his passport until further orders.           
	Therefore, the report that the footballer got bail on the day of his arrest but the Customs authorities seized his passport is factually incorrect. The fact is that the customs authorities did not seize the passport; they detained it as per the order of the court. Had the customs department not hurried the remand application and made the special effort of producing the accused before the court the same day, the footballer would have spent three nights in jail custody. My personal role in the matter can be verified from the president of Mohun Bagan Club.           
	Between that eventful day and April 23, when the high court passed the order of conditional release of the passport, law took its own course in various courts.           
	The return of the passport was contingent upon the footballer furnishing a bank guarantee of Rs 15 lakh and a personal bond of Rs 10,000 of two sureties. It is only on April 28 that the footballers counsel wrote a letter informing the department regarding the footballer furnishing the bank guarantee and personal bond of two sureties. On the same day, a letter was issued to the footballer and his counsel conveying our decision to return the passport in terms of the high courts order and the passport was accordingly returned to the footballer next day at 10 am.           
	The facts narrated above are on record and clearly belie the purported statement of Joymalya Bagchi that his client had submitted the security bonds and bank guarantee, as directed by the court, but was not given back the passport.           
	A copy of the bond accepted by the court on April 25 was enclosed with the letter of the footballers junior counsel dated April 28. Though this letter was actually handed over to the department the next day, we conveyed the departments decision to return the passport to the footballer on April 28 itself as soon as the junior counsel verbally told us that the conditions of high courts order have been met by the footballer. The release of the passport was therefore not linked with the issue of the no-objection certificate of the income tax authorities. The fact that we had returned the passport before the income tax authorities issued the no-objection certificate to the immigration authority at Mumbai on the evening of April 29 speaks volumes of the vacuity of the allegation that the commissioner sat over the passport saying it could not be handed back to Baretto without a no-objection certificate from the income-tax department that had filed a case against the footballer.           
	Finally, as I had told your reporter earlier, my transfer was due as per norms. I have served a record tenure of 33 months in this post, longer than all my predecessors, and that I am looking forward to taking up the new assignment of defending the orders of Commissioners of Customs, Central Excise and Service Tax in the Tribunal.           
	The purported statement of a senior bureaucrat on my transfer and the title of the report Baretto baitor shifted are derogatory; I consider them an affront to my dignity and reputation. Equally objectionable is the general tenor of the report that the footballer was harassed by us. By publishing such views the report attempts to bring down the morale of a public servant who refused to put the footballer above law.           
	Dr Gautam Ray,
  Dover Lane, Calcutta                     
	(This is a personal rejoinder and does not reflect views of a commissioner of customs or anybody else in the department)                               
	Apropos the report Cuffs ready for Greftaar couple, May 13, I am neither an accused in the case nor am I absconding. I am available at my office and I continue to remain a member of the Eastern India Motion Picture Association.

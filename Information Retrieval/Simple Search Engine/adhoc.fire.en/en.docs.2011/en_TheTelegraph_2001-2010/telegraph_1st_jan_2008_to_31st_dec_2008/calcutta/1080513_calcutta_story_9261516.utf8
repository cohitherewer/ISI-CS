The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Neglect slur on hospital 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Neglect slur on hospital 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Kiran                                  
	A Salt Lake hospital allegedly left an 11-year-old girl, diagnosed with a debilitating autoimmune disease, untreated for three days because her family could not afford to pay the escalating bills.         
	It was only after Kiran Kajarias father Suchit, asthmatic and unable to work, complained to police that AMRI Hospital resumed treatment, family sources said.         
	But the girls condition had by then deteriorated to the extent that her life is now in danger.        
	Officials of AMRI Hospital contested the allegations, saying they had only asked the Kajarias to clear the bills. Treatment was not stopped at any point. We asked the patients father to clear the dues, but no threats were made, medical superintendent Debasish Sarma said.        
	The first symptoms of Kirans ailment were acute respiratory distress and fever, for which she missed school for six months. She was admitted to Marwari Relief Society Hospital on April 14. When her condition deteriorated, the doctors advised us to shift her to a private hospital with better facilities, Kirans cousin Anisha said.        
	The Kajarias, who are residents of Beadon Street, in Maniktala, admitted Kiran to AMRI Hospital on April 25. A series of tests were run on her and she was diagnosed with a viral infection of the brain, which doctors said could be cured soon. But Kiran was not responding to treatment and she needed to be kept in the hospital, Suchit said.        
	Three days ago, doctors told Suchit that his daughter had Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or SLE, a rare disease that causes the immune system to attack the bodys cells and tissue, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage.         
	With Kiran remaining in hospital, the bills started escalating. The first payments Suchit made were Rs 12,000 to the hospital and Rs 7,500 to the in-house pharmacy. The pharmacy bill galloped to Rs 31,000 and the hospital charges to almost Rs 1 lakh in a few days. The hospital authorities then started pressuring me to clear the dues and threatened to stop treatment, Suchit said.         
	The threats allegedly continued even after Kiran was shifted to the ICCU. Last Saturday, they told me that only emergency medicines would be administered to my daughter, her father said.         
	He went to Bidhannagar (South) police station on Sunday. We spoke to the authorities and things have been sorted out, officer-in-charge B.K. Palit said.

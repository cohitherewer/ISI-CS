	Over 600 commuters, mostly women, went on a rampage at Sonarpur station and beat up cops and railway employees on Sunday morning after the authorities rejected their demand for a special train.        
	Basudeb Das, the officer-in-charge of Sonarpur police station was injured in the head. Some of the attackers allegedly snatched his gold chain.        
	Rapid Action Force personnel had to lathicharge the protesters to bring the situation under control.        
	The protesters ransacked a booking counter and assaulted nine persons, including policemen and railway employees. One man has been arrested, said Nishat Parvez, the South 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police (rural).        
	The police said trouble broke out around 8.40am. The the women, a majority of whom work as domestic help in the city, were waiting for a Sealdah-bound train.        
	As trains were not coming for a long time, they started a demonstration in front of station master Pronoy Sahas office. When Saha told them that trains were not running because of a blockade at Park Circus, the women demanded a special train for the city.        
	Saha pointed out that it was not possible to arrange for a special train on a Sunday. But the women continued with their agitation, said an officer of Sonarpur police station.        
	Fearing the situation was spinning out of control, Saha called up Das, who rushed to the station with a police team.        
	The women started hurling bricks at the cops and some railway employees. One of the bricks hit Das on the forehead. The protestors later ransacked a booking counter, the officer said.        
	The Park Circus blockade was put up by several women commuters, one of whom had alleged that her bag had been snatched on a train. The women mostly work as domestic help in the city, said an official. No complaint has been lodged.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CU examiners face scrutiny 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) teachers who do not finish checking answer scripts in time or refuse to be examiners will have to give explanations.        
	The universitys undergraduate council on Wednesday decided to haul up such examiners to avoid delay in publication of undergraduate results.        
	The examiners who submit marks late will have to explain why they did so. Publication of results is often delayed because some examiners habitually do not tabulate marks within the due date, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).         
	Apart from being answerable to the university authorities, the examiners will have to submit explanations to the principals of the colleges where they teach. These will be incorporated into their service books.        
	According to Chatterjee, most examiners evaluate their quota of answer scripts in time. We cannot allow students to suffer because of a handful of teachers. But before we can take appropriate action against the errant teachers, we need to know why they refused to examine answer scripts or could not evaluate them in time.         
	Undergraduate results were declared late this year mainly because some examiners completed their tasks late and a few refused to do the job, said an examination department official.        
	The undergraduate council also took a string of other decisions on Wednesday to streamline the process of holding undergraduate examinations and publishing the results.        
	The council decided to draw up an academic calendar for affiliated colleges. It will be mandatory for the colleges to conduct their academic activities according to that calendar.        
	The calendar will set a timeframe for admitting students, filling up registration forms and holding mid-term and selection tests.        
	The tentative dates for the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I, Part II and Part III examinations and the publication of their results will also be mentioned in the calendar.        
	This is the first time, the university will prepare an academic calendar for the colleges, said Chatterjee. The decision to hold a mid-term and a selection test instead of four unit tests was also made on Wednesday.

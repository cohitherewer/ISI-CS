          RITH BASU                          A clogged drain near Bagjola canal. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	The 2,000-odd people living in slums between the Bagjola canal and the railway tracks, who once lost their homes every monsoon, no longer get scared at the sight of an overcast sky.        
	Guided by Lutheran World Service India, the shanty-dwellers have worked out a solution for floods and water-borne diseases on their own. Dividing themselves among groups, they started dredging the clogged open drains leading to Bagjola canal in 2005.         
	The results showed in 2007 and 2008  the slums did not get flooded even after the heaviest downpour and cases of waterborne diseases like malaria and diarrhoea have been on the decline.        
	Agey akash kalo kore elei amader mukh sukiye jeto (We used to feel so helpless whenever dark clouds covered the sky), said 65-year-old Shankari Halder, who has been living in Arun Mandal Palli since 1988. But now we have learnt to enjoy the rain.        
	The relief was shared by the residents of the adjoining slums, such as Hare Krishna Palli, New Noapara II and Bithi Dey Colony.        
	The drains were choked with polythene wrappers and thermocol pieces and covered by hyacinth. We just dragged the stuff to shore with rakes. Since Baranagar municipality did not remove the garbage despite repeated pleas, we had to set it on fire ourselves, said Uttam Barui, a rickshawpuller.        
	That was not easy, as the toxic smoke which hung in the air for days and the stench made life miserable for the slum dwellers.        
	Local CPM councillor Swapan Dey, however, could not recall having received any written request from the slum-dwellers for removing the garbage. Not that it would have mattered. The roads in the slums are too narrow for municipality trucks, said Dey.        
	Bapi and friends also bleached the surroundings. There used to be at least a dozen malaria cases in each slums every year. In 2008, there hasnt been one, said Basudeb Biswas, a fruit-seller.        
	Disaster management is not rocket science. All they needed were a few rakes and a little guidance, said Shipra Mukherjee of Lutheran World Service India.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bright braveheart in cancer fight
          MALINI BANERJEE                          Sreejoy Bardhan who scored 92.5 per cent in Madhyamik 2008                                  
	Nothing could prevent Sreejoy Bardhan from sitting for his Madhyamik exams. Not crippling pain in his right shoulder, not fever, not the nagging fear of a debilitating disease.        
	The student of Mahesh Sri Ramakrishna Ashram Vidyalaya in Rishra, driven by the dream of becoming a researcher in the field of engineering, struggled through the month-long exams before being rushed off to Vellore.        
	On March 25, the 16-year-old was diagnosed with Ewings sarcoma (cancer that mostly starts in the bones or soft tissues) that had affected his right scapula (shoulder blade). Intensive therapy was the desperate need of the hour.        
	Two months later, the Madhyamik results were out  Sreejoy had managed 92.5 per cent despite hurt and high fever.        
	We had no time to rejoice. We could not even think of admitting him to Class XI. When the congratulatory calls started pouring in, we did not know how to respond, recalls father Ashim Bardhan.        
	But father and son knew how to respond to the grave crisis  by fighting back.        
	That never-say-die spirit lit up the Science City stage on Saturday morning when Ashim Bardhan stepped up to receive a certificate of honour for his son in the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage category at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence.        
	Sreejoy has just been wheeled in for his fifth round of chemotherapy in Vellore. He wanted me to be here at this function, said the father.        
	Ashim Bardhan, 45, is fighting hard. He runs from pillar to post every day trying to gather funds for his first-borns medical expenses, which will add up to not less than Rs 7 lakh.        
	A C-grade employee of Calcutta Municipal Corporation, borough no. 7, Bardhan earns about Rs 9,000 per month. He has managed to stitch together Rs 4 lakh  of which Rs 2 lakh was raised by Mahesh Sri Ramakrishna Ashram Vidyalaya for its precious pupil.        
	Yes, I have to run around a little, admits the tireless father, who travels to Christian Medical College in Vellore every month to be with his son. If he can complete his first treatment cycle, his chances of survival are high, he says with a quiet resolve.        
	That is a quality that Sreejoy shares with his father. The quiet boy who loves being with his books or singing Rabindrasangeet is already planning life after his first round of treatment.        
	He hopes to pick up the pieces of his academic dream, do his morning riyaaz with younger brother Debjoy on the tabla, and raise funds for his follow-up treatment by cutting an album of Rabindrasangeet.        
	Sreejoy hates hospitals and he wants to come back home, says Ashim, his voice softening.        
	His son awaits four more rounds of chemotherapy and a fresh lease of life.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A five-year-old boy died of burns and a 45-year-old homemaker was critically injured after a fire suspected to have been caused by a gas leak engulfed a house in Liluah on Friday morning.        
	Both were taken to the Howrah district hospital, where Rudra Dhara died. Sumita Samanta was admitted with over 70 per cent burns.        
	A preliminary probe indicates the fire was caused by a leak in a cooking gas cylinder, said Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh.        
	Rudra, a pre-nursery student, went to take private tuition from neighbour Amrita Samanta in her house on P Road around 11am. Half an hour later, a man came to replace an LPG cylinder. Rudra and Amritas mother Sumita were in the house.        
	Gas started leaking from the refilled cylinder when the delivery man broke open the seal. Within seconds, the house was in flames. The delivery man managed to flee but Sumita and Rudra were trapped, said a police officer.        
	I had briefly left home after asking Rudra to solve a few problems. When I returned, I saw neighbours bringing out my mother and Rudra. Both were badly burnt, recalled Amrita.        
	Rudras father Soumen, who owns a lathe factory in Liluah, was in Bangalore. He is on his way back, said an officer.

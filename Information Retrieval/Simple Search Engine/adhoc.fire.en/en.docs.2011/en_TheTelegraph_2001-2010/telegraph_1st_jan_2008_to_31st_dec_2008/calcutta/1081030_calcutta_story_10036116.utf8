The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Searchlight swings south
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Searchlight swings south
  - CBI suspends Todi passports, eyes business base          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The CBI has secured suspension of the passports of the Todi brothers and turned the searchlight on south India.        
	A second search of the Calcutta addresses of Ashok and Pradip Todi and their relative Anil Saraogi on Wednesday proved futile.        
	The sleuths suspect the trio are hiding down south where the manufacturing unit of the Todis hosiery business is based.         
	Our special focus is on Tirupur, a knitwear hub around 55 km from Coimbatore, said a CBI official.        
	According to CBI sources, a plea for the revocation of the brothers passports has been approved by the authorities concerned and a letter of cancellation has been issued against the documents.        
	Airports and other international departure points have been informed of this, said an official.        
	A Calcutta court had on Monday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against the Todis and Saraogi in connection with the Rizwanur Rahman death case. The warrants are to be executed by November 3.        
	Soon after the warrants were issued, CBI teams had visited the Todis residential addresses in Salt Lake and their office in Burrabazar, but the duo could not be traced. A search of Saraogis Alipore home, too, drew a blank.        
	Senior CBI officials in Delhi decided to intensify the search for the trio in south India after being informed about the futile raids in Calcutta on Wednesday.        
	The Todis and Saraogi are probably planning to move the high court seeking a stay on the execution of the warrants. We hope to arrest them before the high court reopens from the Puja recess on October 31, said a senior CBI official.        
	On Wednesday, lawyers representing the elusive trio said they were poised to mount a legal challenge against the arrest warrants. We will finalise our course of action by Thursday, said a lawyer for the Todis.        
	Wednesdays search by a three-member CBI team started off with Saraogis Alipore home. Marking the businessman absent, the sleuths told some family members to inform him that they were looking for him.        
	This exercise was repeated in Pradip Todis house in Salt Lakes CF block and then Ashok Todis home in CG block.        
	The search will continue. A copy of the arrest order has been sent to our headquarters, from where it will be forwarded to other units. The trio will be arrested as soon as they are spotted anywhere in the country, said a CBI official.

	A Howrah godown stacked with cans of paint and four adjoining houses with asbestos roofs were gutted in a fire on Tuesday evening.         
	Nobody was injured as residents were evacuated in time. The owner of the godown, Amiya Haldar, also has a paint shop in the locality.        
	The godown and the four houses shared the same address  31 Sailendra Nath Bose Road.        
	The fire, which reportedly started in the godown, was first noticed by a resident of one of the adjacent houses.         
	Around 5.30pm, I saw smoke near the godown. By the time I alerted the other residents, flames were leaping out from the godown. The blaze spread in no time. We rushed out without taking anything with us. We have lost everything, said Pradip Saha, who lived in one of the gutted houses. According to him, the godown has been there for over 10 years.         
	Officers of the West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services said the flames spread fast as the godown was stacked with inflammable material. It took 15 fire engines more than two hours to douse the blaze.         
	We have not been able to ascertain the cause of the fire. A short-circuit might have caused it or somebody might have thrown the butt of a bidi or cigarette, said the director-general of fire services, Gopal Bhattacharjee.         
	Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said the civic authorities would conduct an inquiry to find out how a paint godown could function in a residential area. We want to find out if the owner had a licence, he said.         
	Earlier in the day, a fire broke out at Hanuman Jute Mill at Ghusuri in Howrah at 9.15am. The fire started in a warehouse and quickly spread to other parts of the mill. Ten fire tenders rushed to the spot and brought the flames under control in two-and-a-half hours. No one was injured.

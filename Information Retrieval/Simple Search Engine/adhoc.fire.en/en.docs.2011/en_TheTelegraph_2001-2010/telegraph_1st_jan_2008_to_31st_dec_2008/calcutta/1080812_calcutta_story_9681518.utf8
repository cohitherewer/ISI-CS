The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City shoot for Farhan film
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       City shoot for Farhan film
  - November schedule for bilingual on telephones entry          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            Farhan Akhtar and Akshaye Khanna                                       
	After Pradeep Sarkar in 2004, it is Farhan Akhtar in 2008. After Parineeta, it is Voice from the Sky. After Saif Ali Khan, it is Akshaye Khanna.         
	Bengalis may be making it big in Bollywood, but its not every day Bollywood comes calling in Bengal. And thats what makes Farhans decision to shoot his next film in this part of the country all the more special. Come November and the maker of Dil Chahta Hai, Lakshya and Don will be coming to shoot the half-English half-Hindi Voice from the Sky in a village near Bolpur. A week of shooting has also been planned in Calcutta.        
	The film is set in 1905 and the story revolves around the coming of telephone in India, Farhan tells Metro over the phone from Mumbai. Since Calcutta was the capital of the country during that time, the city was an integral part of all the industrial and technological innovations and inventions that were happening. After all the research we did on that period of Indian history, I was convinced that Calcutta and Bengal will be the best backdrop for this film.        
	Voice from the Sky is set in a village and Farhan has already done a couple of rounds of location recce around Bolpur. I have seen two villages and I really like them. I wouldnt like to mention which two at this stage, he smiles. I would have ideally liked to shoot a lot more in Calcutta but I think logistically it will get difficult. So I will stick to a maximum of one week.        
	While Akshaye Khanna will star in Voice from the Sky, the main characters will be played by two kids. I have finalised the two kids and now I am looking to finalise the leading lady for the film.        
	Farhan has been planning Voice from the Sky for quite some time. It was an idea which has been in my head for the last five-six years, he says. In fact, I wanted to make this film right after Dil Chahta Hai. But at that point of time, the industry hadnt grown that much and it would have been difficult to find an audience for the film. Now with different kinds of films being made, I think the time is ripe enough.        
	With the project being delayed over so many years, the cast has also changed  from Irrfan to Saif Ali Khan to now Akshaye Khanna. And also director Farhan Akhtar is now actor-singer-director Farhan Akhtar. A year back I didnt imagine that I will act as the lead in a film and also sing six songs but the Rock On!! script was so good I had to do it, he says.        
	So, after Rock On!! releases on August 29 and the verdict is out on whether Farhan can make it as an actor, Javed Akhtars son will come to Bengal and do what he has already proved himself to be good at  directing. I am really looking forward to the Calcutta shoot, he smiles. So are we.

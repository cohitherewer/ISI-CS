The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cave-in fears for parking lot bridge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cave-in fears for parking lot bridge
          AMRITA GHOSH                          breaking point: Parked buses line both flanks of Bankim Setu in Howrah. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                  
	Bankim Setu, an arterial link between north and south Howrah, may collapse if illegal parking of heavy vehicles on it is not stopped, engineers of the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) and the Howrah Improvement Trust (HIT) have warned.        
	HIT officials have shot off several letters to the superintendent of Howrah police, requesting him to prevent illegal parking on the bridge, but no action has been taken yet.         
	Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee said: We want the police to remove illegal parking from Bankim Setu immediately. We have written to the police asking them to take action against the illegal parking. I do not know why they are dragging their feet.         
	Samarendra Koley, the chief executive officer of HIT, also said that parking of vehicles on Bankim Setu was damaging the bridge.         
	Civic sources said a number of buses and minibuses are parked on the Howrah Maidan end of the bridge throughout the year. On Mondays, heavy trucks are parked through the day.         
	In Howrah, most of the roads are narrow, leaving very little space for parking vehicles. During the day, Calcutta-bound minibuses and buses are parked on Biplabi Haren Ghosh Sarani and near Sarat Sadan. But after 10pm, most of the buses are parked on the bridge.         
	An engineer of HIT said: Bridges are designed to bear the load of moving vehicles. But the constant load of vehicles on a particular spot causes irreparable damage to bridges. Parked vehicles put pressure on the girders of the bridge and there is possibility of a cave-in. The police should immediately take steps to save the bridge from destruction.         
	Though there is no parking fee, sources said the henchmen of a CPM leader based in north Howrah collect fees from the owners of buses, minibuses and trucks.         
	Swapan Dutta (name changed), a 39-year-old garment seller of Mangalar Hat, said: Nearly 100 trucks are parked on the bridge on Mondays. At any given time, there are as many as 10 trucks on the bridge. After a batch of 10 trucks leave, another batch of 10 is loaded. Each batch takes at least four hours to be loaded.         
	Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police, said: There is no space for parking buses and minibuses in the Howrah Maidan area. If the HMC can provide parking space, we will tell the drivers to park there.

           Essence of a woman
          Inspired and intrigued by the city of Calcutta, Dayanita Singh has been shooting the city and its inhabitants since the last 10 years. Though her photographs have been exhibited extensively at different venues around the world, Ladies of Calcutta, the ongoing exhibition of her photographs, mostly features images that have have never before been on display. Structured as an archive, the show concentrates on portraits. One hundred and eight portraits of women form the major part of the exhibition. These private views of Calcuttas women are sumptuous and revealing, personal and guarded. They depict women and girl children in many aspects, capturing them in moments of tenderness, introspection, thought or repose. While some portray women in indolent solitude, others depict them in conscious poses. Charming and innocent, often shrouded by an aura of mystery, the photographs reveal the latent, inner beauty of every woman.
         Event: An exhibition of photographs by Dayanita Singh When: Till February 9 (except Mondays); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Bose Pacia, Stephen Court, 18 Park Street

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The bail prayers of Kaushik Basu and Sabitri Dandapat, arrested in connection with the terror mail hoax, was rejected by the chief metropolitan magistrate on Wednesday. The two were remanded in judicial custody till August 27.        
	Judge S.S. Anand said that the officer investigating the case would be able to interrogate Kaushik and Sabitri while they were in judicial custody.        
	Despite the police failing to find any proof of the duos involvement with the terror email during the 14 days they were in police custody, the public prosecutor opposed the bail prayers.

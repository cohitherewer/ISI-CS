          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta University notched up a better undergraduate performance this year, hotting up the race for postgraduate seats.        
	The pass percentages in the BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part III exams (under the 1+1+1 system), the results of which were declared on Tuesday, are better than last year.        
	The figures stand at 88.96, 94.06 and 86.63 for arts, science and commerce (honours), respectively.        
	In 2007, the pass percentages in B.A and B.Sc Part II (honours) were 85.24 and 80.52, respectively.        
	The 1+1+1 system was introduced in 2005, replacing the 2+1 pattern. The batch that graduated this year was the first to take the Part III test under the 1+1+1 system.        
	The number of successful candidates in BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part III is more than the Part II exams last year. Besides, in certain subjects such as chemistry, physics and geography, the number of first-class scorers is more this time, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	Students who secured first-class marks in physics numbered 228 and in chemistry 238.        
	The vice-chancellor attributed the improved performance to the reforms in the examination system that were initiated following the introduction of the 1+1+1 pattern.        
	In the new system, exams are held thrice, at the end of each academic year. In the earlier system, honours students had to sit for the university test twice  at the end of the second and the third year.        
	University officials said the distribution of the examination load in three parts has contributed to the improvement of students performance. The modernisation of the question and marking patterns, too, helped boost the scores.        
	We are happy with the results. But those who have scored below 60 per cent may find it difficult to secure a berth in the postgraduate class, Das pointed out.        
	There are around 5,550 seats in the MA, M.Sc and M.Com courses. Nearly 29,000 students have cleared the Part III exams this year. As many as 3,934 have scored first class, 60 per cent or more.        
	A large number of students who graduate with honours do not join the postgraduate courses. But the university will do the needful to ensure that each and every applicant with first-class marks gets an opportunity to study a course of his/her choice, the vice-chancellor said.        
	To achieve that end, he pointed out, the university is considering allowing more colleges to run postgraduate courses.

        A potpourri of the nation
   Since its inception in 2004, Kolkata Conservators of Nature has kept its coverage diverse. Over the years, the purview has become larger, embracing ethnicity, landscape, wildlife, culture, festivals and rituals.What is sought to be frozen in frames is the very honesty and gracious simplicity of our native elements. This year rsquo;s edition of the photography exhibition has contributions made by members Tanmoy Choudhury, Barun Kumar Dutta, Arghya Choudhury, Suman Chatterjee, Saikat Roy, Pradip Barai, Joydev Goswami and Samar Saha, along with non-members P.S. Lahiri, Debjyoti Roy and Joydip Mitra. Almost every state of India is represented and most of the festivals are looked into. The attempt is to provide a glimpse of living India and to make people conscious about conserving this collective wealth of the nation, be it wildlife, rituals or the basic little elements of people rsquo;s happiness. A photograph titled Dance is Over, by Barun Kumar Dutta, appears here. 

 Event: An exhibition of photographs by Kolkata Conservators of Nature When: Till January 2; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Gaganendra Pradarshashala

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Women held for cheating
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Four women were arrested in Entally on Friday for duping people by running an illegal chit fund scheme from their homes.         
	Police said 37-year-old Ayesha Hussain, a resident of Lalmohan Bhattacharya Lane, was the leader of the gang. She was arrested in her home along with her neighbours and accomplices Rizwana Begum, 20, Rabia Khatun, 30 and Nahid Begum, 32.         
	The four used to dupe middle-class residents of Entally and adjacent areas by promising high returns on investment, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.        
	According to an estimate, over 165 people have been cheated of more than Rs 1.5 lakh in the past two months. There are many others who have been duped by the gang, said a senior officer.         
	The cops acted on a complaint by a middle-aged resident of the area. He was promised a loan after he paid the first EMI (equated monthly instalment) in advance.        
	His loan was sanctioned in October but when he visited Ayeshas office this month, he was asked to come back in December, said an investigator.

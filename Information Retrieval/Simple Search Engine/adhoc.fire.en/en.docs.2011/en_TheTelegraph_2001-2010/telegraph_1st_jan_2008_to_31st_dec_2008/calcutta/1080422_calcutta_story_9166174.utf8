                      Artists portraits                    Besides the assertion of the artists individual self as the prime decider in artistic creation, the exact nature of motivation for projection of the creators self-image in art not only remains, but is growing more complex. The varied nature of the motivations and their layered existence in human consciousness is something that the concerned artists themselves are not aware of. Image of Ones Own Self, the ongoing exhibition, features paintings, sculptures and prints that offer important clues to the priorities that guide the motives of individual artists. Chandrima Bhattacharya (a painting by her appears right) seems to visualise herself as a woman past her prime, who dolls herself up extravagantly while she reminisces over her youth and the frenzied activity of that period of her life. Chhatrapati Dutta finds himself entangled in a web of politico-legal network. Debanjan Roys sculptures reveal him to be a devourable object of unabashed power. Kazi Nasir projects himself as a techno-savvy, post-modern scientist whose love for nature is limited within the confines of a laboratory. While Pappu Bardhan visualises himself as a faceless victim of society with a blank, indefinite future, Rajarshi Biswas appears to be trying to overcome the obstacles imposed by consumerism. Other participants are Prasanta Sahu, Sajal Kaity, Manjira, Ratan and Lopa. Curated by Pranabranjan Ray.

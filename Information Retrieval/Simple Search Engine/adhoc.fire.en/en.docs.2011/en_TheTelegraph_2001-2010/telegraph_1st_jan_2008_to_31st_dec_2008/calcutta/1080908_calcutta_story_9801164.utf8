  - Teen tides over tragedies, toils through the day and attends college in the evening          MALINI BANERJEE                          Ranajit Haldar (left) at this years The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence                                        
	Nothing could stop Ranajit Haldar from studying. Not the loss of his left eye when he was in Class VI. Not the loss of his father, in an accident, when he was in Class IX. Not the loss of his elder brother 15 days before his Madhyamik exams. Not the strain of washing cars, giving private tuitions and working in a catering unit to support his mother and fund his own studies before his Higher Secondary (HS) exams this year.        
	Its all right. A lot of my friends also worked to get through school, he says, making light of his own toils that brought home Rs 1,500 a month.        
	Now, living in a Rs 75 per month shanty on Ballygunge Station Road with his mother, Ranajit studies B.Com in South City College (evening). He scored 58 per cent in HS and is determined to pursue an MBA.        
	Things are looking up for 19-year-old, who was awarded The German Consulate Scholarship at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence 2008.        
	A month ago he found a job in Samudhbav, a bookshop stocking law books. He works in the shops South Calcutta Law College outlet on Swinhoe Street from 7.30am to 10.30am and in another shop of the same owner from noon to 5pm. He religiously attends college from 5.30pm to 9.15pm.        
	I like my current job. Its at least related to academics, he says seriously, while stacking books neatly on a shelf. He now brings home Rs 2,000 a month. Ranajits college admission fees of Rs 2,400 were paid by his employer Sandipan Chatterjee but he is worried about funding his MBA dream.         
	The immediate worry, though, is finding more time to spend with his books. I dont have enough time to study, rues the boy who borrows two newspapers every day and reads every word to be in the loop. Im disturbed by the Singur issue. I want development to continue in Bengal, he says.        
	And what about his own development; isnt he finding the college curriculum tough to cope with? Theres nothing I find difficult, he says about his subjects. Nothings difficult if you study enough, he smiles.        
	No one would dare argue with Ranajit Haldar about that.

  - NOWHERE TO GO AFTER CAMPS CLOSE          A STAFF REPORTER                          Husna Mondol feeds one of her five children with a meal provided by a local club after her Uttar Panchannagram shanty was razed in a Sunday blaze. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Husna Mondol and her family have been staying in a relief camp since Sunday night, when a fire razed her shanty in Uttar Panchannagram, off the Bypass.        
	She, along with her husband and five children, have been surviving on food and clothes being supplied by the local Banga Bani Sangha club.        
	But once the camp closes down  sooner or later  Husna and her family will have nowhere to go, for they had been illegal settlers at Uttar Panchannagram. We will not be allowed to stay there again, as there are no documents to prove that the place belonged to us, lamented Husna.        
	We used to stay in a shanty near Science City, from where we moved to Uttar Panchannagram eight years ago. We had rented a 15ftx10ft space here for Rs 150 a month, recalled Husna.        
	Her fear is shared by the 750-odd families that had settled illegally in the slum, which had come up after filling up a pond. Most settlers are refugees from Bangladesh or migrants from Bihar.        
	More than 200 of them were rendered homeless by the fire, which 25 tenders took more than three hours to douse. They have moved into camps set up by local clubs.        
	Most of the families could not salvage anything from the fire. We had saved around Rs 15,000 for our daughters marriage and kept the money in a cupboard. The fire spread so quickly that nothing could be salvaged, said Chand Singh, who has taken shelter in the Naba Yubak Sangha camp.        
	Amidst the miseries, there are tales of courage, too. Pappu Singh and Shampa Biswas, two of the homeless, sat for their first Higher Secondary paper on Tuesday.        
	Pappus books got burnt and Shampa lost her admit card in the fire. We arranged for Pappus books and requested the state Higher Secondary council to allow Shampa to take the test without the admit card. The council accepted our plea, said Gautam Karmakar, the secretary of Banga Bani Sangha.         
	My exam went off well, said Pappu, who spent Monday night studying inside the club room.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Citu firm on airport strike
                                                                                                               Citu firm on airport strike
  - Monday meeting last hope for fliers across the country          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The indefinite nationwide strike by airport staff from February 26 threatens to disrupt flights and is sure to bring passenger services to a halt. Also, it ties up civil aviation minister Praful Patel on his daughters wedding day in Udaipur.        
	Fliers in Calcutta, and the rest of the country, are pinning their last hopes on Mondays meeting between the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the employees union in Delhi.        
	If the AAI does not bend, the strike is inevitable, asserted Shyamal Chakraborty, the state chief of Citu, which is backing the shutdown.        
	The strike has been called to protest the AAIs decision to close down the Hyderabad and Bangalore airports to make way for private greenfield projects and press for financial demands of the employees.        
	If the flights operate at all  the airlines said they would stick to schedule  fliers at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport will have to cope up with dirty terminals, filthy toilets and lack of basic facilities, like drinking water and air-conditioning.        
	The airport authorities said they were taking measures to ensure normal operations. Employees who man the air traffic control will not be a party to the shutdown.        
	But sources said there can still be disruption to flights as personnel in other key departments have reportedly pledged their support to the strike.        
	Fire services employees will take part in the agitation, said a leader of AAI Employees Union. The employees support can stall operations, as fire tenders are needed during landing, the source pointed out.        
	The airport authorities are planning to seek help from Indian Air Force and the state fire services department to bail them out. Runway and radar maintenance, too, is likely to be affected, as the drivers of inspection vehicles will join the ceasework.         
	The airlines, however, are determined to follow their schedule. Till now, the decision is to operate all flights, a member of the Airlines Operations Committee said on Sunday. Air India, Jet Airways, Kingfisher and other carriers said there was no cancellation of flights.        
	We are receiving queries from passengers but there has been no cancellation, said a spokesperson for Air India.        
	Citu leader Chakraborty, when told that even the Bengal government run by his party is courting private greenfield projects, said: We are not opposed to greenfield projects if they are viable. The state is asking for it in addition to Calcutta airport. But we cannot accept closure of airports.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Next weekend you can be at ...   Koen
                                                          
	Nuapada station, 247 km from Khurdah Road, must be one of the quietest in the country. After the Chennai Mail that dropped me at the station disappeared in the horizon, the only sound I could hear was of leaves rustling in the breeze.        
	Outside the station, cattle and buffaloes were grazing on a large field. There was a nip in the air even at 10am, so I headed to the lone tea stall in the station.        
	A piping hot cuppa later, it was time to ask for direction. A tribal reeking of country liquor could only direct me to the bus stand, where fortunately there were more people. I learnt that the sea is about 30 km away at Banpode. Parlakimidi is two-and-a-half hours by bus. The reserved forests of Koen, Dandahati and Sarenga can be easily reached from there.        
	A seaside stroll was too tempting to ignore, so I took an autorickshaw to Banpode. The beach with hundreds of fishermen milling around was no place for a stroll though.        
	In two hours I was back at Nuapada digging into a south Indian lunch. Which I nearly threw up on the way to Parlakimidi in a bus loaded with cartons of foul-smelling fish.        
	A few years ago, a train used to chug the 90 km narrow-gauge tracks to Gunpur via Parlakimidi. The service has been suspended for gauge conversion.        
	It was dusk when I reached Parlakimidi, and the 75-km journey to Koen, under Ramgarh forest range, lay ahead. Dandahati is about 55 km to the north-west, the dense Sarenga is nearer by 5 km.        
	The DFO of Parlakimidi advised me to start for Koen the next morning and generously offered accommodation at the lodge.         
	I was on the road by 10 next morning in a hired car. As it powered up the hill, the branches of Akashmoni, Sisoo and Mahul Mundi bordering the narrow road brushed against the roof. Through clearings in the foliage, I could see waterfalls plunging down the slope. The driver told me it is quite common to come face to face with bears and leopards here. We, however, reached a sparsely populated village market, where we had lunch, without encountering any wildlife.         
	We reached the Koen forest bungalow around 4pm. I was eager to explore the forest but it was too late for an excursion. So I did the next best thing: sat outdoors and soaked in the atmosphere. The only sound I could hear was the trickle of streamlets. Butterflies flitted in and out of the bushes. Soon, it was time for dinner  a curry of wildfowl and rice.        
	Early next day, I accompanied the beat officer into the forest. As we walked along the trail, he told me many stories about the dense forests of the state.        
	The Koen forest extends hundreds of kilometres towards Dandakaranya. After a couple of hours, the wall of trees was too dark and dense to penetrate. We turned back.        
	On the way to the bungalow, we came across a lonely river rich with water from several falls. Bogra, Chippu and Dolhara are some of the tribal villages that border the forest.   
	Going   
	Take south-bound trains like Chennai Mail or East Coast Express. Get down at Nuapada and hire a vehicle to Parlakimidi.  
	Staying   
	There are lodges and hotels at Parlakimidi. The tariff is about Rs 300 to Rs 400 per day. Cars are available to Koen, Dandahati and Sarenga.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cost spiral drives CMC towards cash crunch
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cost spiral drives CMC towards cash crunch

	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is moving towards a financial crisis owing to its failure to increase revenue collection and spiralling maintenance and project bills.         
	If it continues like this, the budget deficit in 2010 will go beyond our control, said an official in the civic audit department.        
	The annual civic budget is currently about Rs 1,400 crore. The CMC earns about Rs 800 crore by way of taxes, various fees and interest on investments. The state government bridges the gap between revenue and expenditure.         
	The way expenses are going up, the budget deficit will double from Rs 500 crore in the next couple of years, added the official.        
	The projected increase in revenue will fail to match the rise in expenditure. The civic bodys revenue grows between 10 per cent and 15 per cent every year but the expenditure is going up by 35-40 per cent.         
	The civic audit department has sent a caution notice to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. The notice states that if the property tax dues are not realised immediately and new avenues created to generate revenue, the civic budget for 2010-11 will be hard to prepare.         
	The audit department also pointed out that the CMCs scope for augmenting revenue is limited.        
	The civic bodys contribution to Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) projects and the maintenance of facilities it has taken over from the CMDA, state irrigation department and Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners would take up about Rs 500 crore.        
	The CMC will have to shell out Rs 100 crore annually for 28 years to repay the Rs 1,800-crore ADB loan for laying sewer lines from South Sinthee to Paikpara in north Calcutta and the added areas in Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur. The civic body will also have to spend about Rs 2,000 crore over the next five years on infrastructure projects taken up under the JNNURM.         
	Extra-budgetary allotments to departments  which are not cleared by the civic finance controllers  are adding to the CMCs financial woes, said a senior official of the accounts section.        
	Developing infrastructure in underdeveloped areas is the moral responsibility of any civic body. Funds are required for this. Our current financial situation does not permit us to carry out such development, but the CMC cannot sit idle. We have to arrange funds and tap unutilised resources, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	We are launching a drive to harness resources that have not been tapped so far, added Bandyopadhyay.         
	The mayor and the municipal commissioner have organised several meetings to harness resources. Bandyopadhyay will preside over a meeting of the controlling officers of revenue collection on November 4 on the same issue.         
	The officers who fail to meet revenue targets may be punished, said a civic source.

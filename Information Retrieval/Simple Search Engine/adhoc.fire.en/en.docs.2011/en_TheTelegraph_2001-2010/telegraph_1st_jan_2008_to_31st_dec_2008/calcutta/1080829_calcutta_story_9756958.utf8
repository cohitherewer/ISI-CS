          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A Nigerian footballer was arrested on Thursday on the charge of overstaying.        
	E. John Chicago, 27, had landed in Mumbai in February 2005 with a tourist visa valid for six months.        
	According to immigration officials in Calcutta, Chicago wanted to play football for an Indian club. But since he was here on a tourist visa, he was unable to sign up for any club, said an official.        
	Chicago wanted to return to his country a few days ago, but having overstayed in India, he knew he would be caught at any airport, the official added.        
	To avoid getting caught, he lodged a police complaint in Delhi saying his passport had been lost. He then applied to the Nigerian embassy for a duplicate passport, which was issued to him.         
	With his new passport, Chicago could have left from Delhi itself. But he probably wanted to be extra cautious. So he decided to take a flight from Calcutta, the official said.         
	Chicago arrived in the city three days back and went to the foreigners regional registration office to apply for a departure clearance certificate. A foreigner who has lost his passport cannot leave the country without the certificate.        
	The clearance certificate was not issued as he made contradictory statements about his stay in India, said Basab Talukdar, the deputy commissioner (security and control) and the regional registration officer for foreigners.        
	Immigration officials then discovered that Chicagos visa had expired three years back. When the Nigerian came back to the office on Thursday, he was handed over to police.        
	A probe is on to find out what he was doing in India and how he was earning his livelihood, Talukdar said.

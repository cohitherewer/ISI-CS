The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Once again in currency
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Once again in currency
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The interior of Currency Building, which was on the verge of dereliction, transformed after the Archaeological Survey of India began to restore it. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Currency Building is being reborn.        
	After its partial destruction by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which wanted to put up a highrise in the middle of Dalhousie Square, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was officially put in charge of the 150-year-old building in the Italian Renaissance style in 2003. But ASI was given possession of it only in 2005.        
	First the mountains of debris behind the giant wrought iron gate facing Telephone Bhavan were cleared, and the faade was repaired up to the first floor. The top floors and the terrace of the massive building had become infested with a forest of weeds. These parasites, once visible from all the roads that encircle it, have been removed. Scaffolding was put up inside and outside the structure.        
	In between, a plan to erect a highrise on the vacant plot across the street was rejected as Currency Building is a protected monument. The area 100 m from it is protected, and new construction in another 200 m from it is allowed subject to ASI approval.         
	This year, rooms in the eastern (RN Mookerjee Road side) and western wings (facing Laldighi) have been repaired, and the transformation is remarkable. The gigantic arches, partially-demolished, are whole once again, and look even more dramatic in contrast with portions yet untouched.        
	Bimal Bandopadhyay, the superintending archaeologist of Calcutta circle, says Currency Building is top priority for ASI and there is a proposal to repair the damaged staircase this year. Over the next three years, the ground floor facing Laldighi, rooms and corridor will be repaired along with the upper storeys and the exterior. It has not yet been decided how Currency Building will be used after its restoration is complete.        
	Bandopadhyay said work on Clive house in Dum Dum has been stalled as squatters are still occupying a section of the building, said to be the oldest surviving structure in Calcutta. It is owned partly by South Dum Dum Municipality and partly by the state government. ASI is unable to resist its deterioration, particularly because the damaged terrace and floors cannot be repaired.        
	Hastings house in Barasat, which was also in the stranglehold of parasitical plants, continues and the ground floor has been repaired. Work has been started on the original staircase and terrace.

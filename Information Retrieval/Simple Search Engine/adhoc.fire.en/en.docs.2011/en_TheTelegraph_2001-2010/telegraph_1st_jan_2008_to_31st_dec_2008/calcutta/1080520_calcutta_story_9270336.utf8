The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Order delay holds up Besu probe 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Order delay holds up Besu probe 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Besu campus: Uncertainty ahead                                  
	The one-man committee set up by the state government more than a month ago to probe student unrest at Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) has yet to start work.        
	The delay has been blamed on Besus reluctance to issue a notification on the constitution of the panel  to be headed by former vice-chancellor Sparshamani Chatterjee  and its terms of reference.         
	The notification is meant to also invite interested parties to depose before the panel. The rules for such a probe stipulate that the panel cannot start functioning unless the notification is issued.        
	The Chatterjee commission, set up through a government order on August 8, is supposed to submit its report within three months.        
	We are trying to issue the notification at the earliest, preferably by next week, said registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay.        
	The Shibpur campus was on the boil and academic activity was on hold for more than two weeks in March following student clashes.        
	Sources attributed the delay in issuing the notification to a tussle between the state government and the university.        
	Besu had issued a notification on March 29 about the constitution of a probe panel. But Chatterjee refused to take charge of the probe unless the chancellor, Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, asked him to. This prompted the government to issue its April 8 order, leading to resentment among Besu higher-ups.        
	Ours is an autonomous body. We cannot issue a fresh notification in response to the April 8 order without the states clearance. We have written to the government on this, said a Besu official.        
	A section of teachers fears that the delay will affect Besus upgrade process, which is awaiting the Centres nod.

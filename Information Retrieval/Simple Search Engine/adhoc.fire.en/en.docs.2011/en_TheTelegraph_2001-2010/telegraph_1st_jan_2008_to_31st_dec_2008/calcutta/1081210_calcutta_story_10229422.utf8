	The old boys association of St Xaviers Collegiate School is set to kick-start gala celebrations to commemorate 150 years of the institution on Friday, coinciding with the 31st reunion of Alumnorum Societas (Alsoc).        
	A host of development projects for the school as well as an annual calendar of programmes are being drawn up for the year-long celebrations.        
	The old boys of the school, which was born on January 16, 1860, range from Rabindranath Tagore to Jagadish Chandra Bose, Jyoti Basu to Sourav Ganguly.        
	Tagore had started the schools first old boys association in 1932, which was disbanded for decades before being revived in 1976.        
	We are celebrating 150 years of the school and the college, though the latter was established some time after the school. Interestingly, the school was called St Xaviers College till as recently as 50 years ago, after which the name was changed to St Xaviers Collegiate School, said Noomi Mehta, the secretary of Alsoc.        
	There will be at least one event every month for the next year. It can be seminars or debates or some fun activity, added Mehta.        
	Fridays reunion on the grounds shared by the school and college will begin with a prayer meeting for former headmaster Rev. Fr. Adrien Wavreil and senior school teachers Thomas Vianna and Mridula Goswami, who died recently, as well as for the victims of the Mumbai attacks.        
	The Alsoc projects for the institutions 150th year will be unveiled and the Alsoc award for excellence will be presented, said the convener for the reunion, Vivek Jaiswal.        
	We will flag off the celebrations in grand style on Friday. A similar event next year year will mark the end of the celebrations. In between we hope to make a lot of constructive contributions and help our school reach even greater heights, added Jaiswal.        
	One such initiative planned for 2009 is creating more classrooms for the primary school building on Wood Street. One floor will be added to the small school building and two towers will come up on either side so that more students can be educated at St Xaviers. The terrace will be covered to convert it into a hall, which can be used for indoor games and other activity, explained Mehta.        
	There are plans to install modern elevators in both the senior and junior schools and also start a health insurance scheme for the 180 staff members. A corpus fund will be created to get the best of teachers to Xaviers. We are looking to fund the salaries of six teachers in the senior section so that we continue to impart lessons of the highest quality, said Mehta.        
	A brick and mortar building with modern toilets will also be constructed for the Pravabati Mondal Bal Balika Vidyalaya in Bishnupur, supported by Alsoc.

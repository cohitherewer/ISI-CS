          A STAFF REPORTER                                                 Security guards keep the gates barred at the housing estate in Lake Gardens where the Ghosal family lived. A Telegraph picture		      
	Ritam Ghosals future was the primary concern of his relatives and friends after they performed the last rites of his parents and sister on Tuesday.         
	A train smashed into the familys car at a level crossing in Katwa, Purbasthali, about 170 km from Calcutta, on Monday. Physicians Ranadeb and Ipsita and their 15-year-old daughter Rupsa died.        
	Eighteen-year-old Rupam was admitted to AMRI Hospitals with multiple facial injuries and superficial injuries in the chest.         
	The four had driven from their home in Lake Gardens to Katwa on Sunday evening to offer puja at the ashram of Swami Pragyadas Kathiababa as Ritam had done well in his Higher Secondary examination.        
	He is so young. We dont know how he will respond to the tragedy, said Tapas Ghosal, elder brother of Ranadeb. The teenager was conscious and alert on Tuesday, said a doctor. He is in the ICU. There are multiple fractures in his body, including a minor one in the skull.        
	Ritam is also suffering from facial oedema. There is no immediate need for surgical intervention. However, once the facial oedema is cured, we can think of surgery, added the doctor.        
	We know that Ritam cannot stay with only his grandmother, who is suffering from various age-related problems. My younger daughter Chaiti will stay with him for some time, said Tapas.        
	Tapas and his three other brothers live in the same locality. They have decided to do everything possible to help the teenager cope with the loss of his parents and sister.         
	Ritam sat for his joint entrance examination on Saturday. He wants to become an engineer, though his father wanted him to become a doctor. All we want now is for him to recover quickly and return home, said Tapas.

                                                                                                               Carrier drops Delhi flight
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcuttans flying cheap to Delhi will have an option less this summer  low-cost carrier Deccan is withdrawing its service on the route from March 30.        
	The carrier, which merged with Kingfisher Airlines last year, operates a daily evening flight to Delhi and a morning flight that takes off four days a week.        
	We review our sector-wise performance on a regular basis. After our synergised operation with Kingfisher Airlines, weve adopted a revised schedule that caters to passenger needs and also takes into account the companys revenue and the shareholders value, a Deccan official said.        
	The revised schedule will be continue till October 25, after which it will be reviewed again. Its part of the route rationalisation process following the synergised operation, the official added.        
	Sources, however, pointed out that Deccan was not making much profit on the Calcutta-Delhi route because of competitive fares on the sector.        
	The withdrawal of the service is set to jeopardise the travel plans of hundreds of passengers. Kingfisher and Deccan cater to different classes of passengers, a tour operator pointed out. The minimum average fare offered by Kingfisher on the Calcutta-Delhi route is Rs 1,000 more than Deccans. Now, those who want to fly cheap to the capital will have their choice limited to IndiGo, JetLite and SpiceJet.        
	Delhi has a consistent market. The airlines decision will send wrong signals to the aviation industry about Calcutta, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	From April, Deccan is adding a direct flight (morning) to Mumbai. Now, it runs a flight to Mumbai via Bhubaneswar. Besides, an evening flight will be operated between Calcutta and Bangalore.

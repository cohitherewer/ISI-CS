                Indrajit Chatterjee was arrested on Kona Expressway on Monday for allegedly defrauding banks of about Rs 10 crore. Chatterjee, who owns a real estate firm, and his wife Rasika took loans by claiming to develop a property on Syed Amir Ali Avenue, said police. They produced a film, Greftaar, before disappearing. The CBI, too, had been looking for Chatterjee in connection with a fraud.     Four youths were arrested on Sunday night in connection with the theft of about Rs 4 lakh from the office of an investment company on Hazra Road. The company guard Bharat Sadhukhan was arrested after the theft on May 15. Jugal Kishore Shaw, a relative of owner Sreedayal Sharma, had masterminded the theft, said police. He was arrested in Taratala. Amardeep Gupta, Anup Shaw and Sujit Sharma were arrested in Cossipore. The money has not been recovered.     A camera, an iPod, a credit card and a wallet containing Rs 600, belonging to a South Korean tourist, were recovered by Park Street police on Saturday night. The items had gone missing on June 10 from Mother House, where Lee Hyeram, 24, was staying. The items were allegedly stolen by Sheikh Gora, a drug addict. He was arrested in Topsia.     A four-year-old boy was electrocuted in Howrah on Monday. Muhammad Arif, a resident of Rosan Gulzar Lane, touched a live wire laid by the owner of the building to supply electricity to his tenants. The owner has been arrested. The body was sent for post-mortem.    The international cargo division of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has lodged a complaint with the airport police station about a missing consignment worth Rs 7 lakh. An AAI official said the consignment was due to arrive in Calcutta by a private airline on April 18. It could not be found in the warehouse of the international cargo terminal. An AAI official said a probe will determine whether the cargo was stolen from the airport or it did not arrive.     Air Traffic Control (ATC) officials at the airport on Monday refused to work beyond their duty hours to protest the transfer of a number of their colleagues. An official alleged that the authorities are transferring workers from Calcutta airport even though there is a severe shortage of personnel. Some ATC officials do the morning as well as the night shift on the same day because of manpower shortage. The transfer will aggravate the crisis, added the official.    Maoist leader Himadri Sen Roy was produced before the chief judicial magistrates court at Barasat on Monday. He has been accused of conspiring against the government. He will be produced in the court on July 7 for trial. He was arrested on February 23 at Hridaypur station.    A middle-aged woman was seriously injured on Sunday night when the taxi she was travelling in rammed into a truck carrying bamboo poles on Kidderpore flyover. The incident took place around 11.45pm. The bamboo poles smashed the windscreen of the taxi and hit Rangeela Shaw in the abdomen. Residents of the area rushed her to SSKM Hospital. The drivers of both vehicles have been arrested.

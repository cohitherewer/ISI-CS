The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | At the centre of the circle of his life
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       At the centre of the circle of his life

	When a young reader asked Amitav Ghosh about the thematic concern of his work, he responded simply that it was to tell the readers of the wonders of life. And that is what he does in rich abundance in Sea of Poppies, the first part of his Ibis trilogy.         
	Ghosh, who has been travelling around the country with the book, was in town this week to launch it in one of the three places he calls home (the other two being Goa and New York). The launch in Calcutta is really special for me as apart from being my birthplace, and hometown, it is also the centre of the circle of my life, said the author.         
	The unveiling of Sea of Poppies celebrated the spirit and life of the river 80 feet above the Hooghly at the Floatel. An apt introduction to a novel that dwells on history, language and culture intersecting with adventure and high drama aboard a ship travelling down the Ganga to make its way to distant shores. A large part of the book was written here and much of the action is based in this city and on these waters upon which we are afloat, observed Ghosh.         
	The mood at the unconventional venue was heightened by the July drizzle, the occasional train thundering down the tracks outside and the waiters dressed as sailors. Rahul Bose read dramatically from the river-centric passages of the book, Prof Sukanta Chaudhuri engaged in discussions based on travelling down the river and Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi dwelt on the writers exquisite craft. Vikram Seth had once asked Amitav Ghosh to stick to prose and I believe it was pre-determined by the muses as his words carry themselves from the forests of the Sunderbans to Cambodia to Indo-China to Burma, he said.         
	Ghosh himself dived into trivia about ships and the importance of the setting for a work that explodes with the drama of a sea yarn while recounting a history rendered accessible through the writers imagination. History is the scaffolding for the novel whereas the walls and the dynamic aspect are provided by the characters, he mused.         
	As for the historical setting being the centre of the circle of his life, he said: Calcutta was the funnel for trade, the point through which migrants left the country and the starting point of many journeys.         
	Ghoshs journey with his Penguin publication continued the next day at a book-signing event at Oxford. The 52-year-old was besieged by fans ranging from a schoolboy who had read his works in the classroom and bought Sea of Poppies for his mother to a young literary critic who had brought a copy of his own book (a guide to English literature) to gift the author.         
	I think Amitav Ghosh is the best Indian writer writing in English today. I am from Burma and I think he has captured the majesty of the Burmese people and addressed their glorious past as well as modern-day concerns so well, marvelled Yu Yu Din, a 26-year-old media professional based in the city who has been reading his books and gifting them to her friends for years.         
	The day before the launch, the author had told The Telegraph that he felt good when young people came up and told him how his books had touched them. It is ultimately for this that we write, he had said. The Calcutta launch of Sea of Poppies must have given Amitav Ghosh enough reason to feel good and keep writing.

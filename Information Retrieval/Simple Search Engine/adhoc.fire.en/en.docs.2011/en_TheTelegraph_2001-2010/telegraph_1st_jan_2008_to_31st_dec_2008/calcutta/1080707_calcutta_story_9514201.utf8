                      Inspired by antiquity                    An artistic search for identity and tradition marks the paintings of Bangladeshi artist Minakshi De. The continuation of a recent show held in the US, Without Boundaries, the ongoing exhibition of her paintings, features 16 works inspired by ancient Indian temple art. Paying solemn tribute to the countrys rich and glorious art heritage, the works on show marvellously recreate primitive relief work depicting deities, floral designs and various religious motifs on temple walls. What is significant about her paintings is the way in which they represent the light-and-shadow effect of temple art, a major portion of the form in semi-darkness with only the face highlighted. Though a few of the works are built upon the theme of man-woman relationships, ancient symbolism plays a vital role in such compositions as well. Mainly done in earth colours, with the sole exception of a bright shade of blue, Des creations are characterised by a layered, textured effect, recreating the calm and soothing atmosphere of old temple interiors.                    Event: Paintings by Minakshi De When: Till July 10; 2 pm - 8 pm Where: Samokal Art Gallery, 23 Gariahat Road, Gol Park

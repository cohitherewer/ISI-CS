          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Goodbye monsoon, hello power cuts.        
	The city and its adjoining areas suffered widespread power cuts on Monday as a coal crisis, triggered by Puja holidays and the recent rain, hit production in the CESC and state-run plants.        
	Power cuts are feared on Tuesday, too.         
	The Met office said the monsoon withdrew from Bengal on Monday. There will, however, be some clouds because of the moisture left behind by the monsoon. A North Wind has started blowing and is likely to bring down the minimum temperature, said an official.        
	The disruption in power supply on Monday  each phase stretching an hour or more  started in the afternoon, with the shortfall in the CESC-served areas touching 123 MW.        
	In the evening, the shortfall was down to 83 MW as the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited increased its supply and CESC stepped up production in its Titagarh and New Cossipore units.        
	Officials said the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited was forced to reduce generation as its coal stock would not last beyond four days. The same reason prompted CESC, too, to go slow on production.        
	We are generating only 35 MW in the New Cossipore plant against its optimum capacity of 100 MW. The Titagarh units, too, are being run sparingly. The coal stock in our plants will last only two days, said a CESC official.        
	The state power department on Monday got in touch with the Union coal ministry and Coal India, urging them to step up supply.        
	Things are looking up. Eleven rakes of coal (each containing 3,500 tonnes) arrived on Monday. Once they are unloaded, 12 more will come, power secretary Sunil Mitra said.        
	On any given day, the state-run power plants need 15 rakes of coal.         
	Power Development Corporation managing director S. Mahapatra said generation at Santaldih would pick up from Tuesday as the two units shut down following the collapse of a conveyor belt were re-started on Monday.        
	The power secretary was hopeful that generation would pick up from Tuesday.

                      The nutty bachelor                    Elwood P Dowd is a gentle, amiable bachelor who has imagined for himself a companion named Harvey  a tall, human-like white rabbit whom none but Elwood can see (but at times some others as well!). This makes the situtation unbearable for his widowed sister, Veta Louise, and niece, Myrtle Mae, who have come to stay with him in the Dowd mansion. Veta gets the family lawyer to help get Elwood admitted to a sanitarium for psychiatric treatment. The lawyer arrives and interviews the alleged lunatic patient. His judgment on Elwood confuses Veta and the others. Then, as the plot races from one funny event to another, the tables are turned incredibly for Elwood. Directed by Rohit Pombra, Stagecraft performs this delightful Pulitzer Prize winning play.                  Event: Play in English, Harvey, produced by Stagecraft When: Today at 6 pm Where: Gyan Manch

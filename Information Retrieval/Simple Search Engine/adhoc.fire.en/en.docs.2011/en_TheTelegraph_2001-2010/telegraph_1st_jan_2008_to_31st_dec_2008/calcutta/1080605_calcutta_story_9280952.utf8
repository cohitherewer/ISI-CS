The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fire-safety check after four warnings
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fire-safety check after four warnings

	Nandaram in January, Mullickghat in April, Chandni Chowk Market last week and Mehta Building on Tuesday  four fires in the past five months have forced the usually nonchalant trading community to take a long, hard look at whether they and their businesses are safe in the tinderbox markets of the city.         
	On Wednesday, a day after a godown in Mehta Building was gutted, traders operating from buildings along Canning Street admitted that they were playing with fire.        
	Plastic goods, leather goods, polythene, cosmetics, balloons  you name it, you will get it here. All these items are combustible but if you visit any of the markets, you will not find even a single fire extinguisher. A disaster is waiting to happen, said Arshad Shamsi, sitting in his imitation jewellery shop on the first floor of Janaki Centre, at 70 Canning Street.         
	There are as many as 10 small and large markets along Canning Street. Retailers from across Bengal visit the area to purchase cheap plastic goods, cosmetics, imitation jewellery, toys, plastic bags, balloons and electric fittings. The volume of business may be worth several hundred crores of rupees annually, but scarcely a penny is spent on safety measures.        
	Janaki Centre is one of the oldest and busiest markets of the area, famous for wholesale trade in imitation jewellery and toys. Around 10,000 people visit the 600-odd shops in the market during business hours. The level of safety, or the lack of it, can be gauged from the fact that the market has only one gate. The electrical wiring is a perennial threat and there is not a single extinguisher to put out a small fire, leave alone a big blaze.        
	Short-circuits occur every summer, but nobody is bothered. A local electrician restores power and everybody forgets about it till the next snag occurs, the owner of a shop on the second floor said.         
	Rampuria Market, a stones throw from Janaki Centre, is another potentially flaming death trap. Frequented by people looking for cosmetics and cheap plastic goods, Rampuria is smaller than Janaki Centre but not any safer than its neighbour. The passages are narrow, naked electricity wires hang overhead and there are no fire-fighting arrangements.        
	At the nearby Bagri Market, traders admitted they had no idea how unsafe their surroundings were until Nandaram and the three incidents that followed jolted them out of their slumber. But old habits die hard; the narrow passages within the market remain blocked by goods.         
	But Debabrata Das, the general secretary of the Bagree Market Merchants Forum, claimed that damaged electrical fittings had been repaired, fire extinguishers installed and guards hired in the past three years.        
	Another trader said the business fraternity was complacent about safety because of inadequate surveillance. There are no surprise checks by the fire services department. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation renews trade licences without checking fire-fighting arrangements and CESC officials never bother to enter the markets to check the state of the wiring.

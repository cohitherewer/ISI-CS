          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 45-year-old man was crushed to death between two private buses, moments after he had got off one, at the Lenin Sarani-Moti Sil Street crossing on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Anil Ghosh, a resident of Sil Lane near Tangra, had boarded the bus on route 24A/1 at Burrabazar. As he got off near Loreto Day School, the other bus, plying on route 30B, tried to overtake the first one from the left.        
	The trader was sandwiched between the two Moulali-bound vehicles.         
	The 30B bus, which was stationary, suddenly started moving after the man got off. As the buses sped away, he crumpled to the ground bleeding profusely. He was breathing when we got to him, said Atif Alauddin, a pedestrian.        
	He along with others took Ghosh to SSKM Hospital in a taxi. The trader was declared dead on arrival.        
	Both drivers have been arrested. We have charged them with reckless driving causing death, said an officer of New Market police station.        
	Local traders demonstrated after the mishap, demanding deployment of more traffic policemen in the area.        
	A single policeman controls traffic on Lenin Sarani. As a result, mishaps have become a daily feature. Private buses often endanger the lives of pedestrians but the police look the other way, said Aftab Alam, who works in a mobile shop.        
	Another mishap: A private bus ran over a 26-year-old man near Jagat cinema on APC Roy Road around 10pm on Wednesday.        
	The bus sped away after the mishap. Residents of the area set up a roadblock and hurled stones at other buses.

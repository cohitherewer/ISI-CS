                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Stolen items found in Bypass flat

	The arrest of a gang of burglars on Tuesday led sleuths to a servants room in an EM Bypass flat from where stolen items worth Rs 5 lakh have been recovered.        
	The CID team that raided the apartment early on Wednesday stumbled upon gold ornaments, foreign currencies, digital cameras, diamond and other precious stones, costly perfumes and DVDs of Hollywood movies.        
	The accused must have stolen the articles for the past several months. Todays yield may be the tip of an iceberg, said Sanjay Mukherjee, the special inspector-general of police, CID.        
	The sleuths suspect the gang has sold off many of the valuables. We are trying to trace those who had bought the items, Mukherjee added.        
	The CID learnt about the gang following the arrest of Rakhi Kahar, who worked as a help in the Bypass apartment owned by a businessman. Her employers are among her several victims.        
	We first picked up Rakhi and her daughter Pinky, said Mukherjee. During interrogation, we came to know that Rakhi used to supply maidservants to other houses and gathered information about the families through them.        
	Rakhis parental house is in Sainthia, Birbhum, where she had allegedly sent many of the stolen items. After interrogating the mother-daughter duo, the sleuths arrested Rakhis another daughter Rita, son-in-law Robin Naskar and Raju Rai, who allegedly had an affair with Rakhi.        
	Rakhi and her gang used to targets houses owned by NRIs or rich businessmen. These families are so rich that they did notice if one or two bangles or earrings go missing, said an investigating official.        
	The CID has informed Calcutta police about the seizure. Since Rakhi supplied maidservants to houses in Phoolbagan, we asked the city police to find out whether any burglary took place there recently, said Mukherjee.        
	The sleuths said Rakhis employers had not informed the police about her. People should keep the local police station posted about their help. Had everyone followed the rule, there would have been much less burglaries and thefts, said the officer.

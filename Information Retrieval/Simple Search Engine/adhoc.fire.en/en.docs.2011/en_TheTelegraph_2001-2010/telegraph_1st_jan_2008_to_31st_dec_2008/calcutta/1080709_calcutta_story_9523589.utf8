          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 27-year-old student of Surendranath College was arrested on Monday for securing admission with a fake marksheet. Soumitra Sarkar of Haringhata in Nadia was produced in court on Tuesday and remanded in police custody till July 18.         
	A preliminary investigation revealed that Sarkar had secured admission for the 2006-2007 academic session in the Arts section of the college with a fake marksheet of the Bihar Intermediate Educational Council.         
	The fraud came to light when the marksheet was sent to Calcutta University for verification. The university authorities decided not to inform the college. When Soumitra came to the university on Monday, he was brought to registrar Basab Chaudhuris office and handed over to us, said an officer of Jorasanko police station.         
	The university did not inform the college about the marksheet because it is difficult to trace the student if the college is informed, said a university insider.         
	According to Chaudhuri, the aim is to catch those who are running the fake marksheet racket.

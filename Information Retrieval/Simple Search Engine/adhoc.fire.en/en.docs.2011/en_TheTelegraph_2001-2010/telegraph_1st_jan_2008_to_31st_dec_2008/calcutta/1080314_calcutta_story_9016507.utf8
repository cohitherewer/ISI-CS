	Two groups of students, belonging to the SFI and the Faculty of Arts Students (FAS), clashed at Jadavpur University on Thursday over a tribunals ruling on a union election.        
	The clash followed the tribunals announcement that seven SFI candidates from the international relations department, who had allegedly provided wrong information in the nomination forms, could contest the arts faculty poll, scheduled for March 26.        
	The students had stated in the forms that they were from the political science department. FAS supporters asked for cancellation of the forms on the ground that the department does not exist.        
	But the tribunal, set up following the FAS demand, declared the nomination of the seven candidates valid because the political science department is the same as the international relations department .        
	The situation is under control, said registrar Rajat Bandyopadhyay.        
	College protest: The students of Viharilal College of Home and Social Sciences did not allow teachers and other employees to enter the campus on Thursday to protest the report of a panel acquitting a teacher of molestation charges.

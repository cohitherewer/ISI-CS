                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Carols, cookies amp; German

	They sang carols, baked cookies, and even decorated their stockings for Santa Claus to stuff gifts in. Thats how students of Goethe Institut, along with kids who have taken up German in school, celebrated the Yuletide spirit on December 6 or St Nicholas Day. Nikolaustag (St Nicholas Day) is celebrated by Germans to usher in the festive season.               
	In keeping with the spirit, students sang Silent Night in German. They also attended three activity workshops. One of them was the Christmas cookie baking session, where volunteers helped students roll the dough, cut it into various shapes, fill it with raisins and bake them.         
	Suchana Chowdhury and Shrinvanti Roy, both Class V students of GD Birla Centre for Education, were all smiles as baked cookies came out of the oven. This is a delightful way of celebrating Christmas, gushed Suchana.         
	The students were taught carols in German in the next room. Singing O Tannenbaum (O Christmas tree) and Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht (Silent Night, Holy Night) with them was Rajlaxmi Ghosh, an ex-student associated with the institution since 1988. I come here whenever I am in town, said Ghosh, now a resident of Dubai.         
	In another room, Debayan Deb of Don Bosco, Liluah, was sticking glitters on his stocking while Aditi Roy of Jaipuria College busily stitched her pair. The stocking-making workshop saw students striving hard to come up with the most attractive pair and exchange it with friends.        
	The exhibits of students who learn German in school were displayed in another room. Among the eye-catchers was a large picture of Santa Claus painted by the students of Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar and a collage by Anulia Ghosh, a Class IX student of Modern High School. Finally, it was gift distribution time in the evening. There were surprise gifts, too, for three lucky students  a free language course and two free memberships of Goethe Institut.

	A seven-day day visual arts workshop, Triumph Together, began on December 3  World Disability Day  at Gallery Rasa. It saw many people with disabilities showcasing their skills. Conducted by Trinayani trust, a group that works with disabled people in the field of art, and Khoj Kolkata, a platform for alternative art, the workshop included 18 participants, 12 with disabilities and six from Khoj.         
	The event kicked off with a performance by folk band Dohar. One of the participants, Surjo Shekhar, who has Down Syndrome, recited a poem. The participants, along with danseuse Alakananda Ray, a guest, took to the stage to Dohars foot-tapping numbers, giving a peppy start to the seven-day exercise.         
	Through the workshop we will celebrate difference in an ambience of togetherness. Being disabled does not mean being less able to enjoy the finer aspects of life, said Ritika Sahni, the founder trustee and secretary of Trinayani.         
	The workshop culminated in an open studio on December 8, with a montage of alternative art that included a hoarding with the faces of participants, paintings and thoughts on paper made into paper bags and a thermocol Taj Mahal.

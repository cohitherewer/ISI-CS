          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Monday asked the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education to pay a fine of Rs 2,000 to an examinee for harassing her by providing a wrong marksheet.        
	Sudisha Mondal, a resident of Durgachawk in Haldia town, got only 11 in mathematics out of 100 in her Higher Secondary examinations this year. With a total of 437 marks, she was, however, declared pass. Her mathematics marks was revised to 61.         
	After imposing the fine, Justice Soumitra Pal also asked the council to pay back Rs 5,000 to Sudisha, which she had deposited to the court.         
	On August 1, the judge had ordered the council to produce Sudishas mathematics answer script before him on September 22. He also directed Sudisha to deposit Rs 5,000 before the court by August 5, saying that the amount would be forfeited if her score remained unchanged after a recheck.        
	However, after Sudisha deposited the amount with the court, officials of the council asked her to collect a fresh marksheet. It showed Sudisha had scored 61 in mathematics.         
	Sudisha took the HS from Haldia Government Sponsored Girls Schools. After publication of results, she found that she had scored only 11 in mathematics, which was her third subject.        
	However, in the old marksheet, biology was mentioned as her third subject and mathematics as the fourth.        
	Sudisha got 75 in Bengali, 65 in English, 71 in chemistry, 63 in physics and 63 in biology.        
	On the basis of these marks, the vice-chancellor of Vidyasagar University allowed my client to get provisional admission in Mahishadal Raj College with mathematics honours, said A.S. Das, Sudishas counsel.        
	The court also directed Vidyasagar University to confirm Sudishas admission.

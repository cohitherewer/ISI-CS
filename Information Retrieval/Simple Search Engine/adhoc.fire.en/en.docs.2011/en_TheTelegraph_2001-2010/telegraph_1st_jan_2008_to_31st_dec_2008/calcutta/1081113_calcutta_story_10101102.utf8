          AMIT ROY IN LONDON                        Waterlogged residents near Patipukur bridge might benefit from research on flooding in collaboration with experts from UK; (below) Julian Orford from Queens University				                                       
	Flooding of the kind residents around Patipukur bridge have had to put up with every time there is a shower will become a thing of the past if environmental scientists from Queens University Belfast have their way.        
	The team, which is coming to Calcutta on November 19 for a four-day visit, is helping to set up a new Eastern India Water Research Institute.        
	The institute will be located at the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) and will be partnered by the Institute of Environmental Management and Studies.        
	Sources in Besu said a team of at least four officials from Queens University will arrive on the Shibpur campus on November 19. A team of Besu officials had earlier visited Belfast.        
	The new institute will carry out research in collaboration with Queens University, confirmed B.N. Dutta, the dean in-charge of sponsored research and institute-industry collaboration.        
	The scientists will not only aim to control arsenic levels in drinking water, but also develop better ways of tackling flooding in Calcutta.        
	They will also analyse the dangers to Indias coastline caused by cyclones and the rise in sea levels from global warming.        
	Patipukur rail bridge  between Milk Colony and Lake Town bus stops  has a history of waterlogging. It is a low-lying stretch with inadequate drainage facility, like many other parts of Calcutta.        
	According to a spokeswoman for Queens University, the funding worth $400,000 is coming from CMC Limited, an IT solutions company and a subsidiary of Tata Consultancy Services.        
	The General Register Office (Northern Ireland) has a deal with CMC to digitise their records. The CMC management, in turn, are employing Queens to do the work for them. The information gathered will also be used by academicians in Queens for projects in geography, she said.        
	The delegation, which will come to Calcutta via Delhi, will be led by Prof Peter Gregson, the vice-chancellor of Queens University Belfast, and include a number of experts in their field such as Prof Julian Orford, head of the school of geography, archaeology and paleaeocology.        
	In Calcutta, the visiting team will announce 30 more scholarships to enable students from India to study at Queens University.         
	Gregson said: International co-operation in research and education is vital for the joint economic futures of Northern Ireland and India. The opening of the institute in Calcutta is a clear demonstration of the benefits of such co-operation for people around the globe.         
	Besu will hold a special convocation on November 20 to confer an honorary doctoral degree on Gregson.        
	Orford, one of the worlds leading experts in coastal zone management  he was consulted over Hurricane Katrina in the US  said: The institute is part of a growing India-led coastal research infrastructure, that is actively collaborating with international scientists to help structure and develop the debate of how coastal zone communities can live with ever changing coastal conditions.

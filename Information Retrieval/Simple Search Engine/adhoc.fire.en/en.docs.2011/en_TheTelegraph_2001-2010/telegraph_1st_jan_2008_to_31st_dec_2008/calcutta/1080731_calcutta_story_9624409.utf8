The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Panel for green order
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Panel for green order

	The state government on Wednesday set up a nine-member committee to monitor the implementation of a high court order on controlling vehicular pollution in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.        
	The panel, headed by chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, has to start functioning with immediate effect.        
	The committee will monitor the functions of different agencies regarding the implementation of the court order, said an environment department notification. The agencies will have to file reports every fortnight.        
	The committee will also have the power to examine the records of the implementing agencies.        
	We will soon forward the names of the members to the advocate-general, who will pass on the information to high court, said environment secretary M.L Meena.        
	While delivering the July 18 order on pollution, the high court had ordered the state to form a committee that would monitor the implementation of the directive. Advocate-general Balai Roy was asked to ensure that the panel started functioning soon.        
	July 31 was set as the deadline for forming the committee, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department.        
	The court order, based on an environment department notification issued a day earlier, had banned plying of all 15-year-old commercial vehicles and made it mandatory for all autorickshaws (four-stroke) to switch to LPG mode.        
	The old vehicles are to be phased out by March 31, 2009, while the autos have to switch to green fuel by December 31, 2009. Two-stroke autos are to be scrapped by December 2008.        
	The court also directed a crackdown on unauthorised autos, adulteration of fuel and auto-emission testing centres that issue fake pollution-under-control certificates.        
	Apart from the chief secretary, the monitoring panel will include the transport secretary, environment secretary, state pollution control board chairman, police commissioner and an expert each from Jadavpur University and IIT Kharagpur. The environment secretary will be the member-secretary of the panel.

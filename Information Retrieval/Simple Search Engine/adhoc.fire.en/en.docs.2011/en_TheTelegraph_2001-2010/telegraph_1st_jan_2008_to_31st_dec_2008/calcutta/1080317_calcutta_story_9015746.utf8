          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda University has published a set of books for children between 11 and 16 years to shape their values according to Swami Vivekanandas ideals.        
	The set consists of story books in addition to value education books, aimed at schools. There are also books in the form of a diary-cum-personal journal, intending to help children develop healthy habits and the capacity for introspection and self-evaluation.        
	There is even a book for parents and teachers that draws their attention to the significance of the role played by them in shaping the lives of their children and students.        
	The books have been published under the Ramakrishna Missions value education project called Be and Make: Education for Manifesting Perfection Already in Man.         
	We have tried to make the books different. They wont make for heavy reading, but there will be elevation of thought, said Swami Atmapriyananda, the vice-chancellor of the university.         
	According to him, Unescos manifesto for the 21st Century proclaims learning to know, learning to do, learning to be and learning to live together as the four pillars of education. The first two pillars in the Unescos manifesto are taken care of through theoretical and practical lessons in schools and colleges. The last two pillars are usually neglected but there should be emphasis on them in the context of the current situation. The Missions value education books are an attempt to address the neglected issues, he added.        
	The books include Arunoday, a story book for children between 11 and 13; The Guiding Light, a story book for those between 12 to 14; How Shall I Be, a story book for those between 13 and 15, and Subhos Adventure, a story book for those between 14 and 16. The diary-cum-self-development journal for age group 12 to 14 is called Sanmarga Darshi, that for age group 13 to 15 is Vijnana Sarathi, and the one for age group 14 to 16 is Atmavikas.

          Today's question: Should shopping malls be allowed to come up in residential areas? More letters will be published next week                     Choking result: Prince Anwar Shah Road clogged by traffic in front of South City

	The residential areas of the city are saturated, there is no scope for horizontal expansion. Shopping malls built on plots which earlier had comparatively smaller houses are affecting the population pressure per square unit of land. Thus pressure in terms of water requirement and generation of solid waste have increased manifold and are going beyond the capability of the available infrastructure. The already unequal ratio of vehicles to road space will increase in the residential areas. These perennial sources of pollution will destroy the atmosphere required for peaceful and healthy living. So malls must not be allowed to come up in residential areas.              Pratika Gupta, 
  Phoolbagan								       
	No, shopping malls should not be allowed to come up in residential areas. Although it makes shopping a lot easier, people living in the nearby areas lose their peace of mind by the honking of cars and the rush of people. It becomes difficult for children to study in the evening as their concentration gets diverted. A sick person living in the vicinity suffers a lot too. Youths get a chance to pass their time window-shopping and eve-teasing.               Kshama Agarwal, 
  Girish Park       
	Shopping malls are new to India but building them in residential complexes will have its own share of problems. People prefer quiet and hassle-free zones as residential areas, so cropping up of malls there might not be a good idea. Malls should be near the residential areas, not in them.               Manash Kumar Das,
  Behala								       
	I love mall-hopping and visited the South City Mall sometime back. It was like a huge fair, with the crowd busy window-shopping. The parking facility of the mall boasts of a large capacity. But Prince Anwar Shah Road was chock-a-block with vehicles trying to reach the mall. With so many vehicles emitting smoke at a given place at a particular time, imagine what it does to the pollution level. With depleting greenery and more honking cars resulting from malls, we should think twice before coming out with plans of constructing one in a residential area.              Joydeep Chatterjee, 
  Shyambazar								       
	Shopping malls should be constructed in residential areas. But the authorities and the government must take necessary measures like adequate electricity supply and water supply, installation of fire management system, security and car parking. A mall may be permitted to come up if equipped with these measures.                 Arijit Ghosh,
  Serampore								       
	I am not averse to the idea. But this way we are leaving little room for our kids to play in. Why do we need a shopping mall in a congested area when we can go and get what we want from a mall located, perhaps, a few kilometres away? The kids, already burdened with the mammoth syllabus, hardly get any space outside their homes for a bit of fresh air. Moreover, something should be done to develop the living standards of slum-dwellers, if any, in the area where the mall is proposed to be set up, since it would be ironic if a son from a well-to-do family enters the mall and a lad from the slum his age looks on with desolate eyes.                Prasenjit Paul,

	I am totally against shopping malls coming up in residential areas. A single mall will destroy the business of the local bazaar. People are earning more and are willing to spend but they want value for their money. The rich will opt for the glitzy malls where there is more variety than the local bazaar. But the environment will go for a toss, as more people and more cars would mean more pollution.                Saurabh Dhanuka, 
  Salt Lake								       
	There is no harm if shopping malls are built in residential areas. In fact, it would be very convenient for the people to shop near their houses. Why would a person go to Forum if he stays near City Centre?                 Vinay Kumar Dokania,
  VIP Road								       
	I don't think malls should come in residential areas since they will be a cause of disturbance to people in nearby areas. Moreover, security will become a challenge as there will be more people entering.

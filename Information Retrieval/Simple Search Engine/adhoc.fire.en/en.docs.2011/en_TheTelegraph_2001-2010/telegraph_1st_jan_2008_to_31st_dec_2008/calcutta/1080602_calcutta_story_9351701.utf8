The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cloud build-up,   rain missing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cloud build-up,   rain missing
  - Monumental display of endurance           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Two tourists soak in the sun, seemingly immune to the 35.7 degrees Celsius heat and the peak discomfort index of 66. Picture by Pabitra Das                                              
	Heat and humidity continued to stifle the city on Sunday and news from the Met office did nothing to ease the discomfort.        
	Clouds are building up because of the incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal, but there is no possibility of rain in the city in the next 24 hours. There is a possibility of showers in the north Bengal districts, though, G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Alipore Regional Meteorological Centre, said.        
	Calcutta has experienced oppressive heat with humidity to match over the past few days.        
	The discomfort index on Friday and Saturday ranged between 64 and 66 degrees Celsius, which the Met office said was nearly 10 degrees above normal.        
	A Met official said the monsoon, which usually hits the city around June 8, could reach north Bengal on June 5 or 6.         
	The monsoon reached Kerala on Saturday and has already covered most parts of coastal and south interior Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. If a low pressure system develops over the Bay of Bengal, it can help drag the monsoon faster into Bengal.         
	The maximum temperature on Sunday was 35.7 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal.         
	Although the maximum temperature was not very high, the heat was suffocating because of the cloud cover over the city, which is preventing the surface warmth from escaping, the official said.

                      Liberation through art                    It is a universally accepted fact that art therapy has a tremendous impact on the psychological well-being of the artist. But, when the artist happens to be someone ordained to life behind bars, the exercise assumes a deeper significance. Painting in Prison, the ongoing group show of paintings and sculptures, offers a remarkable case in point. Featuring works by 30 inmates of correctional homes of the state, it demonstrates the power of art to reform and redeem those who are commonly treated as social outcasts. Confined to prison and shunned by society for having erred due to various circumstances, they have been given an opportunity to express their feelings and emotions through participation in an art workshop organised by the department of correctional services, Government of West Bengal. The results of the endeavour have been, to say the least, extremely praiseworthy. Besides revealing the hidden talents of the participants, it has given them a sense of happiness, fulfilment and, above all, a will to live and return to societys mainstream. A brainchild of B.D. Sharma, IG of Correctional Services, West Bengal. Hosted by The West Bengal Correctional Services, Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture and Flight to Harmony Foundation.

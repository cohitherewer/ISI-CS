                                                                                                               Former Besu head to probe flare-up 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The state government on Friday set up a one-man committee to probe the students unrest at Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), where academic activities have been put on hold following campus clashes on March 19 and 20.        
	Former Besu vice-chancellor Sparshamani Chatterjee will conduct the probe and submit a report to the government at the earliest, higher education secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said. Chatterjee will look into the events that led to the flare-up on March 19 and 20.        
	Chatterjee, who was at the helm of Besu from 1995 to 2001, is in Lucknow and is yet to hear from the government directly.        
	Officials said higher education minister Sudarshan Raychaudhuri had discussed the matter with the chief minister before signing the probe order on Thursday afternoon.        
	Back at Besu, the guardians of the students are planning to meet outside the campus on Sunday. They may submit a memorandum to vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea on Monday, said a student.        
	The Besu Teachers Association has written to Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, inviting him to inspect the campus situation. The governor is learnt to have written to the vice-chancellor.        
	A team of the CPM-backed All Bengal University Teachers Association toured Besu on Friday and demanded restoration of normalcy, while Mamata Banerjee threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike if attacks on students were not stopped immediately.

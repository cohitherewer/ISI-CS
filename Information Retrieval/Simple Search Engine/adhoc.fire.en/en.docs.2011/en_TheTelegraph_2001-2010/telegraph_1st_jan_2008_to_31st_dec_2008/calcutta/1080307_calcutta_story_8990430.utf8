                      Haunted by nature                    One of the most well-known watercolour artists in the country today, Shyamal Sen excels in the art of adorning nature with an aura of mystery and magic. Nature and human beings are the subjects of the vast body of his works in transparent watercolours. The 20 paintings on show at the ongoing exhibition present outstanding examples of his ability to unfold the mystery inherent in life and nature. Evoking emotions that bring on feelings of fantasy, trance and enchantment through the sheer dynamism and lyricism of his brushstrokes, his art appears to be a conversation between the creator and his creation.                    Event: An exhibition of paintings by Shyamal Sen When: Till March 7; 4 pm - 8 pm Where: Gallery 79, 79 Raja Basanta Roy Road, 1st floor

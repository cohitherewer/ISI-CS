The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | No to Sourav plot return
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       No to Sourav plot return
          STAFF REPORTER                               
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has refused to take back the land it had gifted to Sourav Ganguly in 2003.         
	According to mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, the former Team India captain wanted to return the 10-cottah plot near his residence in Behala, following controversy over the use of the land.         
	Why should we take back the land? The plot of land had been gifted to Sourav and there is no reason why it should be taken back. The land was gifted to him by the Trinamul-BJP board in the corporation, said Bhattacharyya.         
	Some people are just trying to create an unnecessary controversy, added the mayor.         
	Sourav was not available for comment.        
	Trinamul Congress legislators are up in arms against the civic body alleging that instead of building a state-of-the-art gymnasium and a sports complex, Sourav is developing the plot, on Raja Ram Mohan Roy Road, for commercial use.         
	How can the mayor gift a plot of land to an individual? According to the CMC Act this is illegal, said Javed Ahmed Khan, leader of the opposition in civic body.         
	On Wednesday, during the monthly meeting of the CMC, Trinamul councillor Atin Ghosh alleged that 90 per cent of the proposed building on the land would be used for commercial purposes.         
	The mayor said that a gymnasium was being built on the plot and for meeting its recurring expenses, only the first floor was being rented out to a bank.

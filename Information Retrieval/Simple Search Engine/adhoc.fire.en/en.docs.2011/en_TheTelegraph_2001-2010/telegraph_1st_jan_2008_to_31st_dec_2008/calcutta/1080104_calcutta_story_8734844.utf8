 - College heads to draw up code to regain Part I success rate
     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                  
	Colleges affiliated to Calcutta University (CU) are working on plans to avoid a repeat of last years poor results in the undergraduate exams.
    
	The colleges and CU were shocked after the results of the BA and B.Sc Part I exams (under the 1+1+1 pattern) were declared in November.
    
	The pass percentage in the BA and B.Sc Part I (honours) dropped from to 75.69 and 69.5, respectively, from 90 and 92 in 2006.
    
	The college heads will meet on January 6 to discuss ways to minimise failure in undergraduate exams, said Gyanankur Goswami, the principal of Shyamaprasad College and president of the West Bengal Principals Association.
    
	Students have been asked to attend as many classes as possible, said D. Kundu, the bursar of Scottish Church College. That apart, the teachers should ensure that the first-year students learn the honours papers thoroughly.
    
	The university last month had started an exercise to identify the causes for the poor results. It had asked the colleges to send data on the performance of the students, which would be used while preparing a guideline aimed at improving the success rate.
    
	But the universitys delay in coming up with a guideline has prompted the colleges to chalk out a result-revamp route on their own.
    
	After a preliminary analysis of the results, the CU authorities had attributed the decline in the success rate to the change in the examination system introduced in 2006.
    
	Till 2006, students under the 1+1+1 scheme had to study only four elective papers in Part I. But last year, Part I comprised two honours and two elective papers.
    
	Most students concentrated on the honours papers, neglecting the elective ones. This showed in the results, said the principal of a south Calcutta college.
    
	Many students are finding it difficult to cover the two honours and two elective papers in a year, said a teacher of another college.
    
	We are still collecting performance data from the colleges. The examination department has been asked to compile the data and suggest measures to boost the success rate in the Part I exam. We hope the process will be over by January, said Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of Calcutta University.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Day of the bravehearts
  - The Telegraph School Awards set to raise the bar one more time          A STAFF REPORTER                          Don Bosco Liluah lifts The Telegraph School of The Year Award 2007                                        
	Seven scholarships, 24 awards and over 100 schools. The 12th edition of The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence, at the Science City auditorium on Saturday morning, will be about all that and much more.        
	Its not just about the schools and the students. Its about raising the bar. Its about setting a standard for excellence by honouring individuals who beat all kinds of odds to achieve something great, says Barry OBrien, convener of The Telegraph Education Foundation.        
	From the Surrendra Paul Memorial Award for Courage to the Abhirup Bhadra Memorial Thank You Baba-Ma Award, the Shining Star Employee award to the Dr Mrs NB OBrien Memorial Lifetime Achievement Award, it salutes and celebrates almost every aspect of education.        
	It is not about winning or losing. It is about honouring people across the state whose work in the field of education usually goes unnoticed, says Biswanath Dasgupta, a founder member of the Foundation who has been involved with the awards since inception.        
	The process of selection continues throughout the year, under two broad categories. The first is where a schools or a students academic or extra-curricular performance is evaluated by the assessment panel chaired by Sukanta Chaudhuri, who is also the chairman of the Foundation.        
	The second category focuses on those whove battled the odds, from physical to financial, for the cause of education.                    
	Their achievement need not always be about marks scored. It is enough that they take up the challenge life has offered them, feels Barry.        
	For the first category the schools apply for a specific award and are judged by the assessment panel comprising achievers from various field.        
	The talent-scout happens all year round, whether powered by applications, newspaper reports or information from friends of the Foundation referred to as angels.         
	We travel to the remotest of places to follow up on leads we are given and depend on our angels to provide us information about brave and talented students, explains Barry.         
	Another aspect that the Foundation must keep an eye on is picking a deserving candidate who can give away the courage award. The bravehearts who have given away the awards over the years include Temba Tsheri Sherpa, who scaled the Everest despite losing five fingers to frostbite, and Dhiren Pithia, a 32-year-old advocate from Junagarh, Gujarat, with a rare blood group (AB negative) who travelled 50km to give blood to a 16-year-old Muslim girl and saved her life.        
	The special guests who have over the years stood and applauded the little soldiers of courage on the Science City stage include Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Kapil Dev, N.R. Narayanamurthy, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Gopalkrishna Gandhi.        
	But at the end of the day, it is not about people  either famous or anonymous. It is above all about the never-say-die human spirit that inspires one and all.        
	This is our joy and our reward. This is our challenge and this is our pilgrimage, says Barry, on behalf of Heritage, which acts as the link between the Foundation and the students.

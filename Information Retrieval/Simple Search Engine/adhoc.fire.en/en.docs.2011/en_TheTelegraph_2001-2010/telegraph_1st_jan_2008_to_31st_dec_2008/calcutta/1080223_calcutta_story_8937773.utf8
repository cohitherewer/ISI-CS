                                                                                                               The City Diary
                A 15-year-old boy was seriously injured on Friday afternoon when a private bus on route 204/1 knocked him down on Darga Road, in Park Circus. The boy was crossing the road around 12.50pm when the bus, headed north, hit him from behind. He was rushed to National Medical College and Hospital. The driver fled, leaving the bus behind.    Palash Manna, Raju Das and Harkesh Patel were chased and caught by police while fleeing with a snatched cellphone near Salt Lakes Indira Bhavan on Friday. The phone belonged to Anadi Nath Basu, 71, of GC Block. Basu was talking on his phone when it was snatched by one of the trio. They then hopped into an auto. The police grew suspicious on seeing the auto speeding away. The chase ended at Duttabad, where the trio live.    Calcutta High Court on Friday declined to accept the public interest litigation challenging the legality of the state governments decision to hold Book Fair on the Salt Lake stadium grounds. The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghose observed that the petitioner had no locus standi to file the case.    Ruksa Khatoon, 16, committed suicide by setting herself ablaze on Thursday afternoon in the bathroom of her Ahiripukur Second Lane home, in the Karaya police station area. A preliminary investigation revealed she was suffering from depression. She lived with her father and stepmother.    The disfigured body found in Howrahs Kailash Banerjee Lane on Wednesday has been identified as that of Rintu Das, a resident of Shibpur. He had a criminal record. Das was possibly a victim of inter-gang rivalry, said police.    Two additional second-class chair cars have been attached to the 3317 Up and 3318 Down Howrah-Dhanbad Black Diamond Express for the convenience of passengers, an Eastern Railway spokesperson said on Friday.

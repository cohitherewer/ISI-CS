          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shortage of coal continued to affect power supply in Calcutta and its adjoining areas on Tuesday.        
	Widespread power cuts started around 9.30am and continued till late into the day. The deficit, around 100 MW at noon, rose to 116 MW in the evening.        
	CESC officials said the power cuts lasted from 60 to 90 minutes, but there were reports of longer bouts of darkness from many parts of the city.        
	There was no power in Maniktala and Kankurgachhi from 11am to 2.30pm following a snag in a transformer.        
	The situation is unlikely to improve on Wednesday as the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited will shut down a 210MW unit at its Bakreswar power plant.        
	We have virtually no coal stock at Bakreswar. We have decided to shut down one of the units because we need to build up some ground stock there before Diwali, said S. Mahapatra, the managing director of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited.        
	He added that the 250MW unit at the Santaldih plant that was shut down for repairs would be back in action on Wednesday to make up for the Bakreswar unit.        
	A 210MW unit of the Kolaghat plant has also been shut down after a snag and a 300MW unit at Sagardighi is down for maintenance.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                                 The mishap spot on Rajarhat Expressway. (Tamaghna Banerjee)      An elderly motorcyclist died on the Rajarhat Expressway on Sunday morning when his two-wheeler skidded on a damaged stretch and was hit by a speeding sedan coming from the opposite side.        
	Businessman Jyotibhusan Adhikari, 65, was crossing the Jatragachhi connector on his way to Salt Lake along with his employee, 75-year-old Singheshwar Singh, when the Yamaha bike skidded on stone chips and crashed into the Honda City.        
	Adhikari was flung off the two-wheeler and landed on the sedans windshield before tumbling over and falling on the road. He died instantly.         
	Singh fell on the other side of the road and was critically injured.        
	The Honda City driver braked but the car was moving at such speed that he could not avoid hitting the motorcycle, said Jahangir Hussain, who owns a small garage adjacent to the accident site.        
	Adhikari owned Apex Dry Cleaners, a Salt Lake shop with two branches. He had come to the Salt Lake shop around 10.30am and took Singhji with him to visit someone in Rajarhat. I cannot believe he is no more, said Arpan Saha, an employee.        
	A close friend of Joykrishna Ghosh, the confidential assistant of former chief minister Jyoti Basu, Adhikari had visited his Salt Lake residence an hour before the accident. We were friends for the last 40 years. He had visited my house around 11am and left in a hurry for some work along with his employee, Ghosh said.        
	Bystanders took the two men to Bidhannagar Sub-divisional Hospital, where doctors declared Adhikari dead. Singh was shifted to NRS Medical College and Hospital later. He has head, shoulder and leg injuries.        
	Adhikaris wife Nitu said she had asked her husband to give up riding a motorcycle because of his age but he wouldnt listen.        
	The driver of the Honda City was arrested and taken to New Town police station. We have filed a case of rash driving and causing death by negligence, an officer said.

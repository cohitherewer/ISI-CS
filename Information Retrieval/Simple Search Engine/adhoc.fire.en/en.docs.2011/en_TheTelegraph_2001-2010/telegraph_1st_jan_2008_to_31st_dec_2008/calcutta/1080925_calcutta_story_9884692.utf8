The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puff ban in slo-mo
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Puff ban in slo-mo
          RITH BASU                                                  
	Come October 2, smoking will be banned in all public places, but it will take the health department almost till the year-end to notify all state organisations about the blanket ban.        
	Passed on May 30, the Prohibition of Smoking in Public Places Rules, 2008, states that those caught smoking in public places can be slapped with a fine of Rs 200.        
	Even four months after the rules were notified, the health department is yet to intimate other state departments of the particulars of the ban.         
	To make the ban effective from Gandhi Jayanti, each state department was supposed to put up notices in public places that come under its purview and print challans, without which the fines cannot be charged.        
	Satyoban Ghosh, the nodal officer (tobacco) in the state health department, admitted that the process should have been started earlier. There were a few ambiguities in the new law and we held regular meetings with Delhi to clarify them. The meetings stretched till this month, as a result of which we could neither print challans nor inform other departments about the ban.        
	The challans will be available with tax inspectors, station masters, gazetted officers, medical institution heads, postmasters, public and private office heads, heads of educational institutes, librarians and airport officers, all of whom can slap the fine.         
	The law requires all public places to put up 60cm x 30cm notice boards with the words No smoking area. Smoking here is an offence.         
	The sheer logistics of the task, considering the number of eateries, bus stops and offices around town, suggests that this exercise alone will take months to complete.        
	But health experts are hopeful that the ban will go a long way in reducing the number of smokers and tobacco-related diseases.

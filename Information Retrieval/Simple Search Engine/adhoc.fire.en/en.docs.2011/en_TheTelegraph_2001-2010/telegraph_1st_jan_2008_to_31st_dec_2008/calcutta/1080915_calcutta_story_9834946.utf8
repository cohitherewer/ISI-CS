                A 45-year-old woman, who was found lying injured near the railway tracks in Liluah on Sunday morning, died unattended at Howrah station hours later. The woman probably fell off an express train, said an official. The woman, bleeding from the nose and mouth, was spotted by some passengers of a Howrah-bound Bandel local around 11am. They brought her to Howrah and left her unattended on platform 1. The railway medical officer examined the woman around noon and found her dead.    Nusrat Parveen and Ruksa, both in their teens, were feared drowned in the Hooghly in Agarpara, on the northern city fringes, on Sunday afternoon. Police said the duo were swept away during high tide and could not be traced till Sunday night.    Power supply may be affected in some areas on the northern city fringes from 9am to 4pm on Monday because of repairs by CESC. The MB Road, Majerhati, Birati station, MM Feeder Road, Durganagar, Udayachal Matkal, Jatindas Nagar and Shibachal are some of the areas where the supply may be disrupted.    An unattended bag in the arrival lounge of the domestic terminal triggered a bomb scare at the airport on Sunday morning. The bag was spotted by CISF personnel at 11.30am. A team from the bomb detection squad opened the bag and found clothes and some other items inside. The authorities handed over the bag to its owner, a passenger from the Northeast, and asked him to submit a written apology.    Rehmat Hossain, an alleged criminal wanted in a dozen cases, was arrested in Topsia late on Saturday.

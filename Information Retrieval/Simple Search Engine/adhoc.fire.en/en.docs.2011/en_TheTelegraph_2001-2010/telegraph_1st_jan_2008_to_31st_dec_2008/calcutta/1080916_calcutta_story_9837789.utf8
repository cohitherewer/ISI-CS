The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cop, wife crushed by trucks 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cop, wife crushed by trucks 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	An off-duty traffic constable and his wife were crushed between two speeding trucks early on Monday, when the streets were empty, the signals on automatic mode and policing almost absent.        
	Shyamal Kumar Ray, 42, and wife Anjali, 35, were on a motorcycle when the mishap occurred at the Raja Dinendra Street-Aurobindo Sarani crossing. Bimalesh Kumar, the helper of one of the trucks, was killed, too.        
	The couple had left home on their motorcycle at 4.40am and were headed to the morning haat near the Khanna cinema crossing on APC Road.         
	Around 5am, when they were about 50 metres from the market, the motorcycle was caught between the two speeding trucks, one going towards Ultadanga along Aurobindo Sarani and the other turning towards Ultadanga from Raja Dinendra Street.        
	The couple and the cleaner died instantly.         
	The bodies were crushed and there was blood everywhere. Glass shards were strewn all over, said S. Mishra, the security guard of an ATM at the crossing.        
	The noise of the accident woke up many residents and they rushed to the spot. The survivors from both trucks, however, had fled by then.        
	Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said: It appears that the driver of the truck plying along Raja Dinendra Road was at fault. The signals at the crossing were on blinker mode. Since Aurobindo Sarani is an important road, the driver should have slowed down before hitting it.         
	Absence of traffic policing between 11pm and 6am is one of the main reasons for late- night and early-morning accidents, said a senior traffic department officer.        
	Goyal, however, pleaded helplessness. Though we have received proposals for night traffic policing, we do not have sufficient manpower to man the roads round the clock, he said.

                 Bypassing Law: The picture with the caption ldquo;Rules, what rules? rdquo;,   August 1, depicts a shameless violation of rules by government officials and gives out a wrong impression about the work culture of the state administration. Are those riding official vehicles above the law?     Madhabi D. Ghosh, Salt Lake             It is difficult to scan the sea of people at Howrah and Sealdah stations during rush hours. If each passenger is scanned with great care, the delay will trigger public outrage. Installing modern metal detectors in place of the narrow ones being used will prevent congestion at the entry and exit point. Metro has rightly pointed out that the RPF personnel patrolling stations hardly care whether passengers walk through the metal detector frames or not ( ldquo;Security farce at stations rdquo;, July 30).   Staff crunch is a perennial excuse of the authorities to cover up their lapses. As a daily commuter between Burdwan and Howrah, I have seen huge bundles of goods being allowed to lie near the vestibular corridor of express trains without authorisation. RPF men on duty are only interested in bribes. They don rsquo;t even check what the bundles contain. One cannot rule out the possibility of explosives being parcelled in this manner. Security is beefed up only when a mishap takes place. Soon, it rsquo;s back to the old routine of indifference.  Surprise raids should be conducted on trains and stations and those found neglecting their duty should be suspended.

	Chitpur residents have said in their petition to the Pollution Control Board that the nearby rail yard is contributing to pollution by generating dust, smoke, noise and filth (Pollution rap on Chitpur rail yard, July 30). We need to ask the residents one simple question: what came first, the rail yard or the human settlement around it?             
	The people who settled around the yard, mostly immigrants from erstwhile East Bengal, knew well about the existence of the yard and its activities. Those days, the pollution was greater because of steam locomotives. They had not complained at that time as they had nowhere to go. They got land at throwaway prices and now want the Railways and PCB to change the activities of the yard to suit their convenience.           
	Tapan Pal,
  Batanagar             
	The report Rare bail for tortured mother accused of killing girls, July 30, goes to prove that justice is neither blind nor insensitive. The judges gave due weightage to the 25-year-old womans extreme mental trauma while granting her bail. One hopes such consideration would also be shown once the trial begins.             
	A.S. Mehta,
  New Alipore           
	The report highlights the tremendous torture a woman had to suffer in the hands of her in-laws for giving birth to girls. It is shameful for a nation that thousands of women are subjected to abuse physically and mentally by their husbands and in-laws for bearing girls. Why dont these people realise that their daughters might one day become the next Sania Mirza or Pratibha Patil? Gender discrimination and female foeticide are rampant in our society even now. The government should amend the laws and stringent punishment should be meted out to the guilty to prevent such heinous crimes.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder, 
  Behala           
	Whatever happened with Sima Sain is a common incident. It is evident that circumstances forced her to kill her own daughters. The hapless and helpless Sima was tortured mentally and physically by her husband and in-laws. Sima has definitely committed a crime and must be punished, but similarly, her husband and in-laws must also be punished for compelling her to take such an extreme step.           
	Atif Ayaz, 
  Serampore                   
	In the report Traffic plan for Bypass hub, August 21, the Emaar MGF and Apeejay groups were misspelt. The errors are regretted.             
	In Englishmen and Zamindars, August 31, I.P. Singh Roy has been referred to as the honorary president of the British India Association. He is actually the honorary secretary of the association. The error is regretted.     Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

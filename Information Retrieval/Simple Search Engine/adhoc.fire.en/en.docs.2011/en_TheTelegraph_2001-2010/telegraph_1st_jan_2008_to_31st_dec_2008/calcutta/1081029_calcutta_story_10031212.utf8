The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Its four to the fore
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its four to the fore
  - BOLLY BANKS ON DIWALI BAIL-OUT          PRATIM D. GUPTA                              BULL-RUN BELIEF: Priyanka Chopras Fashion and Roadside Romeo				                                       
	Priyanka Chopras research says that every time the sensex has dipped in the history of the Indian stock market, it is Bollywoods song-and-dance which has lifted the sagging spirit. No wonder, not just the Fashion leading lady but the entire movie industry, from the producers to the exhibitors, is hoping that the Diwali releases will do the trick and bail out a year which has been largely dry at the box office.         
	And this time there are effectively four Diwali releases  two which released last Friday and two which release today. In fact, according to sources, the two October 24 releases  Roadside Romeo and Heroes  insisted that their show count do not take a beating when Fashion and Golmaal Returns arrive on October 29. As a result almost all other films  from Karzzzz to Body of Lies  had to bid adieu to the city plexes.        
	No film would like to run for a truncated week and naturally, both Heroes and Roadside Romeo wanted their full seven days regardless of their performance in the opening weekend, says the INOX (Forum) general manager, Vikas Syal. So despite newbies Fashion and Golmaal Returns, they still have five to seven daily shows at every plex property.        
	Yes, its effectively four films this Diwali and all of them are so different from each other, says Fashion director Madhur Bhandarkar. From an animation flick and a patriotic multi-starrer to a comedy sequel and a film on fashion, its indeed a mixed spread.        
	And despite the economic gloom all around, none of the plexes has slashed ticket prices except INOX (Swabhumi), which underwent a re-branding recently. The word from the Fame chain of plexes is that since the remaining few Fridays of the year have some of 2008s biggest releases, it can turn out to be a case of jumping the gun.        
	Quantum of Solace on November 7, Dostana on November 14, Yuvvraaj on November 21, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi on December 12, Ghajini on December 25... the best sure is saved for last this year.        
	But as the disastrous box office performance of Karzzzz  the number of shows came down from 17 in Week One to two in Week Two at Fame (South City)  showed, Bollywoods bear run can be equally nasty.

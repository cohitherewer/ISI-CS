The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 100 not out: salute to a life less ordinary
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       100 not out: salute to a life less ordinary
  - Jaichandlal Kothari can still read a newspaper without glasses amp; remember names          RITH BASU                          Jaichandlal Kothari celebrates his 100th birthday with his great grandchildren. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	Andrew Strauss, Paul Collingwood and Jaichandlal Kothari  an Indian did score a century on Sunday after all, but on a different pitch.         
	Cheered by 1,000-odd family members, relatives, friends and well-wishers, Kothari, whose 50 years in Calcutta can be divided into two innings, lit a lamp at a Ballygunge Place party address in the evening to commemorate 100 years of a life lived well.        
	He then whispered to Metro a secret of longevity that could well have been Strauss and Collingwoods mantra at Chepauk. Mental peace, discipline and self-control have taken me this far, Kothari said, surrounded by his indulgent great grandchildren.         
	Dressed in white dhoti-kurta and a brown coat, which he teamed with a shawl and a yellow Rajasthani turban, Kothari appeared younger than his 100 years. Great granddaughter Kriti Singhee thought he looked handsome.         
	I told him he didnt look old, certainly not 100, Kriti, a student of Class IX at Modern High School for Girls, said.        
	Other than normal geriatric problems, he does not have any major health complications. Our family doctor comes just to chat with him, said Ranjitmal, Kotharis eldest son.        
	Ranjitmal said his father, whose roots are in Churu district of Rajasthan, was shattered after the death of his mother Guddu Devi four years ago but bounced back.         
	He has always been disciplined. He goes to sleep early and wakes up at 4.30am to sing bhajans. Until 10 years ago, he used to clean our house in Churu and milk the cows. He would wash his own clothes till four years ago. He still reads newspapers without glasses.         
	Kotharis eyes light up when he talks about his Calcutta connection. He first came to the city as a 20-year-old in 1928 to join the father Chiranjilals jute business. He left for Churu again after retiring at 60. He handed the reins of the business to his sons and decided to spend the rest of his life in Churu, recalled family friend L.P. Patel.                          
	Little did Kothari know that he would have to renew his link with Calcutta 30 years later. Temperatures in Churu touch 50 degrees Celsius in summer and 2 in winter. So his doctor advised him to shift to Calcutta, which he did at 90, Patel said.         
	Of the 1,000-odd guests at the party on Sunday, Kothari remembered most. His grandson Vinod led a young man he hadnt met in years and asked him who he was. You may not remember his name but I do, the centurion said.         
	Like most Calcuttans, Kothari is passionate about football. I support Brazil. I watched their matches in the Germany World Cup (2006), he said.

                      Interplay of styles                    Contemporary visual culture has matured a lot and the difference between high and low art is utterly insignificant now. The on-going exhibition of sculptures and paintings, titled The Wandering Alchemist, by Alexis Kersey (a painting by him appears here), George K. and Manish Nai Lambhachiya, is unconventional, kitschy and entertaining. Kersey is of British-Australian origin and his artistic language is designed such that it addresses issues of globalisation and rapid urban development in contemporary India from a critical subjective viewpoint. He has painted a series in the style of hoardings, studio portraits and a Duerer Adam wearing a Nehru cap. George K paints familiar faces in a bazaar in a photo-realist style. He paints a Kathakali dancer, before and after make-up, all in the same frame. He uses his canvases to communicate directly with his viewers. Manish Nais works are neither restricted by material, nor by any formal conventions as he creates his aesthetically refined works from a variety of materials and mediums, including paper, watercolour and jute fibre. This show is a jointly hosted by Gallery Sanskriti and Apparao Galleries.

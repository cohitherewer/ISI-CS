          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A section of Tollywood artistes called a ceasework on Thursday over non-payment of dues.         
	Shooting for three mega serials  Kokhono Megh Kokhono Brishti, Krishnakali Ami Tarei Boli and Sonar Harin  was cancelled when the actors refused to work unless their dues were cleared. The technicians of the three serials, too, have pending dues but they didnt join the actors in the strike.        
	Later in the evening, the artistes and technicians jointly decided to continue with the ceasework till their dues were met. We will not work till the producers make the payments, said Partha Kar, the joint convener of Artistes Forum and Cine Technicians Federation.         
	Snehasish Chakraborty, the producer of Kokhono Megh... and Krishnakali..., has turned the tables on the artistes. We had promised to pay them within a few days but the actors didnt listen. We suffered a loss of Rs 1 lakh today and have decided not to work on Friday because our losses will mount if the actors dont work, he said.        
	But Ashim Bose, one of the producers of Sonar Harin, has called a truce. We have informed the actors that their payment is ready. We will work on Friday. According to an Artistes Forum rule, actors have to be paid by the 11th day of every month.

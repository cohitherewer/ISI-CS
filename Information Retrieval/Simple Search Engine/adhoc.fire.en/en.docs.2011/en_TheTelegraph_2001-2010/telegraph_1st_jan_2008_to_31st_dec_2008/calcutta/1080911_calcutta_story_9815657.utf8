The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Higher bench for B.Ed case
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Higher bench for B.Ed case
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Puzzled by contrary judgments of Calcutta High Court on whether a B.Ed degree is mandatory for someone to teach in a secondary school, Justice Tapen Sen on Wednesday passed the case he had been assigned to a higher bench.        
	A higher bench should decide whether B.Ed qualification should be considered as essential and compulsory while appointing teachers in secondary schools, Justice Sen said in his recommendation to Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar.         
	Justice Sen decided to refer the case to the Chief Justice after being shown two contradictory judgments passed by high court judges in three legal disputes on the same topic.         
	One high court judge had ruled that a B.Ed degree should be considered an essential qualification while considering candidates for posts of teachers in secondary schools. But another judge who adjudicated on two similar petitions ruled that a B.Ed degree should not be considered mandatory for a schoolteacher.        
	These judgments were shown to Justice Sen while he was hearing a petition filed by Sovan Mondal, who holds MA and B.Ed degrees.        
	Mondal accused the School Service Commission (SSC) of violating the National Council for Teachers Education Act while recruiting teachers for government-run secondary schools.        
	A resident of Shyampur, in Howrah, Mondal said: According to the NCTE Act, a PTTI (Primary Teachers Training Institute) certificate and B.Ed qualification are essential for candidates to be appointed in primary and secondary schools. The Primary Teachers Council has made the PTTI certificate essential for appointing teachers in primary schools. But the commission is not following these norms.         
	Justice Sen said the onus was on the chief justice to forward the case he was hearing to an appropriate bench.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Artists impression of the conjunction                                  
	Calcutta and most of eastern India will be witness to the spectacle of Mars and Saturn nudging each other, with a crescent moon watching over them, this weekend.        
	This rare conjunction after sunset on July 6 will be topped by Regulus (Megha), the brightest star in the Leo constellation, making an appearance in the same patch of the western sky.        
	After dusk on July 10, Mars and Saturn will be just 0.38 degrees apart, which is the closest theyll get until 2022.        
	According to astronomers, the two planets were last seen near each other  but not so close  in 2006.        
	They will not come as close again in another 14 years, confirmed Debiprosad Duari, the director of research and academics at MP Birla Planetarium.        
	Those eager to observe the conjunction of planets, accompanied by the moon, should look west 25 degrees above the horizon around 7pm to enjoy the best view, Duari said.        
	Mars, Saturn and the moon will be visible together till about 8.45pm that night. The moon will make an exit at 9.08pm and Mars and Saturn at 9.28pm.        
	The moon will exit first, but that must not stop one from continuing to watch the phenomenon, Duari said.        
	Anyone using a small telescope should be able to see Saturn, Mars and the moon very well, provided the sky is clear.         
	You can even see Saturns rings, the little red disc of Mars and a grand sweep of lunar mountains and craters, Duari said.

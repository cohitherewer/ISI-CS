                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Red tape keeps body in morgue 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The family of a housewife who died of burns at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Saturday has been unable to take the body home because of a rule that requires a magistrate to be present when she is identified.        
	Relatives of Minakshi Biswas, 21, protested in front of the medical superintendents office on Monday for the delay in completing the magisterial inquest. The hospital authorities said they could not even do a post-mortem without a magistrates consent.         
	This rule is applicable to a woman who dies an unnatural death within seven years of her marriage. Minakshi, a resident of Bamungachi in Barasat, married Tapas Biswas in 2004. According to her family, she suffered fatal burns during an accident in the kitchen on July 1 and was admitted to RG Kar hospital the same day.        
	Her body has been lying in the morgue since July 5. When we spoke to the hospital authorities, they told us straightaway that it was a police case and they could not do anything about it. We want a magistrate to visit the hospital at the earliest and an explanation for the delay, said Minakshis elder brother, Susanta Das.        
	Tapas said he spoke to officers of Tallah police station, but they passed the buck. A senior official of RG Kar hospital said the onus was on the police to complete the formalities. We understand the intense grief of the family, but we cannot do anything about this.        
	An officer at Tallah police station admitted there had been a delay.

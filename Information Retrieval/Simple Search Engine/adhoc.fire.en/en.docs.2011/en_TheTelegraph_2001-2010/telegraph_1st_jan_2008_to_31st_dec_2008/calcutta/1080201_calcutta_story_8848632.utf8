     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	First, he ran over a four-year-old girl and her father while allegedly drunk. Then, the man bought peace with the cops and bystanders, who caught him on VIP Road on Tuesday night, by promising to pay for the medical expenses of Turisha Sarkar and her father Prabir. Finally, Sougata Das managed to dodge the cops and the local people and fled after admitting the duo, residents of Baguiati, to a nursing home. 
    
	He paid Rs 28,000 in cash to put them into the nursing home. As the hospital authorities demanded more, he left the spot, promising to return with the remaining amount. But he did not return, said Arun Ghosh, a resident of Baguiati, who rushed the father and daughter to the nursing home. 
    
	While Turisha is battling for life in the intensive care unit of the nursing home on the EM Bypass, police are yet to arrest Das, a Dankuni-based trader.
    
	She has suffered multiple injuries and had to be operated on as the area below her abdomen was smashed in the accident. She is still in a critical condition, said a nursing home spokesperson.
    
	Nursing home sources said her father Prabir, admitted with a spine injury, might be released in a day or two. But we do not know how we will pay the bills, which has already run into lakhs, said Barun Das, a family member.
    
	According to him, Prabir  an employee of a private firm  will not be able to raise the resources.
    
	We did not lodge any complaint against the drunk driver, as Sougata Das promised to take care of their treatment. But now he is missing and the police are doing nothing about it, added Das.
    
	We have lodged a case under Section 308, which means culpable homicide not amounting to murder, against the driver and are conducting raids to net him, said Supratim Sarkar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

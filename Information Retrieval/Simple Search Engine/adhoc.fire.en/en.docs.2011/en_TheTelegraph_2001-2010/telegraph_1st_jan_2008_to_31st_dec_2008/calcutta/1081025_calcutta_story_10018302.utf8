                Air India will reintroduce its direct flight between Calcutta and Hyderabad on October 26. Airline officials said the flight would take off from Calcutta at 9am and reach Hyderabad at 11am. The flight will operate on Sundays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.     Civic revenue officers realised Rs 18 lakh of the outstanding property tax of Rs 44 lakh of the building housing City Mart (former Light House cinema) on Friday by setting up a blockade in front of the shopping centre. Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the owner gave an undertaking that the balance would be cleared by March 2009.     Chiranjit Barua, 35, was arrested late on Thursday for withdrawing money using the credit card of a trader in Howrah. Police said Barua, posing as a bank agent, convinced Abhishek Gupta to hand over documents relating to his credit card by promising him an upgraded card. Later, Gupta got a text message from his bank that Rs 17,000 has been withdrawn from his account. He then lodged a police complaint.    Jayasree Sen sent the following note to Metro on Friday:  This is regarding your news item Mystery of missing Buddha at artists final farewell on my late husband, Paritosh Sen, who passed away on October 22. I am shocked with dismay to see how his last journey on October 23 has been politicised in your paper.  Paritosh Sen was not associated with any political party directly. His mortal remains were brought with my consent to Lalit Kala Kendra, an institution with which he was associated from its inception, for the artist community, friends and well-wishers to pay their last respects.  I wish that my husband be remembered for his creativity and his humanistic values.

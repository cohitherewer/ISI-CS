                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       University slams exam door on 500
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University has barred nearly 500 students from the BA, BSc and BCom Part-I examinations because they missed the deadline for submission of application forms.        
	We have noticed that a section of students has developed the tendency to submit examination forms after the prescribed date. We had previously allowed many of these candidates to write the examinations after charging a fine. But we need to stop this practice because it delays the entire examination process, an official of the universitys examination department said.        
	This is the second time in a month that the university has cracked the whip on students. More than half the second-year MA English class was not allowed to register for their Part II examinations because of inadequate attendance.        
	The official said students were not the only ones to ignore the deadline. Some colleges affiliated to the university are guilty of sending the application forms late.        
	The decision to bar students from sitting for the examinations is meant to discourage a casual attitude towards examinations and ensure timely announcement of results. The last date for submission of forms had been extended by over a week, but many students still did not submit their forms.        
	We had agreed to accept the forms during the extended period with a fine of Rs 50 per day and there were not many takers. We are not going to accept this kind of attitude,  the official said.        
	The university will henceforth not accept forms after the deadline even if a student has a good academic record and adequate attendance.        
	Some of the students at the receiving end of the enforcement of rules this year passed the buck to their colleges. Our college did not inform us about the last date, one of them said.        
	Another threatened to move court. We are taking legal help. The university cannot prevent us from taking the Part-I examinations on this ground, a student of a north Calcutta college said.        
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said the decision to bar nearly 500 students from the examinations was taken after much consideration. It is important for the students and also the colleges to realise that they must submit examination forms within the deadline. Colleges have been asked to ensure that there is no communication gap between them and the students in future.

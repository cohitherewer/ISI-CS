                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Green cue from   power cuts
      Climate   Watch                                Raj Bhavan, which went dark at the Governors instruction to save power. A Telegraph picture           
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis decision early last month to not use power for a couple of hours in Raj Bhavan, apparently to share the suffering of the lakhs of people who are being affected by power cuts in and around the city, has sparked only controversy. But the matter has an environmental angle as well: cutting down on power usage ensures less production of carbon dioxide and hence slows down climate change, however imperceptibly.           
	This leads to the question in what other ways our VIPs can contribute positively to the environment?          
	One obvious way is by reducing the number of cars in their convoy, ensuring less consumption of fossil fuel. Months back, Governor Gandhi had showed the way by bringing down the number of cars in his convoy from seven to three. Politicians can definitely take a leaf out of his book.           
	Most government buildings, including circuit houses and quarters of district magistrates, are enormous. They are ideal for projects like rainwater harvesting, solar lighting and vermiculture (the raising and production of earthworms and their byproducts), says an environmentalist.          
	A few years back, the Madhya Pradesh government decided that every single elected representative of the people in the state  be it an MP, MLA, councillor or panchayat member  has to take responsibility for conserving a water body. It is high time the project is tried out in other parts of the country, especially West Bengal.           
	Many environmentalists feel that VIPs should cut down on consumption of electricity and showcase the gains through a green audit.          
	Switching off the air-conditioner machines in houses, offices and cars when not urgently required may be a good starting point. Ministers and secretaries at Writers Buildings can at least ensure that the air-conditioner machines are switched off when they are not in office, says an environment activist.          
	Anyone listening?

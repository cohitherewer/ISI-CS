                      When ignorance like cancer grows...                    It takes the whole of life to learn how to live, and what will perhaps make you wonder more  it takes the whole of life to learn how to die  Seneca.        We all live and lead perfectly normal lives, maybe a little fast-paced, a bit hectic to move with times. And how fast times are changing, and with times, we too! We have learnt to balance our lives perfectly  at home, in office, while on the move, in the company of friends, colleagues, family and even strangers  and one binding factor everywhere is the small, innocuous, pristine white cigar. It is so easy to depend on this small device to kick-start or prolong a conversation, to concentrate, to release tension and gradually, very slowly embrace illness and death. To mark World Health Day (April 7), the Cancer Foundation of India (CFI) came up with a brilliant idea and organised a photography exhibition on the theme, Lifestyle Factors and Risk of Cancer. The stills on display focus on ways to combat the adverse effect on health due to carcinogen. These shots have been used to depict cancer-causing agents along with some protective measures and they document or supplement a text. The frozen moments stir emotions and spread awareness among the masses. Participating photographers: Raghu Rai, Satyaki Ghosh, Nitin Rai, Fawzan Hussain, Boman Irani, Dilip Banerjee, Arun Ganguly (a photograph by him appears here), Mala Mukerjee, Amit Dhar and Bikas Das.

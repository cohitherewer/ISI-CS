The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Duty-free debut at airport
                                                                                                               Duty-free debut at airport
          SANJAY MANDAL                          One of the duty-free shops that have opened in Calcutta airports international lounges                                  
	Calcutta airport has finally got duty-free shops that it does not need to be ashamed of.        
	The stores in the international arrival and departure lounges became fully operational this week and stock sought-after brands like Calvin Klein and JLo, Glenmorangie and Belvedere.        
	A space crunch, however, has prevented Flemingo International, the Dubai-based company running the stores, from stocking electronic and leather goods, watches and fashion items.        
	Calcutta now has world-class duty-free stores with competitive rates, said V.K. Monga, the director of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	Sales have started picking up and we plan to add more stocks and a jewellery store soon, said P.K. Thimmayya, the vice-president of Flemingo.        
	The company, selected through bidding, will apply for more space once the new terminals become operational. The existing space does not allow us to spread, said a Flemingo official.        
	For long, Calcutta had an apology of a duty-free shop that was closed down in July after the contract with ITDC expired.        
	The store, set up in 1968, often ran out of stocks and the turnover dropped from Rs 40 lakh in 2006-end to Rs 10 lakh at the time of closure, said an airport official.        
	The stores were scheduled to be opened in December. Operational issues and delays in getting statutory clearances deferred the unveiling, said Thimmayya.        
	Passengers, however, feel there is room for improvement. The display should be better and fashion items need to be stocked, said Rajesh Gidwani, a city-based businessman who visited the shops on his way back from Bangkok.

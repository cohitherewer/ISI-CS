                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bigger duty-free basket
          SANJAY MANDAL                           A duty-free shop at Calcutta airport                                  
	Fliers will soon be able to pick up LCD televisions and designer jewellery while stocking up on booze at the duty-free shops in the city airport.        
	The stores in the international arrival and departure lounges of the airport  which re-opened in January  will now display electronic goods and jewellery. A space crunch had prevented Flemingo International, the Dubai-based company running the stores, from stocking these items.        
	Electronic goods, including LCD television sets, will be available. We have also tied up with DDamas for showcasing its line of jewellery, said P.K. Thimmayya, the vice-president of Flemingo.        
	The stores now stock high-end perfumes like Calvin Klein, Christian Dior and Davidoff and whiskies like Balvenie and Glenmorangie and vodka like Belvedere other than the Johnnie Walker range of scotch.        
	The duty-free stores at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at now have 1,300 sq ft shopping space and 300 sq ft for storage. Flemingo is planning to use the storage area for displaying the new items.        
	The company has approached the airport authorities for more space.        
	It is in the interest of passengers that the new duty-free shops should store more items and display those properly. We will recommend their proposal to the headquarters in Delhi, said airport director V.K. Monga.        
	Passengers, too, feel the duty-free shops should display more goods. Compared with other international airports, the prices here are very competitive but the space is too small. There should be jewellery and more perfumes, said Ramnik Sethi, a city-based insurance adviser and a frequent traveller.         
	Airport officials said once the new integrated terminal became operational, a huge space would be allotted for duty-free shops.

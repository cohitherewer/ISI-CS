                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ceasework at court after death 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Hundreds of litigants were inconvenienced at the Barasat court on Wednesday as lawyers and employees observed a ceasework to mourn the death of a clerk of Sealdah court.        
	Nirmalya Munshi, 32, the clerk, was run over by a train near Barasat on Monday. The Sealdah court had observed a ceasework on Tuesday to mourn Munshis death.        
	Around 9.30am on Wednesday, several clerks of the Barasat court, led by Mohan Nandi, requested bar association secretary Sisir Nandi to ask the lawyers to abstain from work. Sisir Nandi then reportedly informed district judge Bandana Roy that the lawyers and employees would observe a ceasework.        
	The court rooms were empty and there were no lawyers around. I heard a couple of cases in the morning and then went to my chamber, Roy told Metro. Other judges, too, heard only a few cases in the morning.        
	Mohan Nandi denied having requested Sisir Nandi to ask his association members to abstain from work. We only requested the lawyers to pay tribute to our departed colleague.        
	The bar association secretary, however, asserted that the clerks had given him a letter requesting the lawyers to suspend work on Wednesday. We observed ceasework following a request from the clerks. They told us they could not suspend work as they were government employees, said Sisir Nandi.        
	Alema Bibi, of Rajarhat, came to the court to file a bail plea for her husband. But there were no lawyers around. My husband has to spend one more day behind bars.        
	The hearing of a case involving Belghoria resident Dipankar Majumder was scheduled for Wednesday. My lawyer did not turn up. I have to come again tomorrow and get a new date.

          A STAFF REPORTER      
	The much-delayed Sector V surveillance project is set to take off before Puja.         
	Six closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) set up near SDF crossing, College More, Techno India campus, Videocon crossing, Rajarhat box bridge and Millennium City will start recording footage this week.        
	Each of the cameras can rotate 360 degrees and store 168 hours of video on a hard disk. Public address systems have been attached to them for making emergency announcements.        
	Reacting to the Bangalore and Ahmedabad blasts, Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA), the administrative body of the tech hub, had announced on July 28 that 10 security cameras would be installed within 10 days.        
	The camera at the SDF crossing is functional. Connectivity will be provided to the other five within this week, said Subhas Bose, the officer on special duty (technical) of the NDITA.        
	To further boost Sector V security, police have organised periodic inspection of cars parked in the area.        
	Since car bombs were used in the past few terror attacks, we will use Under Vehicle Search Mirrors to check cars entering and leaving offices and parking lots, said Sujoy Chanda, the additional superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	In a meeting attended by NDITA officials, police officers and representatives of IT companies on Monday, it was decided that two box bridges, in front of Nicco Park and between AP and BP blocks, would be opened before Puja to handle additional traffic.        
	Both bridges are almost complete and will be inaugurated soon, said S.A. Ahmed, the NDITA chairman.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Environment experts say colours used in the idols damage the river ecosystem. A Telegraph picture                                  
	As the city gears up for the festive season, the high court has fixed responsibility for tackling the pollution caused by the immersion of Durga, Lakshmi and Kali idols in the Hooghly.        
	On Friday, Calcutta High Court directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and Calcutta police to constitute a committee to devise a way to remove garbage from the Hooghly within seven days of the immersion.        
	The court will pass an order after receiving reports from the authorities concerned, a division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Maharaja Sinha said.        
	Last year, another division bench of the court had directed the CMC and the CPT  the custodian of the river  to take effective steps for removing pollutants from the water after immersion. The court had also said the expenses for cleaning the water would have to be borne by the CMC and the CPT.        
	Appearing for the port trust, lawyer Hirak Mitra, however, told the court on Friday that his client did not have funds for the clean-up drive.        
	Petitioner Subhas Dutta told the court that the CMC had no infrastructure for prompt removal of the garbage. The CPT should be asked to provide technical support to the CMC, Dutta said.        
	CMC counsel Aloke Ghosh admitted that his client didnt have the infrastructure for the job.        
	The court, after hearing all the parties, asked the CPT, the CMC and Calcutta police to set up a committee for cleaning the river.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Police fall short in speed test
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Police fall short in speed test
          ZEESHAN JAWED                        The Metro car speeds past a sign stipulating the speed limit on EM Bypass off Goutams coffee shop. (below): The car speedometer reads well over 60 kmph on the Bypass. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha				                                       
	The speed guns of Calcutta police are not firing. Like most other initiatives to rein in speeding vehicles, this one, too, has fallen flat. Earlier this month, the traffic department fixed speed limits for 85 thoroughfares and, armed with six speed guns, set out to tame motorists breaking these barriers.         
	Metro flouted speed limits on four accident-prone stretches  EM Bypass, Park Circus connector, AJC Bose Road flyover and Red Road  on a weekday to test the effectiveness of the polices initiative. Had the police stuck to their task, a speed radar would have recorded our cars pace and clicked its pictures. We would then have been fined Rs 300 for the first violation. But like all other speeding motorists, we got away.                 
	Eastern Metropolitan Bypass        
	Speed limit: 60 kmph        
	Test case: We started from Ultadanga at 60 kmph and accelerated as we hit EM Bypass. We drove past Goutams coffee shop on the Bypass at 70 kmph, ignoring the traffic departments signpost that read 50 kmph. But nobody stopped us. By the time we crossed Hyatt Regency, the speedometer was showing 80-90 kmph. But there was still nobody to pull us up. We drove at this speed for 10 km till Parama island without being stopped once.        
	Surveillance: The Beleghata traffic guard is on this stretch, and at least three patrol vans are supposed to keep an eye on traffic. Connecting Garia in the south with Ultadanga in the north and being the gateway to Sector V and New Town, this road should have had police personnel at all intersections. But we did not spot a single sergeant at any of the crossings.                 
	Park Circus Connector        
	Speed limit: 60 kmph        
	Test case: After speeding down EM Bypass, we hit the Park Circus connector. Our driver continued at 80 kmph  the limit is 60 kmph  by dodging the vehicles and the autorickshaws that were running amok. Our speeding car missed other vehicles by a whisker more than twice near the Topsia crossing. It zipped past a traffic sergeant stationed near the Tiljala Road crossing at almost 80kmph.         
	Surveillance: The sergeant at the Tiljala Road crossing was the only one we saw. How can I assess the speed of a car moving at high speed? If I stop the car, I do not have evidence to book it for speeding. If such a rule has to be implemented, there should be a speed gun at every crossing, he said later.                 
	AJC Bose Road flyover        
	Speed limit: 60 kmph        
	Test case: Our driver treated it like a race track and touched almost 100kmph. There wasnt a single signpost on the 2.2-km flyover to inform motorists about the speed limit. There was no sergeant either.        
	Surveillance: A sergeant stationed near SSKM Hospital repeated what his colleague near Tiljala Road had said. Speed radars can curb racing, but for that you have to have one speed radar at every crossing. Given the ratio between availability of radars and the 84 thoroughfares where there are speed limits, one road can be monitored only once in 12 days.                 
	Red Road        
	Speed limit: 50 kmph        
	Test case: The entire stretch, from RCTC till Raj Bhavan, looks inviting to anyone with the urge to step on the gas. Our car cruised at 80 kmph, which is 30 kmph above the limit for this road. In the absence of a footbridge, pedestrians hopped from one side of the road to the other at the risk of being mowed down. A group of youths who had just finished a game of football were crossing the road when our car whizzed past them.         
	Surveillance: Ministers and babus staying in the southern parts of the city use Red Road, which is why there is a sergeant stationed every few metres. But we saw none of them stopping any vehicle for violating the speed limit. quot;People are going to drive fast here. If the authorities want motorists to follow the stipulated acceleration limit, they should give a speed gun to each sergeant, quot; an officer said.                
	What deputy commissioner (traffic), Manoj Verma, says: We have only six speed radars that are moved from one place to another. So, it is not possible to track every vehicle that is flouting speed norms. But we are trying to upgrade and very soon, we will be able to track most vehicles that cross the speed limits. We need time.

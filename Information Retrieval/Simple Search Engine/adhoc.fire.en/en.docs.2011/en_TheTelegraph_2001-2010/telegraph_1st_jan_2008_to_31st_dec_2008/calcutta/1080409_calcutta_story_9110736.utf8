          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The first-floor balcony of a building at 1 Mir Bahar Ghat Street, in Burrabazar, collapsed on Monday evening, injuring three shop-owners on the ground floor.        
	The tenants of the three-storeyed building, more than 80 years old, alleged that three promoters are constructing an illegal structure at the back of the building and are trying to connect the two.        
	That caused the first-floor balcony of the old building to collapse, said Chandra Bhushan, who runs a watch store on the ground floor. He was among the tenants injured.        
	An official of the local Borough IV confirmed that the building at the rear of 1 Mir Bahar Ghat Street is being raised without the civic bodys consent. A probe will be ordered after other unsafe parts of the building are pulled down, said an official.        
	The residents alleged that the promoters  Gopal Lal, Ghanshyam Lal and Natwar Lal Bhattar  had obtained a permission from the civic body to repair the building. But they started raising three floors at the rear illegally.        
	On Tuesday afternoon, a team from Posta police station had cordoned off the area, fearing further cave-ins. Engineers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporations building department were present on the spot.        
	Metro tried to contact the Bhattars but their cellphones were switched off.

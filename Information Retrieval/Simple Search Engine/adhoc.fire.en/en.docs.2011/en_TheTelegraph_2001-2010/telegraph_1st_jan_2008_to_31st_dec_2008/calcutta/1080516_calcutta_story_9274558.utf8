          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Come June, Calcuttans will get birth and death certificates from their respective borough offices.        
	Now, people from across the city have to trudge to the civic headquarters in central Calcutta for the certificates if the birth or death is not registered with the borough office within a year.        
	The decision to decentralise the system was taken at a meeting between civic health officials and municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	Only 30 per cent of the people collect birth or death certificates from the borough offices. The rest turn up at the civic headquarters, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	The borough offices will start dealing with old cases of birth and death registration from June 2008, said an official. Once the decision comes into effect, the birth and death registration counters at the civic headquarters, which have been running for over 150 years, will be closed down.        
	Civic operations are being decentralised to ensure that the services could be delivered at the citizens doorsteps. Our aim is to empower the ward offices by next year to issue birth and death certificates, said commissioner Bandyopadhyay. The decentralisation is part of the Rs 100-crore e-governance drive undertaken by the CMC.

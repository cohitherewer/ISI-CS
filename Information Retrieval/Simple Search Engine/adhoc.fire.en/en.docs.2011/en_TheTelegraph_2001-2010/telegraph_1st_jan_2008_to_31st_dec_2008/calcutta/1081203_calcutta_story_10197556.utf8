	Six Bangladeshis who swam the Ichhamati river to cross the border and enter India through Hasnabad were arrested at the Armenian Street-Rabindra Sarani crossing on Monday night.         
	They arrived in the city on Monday evening. Some shopkeepers spotted them roaming around and alerted police.        
	 The six were identified as Rasul Karigar, 20, Mahboob Rahman 28, Mohammad Nazrul, 27, Abdul Sabir, 35, Mohammad Abul Wasim, 28, and Mohammad Reyazul, 25, by the police.        
	The travelled by boat and then swam to enter India. We are interrogating them to find out more details, said an investigating officer.        
	All the six are residents of Satkhira district in Bangladesh. They told us that they had come to Calcutta to look for jobs. We have not found any terror link so far, added the officer.

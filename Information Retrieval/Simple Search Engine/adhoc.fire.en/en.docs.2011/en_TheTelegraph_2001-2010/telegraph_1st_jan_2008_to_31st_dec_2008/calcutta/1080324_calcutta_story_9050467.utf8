	Homemaker Sampa Das, 20, whose sari caught fire while cooking in her Tiljala home on Friday, died of burns at Ruby hospital on Saturday night. Husband Tapas is admitted in the hospital with 50 per cent burns.         
	He said he was injured while trying to save his wife. Sampas parents have lodged an FIR alleging that she was tortured for dowry since her marriage a year and a half ago.        
	Held for rape: Mohammad Salaam, 26, was arrested in Garden Reach on Sunday for allegedly raping a minor. He took the 13-year-old girl from the neighbourhood into an abandoned storehouse and raped her, said police.        
	Shop gutted: A footwear showroom was gutted in a blaze in Behala on Sunday afternoon. The shop caught fire around 4.45am, said police. Four tenders put out the blaze around 6pm. The police said a short-circuit had caused the blaze.        
	Bar brawl: Two men were injured in their heads in a brawl in a bar near Fancy Market in Kidderpore on Saturday night. Police are looking for local residents Shahjada and Chotu, both with criminal records.        
	Fare hike: Singapore Airlines has announced a hike in fuel surcharge for tickets issued on or after March 26. An airline official said on Sunday that on the Calcutta-Singapore route, a one-way ticket will cost $5 (around Rs 200) more because of the recent hike in the jet fuel price.        
	Bridge launch: State finance minister Asim Dasgupta on Sunday inaugurated railway overbridges at Barasat and Madhyamgram. The over-bridges were scheduled to be completed two years ago. The minister also laid the foundation stone of a flyover at Nagerbazar.

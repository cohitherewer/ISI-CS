The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Justice comes easy, not refund
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Justice comes easy, not refund
  - Apex consumer forum sits on claims for return of security deposits          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	Justice delivered but refund denied is the story at Bengals apex consumer forum.        
	Ask gynaecologist Tapan Kumar Dey, who won his appeal in a case of medical negligence last September but is still waiting for his refundable security deposit of Rs 25,000.        
	A year has gone by and there is no sign of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission returning my money, he said.        
	Dey  whose appeal against the Uttar Dinajpur District Consumer Forums order that the doctor pay Rs 1 lakh in compensation to a complainant alleging medical negligence was upheld by the consumer forum  is one among several appellants awaiting their deposit dues.        
	Security deposit claims worth Rs 94 lakh are pending with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, reveal sources.        
	One of the conditions for filing an appeal before the commission against an order of a district-level consumer court is a security deposit (see box).        
	B.D. Jana, the registrar of the commission, admitted to refunds being delayed but tried to justify it by citing the lack of a specific refund law under the Consumer Protection Act. The present system is such that appellants must move the appropriate bench for each case separately to get a refund. Based on that courts order, they are to again file claims before the registrar of the state commission.        
	Jana claimed the commission was doing its best to speed up the process.        
	Unlike his state counterpart, the registrar of the national commission, B.V. Sharma, said delaying refunds was a wrong practice.         
	I have spoken to officials of the state commission and asked them to get in touch with the president of the national commission to discuss the problem, he told Metro over phone from Delhi.        
	Sources said several companies and private financial institutions, including Infotech and Axis Bank, had won appeals in the state commission but not received any refund for months.

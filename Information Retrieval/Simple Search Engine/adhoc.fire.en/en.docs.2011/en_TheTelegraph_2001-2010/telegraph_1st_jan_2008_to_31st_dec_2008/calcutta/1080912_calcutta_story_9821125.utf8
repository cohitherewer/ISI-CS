	The trigger for the accident that killed six passengers of a bus bound for Howrah station was a retreaded tyre that should have been discarded long ago, just like the ones many Calcutta buses flaunt.        
	If you look at the tyres and the bodies of the buses plying in Calcutta, they are not much different from the bus (WB-11-8286) that plunged into the canal in Howrah, a police officer said.        
	Of the 20 buses on Route E-43 (Howrah-Dehibhursut), only three are in reasonably good condition. Most of the buses on our route are unfit to ply. We wonder how these buses obtain fitness certificates, said Paresh Bhandari, a resident of Binola village.         
	The worst accident in Calcutta in recent memory also involved a bus that did not have a certificate for roadworthiness. That bus had plunged into the Bagjola canal at Keshtopur on April 4, killing 21 people.        
	An inspection by Metro of the bus that met with an accident in Howrah revealed that it hadnt been serviced in years. The tyres, body and interiors of the bus gave it the look of a condemned vehicle rather than one that was ferrying almost 80 passengers to a destination 65km away from the starting point.        
	The rulebook states that all commercial passenger vehicles should be tested once every year to ensure that the tyres, engine, lights and seating arrangements conform to the standards of roadworthiness. Transport officials admit that most buses on the road are unfit to ply. There is a nexus between the owners of the vehicles and transport officials. Even buses that have not been serviced for years pass the fitness test. These are the buses that spill blood on the roads, said an official of the public vehicles department in Beltola.        
	The stranglehold of trade unions on the administration has ensured the failure of all initiatives to phase out old vehicles. On July 18, the high court upheld an order to phase out commercial vehicles that are 15 years or more by March 31, 2009. Bus owners challenged it within a month.        
	When Metro asked Howrah road transport officer Kalyan Banerjee whether his department had ever checked the roadworthiness of buses in the district, he said: Fitness certificates are given only after thorough checks.

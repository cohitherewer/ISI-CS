The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Big bridal buy-buy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Big bridal buy-buy
  - Three-day marriage mart with all-round appeal          KARO CHRISTINE KUMAR                                                  
	The bride and groom may be growing slimmer and trimmer but the Calcutta bridal bazaar is growing bigger and fatter.        
	There was enough evidence of that at The Telegraph Weddings, a three-day bridal exhibition-cum-sale at The Hyatt Regency, over the weekend.        
	Its larger than life, said Abhishek Raniwala of Jaipur-based Raniwala Jewellers, one of the 60 participants at the annual event. Calcutta has deep pockets and now they are ready to spend. Adding to gaadi, kapda and makaan is a fourth element  shaadi!        
	Bengals bridal craftsmanship and the price point make Calcutta the focal point of trousseau shopping. The quality of work of the kaarigars is very good in Calcutta. Only Uttar Pradesh can provide competition, said designer Agnimitra Paul, busy at her stall.        
	Skilled labour is cheap in this part of the world, lowering overall costs. NRIs from abroad would rather fly down and buy bridal wear here at half the price than paying through their nose in New York or London, argued Agnimitra.        
	The Telegraph Weddings rode a wave of trousseau shopping in town, which peaks between September and December. Raniwala Jewellers felt Calcutta was 30 per cent better in terms of sales over bridal exhibitions in Dubai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi and the US over the past few years.        
	If Agnimitra sold 14 pieces on Day One and Radhika Singhi sold saris and lehngas worth Rs 3 lakh by the second half of Day Two, designer Soumitra Mondal was all smiles after bagging a bulk order for 400 linen saris, priced between Rs 4,000 and Rs 5,000 each. Dev R. Nil sold 60 per cent of stocks on Day One and brought in replenishment  what moves smartest is in the price bracket of Rs 5,000 for a tunic and Rs 20,000 for a sari, said Dev while Arjun Agarwal sold 70 pieces of high-end bridal prt by Day Two.        
	What used to be D-Day is now the wedding week, with many more functions to plan for and many more people to shop for. A wedding now is easily extended to five days, said Vinod Bhandari of Wedding Xtraordinaire, event partner of The Telegraph Weddings.         
	What Delhi was five years ago, Calcutta is now, he added, with demands for destination weddings and exotic honeymoon spots picking up. And that has come as a pleasant surprise to some participants at Weddings. Maximum queries have come in for Bora Bora, although we expected Calcutta to be more interested in honeymoon destinations like Switzerland. We definitely werent geared up for the peoples demands here. And they are fairly ready to commit, marvelled Aparna Basu Mallik, the director of Club 7 Holidays.        
	Offering haldi to honeymoon, variety under one roof was clearly the top draw of this marriage mart.

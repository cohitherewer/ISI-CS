										      Calcuttan of the week                                    
	Name: Samit Roychoudhury (picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha)        
	Age: 38        
	Claim to fame: A graphic designer by profession, Roychoudhury wrote and published the Great Indian Railway Atlas in 2005 that has sold 2,500 copies. The atlas lists 10,000 stations along with station codes and shows lines under construction, under survey, locomotive sheds and tracks that have been discontinued. The atlas also includes maps of narrow-gauge tracks and Metro railway maps of Delhi and Calcutta.        
	At first glance, the atlas with matte blue cover and a picture of Varanasi station on a rainy evening looks nondescript. Roychoudhury, however, says: There are other railway maps, but mine is more detailed and of better quality.         
	Early start: Roychoudhury, a railfan or a member of the mailing list of the Indian Railway Fan Club, remembers being fascinated by trains since he was very young. A neighbour gave me a book on trains when I was four years old. By the time I was seven, I was hooked on heavy vehicles. Trains grew on me more because they are so different, he smiles.        
	The love blossomed during his nine years in Mayo College. There used to be special trains for the school students. We used to complain about how they were always driven by steam engines and not by the hi-fi diesel or electric engines, which seemed far cooler then. Roychoudhurys eyes light up as he talks about the lovely rocking motion of a metre-gauge train.        
	Track trivia: From metre-gauge routes in distant parts of India to classes of locomotives and engine liveries, Roychoudhury is a storehouse of rail trivia. There are places between Mavli and Marwar where the train slows down to 17 km per hour on the track. Its a beautiful journey. He is not completely happy with the changes being made in the railways, such as the introduction of the side middle berth. The British built a beautiful system. A lot of the changes introduced or on the cards dont make sense, he says.         
	Future fan: Does anyone share his passion? My wife is very supportive. I am told my three-year-old nephew is enthusiastic about trains.        
	On a serious note, he adds: I wish the government was more supportive of railfans and allowed us to take photographs.

	The Trinamul Congress will gherao Lalbazar on October 20 to protest the arrest of Swarup Biswas, brother of party MLA Arup Biswas, and others for the violence at Charu Market police station on October 5.        
	Mamata Banerjee, while addressing a rally in south Calcutta on Sunday, said Swarup had been framed because of police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabartis personal grudge against him.        
	On the night of October 5, a group of youths and the police clashed on Deshapran Shashmal Road after a private bus overturned. The cops alleged that the youths were robbing trapped passengers on the pretext of rescuing them.        
	The group then marched to the police station, threw stones at the deputy commissioner (south) and other senior officers before setting four vehicles on fire.        
	Swarup was arrested four days later from Kona Expressway on the charge of masterminding the violence.        
	Documents with SSKM Hospital show Swarup had rushed the injured passengers there. How could he mastermind the attack on the police station? Even the others who were arrested for the violence were innocent, said Mamata. The arrest of Swarup, a social worker, was a fallout of the vindictiveness of the CPM and the police.        
	Mamata described the police chief as a CPM man, saying he was the hero of the incident on July 21, 1993, in which 13 persons were killed in police firing.        
	She said Chakrabarti had dragged her out of Writers Buildings in 1992 while she was demonstrating with a deaf and mute girl. Since then I have never visited Writers. The next time I enter the building, I will teach him a lesson.        
	Amidst Mamatas tirade against the cops, senior officers at Lalbazar claimed the Trinamul had not sought permission for the rally that had blocked the crossing of Deshapran Shashmal Road and Tollygunge Circular Road for two hours.        
	We had to divert traffic because Trinamul supporters blocked both flanks of the two roads, said an officer of the traffic department.

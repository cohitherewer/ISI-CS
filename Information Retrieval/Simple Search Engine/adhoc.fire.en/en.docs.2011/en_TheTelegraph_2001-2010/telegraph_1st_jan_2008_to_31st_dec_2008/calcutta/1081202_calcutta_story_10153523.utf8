The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Boost for ties with China
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Boost for ties with China

	A hectic fortnight in trade and cultural diplomacy between Calcutta and China last month could open a new chapter in bilateral ties, city fathers hope.        
	Three delegations comprising more than 100 members came calling within two weeks, leaving mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya optimistic about a thaw in the relations with China.        
	The delegations were headed by Li Xiansheng, the executive governor of Hubei province; Quin Guangrong, the governor of Yunan province; and Zhang Zulin, the mayor of Kunming. The team members met the mayor and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Zhang signed an MoU that sought to foster ties between Calcutta and Kunming as sister cities. They have great interest to re-establish cultural and commercial ties with Calcutta and sought active help from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). I am optimistic about a thaw in Sino-Indian ties, said Bhattacharyya.        
	Calcutta is closer to Kunming by air than Burdwan is by train. Its just a two-hour flight from Dum Dum. Calcutta-Kunming flights now operate twice a week, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	The CMC told the Chinese delegates that it could help them in two ways. We can preserve and provide a facelift to Chinese temples, old Chinese parishes and Chinatown and help them create infrastructure for tourists from China, Bandyopadhyay added.        
	The commissioner also pointed out that the Calcutta-Rajgir-Nalanda-Bodh Gaya circuit could be developed as a major draw for the tourists.        
	The executive governor of Hubei and the governor of Yunan province had called on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and discussed ways to boost tourism ties between China and eastern India.        
	Eastern India was the cradle of Buddhist philosophy and Chinese are eager to visit sites associated with Buddhism, such as Bodh Gaya and Nalanda, said Yunan governor Quin Guangrong.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A policeman abandoned on the road an ailing, 82-year-old woman who had lost her way in Salt Lake despite being tasked with escorting her home to Chiriamore.        
	Anup Bishoyee, an assistant sub-inspector at Bidhannagar (North) police station who dropped Bhulurani Devi in front of Bidhannagar College, asking her to return home on her own, was suspended on Wednesday for negligence of duty.        
	Bishoyee had acted in an inhuman way, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.         
	Bhulurani, who lives with her three sons and their families in Chiriamore, was found lying unconscious at Karunamoyee on Sunday afternoon. On being informed by residents, a team from the police station admitted her to the sub-divisional hospital. She was in poor health, starving for long hours, said an officer.         
	But Bhulurani sneaked out of the hospital early on Monday. Hours later, she was spotted in front of a house in BD Block. The residents took her to the police station, where she said she lived in Chiriamore but could not give her address.         
	We decided someone should accompany her home. Bishoyee was given the job, said an officer.         
	It was raining when the officer asked me to get off the jeep, recalled the octogenarian. When I told her I could not find my way home, he asked me to board a bus for Dum Dum.        
	The woman was standing helplessly, drenched and shivering, when some residents took her to the police for the third time. Another officer finally accompanied her home.         
	Bhuluranis family has no clue how she reached Karunamoyee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Return of Tuntuni
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Return of Tuntuni

	This winter, a new puppet show for children and those young at heart will come to town. Naak Kata Raja, by Calcutta-based group Dolls Theatre, is based on the popular Upendrakishore Roy Chowdhury tale, Tuntuni O Raja. It is about a tiny but clever bird and a proud and oppressive king.        
	The group is just back from touring Delhi, where the show was staged at eight Durga puja venues, including Saket, Chittaranjan Park, Mahavir Enclave, Greater Kailash, Mayur Vihar and Noida.        
	To make it accessible to a wider audience, who might not understand the language, large doses of humourous action, nine songs and a pleasing end were added, said the director and scriptwriter, Sudip Gupta. In the play, the king loses his nose while trying to catch and punish Tuntuni for making fun of him.         
	But the bird flies away with the bit of nose. In the play, unlike Roys story, the king repents in the end and gets his nose back after he promises to be good. Apart from the seven queens, ministers and guards, two characters from two other stories creep in: napith and the famous know-all cat Majanthali Sarkar.                           The elephant puppet used in Operation Bhomragar was provided by Doll rsquo;s Theatre       
	The production avoids the rectangular frame within which stick puppet shows are typically arranged. The puppet act is also beautifully supplemented with choreographed movements by actors and dancers. The elephant, which the puppet king rides, is really an actor in a jumbos costume.         
	We try to keep our productions as non-verbal as possible so that everyone can enjoy it, explains Gupta. The group of eight puppeteers who make up Dolls Theatre began its journey in 1990, working primarily around environmental issues. Our production Taming of the Wild  which had no text, only music  toured all over the world. Padmagatha, based on the legend of Shakuntala, was also non-verbal. Here, we represented the puppet Shakuntala as Nature, with her costume and complexion resembling a lotus, inside which she had been found. King Dushyanta stood for a man, who in his forgetfulness, was threatening nature, said Gupta.        
	Dolls Theatre has also provided props for various major theatre groups in the city. The huge elephant used in Manoj Mitras Operation Bhomragar was ours. The elephant, called Alhadi in the play, is a central character and has to walk around on stage. It trumpets and swings its trunk in anger and joy. We also supplied a lively dog in the Bivas Chakravarty-directed Petchuri, glove puppets in the Debesh Chattopadhyay-directed Fataru and lion, Ganesh and Durga puppets in Soumitra Basus Murkir Hanri. There were lots of puppets in Bidyut Nags Kankavati, too. We have also provided life-like props for plays directed by Debashis Majumdar and Usha Ganguli, said Gupta.

	Salute to Sachin        
	Budding cricketers in the city cant stop gushing about Sachins record at the Mohali Test. After the Little Master became the highest scorer in Test cricket with 12,027 runs, many young fans have started dreaming big, too. Heres what they have to say:                 
	Debapriya Sur: An all rounder. He represented Under-17 Bengal in 2007        
	School: Calcutta Boys School        
	The moment: I was following the match closely and was ecstatic. I wish I can do a Tendulkar some day.         
	Feeling: It was a proud moment as an Indian broke Brian Laras record. But I would have been happier if Sachin stuck around and scored a century too.         
	Sachin is my hero because: He has been a consistent player throughout his career. With this record, he also proved his critics  who wanted him to quit after his elbow injury  wrong.         
	This record is special because: An Indian achieved it and perhaps nobody else will be able to break it.                           
	Arijit Banerjee: An all-rounder. He played for Under-17 Bengal in 2007        
	School: Calcutta Boys School         
	The moment: I was watching the match in bits, but made it a point to watch the record-breaking moment. I could not have felt more happy.         
	Feeling: Sachin deserved it. It is an inspiration for budding cricketers like us.         
	Sachin is my hero because: We have grown up learning from his style. His commitment to the game is awe-inspiring.         
	This record is special because: This is a big milestone in cricket history. Not just Indians, the whole world is happy for Sachin.

	CHIT CHAT        
	Culture cauldron        
	Apeejay School, Salt Lake, recently played host to the state convention of Spicmacay (Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture amongst Youth) on October 1. After a welcome address by Principal Rita Chatterji, it was time for Kiran Seth, the founder and chairperson of the voluntary students movement that began in 1977, to share his experiences.         
	Kathak exponent Malabika Mitra enthralled the audience with her lecture-demonstration. Displaying the nuances of the Lucknow and Jaipur gharanas, Mitra emphasised how our classical dance and music are a perfect blend of science, mathematics and philosophy. She also explained the importance of riyaz to succeed in life. The demonstration was followed by planning for the Spicmacay annual cultural festival, Virasat, to be organised from November 1 to December 31.         
	Isha Shah,
  Third year, History, Presidency College        Dickens delight   
	Students from classes VI to XI of Birla High School (Girls) staged Charles Dickens The Christmas Carol at the Vidya Mandir auditorium on October 1. It was a delightful musical, packed with lots of songs and dances. The actors were good and the props made the show more colourful. The participants had practised for a month and had even come to school on weekends to make the programme a success. The children did a wonderful job. But it wouldnt have been possible without our teachers, said a parent after the show.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Breathless denied oxygen
                                                                                                               Breathless denied oxygen
  - Hospital neglects 75-year-old in acute respiratory distress          SANJAY MANDAL                                            
	A 75-year-old man suffering from acute respiratory distress was left untreated and without oxygen support for nearly two hours at National Medical College and Hospital on Monday evening. He was shifted to a private hospital on Monday night.        
	Kanak Kumar Auddy, a resident of Linton Street, in Beniapukur (picture by Amit Datta), suffers from cardiac ailment and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which makes breathing difficult. I was struggling to breathe on Monday evening. The inhaler did not help, said the retired employee of a private firm on Tuesday.         
	He was taken to National Medical around 6.30pm. We urged the doctors in the emergency ward to admit him to the ICU but they refused. After an hour, they admitted him but made him lie on the floor, said Chadranath Laha, Auddys relative.        
	The doctors didnt even provide oxygen support to Auddy, who soon lost consciousness. The doctors said the nurses would provide Auddy with oxygen support. The nurses passed the buck to the ward boys, who could not be found. The doctors were repeatedly asked to attend to the patient, but they didnt, added Laha.        
	Auddys relatives got him discharged on a risk bond and rushed him to Mission of Mercy Hospital around 9.30pm. He was admitted to ICCU.        
	We provided oxygen support and medicines. His condition gradually improved, said Partha Bandyopadhyay, a doctor at the private hospital.         
	Auddy was admitted with an oxygen saturation level of 65 per cent in the blood. He was critical. If the oxygen support had been delayed further, he could have suffered heart failure and his brain, too, would have been affected, explained the doctor. Auddys oxygen saturation level improved to 98 per cent on Tuesday.        
	Patients with acute respiratory distress should be admitted to the ICU. I shall find out why Auddy wasnt admitted there, said S. Banerjee, the director of medical education.

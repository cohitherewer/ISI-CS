          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	R. Ramachandran, the director-in-charge of the National Library, said it should not take more than 10 to 15 minutes to buy a book.        
	He said buyers should go to the stores section in the annexe building and ask for the list of books.         
	After selecting the books, they have to pay at the cash counter in the main building. Taking the receipt, they have to return to the superintendent of the stores and collect the books.         
	Its unfortunate that the reader had to face harassment. I have ordered an inquiry, he said.        
	I have got such complaints even in the past. Action will be taken against such employees.         
	Recently, Sudipta Jana had to wait nearly four hours to get a book photocopied.        
	One of the employees told me there was nobody to do the photocopy. I wrote a letter to the director-in-charge and got it done immediately, Jana said.

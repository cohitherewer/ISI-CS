                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sting toll on the rise
  - Mosquito-borne disease kills Tollygunge youth           OUR BUREAU                                    
	The mosquito sting has claimed yet another victim.        
	A 28-year-old Tollygunge resident died of meningoencephalitis  a mosquito-borne disease like malaria, dengue and Japanese encephalitis  at MR Bangur Hospital on Friday.        
	Sailendra Kumar Chowdhury is the ninth victim of a vector-borne disease this season, going by the state health departments records. Or seventh, if the civic bodys figures are to be believed.        
	The student of computer programming had been suffering from high fever for the past four days. He was taken to SSKM Hospital on Thursday night when he complained of severe abdominal pain.        
	The SSKM authorities referred him to MR Bangur Hospital, said Sunil Kumar Shah, a friend of Sailendra. He died around 2.30am at MR Bangur.        
	H.K. Chanda, the superintendent of MR Bangur, said: The patient was diagnosed with meningoencephalitis.        
	The disease causes inflammation of the brain and the membrane covering it. It is caused by several agents, such as tuberculosis bacteria, Japanese B virus, Herpes Simplex virus and parasites, including malaria, naegleria and acanthamoeba, said Amitabha Nandi, the director of the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Parasitology.        
	Residents in ward 81, where Sailendra lived with his father, alleged that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation was doing nothing to destroy larvae though a number of people in the locality were suffering from an unknown fever.        
	Civic officials have not visited the area for the past two months, said Arvind Kumar Sahoo, a resident.        
	Officials alleged that one reason for the uncontrolled spread of vector-borne diseases was complete lack of coordination between the civic and state health departments.         
	That was evident in the mismatch of figures of the number of victims of mosquito-borne diseases, an official pointed out.        
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and chief civic health officer DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay met chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb at Writers Buildings on Friday to discuss measures to tackle dengue and chikungunya across the city. Deb asked the duo to combat the diseases on a war footing.        
	Dengue: Bubai Das Bhowmick, a 28-year-old resident of Rajarhat, was diagnosed with dengue on Friday.         
	He was admitted to a nursing home off VIP Road with fever last Wednesday. Blood tests confirmed dengue.

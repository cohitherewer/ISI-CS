	Four city-based builders were killed when the car they were travelling in collided with a truck near Suri, in Birbhum, on Wednesday afternoon.        
	The men, all residents of Lake Town, were on their way to Tarapith, a temple town in Birbhum, for a holiday.        
	Ravi Pillai, 38, Sujoy Pal, 32, and Rathin Mitra, 38, died before medical help could reach them. Subhashis Roy Chowdhury, 36, succumbed to his injuries at Suri Sadar Hospital.        
	The driver of the truck managed to escape.         
	The accident took place around 2.45pm at the Abdarpur railway crossing on National Highway 60, around 245km from Calcutta. The car was smashed. Residents helped us extricate the four from the mangled mass of metal, said Swapan Banerjee, the inspector-in-charge of Suri police station.        
	We learnt from one of Pillais friends that the group started from Calcutta in the morning and had planned to spend the night at Tarapith, he added.        
	Pillai, who was driving the blue Maruti 800, owned a hotel in Tarapith. On Tuesday night he had planned to drive down to the town with the three to offer puja to goddess Kali, said his friends.        
	I had been trying to contact Ravi since 1.30pm but no one was picking up the phone. Around 3pm, a police officer in Suri received the call and told us about the accident, said Snehasish, the younger brother of Subashis.

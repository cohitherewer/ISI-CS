                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Police brace for protest
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Mamata Banerjee declared on Sunday that the state government would be responsible if anything untoward happened during Mondays proposed peaceful demonstration at the Lalbazar police headquarters by the youth wing of Trinamul Congress.        
	Our youth leaders will peacefully march to Lalbazar to protest against police officers acting as CPM agents to gag the Opposition in the name of establishing the rule of law, Mamata said at her Kalighat residence after returning from New Delhi on Saturday.         
	S.N Sarkar, the special commissioner of police, said a security ring would be thrown around the headquarters on Monday. Over 9,000 policemen will be deployed in central Calcutta, especially on the roads leading to Lalbazar. Nearly 40 police pickets will be posted in Lalbazar to maintain law and order, he told Metro.         
	Additional commissioners, joint commissioners and deputy commissioners will be on the road to monitor the situation. To avoid tension, policemen have been asked not to carry firearms.        
	Trinamul activists will converge on Metro channel before marching to Lalbazar. We will put up barricades in Phears Lane so that the demonstrators cannot move further, added Sarkar.         
	The Trinamul Congress chief said she would not be present at Mondays programme but would make herself available if she was required.        
	She accused state home secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti and city police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti of colluding with the CPM to use brutal force on party activists during Mondays peaceful agitation.        
	We have no plan to gherao Lalbazar on Monday. Ours will be a peaceful protest and our procession will stop wherever police obstruct us, Trinamul youth wing chief Madan Mitra said.        
	Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said stringent action would be taken against those violating the prohibitory order.

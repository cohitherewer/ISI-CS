  - Thai national seeks second clearance for journey home          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A security breach at the Delhi airport was detected at the Calcutta airport on Tuesday.        
	Bua Phetthonge, a 25-year-old Thai national in India on a tourist visa, nearly obtained immigration clearance in both cities for her journey home.        
	Immigration officials at the Calcutta airport detained her when she sought clearance to board a flight to Bangkok.        
	Phetthonge was scheduled to take a Jet Airways flight to Bangkok from Indira Gandhi International Airport at 12.45am on Tuesday. She collected her boarding pass from the check-in counter, cleared immigration and proceeded to the boarding area.         
	The lady did not show up for boarding despite several announcements and the flight had to leave without her, said a Jet official.        
	Phetthonges registered luggage was offloaded. She left the boarding area without being stopped by the airport security personnel.         
	If a passenger misses an international flight or decides not to board it after clearing immigration, the authorities are required to immediately cancel the clearance.        
	The next Jet Airways flight from Delhi to Bangkok was early on Wednesday. Unaware that she had breached norms and also to save time, Phetthonge took an early morning flight to Calcutta, said an immigration official in the city.        
	When she approached the immigration counter at the Calcutta airport around 11am for clearance to board the Jet Airways flight to Bangkok at 11.55am, the mistake at the Delhi airport was detected.         
	Officials asked Phetthonge why she had missed the earlier flight and how she left the Delhi airport without her immigration clearance being cancelled. She claimed that she was offloaded by the airline but could not say why. She may have wandered into a duty-free shop and did not hear the announcements, said an official.         
	We also asked the Delhi immigration officials how a passenger could leave the security area without getting the clearance cancelled but did not receive a satisfactory answer, he added.        
	The Calcutta immigration authorities told Phetthonge that she could not have two immigration clearances for a single journey out of the country. She was sent back to Delhi and is scheduled to take the 12.45am Jet flight to Bangkok on Wednesday.         
	She will be allowed to travel from Delhi with the same ticket she had bought for the Calcutta-Bangkok flight, said an airline official.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The superintendent of Uluberia Sub-divisional Hospital, Bimalbandhu Saha, was caught red-handed by officers of the district enforcement while accepting a bribe from a supplier.        
	Saha, who had allegedly asked for a bribe of Rs 2 lakh, has been arrested under Section 7 of the Anti-corruption Act.        
	Uluberia sub-divisional officer Sanjay Basu said: Several people had brought corruption charges against the superintendent. Now that he has been caught red-handed while accepting bribe, it will be easier for us to prove the corruption charges.        
	Saha fell ill after being arrested. He was admitted to the cardiac care unit of his hospital and later shifted to Howrah District Hospital.        
	Police said the arrest followed a complaint lodged last month by Ashok Das, who supplies food for the patients of the hospital. Das alleged that Basu had sought Rs 2 lakh from him to clear his pending bills. Das has been supplying food to the hospital for the past 15 years.        
	On receiving the complaint, the SDO contacted the district enforcement branch (EB). On Wednesday, an EB team met the SDO and decided to lay a trap for Saha.        
	Accordingly, Das was asked to take Rs 5,000  comprising only Rs 100 notes  to the superintendent. The SDO had signed on the notes.        
	When Das entered Sahas chamber and handed him over the money, the EB men waiting outside arrested the superintendent. Saha will be produced in court after doctors declare him fit.

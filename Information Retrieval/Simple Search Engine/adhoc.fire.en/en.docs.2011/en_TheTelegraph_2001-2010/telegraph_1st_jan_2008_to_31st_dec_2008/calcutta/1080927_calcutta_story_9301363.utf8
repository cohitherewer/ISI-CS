The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Retailers now look beyond
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Retailers now look beyond
  - Citys loss, towns gain          SUBHRO SAHA                          A mall in south Calcutta                                        
	Skyrocketing rentals, mushrooming malls and a sluggish pace of market maturity have combined to force many Calcutta retailers to look outside the city to remain viable.        
	With rentals shooting through the roof  touching almost Rs 300 per sq ft at Forum Courtyard  in city core areas, a clutch of Calcutta retailers have shifted their gaze to tier-2 towns like Durgapur, Siliguri and Asansol and also to neighbouring states.        
	As a thumb rule, in apparel retail, one must earn a minimum of Rs 40-45 per sq ft per day to stay viable, which is not happening at all big-ticket brand stores in Calcutta right now. The exorbitant rentals pinch. Consequently, we have to look elsewhere to stay afloat, says Madhusudan Binani, a franchisee of Benetton, Allen Solly, Adidas and Satya Paul.        
	Binani and his partner Lalit Marda, who have presence in Forum, City Centre and South City, have now gone on to open Reebok, Benetton, Levis and Raymond outlets on the NH31 in Gangtok. The duo has also helped a local partner in Guwahati to launch a 25,000-sq ft mall.        
	Vijay Dugar of CS Trade Link, a franchisee for Reebok and Adidas, has opened outlets recently in some tier-2 towns. The rentals are at least half than that in Calcutta, sometimes even lower than our Calcutta staff salaries, he points out.        
	The market in Calcutta has failed to mature at the pace of Mumbai, Delhi or Bangalore, feels a Reebok official. Besides, rentals have gone berserk here. So we are now aggressively looking at smaller towns elsewhere in Bengal and in Orissa and Jharkhand, he says.        
	The organised retail trade in town, particularly in the garment segment, is also getting congested. Compared with just 200,000 sq ft in Forum just a few years back, the city now has over 16,00,000 sq ft of shop-floor space in formatted malls alone. Most big retailers in Calcutta want to explore other territories to gain first-mover advantage, says Kamal Jain, a city-based franchisee of multinational brands.

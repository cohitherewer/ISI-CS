	The civic scanner is back on a building in the chief ministers neighbourhood that has added floors illegally.
    
	Following a report in Metro on January 19, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has set up a committee to probe how landlord Manik Majumdar could reconstruct two illegal floors at 5F Palm Avenue that the civic body had demolished in April last year.
    
	I have asked the committee to inquire into the matter and submit a report, Bhattacharyya said. After going through the report, I will order the demolition of the two illegal floors. Its strange that the police had no knowledge of the illegal construction.
    
	Officers from Karaya police station visited the building, originally two-storeyed, on Saturday and stopped drainage work.
    
	A local resident alleged that Majumdar had also illegally joined the top two floors with an adjoining building.
    
	A probe is on to ascertain whether civic officials and the police were involved in the matter. How could the landlord construct the two floors without the knowledge of the local police station? wondered mayoral council member (building) Deepankar Dey.
    
	But what about the other illegal buildings in the city? Going by the Calcutta Municipal Corporations estimates, almost half of the 600,000-odd buildings in Calcutta are illegal.
    
	The mayor has said that a team would be formed to crack down on the unauthorised structures, in association with the police. Illegal buildings will keep mushrooming unless we launch joint operations with the police and step up surveillance, he said.

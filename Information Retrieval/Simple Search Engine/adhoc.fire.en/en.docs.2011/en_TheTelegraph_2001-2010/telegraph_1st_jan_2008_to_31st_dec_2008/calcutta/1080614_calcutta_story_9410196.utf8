                      Reviving a melodious heritage                    The development and growth of theatre and cinema in Bengal are inextricably linked with their music, particularly songs. Projecting the music ventures in Bengali theatre since the late 18th century as well as of Bengali cinema since the beginning of the 20th century, Theatre O Cinemar Gaan: Ekal Sekal, attempts to capture snatches of a glorious musical past and discover fundamental links with the tunes of the present. Portraying the parallel trend of the composition of songs of Bengali theatre and cinema during various decades of the 20th century, it will also document the way in which Bengali theatre, with its spectacular scenes, panorama and melodrama, led the way to pioneering work in cinematic practice. From the play Alibaba (1901) by Hiralal Sen to Satyajit Rays film Agantuk (1991), it draws upon research in recordings, notations, prompt books and clippings to offer an exciting and original view of artistic translation between media. Featuring a retrospective of songs of different genres, the programme will trace the parallel evolution of vision and craft in theatre and cinema. Presenting a melodious, spellbinding evocation of the past, it also provides an important historical archive of the songs of a bygone era. Participants: Riddhi Bandyopadhyay and Devajit Bandyopadhyay (in songs) and Soumitra Chattopadhyay (in narration).                    Event: An evening of old Bengali theatre and film songs When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Madhusudan Mancha

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mystery of missing Buddha in artists final farewell
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Partha Chatterjee and Shuvaprasanna offer floral tribute to Paritosh Sen at Lalit Kala. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did not pay his last respects to Paritosh Sen on Thursday.        
	The official reason? The chief minister was busy in a Cabinet meeting.        
	The real reason? The artists last journey was a bit of a Trinamul show.        
	The body of Paritosh Sen, who died on Wednesday, was kept in Lalit Kala Akademi from 11am to 1pm for people to pay their last respects.        
	The master of ceremonies was Sens friend and fellow-artist Shuvaprasanna. By Shuvaprasannas side was his new-found ally and art lover, Partha Chatterjee.        
	If the chief minister was conspicuous by his absence, the Trinamul Congress leader was conspicuous by his presence.        
	We had never seen Partha Chatterjee by Paritosh Sens side before, but on Thursday he seemed to be calling the shots along with Shuvaprasanna, said a veteran artist.        
	As the Trinamul leader with a French beard and the Trinamul sympathiser with a flowing beard shared the spotlight, the chief minister chose to send a representative with a wreath and a condolence message.        
	He is stuck in a Cabinet meeting, said the representative at Lalit Kala.        
	But at Writers Buildings, the cabinet meeting lasted no more than 12 minutes from 11am. We didnt even have a cup of tea, complained PWD minister Kshiti Goswami.        
	An official said Bhattacharjee  who had cut Sens 88th birthday cake last year and hailed him as the nations pride  would surely have gone to mourn the veteran artist had the venue been Nandan or the Calcutta Information Centre.        
	We had got a call from a government official around 11pm on Wednesday requesting us to shift the venue to the Nandan complex but it was too late to comply, said artist Samir Aich. It is unfortunate that the chief minister could not make it, he added.        
	Lalit Kala was apparently chosen because of Sens association with the Keyatala centre. Subrata Kumar Halder, one of his first recruits for the Akademi in 1983, was among the many Sen loyalists surprised by the presence of Chatterjee, who even co-ordinated the proceedings at Keoratala.        
	Chatterjee, fresh from the bruising Nano battle, refused to blink. I knew Paritosh Sen, though I was not very close to him. Since I am a keen lover of art, Mamata Banerjee asked me to co-ordinate the proceedings.... The chief minister sent his wreath, but we dont believe in doing things like that, he told Metro.        
	Bhattacharjee had recently admitted to Sen that his art often went over his head. But Sen, a keen observer of life, would probably have understood the compulsions of politics on the day of his final farewell.

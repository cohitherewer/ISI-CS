	The Supreme Court will hear on Monday the Todis plea against the arrest warrants issued against them and their relative Anil Saraogi in connection with the Rizwanur Rahman case.        
	When the matter came up on Friday, the Todis lawyer, Harish Salve, told the bench that the Todis petition in a Calcutta court seeking revision of the warrants would be heard on Monday.        
	Seeking a stay on the trios arrest, Salve said the warrants violated the intent of an apex court ruling on October 13 that had stayed trial in the Rizwanur case.        
	Following Salves submission, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said the Supreme Court had only stayed the commencement of the trial and that the order did not restrain the trial court from issuing summons to or arrest warrants against the accused. Salve then sought time to establish his case. The bench scheduled the next hearing for Monday.         
	Kalyan Banerjee, the lawyer for Rizwanurs family, said the Todis were filing cases in various courts to delay the trial.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Anger management enters classrooms
                                                                                                            Anger management enters classrooms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	City schools, alarmed at the Gurgaon school shooting that left a 14-year-old dead, are working on ways to preempt student violence on their premises.        
	While some schools are educating the children on the virtues of curbing anger, others are trying to identify the causes of aggression among students by organising interactive sessions with parents and teachers, in the presence of counsellors and child psychologists.        
	All the institutions have one aim  to prevent a Gurgaon-like tragedy. Two 14-year-olds had shot dead one of their classmates in a Gurgaon school, who they accused of bullying them.        
	St James School held a workshop for all its 70 teachers on the day the school re-opened after winter vacation to discuss behavioural issues related to children.        
	The teachers were asked to recall the memories of their childhood and speak about the attributes of their tutors they considered their role models.        
	Teachers have an important role to play in building up a culture of confidence and trust in schools. To ensure this, they need to act as role models for the students. The workshop was aimed at making the teachers aware of their responsibilities, said Terence Ireland, the principal of St James School.        
	The participants also dwelt on the mental health problems faced by children.        
	The schools are unanimous that peer pressure and inadequate parental guidance are responsible to a great extent for violent behaviour by students.        
	There has been no violent incident in our institution so far. But one cannot deny that youngsters are now exposed to tremendous peer pressure that leads to a number of mental health problems, said Mukta Nain, the principal of Birla High School. We are ready to reach out to a student if he shows any abnormal behaviour.        
	Several schools are also beefing up security on their campuses.        
	Along with our regular counselling sessions, we are also checking the bags of the students to ensure they do enter classes with any weapon, said H.P. Das, the principal of St Stephen School.

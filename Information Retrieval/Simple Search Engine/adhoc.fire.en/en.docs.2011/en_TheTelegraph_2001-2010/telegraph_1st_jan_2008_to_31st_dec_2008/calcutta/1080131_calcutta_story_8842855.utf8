	The Shakespeare Sarani explosion on January 16 was not an accident. The blast at the base of a radhachura tree that injured four pedestrians was carried out by a local criminal group, police said.
    
	Officers investigating the case have ruled out the hand of extremists funded by foreign agencies like the ISI. Maoists, however, could be to blame, said an investigator.
    
	We did not find any container in which the explosive could have been kept. It was probably buried in a hole in the tree trunk, said the officer.
    
	The police have come to the conclusion by the process of elimination. Short circuit of underground power cables, leak in the pipeline of a gas company and methane gas accumulation in the sewage network have been ruled out by experts. They suspect that a synthetic explosive caused the blast, added the officer.
    
	Since synthetic explosives could not have formed naturally, there must be human hands behind the blast, the investigator said.
    
	Officials of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, who collected samples from the spot, are yet to identify the synthetic explosive.
    
	Panchanan Pramanik, a chemistry professor at IIT Kharagpur whose help was sought by the police, said: I was asked to find out whether gas leak had led to the blast. Had that been the case, gas-leak pockets would have formed on the sandy soil. Moreover, methane could not have caused the blast as there was no source of the gas close to the spot.
                
	If gas trapped in the sewage system was capable of causing the blast, such incidents would have been common all over the world, added Pramanik. 
    
	According to the police, terrorist outfits funded abroad could not have been involved in the blast because claiming lives is their first priority. Whoever carried out the blast did not have any intention of killing people.
    
	Those behind the blast either wanted to threaten the law-enforcement agencies or wanted to find out if the explosion was intense enough to claim lives if shrapnel was used. We are investigating whether Maoists were involved, said a Special Branch officer.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Pabitra Ghosh		    
	A 36-year-old medicine distributor, Pabitra Ghosh, has been missing from his Behala home since Friday evening. On Sunday, his family lodged a missing diary with Behala police station.         
	Till late on Monday, the family members had not received any phone call nor were they able to contact his cellphone. One person has been detained in this connection.         
	The superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, Ajey Ranade, said Pancha Das has been detained for interrogation as Pabitra was last seen with him.         
	Pabitras wife Soma said he had taken a loan that he was re-paying in instalments. If that is the reason behind his disappearance, I am ready to pay the rest of the amount. But I request whoever is responsible to allow my husband to come home, she said.        
	Jaya, Pabitras mother, said that on Friday he came home at 4pm. He left in the evening after having tea. We thought he had gone to a local shop for his usual adda session. But when he did not return till late in the night, we started looking for him. We waited till Sunday evening and then went to the police, she said.        
	Pabitra lives in a rented house with his mother, wife, eight-year-old son and four-year- old daughter.

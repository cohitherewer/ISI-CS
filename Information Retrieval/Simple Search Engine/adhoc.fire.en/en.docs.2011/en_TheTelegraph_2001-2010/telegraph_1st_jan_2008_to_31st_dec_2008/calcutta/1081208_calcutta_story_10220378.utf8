          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Class XII student from Park Circus purchased 10 of the SIM cards that Calcutta polices big catch, Mukhtar Ahmed, allegedly supplied to the terrorists behind the Mumbai attacks.         
	Police say the unnamed teenager, who comes from a lower middle class family, did it for money.         
	He earned Rs 100 for procuring the cards without any documents and handing them over to Mukhtar, a member of the investigation team said on Sunday.        
	The special additional commissioner of the Special Task Force, Rajeev Kumar, said the boy would be interrogated further to confirm whether he knew who the SIM cards were meant for.        
	The teenagers name cropped up when Mukhtar, arrested from a hotel in Delhi on Friday, was interrogated after being brought to Calcutta. Tausif Rehman, the Beniapukur youth arrested from Howrah, mentioned him, too.        
	The boy was summoned to Lalbazar on Saturday morning and taken to the interrogation room of the STF, where he promptly identified Mukhtar. Both Tausif and Mukhtar were in the room. The teenager pointed at Mukhtar and said he had handed over the SIM cards to him, an investigator said.         
	He procured all 10 SIM cards from outlets in Park Circus without submitting either proof of identity or residence.        
	We have the names of the retailers who sold the pre-activated SIM cards without asking for any document, an STF officer said.        
	The SIM cards that the teenager procured for Mukhtar cost Rs 25 each.        
	If it is confirmed that he didnt know about any terror plan, the police will name him only as a witness in the chargesheets against Mukhtar and Tausif.         
	The STF arrested Mukhtar on the basis of information provided by Tausif. Two officers of the crime branch of Mumbai police interrogated the duo throughout Sunday.        
	We have been told that Mumbai police do not intend to ask for transit remand immediately. The duo will be in our custody till December 19. But if the visiting team later decides to ask for transit remand, we wont object to it, Kumar said.        
	According to STF officials, Mukhtar came to the city in October to collect the SIM cards that Tausif and the Park Circus teenager had procured. One of the 12 SIMs that Tausif purchased by showing the voters identity card of his late uncle, Ashraf Numan, was found on a slain terrorist.         
	When STF sleuths came to know that Numan was dead, they began monitoring call details of Tausif and his younger brother, a kitchen worker in a five-star hotel. Tausifs sibling turned out to be clean.

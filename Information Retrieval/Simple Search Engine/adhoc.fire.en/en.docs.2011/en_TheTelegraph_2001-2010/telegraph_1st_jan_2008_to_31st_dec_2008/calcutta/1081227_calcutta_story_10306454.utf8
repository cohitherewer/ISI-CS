          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Five men were arrested for allegedly being part of a racket that forged voters identity cards and other documents at a computer centre in Champadali, Barasat, on Friday.         
	The men were later produced in court. One of them was remanded in police custody while the others were sent to judicial custody. Nearly 100 forged documents, including voters identity cards, PAN cards and driving licences, were seized from the centre, said J. Biswas, the Barasat sub-divisional police officer.        
	A man who had been approached by a member of the racket at the motor vehicles department office in Barasat tipped off the cops.

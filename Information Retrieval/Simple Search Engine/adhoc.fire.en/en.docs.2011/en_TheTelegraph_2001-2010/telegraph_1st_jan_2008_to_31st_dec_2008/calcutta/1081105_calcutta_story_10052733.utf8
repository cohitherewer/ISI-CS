The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Paper woes for pilgrims
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Paper woes for pilgrims
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Around 100 Haj pilgrims have not been able to board their flights to Saudi Arabia as the travel documents are yet to reach them.        
	The Central Haj Committee has failed to send the passports and visas to the state Haj committee on time, resulting in about 30 pilgrims missing their flights daily. Thirty-seven flights from October 30 to December 2 are supposed to carry around 8,000 pilgrims from the city to Medina.        
	The Saudi embassy is closed on Thursdays and Fridays. Hence the delay in readying the travel documents, said Afroze Begum of the Central Haj Committee.        
	The explanation, however, failed to assuage Kazi Mujibur Rahman, who was supposed to fly to Medina with his septuagenarian parents on November 1.        
	The central and state Haj panels have failed in their task. The process started six months back and the entire money was paid in advance. Then why this delay? asked the 46-year-old trader from Canning, now waiting in Haj House on Dilkusha Street for news about his travel papers.        
	The pilgrims also complained against volunteers deployed at the airport by the state Haj committee. The volunteers are using the rest rooms and availing themselves of the refreshments meant for the pilgrims, said the relative of a pilgrim who left on Saturday evening.        
	The state Haj committee denied the allegations. The volunteers have been appointed to help elderly pilgrims. They are doing their work well, said Tanvir Afzal, an officer on special duty, Haj Operations 2008.        
	Three years ago, the state Haj committee had stopped sending welfare officers with the pilgrims. The officers maintained liaison between the pilgrims and the local authorities in Saudi Arabia.        
	Most pilgrims are from the districts and they speak only Bengali. If they face any problem during the pilgrimage, they cant inform the local authorities without help from the welfare officers, said an official of the state Haj committee. Afzal said he was not aware of welfare officers.

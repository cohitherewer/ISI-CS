	Students from 24 city schools put their creative side forward in the Seventh Frank Anthony Memorial Story Telling Contest, organised by The All India Anglo-Indian Association, along with The Telegraph In Schools (TTIS), on November 22. To mark the birth centenary of Frank Anthony  a lawyer, parliamentarian and an educationist  the contest was held at the auditorium of Frank Anthony Public School.         
	The contest ran for close to two hours. Most of the stories were written by the students themselves. They did not just narrate them in a flat voice. For a better impact, they modulated voices and made various facial expressions. And the judges were impressed.         
	The kids displayed a lot of maturity as they narrated a story. There was a boy who talked about the plight of people in Nandigram. The emotion in his voice was touching. All the stories had a moral, said Gitanjali Alagh Jolly, one of the judges.         
	For Shromona Jana, the winner of the contest, it was a memorable experience.         
	I told a funny tale. It was about two persons travelling on a train, one a magician and the other a fraud. The story ends with the latter proving to be a better trickster as he dupes the magician and steals all his possessions, said the Class IV student of Apeejay School, Park Street.         
	This story teaches us not to fool others, as we may be fooled in return too, she added.         
	Other judges included Father Molly, the inspector of Diocesan schools.         
	Jana got a 75 out of 90. Sparsh Agarwal of Don Bosco, Park Circus, followed with a 73, while Sutirtha Banerjee of National Gems and Dipanjali Mitra of Modern High School for Girls came third, with 72. There were four candidates who came fourth with 71. The event was followed by cultural performances by the host school.        
	Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, the chief guest of the event, stressed on the importance of the art of story-telling, that is almost lost now.         
	When we were kids, our grandmothers would tell us stories. Todays children are probably more interested in television and computers. But they should not do away with listening to stories. Its a rich experience, he added.

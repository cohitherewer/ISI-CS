The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Oil pump sale bar order snubbed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oil pump sale bar order snubbed
          JAYANTA BASU                              
	A major oil company has expressed its inability to implement an environment department order not to supply fuel to vehicles that do not possess the pollution-under-control (PUC) certificate.        
	The department, however, has refused to budge and stressed that the order would come into effect from June 5, as earlier announced.        
	While the petrol pumps have been entrusted with the responsibility to check the PUC certificates, the pump attendants are not empowered to check such documents, Indian Oil Corporations executive director Debasish Sen has recently written to environment secretary M.L. Meena.        
	The environment department had in March published a notification asking the oil firms to direct the filling stations under them to check PUC certificates before supplying diesel to vehicles.        
	Sen also pointed out another legal hurdle in the way of the implementation of the order. He said it was beyond the oil firms jurisdiction to refuse fuel to vehicles that do not possess PUCs.        
	The environment department, however, has rubbished the stand. Your plea is not sustainable... and you are requested to abide by the... notification issued by the environment department, chief law officer Biswajit Mukherjee has written back to Sen.        
	Mukherjee also pointed out that the Environment Protection Act, 1986, empowers organisations to take decisions beyond their usual jurisdiction.        
	The power-supplying authorities had raised similar questions when they were asked to snap electrical connections of polluting industrial units. But the high court rejected their plea, said Mukherjee.        
	The representatives of petrol pump owners, too, have opposed the notification. We will face logistic problems to carry out the order, said Tushar Sen, a spokesman for the dealers association.        
	But an environment department official reiterated that violation of the order would attract action under Section 31A of the Air Act and also the Environment Protection Act. The pumps might even be closed down.

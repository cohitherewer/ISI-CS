           A lyrical tribute
          Music is the highest art and, to those who understand, is the highest worship  Swami Vivekananda. The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture hosts a music festival to mark the 145th birth anniversary of sur-yogi Swami Vivekananda. In Sanskrit, sur stands for divinity and musical tone. The sound emanating from the navel, heart and the throat pronounce a-u-m which is the mighty alphabet, the very breath of all divinity. Both Western and Occidental philosophers assert that man is the microcosmic representation of the macrocosmic universe. Swami Vivekananda declared music to be the supreme form of worship since the essence of all music is I am He. A music festival to mark this great saints birth anniversary features performances by Uday Bhawalkar (dhrupad), Shahid Parvez (sitar) and Swapan Chaudhuri (tabla solo) from 9 am onwards, followed by Rajendra Gangani (Kathak dance) and Rashid Khan (vocal) at 2 pm, while in the concluding session (6 pm onwards), Dhruba Ghosh (sarangi) and Hariprasad Chaurasia (flute) will pay their musical tribute.

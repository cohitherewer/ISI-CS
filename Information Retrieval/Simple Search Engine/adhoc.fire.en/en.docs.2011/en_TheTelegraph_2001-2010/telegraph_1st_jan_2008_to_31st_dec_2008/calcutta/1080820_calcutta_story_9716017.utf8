                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SSKM boss abused
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The superintendent of SSKM Hospital lodged a complaint against Trinamul Congress MLA Arup Biswas with Bhowanipore police station on Tuesday for allegedly abusing him over the phone. A general diary has been registered.        
	According to hospital superintendent Ashok Ghosh, Biswas had called him up several times while he was in a meeting.         
	I could not take the call. But when I did, I was stunned. I never thought that an MLA can use such abusive language, he said.        
	Biswas denied abusing Ghosh. I was desperately trying to contact him because the condition of the imam of Tipu Sultan mosque in Tollygunge was serious. He needed immediate admission to the ICCU of the hospital. I called Ghosh six times, but he did not bother to take the calls, said the legislator.        
	Syed Abdul Azmal, the 70-year-old imam, was admitted to a nursing home in Tollygunge a week ago. He is suffering from heart and kidney ailments.        
	The imam was unable to pay the bills of the ICCU in a nursing home. So he sought my help and I contacted Ghosh, said Biswas.        
	Police are investigating the incident.

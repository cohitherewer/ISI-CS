	In an effort to reconcile a warring couple, Justice Asim Banerjee of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday asked them to spend the weekend at Kamarpukur and Jayrambati  the birthplaces of Sri Ramakrishna and his wife Ma Sarada.         
	The judge also contacted Ramakrishna Mission and made arrangements for the couples stay.        
	Go and stay there for two days. I am sure that after returning from the holy places, you will stay together, Justice Banerjee told 32-year-old Sandip Chakraborty and his wife, Mousumi, 25.

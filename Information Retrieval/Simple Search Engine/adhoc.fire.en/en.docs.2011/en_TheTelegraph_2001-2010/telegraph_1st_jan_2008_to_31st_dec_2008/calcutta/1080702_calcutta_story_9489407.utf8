The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Power cut heat sends temperatures soaring
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Power cut heat sends temperatures soaring
  - From Alipore to Sovabazar, families united in frustration over electricity shortage          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          Judges Court Road, in Alipore, lies dark and risky during a power cut. A Telegraph picture                                        
	 Tanisha Mundhra, 9, huffs and puffs up the stairs leading to her eighth-floor apartment with a huge schoolbag on her back every other day. The worst part of it is knowing that she cant cool off under the fan even after reaching home. Her sisters, Vatushi, 12, and Vashita, 16, had unit tests recently but could not prepare well.         
	 Bimla Mundhra, the siblings 61-year-old grandmother, spent two hours on Saturday sitting on the ground-floor stairs of the Moira Street apartment because she couldnt possibly make it to the eighth floor without the lift.        
	The Mundhras are not the only ones sweating and fretting over frequent power cuts. When lights go off and fans, air-conditioners and lifts come to a halt every day, the words that echo through thousands of houses across the city are: Oh no, not again!        
	 The generator in our building is out of order, forcing my kids and mother-in-law to take the stairs to our eighth-floor flat. In the evenings, cooking by candlelight is a huge problem. If the power scenario doesnt improve, we will have to buy an inverter, said Sarita Mundhra.        
	On an average, Moira Street and many other localities in the city have been going without power for at least three hours every day.        
	Dialling the CESC helpline, 1912, doesnt help. We have power cuts almost every evening at 7pm, and the blackout lasts hours. Every time I call 1912, they tell me power will be back in 30 minutes, but that rarely happens, said Dolly Khanna, a resident of New Alipores F Block.         
	The areas that have borne the brunt of the power shortage are Kasba, Loudon Street, Park Street, Bagbazar, Sovabazar, Jadavpur, Behala and Golf Green.        
	Last week, the shortfall in CESC areas was 100-120 MW. We had to resort to power cuts of 60 to 90 minutes duration on a rotational basis across the city, said a senior CESC official.        
	Arup Basak, a resident of Kasba Bosepukur, said the duration of power cuts was seldom below two hours. There are regular power cuts in our area for periods ranging from two to three hours. My two-year-old son has developed rashes all over his hands and neck because he perspires all evening.        
	Potholed, waterlogged roads and stretches that have been dug up for the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project have added to the Calcuttans woes in this summer of discontent. Last Friday, my father fell into a trench during a power cut and injured his spinal cord. In the darkness, he did not see a narrow wooden board laid over the trench and tripped and fell, recalled Himani Bhattacharya, a resident of Rabindranagar, in Behala. Ramendranath Bhattacharya, who had to be admitted to a local nursing home, is still bedridden.        
	For many traders, the power cuts have meant discomfort at home and losses in business. Most of my designs, rate cards and business development plans are stored in my computer. My shop doesnt have power for around two hours in the afternoon, which is peak time, said Sanjay Mundhra, who owns a wedding decoration business in Loudon Street.        
	As citizens suffer, the news from Raj Bhavan is that Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi continues to inflict an hours power cut each in the afternoon and evening on himself to be one with the rest of Calcutta.        
	Kolaghat and Bakreswar, from where the city gets most of its power, have lately been producing less electricity because of a coal shortage triggered by monsoon rain across Gangetic Bengal and Jharkhand. Power generation declined after the coal mines in Ranigunge supplied us with wet coal. We are running out of stock and may have to close down a few units if the situation does not improve, an official of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation said.         
	Officials of CESC are hoping that the Met offices rain forecast comes true and the citys power requirement declines.

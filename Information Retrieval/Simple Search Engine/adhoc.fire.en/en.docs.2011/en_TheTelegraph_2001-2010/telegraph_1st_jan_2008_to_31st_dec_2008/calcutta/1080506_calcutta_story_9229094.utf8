The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | SSKM too hot for team from Delhi 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SSKM too hot for team from Delhi 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          SSKM Hospital		    
	The main operating theatre complex is too warm, the central laboratory does not conduct specialised tests and the students hostel is poorly maintained in Bengals biggest referral hospital.        
	A team from the Medical Council of India (MCI) that visited SSKM Hospital on Monday made these adverse remarks while reviewing the hospitals facilities as part of an exercise leading to permanent sanction for its MBBS course.        
	A doctor at the hospital, present during the teams visit, said: The MCI members said the air-conditioning system at the main OT complex is not up to standard. It is extremely warm inside and uncomfortable for doctors and patients.         
	The air-conditioning system at the OT complex, on the second floor of the hospitals Main Block, has not been working since it was installed six months ago.        
	The complex has 10 surgery tables where general, paediatric, neuro and plastic surgeries are carried out.         
	A hospital official revealed that even before the AC became functional, the copper pipes were stolen. After two months, new copper pipes were installed at a cost of Rs 15 lakh but within days these were stolen too.         
	This time, the public works department has given an estimate of Rs 25 lakh to install the pipes, the official said. The proposal is awaiting clearance from the health department while patients are often asked to go elsewhere for surgery.        
	 A hospital official said the MCI team also raised questions why specialised tests were not being conducted at the central laboratory.        
	Patients allege that they are being asked to get the tests done outside.         
	Sources in the hospital said the team expressed unhappiness at the state of the new hostel building where over 350 doctors live.         
	Water supply is irregular, lifts do not work properly, water seeps in from the roof and at times chunks of plaster fall off... There is hardly any maintenance, said a junior doctor.

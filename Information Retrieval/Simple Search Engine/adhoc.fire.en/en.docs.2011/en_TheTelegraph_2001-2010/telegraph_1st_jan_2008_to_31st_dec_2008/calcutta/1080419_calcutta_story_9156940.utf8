	Multiple and complex blocks in the coronary arteries can now be treated with minimal invasive procedures like angioplasty, instead of the conventional bypass surgeries, said cardiologists in Calcutta on Friday.         
	Improved versions of drug-eluting stents, state-of-the-art wires and balloons are helping patients avoid the trauma of a major surgery.        
	Multiple and complex blocks are usually treated by open heart surgery. But now, they can be taken care of by angioplasty, said Rabin Chakraborty, the interventional cardiologist and convener of the annual conference of National Intervention Council of Cardiological Society of India. Seven minimally invasive procedures were demonstrated at a live workshop at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.        
	Mortality is less and recovery faster with the minimal intervention method. Patients can be discharged on the third day of the operation and they can get to work within a week, Chakraborty said.        
	Angioplasty uses state-of-the-art wires which can now penetrate long-standing arterial blocks whose plaques have become hard, making it possible to implant a stent, the doctor explained. Improved drug-eluting stents are also making angioplasty possible in complex coronary artery blocks. The shapes and sizes of the stents are undergoing changes to ensure implants in these cases too, he added.        
	The improved biocompatible stents have better polymer and, hence, less chances of causing reactions in the body.         
	The number of minimal invasive surgeries has doubled in comparison to open heart surgeries, said Amal Banerjee, the chairperson of the conference.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lensman at work, caught on film
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lensman at work, caught on film
          MOHUA DAS                           Raghu Rai clicks idols and artisans in Kumartuli ahead of Kali puja. Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	The man who has captured the changing face of India over the years is now the subject of a documentary film. Titled Through a Lens Eye Raghu Rais India, the film will showcase the countrys myriad cultures, customs, colours and moods, as seen by the ace photographer.         
	The 25-minute film, which was commissioned by the external affairs ministry, is being directed by author, poet and documentary film-maker Suresh Kohli.        
	The shoot started nearly two months ago in Delhi. Kohli then covered Mumbai and Varanasi before coming to Calcutta last week. Moving away from cliches like Victoria Memorial or the Taj Mahal, the director is focussing on people and places that have captured the 66-year-old Rais attention.         
	Hes a veteran photographer who has travelled and shot extensively across the country. We have selected places close to his heart, says Kohli, whose next stops are Amritsar, Agra and parts of Rajasthan, including Pushkar.         
	Rain played spoilsport during Kohli and his teams stay in the city. It ruined their plans of filming Sealdahs flower market, women wrestlers in north Calcutta, the College Street Coffee House and the riverfront. We want to film at places that are not usually tourist attractions, said Kohli.         
	Rai didnt seem perturbed by the unseasonal showers. Every time I come back to Calcutta, it amuses me with its unique street life and richness of human expressions. Plastic sheets of various colours, hands sticking out of taxis and eyes peeping out of umbrellas  all have their own powers of expression, said the Padma Bhushan recipient.         
	This time my focus in Calcutta is Kali puja, which Ive never experienced before, said Rai, who spent Sunday morning clicking idols and artisans in Kumartuli.         
	Calcutta, like the other cities, will figure only for a minute in the film, which will not have interviews or commentaries but Rais own narrative woven into footage of him at work. It will also show photographs of places he has visited. The film will provide an insight into Raghus methodology, how he frames his pictures and what he chooses to click, said Kohli, who will divide his film into four categories  people, places, situations and celebrations.         
	Celebration will cover the Ganpati festival in Mumbai, Id in Delhis Jama Masjid, Durga puja at the Varanasi ghats and Kali puja in Calcutta.        
	Just a photograph of the Howrah bridge and the river beneath is nothing unless you can capture the rush of energy and the intensity of being there. A sensitive photographer has to go beyond just the physical presence, said Rai.        
	Filming the photographer in action has not been easy. Keeping pace with the sprightly Rai as he rushes towards the riverfront or dives into a crowd can be a tough call for a film unit lugging heavy equipment.         
	Sometimes its distracting since Im not acting for anyone and I move very fast trying to capture rare moments. When the crew comes into my frame, I want to kill them but documentary filmmaking is close to photography, so Ill be looking into their frames too, said Rai.        
	He will launch his second picture book on Calcutta, titled Calcutta Kolkata  It never begins and never ends in December.        
	You can catch a preview of some pictures from that book in the current Aircel display ads, the photographer added.         
	Kohli intends to wind up the shoot by December, after which the documentary will be screened at various cultural centres in India and abroad.

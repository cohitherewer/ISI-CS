          A STAFF REPORTER                                                Puja attraction: The tiger has Amitabh and Shah Rukh as allies		    
	The one thing that can bring the Shahenshah and Baadshah together is the roar of the tiger.         
	This Pujas big-ticket release stars a homegrown hero  the Royal Bengal tiger  with Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan in supporting roles. Plus, its a tax-free entertainer that will be screened not in a multiplex but at a busy street crossing.        
	The 20-minute documentary on the tiger, produced by Sanctuary Asia magazine as part of its Royal Bengal Tiger Bachao campaign, will be screened on all five Puja days at the Hatibagan crossing. People visiting Hatibagan Sarbojonin puja will be able to see it.         
	Apart from Bachchan and Khan, Soumitra Chatterjee, June Maliah and Srikanta Acharya will be seen urging people to do their bit to save the tiger from poachers and protect their habitat.         
	Khan acknowledges the courage of forest guards engaged in conservation with inadequate equipment, calling them the true heroes in the battle against poaching. Bachchan speaks on elephant conservation.        
	According to Tyke Malhotra of Samskara, the NGO that has provided the footage of the two actors, both are passionate about conservation.         
	Joydip Kundu of Sanctuary Asia said: The messages have been kept simple, keeping in mind that people will be out to enjoy Puja.         
	The Hatibagan crossing is a prime spot for commercial advertising. Last year, it was leased out for Rs 65,000. But we wont charge anything for this screening, said Avijit Bose, the treasurer of the puja. The civic body isnt charging any tax either.

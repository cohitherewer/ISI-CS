The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minority panel rap on govt
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Minority panel rap on govt
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The chairman of the National Commission for Minority Education Institutions has criticised the state government for the educational backwardness of Muslims in West Bengal.         
	Justice (retired) M.S.A. Siddique was in Calcutta on Sunday to meet representatives of minority education institutions and listen to problems faced by them.        
	The commissions role is to advise the central and state governments on minority education. It also looks into specific complaints regarding violation of the rights of minorities to establish and run educational institutions.        
	Muslims in West Bengal are lagging far behind their counterparts in other states in terms of education. Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra are churning out doctors, engineers and civil servants. But most Muslim children in Bengal do not even have access to primary education, Justice (retired) Siddique told Metro after the meeting at Muslim Institute on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road.         
	According to him, some of the state government guidelines for minority education institutions violate Article 30 of the Constitution.         
	He cited the example of the rules formulated by the School Education Board of West Bengal that came into effect in 2007. They made it mandatory for a school to be built over an area of 2 acres in urban areas and 3 acres in rural areas. The classrooms should be 400 sq ft or larger. The compound should have a playground.         
	We appeal to the state government to relax the laws because it is difficult for the financially backward Muslims to acquire so much land in a city like Calcutta, said Justice (retired) Siddique.

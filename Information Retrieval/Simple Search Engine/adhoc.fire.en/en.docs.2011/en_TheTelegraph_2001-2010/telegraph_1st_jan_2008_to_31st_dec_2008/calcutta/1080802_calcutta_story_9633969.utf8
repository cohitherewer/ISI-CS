          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Indian carriers are joining hands with tourism boards abroad to gain more fliers.        
	Air India Express (AIE), the low-cost carrier of Air India, on Friday announced a marketing tie-up with Singapore Tourism Board (STB). We hope the tie-up will increase our load factor on the Calcutta-Singapore route from 70 to 90 per cent, said A.K. Tirkey, the manager (eastern India) of the airline.        
	The carrier and the tourism board will launch a three-pronged strategy to boost tourist flow to Singapore.        
	We will take up promotional drives and penetrate into more cities in eastern India, said Kenneth Lim, the area director (northern and eastern India) of the Singapore board.        
	Promotional campaigns will initially be launched in Jamshedpur and Bhubaneswar.        
	The airline announced a special one-way fare of Rs 12,000 (excluding taxes) in the sector for August and September 30. On August 13 and 15, the minimum fare will be Rs 999 (excluding taxes).        
	Air India officials said the partnership would extend beyond marketing. Attractive packages are in the offing, said Tirkey.        
	Jet Airways, another Indian carrier flying to South East Asia, has tied up with the tourism boards in Thailand and Malaysia. These are tactical partnerships for the promotion of the sectors, said a Jet official.        
	The tie-ups will enable tourism boards to give special discounts and airlines to offer reduced fares, said Anil Punjabi of the Travel Agents Federation of India.

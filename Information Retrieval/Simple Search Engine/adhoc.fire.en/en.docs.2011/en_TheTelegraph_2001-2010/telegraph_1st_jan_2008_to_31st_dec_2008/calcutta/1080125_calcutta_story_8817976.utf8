	Oral cancer has emerged as the most prevalent among all head and neck cancer cases in Calcutta.
    
	On an average, 33 of every 100 cancer patients in the city are found to be suffering from oral cancer. And the figure has been rising by 10 per cent a year, said Gautam Mukhopadhyay, a surgical oncologist at AMRI Hospitals.
    
	Tobacco, he pointed out, is the most common cause for oral cancer. More than 91 per cent of head and neck cancer cases are somehow linked to tobacco consumption, either in the form of chewing or smoking, said Mukhopadhyay.
    
	The other causes are poor oral hygiene, irritation from sharp tooth and excessive consumption of spicy junk food.
    
	The good news is that facilities for advanced treatment of oral cancer are now available in the city. Around 80-90 per cent of oral cancer can be cured completely if it is diagnosed and treated early.
    
	For complete cure, the disease has to be diagnosed early. But most patients come to us when the disease is in an advanced stage. Such delays can be fatal, warned Subir Gangopadhyay, a clinical oncologist at NRS Medical College and Hospital.
    
	He said one should consult a doctor immediately if there is an oral cavity or an ulcer in the tongue. Difficulty in swallowing or a constant sensation like a fish bone stuck in the gullet must also be reported without delay. A biopsy can easily diagnose the disease and the doctor can start treatment, said Gangopadhyay.
    
	Several advanced but cost-effective treatment options  like carbon-dioxide laser therapy and photodynamic therapy  are now available in the city, said Mukhopadhyay.
    
	Both the techniques use laser to remove the affected tissues with minimum to zero damage to the surrounding healthy tissues, resulting in quick recovery, he added.
    
	For photodynamic therapy, hospital stay may not be required at all.

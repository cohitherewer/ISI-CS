          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A homemaker tried to commit suicide on Tuesday evening, unable to bear the grief of her five-year-old sons death, allegedly because of medical negligence.        
	Sonali Manna, 31, tried to end her life by taking a large number of sleeping pills in her parents home in Howrah. She was taken to a private hospital in a critical condition on Tuesday night. Till late on Wednesday, she was in the intensive care unit.        
	Husband Samarendra said Sonali had slipped into a severe depression after the death of their elder son Rishav at Beleghata ID Hospital on July 12. She was under the treatment of a psychiatrist.        
	We have started an inquiry. Our preliminary probe suggests that she has been suffering from depression following her sons sudden death, said a police officer.        
	Samarendra, who works with a multinational company, blamed his wifes suicide attempt on the negligence of the doctors who treated their son.        
	Rishav, who was inoculated against diphtheria after birth, complained of a severe stomach ache on June 28. He was also suffering from high fever.        
	The family physician suspected viral fever and treated him. But the boys condition worsened and on July 4, he faced difficulty breathing and swallowing food. Rishav was admitted to the Beleghata hospital on July 12.        
	The hospital treated him for diphtheria on the basis of a clinical investigation, said Samarendra. Though the diptheria test was negative (a copy of the report is with Metro), the hospital mentioned it as the cause of Rishavs death.        
	They did nothing except administering anti-diphtheria serum to him. When we told the doctors that Rishav was inoculated against diphtheria, they asked us not to interfere in their job. But their job ruined our lives, said Samarendra.        
	A probe will be ordered if the family lodge a complaint with us, said Biswanath Bhandari, the medical superintendent of the hospital.

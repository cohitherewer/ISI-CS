          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The main runway of Calcutta airport was closed for nearly two hours on Friday after a portion of the surface peeled off.        
	Airport officials said the surface had started peeling off near the touchdown point a few days ago.        
	The runway was closed around 3.10pm after an inspection. Flights were operated through the secondary runway till 5pm, when the primary runway was opened again.         
	The peel-off was caused by continuous rainfall over the past few days, said an official.        
	Flights were not delayed because of the shut down.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Craters, snarls in traffic trauma
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Craters, snarls in traffic trauma
  - Spot the road          A STAFF REPORTER                          A pothole on Jessore Road. A Telegraph picture                                         
	Every time ambulance driver Sushanta Samadder ferries a critically ill patient to RG Kar Medical College through Jessore Road, he knows his nerves and skills will be tested.        
	Theres a perpetual traffic snarl on the Bangur-Belgachhia stretch and I invariably have to switch to the other lane to avoid being stranded with a patient. I know it inconveniences everyone but do I have a choice? he asks.        
	Commuting through Jessore Road and Dum Dum Road has actually been a nightmare for everyone over the past year, thanks to the state of the roads, encroachment and lack of policing. When ambulance drivers like me take the other lane during an emergency and demand right of way, other vehicles follow suit. That adds to the chaos, says Samadder, who drives an ambulance of the Madhyamgram-based Naba Ankur Club.         
	Office-goers who regularly avail themselves of the Metro Railway service from Dum Dum and Belgachhia stations are affected the most. I now start at least 45 minutes earlier than I used to. I still reach office late at times, says Asim Sen, a resident of Nagerbazar who takes the Metro to Central or Chandni Chowk stations to reach his office in Dalhousie.         
	Officials admit the poor condition of the road is one of the reasons for the snarls. We repaired a portion of the Dum Dum underpass despite that being the responsibility of other agencies. The condition of the Dum Dum underpass and the one in Patipukur is partly responsible for the snarls, says S. Halder, the chief executive officer of South Dum Dum Municipality.         
	Kanu Bose, the secretary of the Citu-managed road safety committee of Nagerbazar, blames encroachment and the absence of traffic police for the chaos. Sen echoes him. I do not remember seeing a sergeant on this stretch. Dum Dum and Patipukur are paying the price for being on the periphery of the areas under the jurisdiction of North 24-Parganas and city police, he says.        
	Arundhuti Mondal, the owner of a grocery shop near the Patipukur bridge, said she had rarely seen traffic moving smoothly in that area. But it used to be smooth when officers of Lake Town police station were posted on the route some months ago.

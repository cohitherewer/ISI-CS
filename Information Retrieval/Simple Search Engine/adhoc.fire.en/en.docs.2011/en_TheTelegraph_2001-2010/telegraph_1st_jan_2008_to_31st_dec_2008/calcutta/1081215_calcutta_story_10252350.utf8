          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five youths, including a murder accused, were arrested on Sunday when they visited a Muchipara house allegedly to extort money from its owner. Two of them were carrying daggers.        
	Bijay Burma had lodged a complaint with Muchipara police station alleging that a group of youths had demanded Rs 5 lakh from him because he was building a house on nearby Dhiren Dhar Sarani.         
	Burma had told them repeatedly that it would not be possible for him to meet their demand. The youths continued to threaten him with dire consequences over the phone if he did not pay up, said an officer.        
	The goons had allegedly asked Burma to keep the money ready on Sunday afternoon. We laid a trap. When the youths turned up in front Burmas house, we surrounded them. They tried to run away but we pinned them down, added the officer.        
	The five were identified as Indrajit Deb, Subhankar Dalui, Madhai Das, Kailash Das and Debasish Chanda. All of them are in their mid-20s and stay in the locality, said the officer.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that Indrajit, the leader of the gang, was wanted for a murder in Bankura. The other four also have criminal records. They were involved in robberies and other crimes in north Calcutta over the past couple of years, said another officer.        
	The city police sent a photograph of Indrajit to their counterparts in Bankura for more information on him.        
	Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department), said the gang started operating in Muchipara after it witnessed a real estate boom.         
	Initially, the youths used to sneak into houses and decamp with valuables. Later, they started robbing pedestrians and house-owners, said an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy squad.

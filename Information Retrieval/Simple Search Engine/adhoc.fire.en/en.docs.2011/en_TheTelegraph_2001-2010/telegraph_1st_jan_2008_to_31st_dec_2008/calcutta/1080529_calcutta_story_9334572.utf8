          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A 150-strong womens brigade, enraged at the partys alleged attempt at grabbing a north Calcutta playground (picture by Amit Datta), assaulted four CPM cadres with slippers on Tuesday morning.        
	Around 20 party workers watched helplessly as their comrades were being thrashed in a CPM office in Muraripukur. Gauging the residents mood, CPM leaders have pledged support to the drive to protect the 10-bigha ground.

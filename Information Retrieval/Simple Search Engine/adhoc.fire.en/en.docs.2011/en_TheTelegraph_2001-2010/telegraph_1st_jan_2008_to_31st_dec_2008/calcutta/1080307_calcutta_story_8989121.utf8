                                                                                                               Phone found with sleaze clips deleted
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The day after the arrest of Samir Barik and Somasree Das, Howrah police recovered the cellphone on which Srabonti Ghosh had allegedly taken intimate photographs of them.        
	Samir (married, with a son) and Somasree (married, with a daughter and now pregnant) had confessed on Wednesday to the murder of Srabonti and her eight-year-old daughter Prapti.        
	Srabonti was allegedly blackmailing Samir and Somasree  who used the Ghosh house in Jagacha as their love nest  with the photographs in her phone.        
	We seized the mobile phone from a person in Duttapukur and matched the IEMI number. Samir had sold the phone after deleting the damning photographs, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of police (Howrah).        
	We are in touch with technical experts to try and retrieve the deleted photos. The phone does contain video clippings of some pornographic movies downloaded from the Internet. We have also seized jewellery worth Rs 50,000 that belonged to Srabonti. Somasree and Samir had stolen it along with the mobile phone, added Singh.        
	Howrah police reconstructed the double murder of February 26 after taking Samir and Somasree to Srabontis house on Thursday afternoon.        
	After plotting to murder Srabonti  who was also allegedly having an extra-marital affair with Samir for the past few weeks  if she refused to part with the mobile phone, Somasree reached the Ghosh house at 2.30pm. Samir arrived moments later.        
	I will not give you the mobile phone, do what you can, said Srabonti, threatening to expose them.        
	I overpowered her from behind and as she fell down, I sat on her chest, wore a pair of surgical gloves and then throttled her. I then took out a knife from my pocket and stabbed her repeatedly, said Samir.        
	Prapti, who was asleep in the adjacent room, woke up and ran into the room, crying out for her mother.        
	Somasree first clamped a hand on the childs mouth. I then took a pillow from the bed and suffocated her, till she stopped struggling.... After that, we opened the almirah, took the mobile phone and some jewellery, Somasree told the police.        
	Mission accomplished by 3.20pm, Somasree was the first to leave the Ghosh residence.        
	Somasree went straight home (within shouting distance of Srabontis house) while I went to a pond nearby to dispose of the blood-stained gloves. I then took a rickshaw to Kona Expressway, from where I boarded a bus back home, said Samir.

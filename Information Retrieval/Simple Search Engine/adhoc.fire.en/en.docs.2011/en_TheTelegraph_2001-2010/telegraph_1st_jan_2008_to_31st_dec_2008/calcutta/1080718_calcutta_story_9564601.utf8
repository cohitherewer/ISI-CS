          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A Gariahat businessmans wife was arrested along with her maid on Thursday for pressing hot tongs on an underage domestic helps back to punish him for wetting his pants.        
	Screaming in pain, 12-year-old Sanjit Rai ran out of the apartment and took refuge behind a car parked in the basement. A group of drivers who knew that the domestic help used to be tortured regularly spotted and took him to Gariahat police station with burn injuries on his back.         
	A police team arrested Debarati Pradhan and the maid, Malati Das, on the basis of Sanjits statement. But the duo were granted bail because the police booked them under bailable charges.         
	It is illegal to hire a minor as a domestic help, let alone torture him/her.         
	We handed over the boy to an NGO since his parents and other family members reside at Chapra, in Bihar, said Rajesh Subarna, the deputy commissioner of police (south division).        
	The police are awaiting the arrival of Sanjits parents to carry the investigation forward.         
	Investigators said Sanjit, who was hired three months ago, told them he was tortured regularly. On Thursday, Debarati noticed that he had wet his pants and immediately entered the kitchen, where her maid was cooking. She asked her to give the hot tongs, said an officer at Gariahat police station.         
	The duo then caught hold of Sanjits hands and pressed the tongs against his back. quot;When the boy came to the police station, officers noticed that his back was scalded. They immediately took him to SSKM Hospital for a medical check-up, quot; Subarna said.               
	When Debarati and Malati were summoned to the police station, the duo turned up with a legal counsellor. They were charged with voluntarily causing hurt. Since the charge was a bailable one, we released them on bail from the police station, another officer said.         
	A preliminary investigation revealed that Debarati and Malati would torture Sanjit mainly for his unhygienic toilet habits.         
	Sometimes, he would forget to flush the toilet after relieving himself. This is because the boy was from a remote village in Bihar. Instead of teaching and guiding him, his employer used to beat him up. As a result, he used to be perennially scared whenever he had to go to the toilet. This is probably why he urinated in his pants on Thursday, the officer said.

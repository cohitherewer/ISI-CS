	Aftab Alam Ansaris arrest on the false charge of ferrying explosives to Uttar Pradesh for the serial court blasts was a shameful incident, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Tuesday.
    
	It was a shameful incident. I will see to it that he gets back whatever he lost since his arrest, Bhattacharjee said, moments after the Baranagar youth and his mother, Ayesha Begum, called on him.
    
	The CID had seized Aftabs watch and cellphone and the Rs 450 he was carrying after he was brought to its headquarters in Bhabani Bhavan. He is yet to get them back, almost a week after his release from a Lucknow jail.
    
	The chief minister assured me that Ill get back my stuff, Aftab later told reporters. He admitted that my arrest was a mistake and said he would look into it.
    
	Aftabs mother fell ill at Writers Buildings and was given medicines by the chief ministers secretariat.
    
	The 27-year- old, a victim of mistaken identity, was picked up by the special task force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh police on December 27 and later taken to Lucknow. He was released on January 17, after the sleuths realised that he was not the one they were looking for.
    
	Sources said that soon after Aftabs arrest, a central intelligence agency informed the STF that a wrong person had been picked up. 
    
	But the force ignored the alert, apparently because two accused in the blast case  Mohammad Khalid and Tariq Quazmi  had identified Aftab from his picture as the one who supplied them explosives.
    
	The Subsidiary Intelligence Branch told us to release Aftab after we arrested him on December 27. They said the real accused was from Malda, recalled an STF officer.
    
	The CID claimed it had not played any role in the arrest. Our task was to locate the person the STF was looking for. The rest was the STFs responsibility, said a CID official.
    
	But sources in Calcutta police said they had alerted the CID that Aftab was not involved in the UP blasts. The CID had asked us about Aftab, said an officer of Cossipore police station (Baranagar falls under its jurisdiction).
    
	Our probe revealed that he had never been to Bangladesh. We checked the log book of his office and found that he was in town on the days the STF claimed he was in UP. But the CID ignored our feedback, said the officer.

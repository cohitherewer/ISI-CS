The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Online support for Nano plant
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Online support for Nano plant
  - Techies flock to website created by colleagues          A STAFF REPORTER                          Workers on their way to the Singur factory site. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	The sunrise sector has started a virtual campaign to save the states showcase manufacturing hub.         
	On Sunday, as the Trinamul Congress chief sat on an indefinite dharna outside the Tata Motors plant in Singur, two senior executives from the IT and life sciences industries created a website to rally support for the project and the process of industrialisation in the state.         
	While the number of supporters at the Trinamul podium has dwindled since then, http://wesupportindustry.silicogene.com/ISR has seen a steady stream of techies voicing their support for industrialisation.         
	By Tuesday evening, nearly 300 professionals had written on the message board of the website started by Jhuma Mukherjee and Ranjan Basu.         
	The perception about Bengal is changing and it will be a shame if the Tatas Nano project is moved out because of short-sighted political interests. We must come forward for the bigger cause and dream about a Bengal humming with activity, employment and growth, wrote Anindya Nag, the head (operations) of Wipro Infotech, on the message board.         
	We should have the Tata factory up and running or else its a loss of face for all of us and a matter of shame, wrote Pallab Sen, a senior consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers.              
	Mukherjee and Basu, who work with The Chatterjee Group, are also emailing everyone they know to garner support for the cause.         
	We discuss these issues over a cup of tea but never do anything. My colleague and I decided to create a platform for people like us who want to voice their support for industrialisation, said Mukherjee.         
	Managing directors, managers and even trainees of companies like Wipro, HCL Technologies, IBM and Cognizant Technology Solutions are leading the campaign, but there are also academicians, students and bankers on the message board.         
	Tata should be allowed to work in peace in Singur, wrote Nupur Mukherjee, a lecturer.         
	Support on the Internet for the Nano plant is not restricted to this website. Orkut, one of the most popular social networking sites, has multiple communities supporting the project.         
	Tata amp; Singur Project, created on Orkut in December 2006, invites members to debate the project, the chief ministers resolve and its effect on West Bengal.         
	The We want Tata Motors in Singur community brooks no argument about the need for the project in Bengal. I am expecting a second Jamshedpur in Singur, reads one post.         
	Another community, Asun Bangali der bachai (Come Lets Save the Bengalis), urges members to wake up and save themselves by supporting industrialisation.         
	Our image has already suffered. I am afraid that if this happens (if Tatas leave) the one or two companies that have been coming to the state will also stop, wrote a member.

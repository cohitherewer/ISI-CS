 - Home and only workplace for 34 years
     A STAFF REPORTER
             R.K. Sharma: Sorrow and sympathy. Picture by Amit Datta
                    
	For four days, R.K. Sharma sat on a wooden bench on the road and watched his home and workplace of 34 years being devoured by fire, bit by excruciating bit.
    
	Sitting by the 57-year-old caretaker of the Nandaram complex were the traders of the market, who used to turn to him every time their shop went dark or the tap ran dry. Sharma, who has never worked anywhere else, could only console the shop-owners in their darkest hour. 
    
	Its a ghost house now. I have worked in the market from the day it came into being and cant get over the shock, said Sharma, between advising firemen on how to find their way on the 13th floor. 
    
	The caretaker claimed that he had tried to help the firemen in drawing up a map of the building on Saturday, but they didnt listen and the worst happened as the fire spread. 
    
	Sharma was asleep in his room on the 13th floor of the market  where he stayed with his family  when the blaze started. Some workers who sleep in the building woke me up by knocking on the door. I looked out of the window and saw Tirpalpatti ablaze. I never knew that the fire would destroy Nandaram market as well, he said.
    
	According to him, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) should have demolished the illegal portion of Nandaram long ago. Why are they saying now that it is illegal? How did they issue trade licences to people who had shops in the illegal portion of the building? The CMC officials made a lot of money then. 
    
	Sharma recalled another fire in the market five years ago. It started from an incense stick that the owner of a basement shop had left burning on Diwali night. We had no option but to demolish the roof of the basement to put out the blaze.
    
	A similar plan by the army of blowing up the top two floors of Nandaram market was rejected by the state fire department officials. It would have worked, rued Sharma.

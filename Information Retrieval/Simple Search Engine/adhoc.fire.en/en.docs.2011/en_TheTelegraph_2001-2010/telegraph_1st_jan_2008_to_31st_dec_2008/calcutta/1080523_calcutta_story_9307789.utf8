	Two drug addicts attempting a robbery at a New Alipore address before dawn on Thursday were thwarted by a guard, who chased the duo through an empty street and caught one of them.        
	Sheikh Abbasuddin, an ex-serviceman, was catching a few winks on the ground floor of the two-storeyed house  F-102/E  when he heard a clanging sound from the second floor. Sushil Bag, the robber he later caught, and another youth were then picking up whatever they could lay their hands on inside a bathroom.        
	On realising that someone had woken up, the duo clambered down the tree they had climbed to reach the terrace of the building. Abbasuddin did the same and ran after them , catching up with them after a few hundred metres.        
	It was around 3.30am and nobody was around on Taratala Road except for a few newspaper vendors. I was injured while grabbing one of the thieves but a man on a two-wheeler helped me take him to the nearby police station, the guard said.        
	The owner of the house, Bhaskar Ghosh, is vacationing in Chennai along with wife Priyanka and two sons. His mother-in-law said Sumita Saha, who lives nearby, said Abbasuddin informed her about the incident after handing over the thief to the police.        
	I received a call from Abbas around 4.30am. Thankfully, the thieves could not take away anything except a few items from the bathroom, she said.        
	The sound that alerted Abbasuddin was of the thieves breaking a wash basin.        
	The police said Sushil and his accomplice were part of a group of drug addicts who would steal anything that could buy them a fix.        
	 Most of these youths are from the fringes of Behala and Thakurpukur. They are not expert thieves but will go to any extent to find something of worth with which they can buy drugs. We know that the gang has been eyeing houses in New Alipore, a senior officer at New Alipore police station said.

  - Rs 6-crore CMDA project on Bypass           A STAFF REPORTER                          The Panchannagram slum on fire. A Telegraph picture                                        
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has taken up a project to rehabilitate the 400 families that had lost their homes in a fire at Panchannagram, on the EM Bypass, in March this year.        
	Each family will be given a flat in buildings that will come up on a six-bigha plot of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) in Panchannagram. The 400 families lived in shanties on the plot.        
	At a recent meeting, the CMC agreed to hand over the plot to the CMDA free for the rehabilitation project. The Rs 6-crore estate will come up on a public-private partnership basis in two phases.        
	Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and the state government will each bear 35 per cent of the cost. The beneficiaries will pay 20 per cent and the rest will be borne by the CMDA as the nodal agency of the project. Each building in the estate will be four-storeyed.        
	The families have suffered a lot. We are trying our best to give them some relief before the next monsoon, said Samarendra Nath Roy, the chairman of the local borough XII.        
	We have started ground work, which includes development of the land and setting up of infrastructure, said Deepankar Chatterjee, the chief engineer of CMDAs area development sector.         
	Urban development affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya had attended the CMDA-CMC meeting.

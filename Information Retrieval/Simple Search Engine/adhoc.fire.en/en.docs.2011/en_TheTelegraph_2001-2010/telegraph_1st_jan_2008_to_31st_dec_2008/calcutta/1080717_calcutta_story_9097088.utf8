The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | No escape from autorickshaw raj
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       No escape from autorickshaw raj
  - They stand wherever you go, blocking the way and letting loose fumes that gnaw at your health                                               
	Noxious katatel emissions are not the only way autorickshaws affect Calcuttans. In a city of narrow roads, the three-wheelers, thanks to their sheer number and aided by administrative apathy, occupy an inordinate amount of space. There are 119 official auto routes in Calcutta and every route has at least two stands. Most of the stands are on the carriageway, cutting off the flow of traffic. Where there is no space on the carriageway, the three-wheelers park on the footpaths, making them out of bounds for the pedestrians. Metro visited four spots where autos edge out other vehicles and pedestrians.                
	Where: Kimber Street         
	What we saw: More than 250 autos of route 45 (Topsia-Kimber Street) block the 250-m stretch that connects Congress Exhibition Road with Park Circus Connector. Residents say the autos are parked bumper-to-bumper in multiple rows leaving no space for even a motorcycle to pass through. The three-wheelers block the entrance to the Kimber Nursing Home as well.         
	Union voice: Where will we park the autos? There is no other space to park them. Moreover, not many vehicles use this road. They can use other lanes, says Akram Ali.         
	Local version: From 7am to 10pm, even ambulances cannot enter this road. Throughout the day, the drivers play radio at high volume disturbing the patients of the nursing home. We tried protesting once but the union members threatened us, says an official of the nursing home.                 
	Where: Grant Street        
	What we saw: Autorickshaws of Chandni Chowk-Lohapul route have been occupying this stretch for years. As a result, Grant Street is off-limits for all other vehicles. Of the almost 500 autos on the route, at least a hundred are parked on Grant Street at any given point of time, causing traffic jams on SN Banerjee Road and Lenin Sarani.        
	Union voice: This is a legal auto stand. If the autos do not park here where will they? asks an auto driver.         
	Local version: The auto drivers, backed by their union, flout the law with impunity. Since the road was converted into an auto stand, life has become a nightmare for residents. I cannot park my car in front of my building as the space has been taken up by autos, says Christopher Emmanuel, a resident.                 
	Where: Marcus Square, near MG Road Metro station        
	What we saw: A footpath more than 500 m long has been encroached by autorickshaws of MG Road-Kadapara route. The adjoining portion of the carriageway has been dug up by the civic body, leaving pedestrians with no space to walk.         
	Union voice: The road has been dug up, so parking there is not possible. If the autos do not ply, the families of the drivers will starve. That is why we are parking on the footpath, says Narayan Sau, a driver.         
	Local version: People move around like cattle here. When there is traffic on the road, it is just impossible to walk, says Mohammad Wahid, a resident of the area.                 
	Where: Ultadanga        
	What we saw: Autos to almost every point in Salt Lake, Lake Town, Baguiati, Kestopur, Dum Dum Park, BK Pal Avenue and Ahiritola are available from Ultadanga crossing. The three-wheelers occupy the majority of the carriageway. According to a traffic sergeant, autorickshaws are the reason behind massive snarls here.        
	Union voice: We try our best not to disrupt the traffic. But during peak hours, it is impossible to stand in a straight line, says an auto driver.         
	Local version: Driving and walking on the stretch is a test of nerve. You never know from where an autorickshaw will come and hit you, says Debabrata Biswas, a regular commuter.                    ZEESHAN JAWED

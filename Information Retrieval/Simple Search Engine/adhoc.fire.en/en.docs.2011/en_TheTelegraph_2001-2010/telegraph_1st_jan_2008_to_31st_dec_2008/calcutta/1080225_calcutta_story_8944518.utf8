                      Indigenous expressions                    Exploring the quintessential spirit of all that is Indian, Manoj Kachangal has evolved a personal language that he has created through spirituality, colour and abstraction. In Search of the Abyss, the ongoing exhibition of his recent works, represents colour, rhythm, balance, accord and a sense of mysticism and tranquillity. At the same time, there is a palpable sense of adventure, as the viewer walks through the labyrinth-like space, negotiating the tangled thickness of paint. Possessed of a strong and dynamic energy, the artist has generated an atmosphere that is meditative and introspective yet inviting; a window to a world that beckons and invites further exploration. Escaping the obvious, his works allow for a freedom of analysis and reading, each an unfolding and captivating account of life in real and surreal realms. Curated by Bhavna Kakar.            Event: An exhibition of paintings by Manoj Kachangal When: Till February 29; 11.30 am - 7 pm Where: Mon Art Gallerie, 6 Hungerford Street, 3rd floor

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Thursday asked the state government to clarify its stand on an Afghan nationals plea for Indian citizenship.        
	Hakim Khan, who has been staying in Howrah since 1944 and married to an Indian woman, moved the high court after he was denied a passport.        
	Khan claimed he was born in Afghanistan in 1934. I came to India when I was only 10, Khan said in his petition.        
	Khans lawyer Buddhadeb Ghosal submitted before Justice Dipankar Dutta: Since 1944, my client has been living on Pilkhana Road, under Howrahs Golabari police station. He owns landed property here and has been issued a ration card, driving licence and a voters identity card. But he is still not considered an Indian citizen.        
	Ghosal said Khan has nine children, all of whom were born in a Howrah hospital. The electric meter and the land phone connection in his house are in his name.        
	Khan had applied for a passport but the authorities refused to issue him one as he was not an Indian citizen.        
	The authorities issued passports to his wife, five sons and four daughters. As the head of the family, why should not my client be considered an Indian citizen and given a passport, the lawyer asked.        
	Appearing for the passport authorities and the Union of India, lawyer Uttam Majumdar submitted that S.B. Mondal, a secretary in the passport department, had written to the Bengal home secretary asking him to state his governments stand on Khans application for citizenship.        
	Three months have elapsed but there is still no response from the state government, Majumdar alleged.        
	A few days ago, the court had issued an order asking the government to make arrangements to deport Gul Mohammed Khan, alias Gul Khan, who had entered the country in 1984 and has since been staying in Calcutta.        
	Khan, too, had a ration card and has been running various businesses from the city. Gul moved a division bench against the order.

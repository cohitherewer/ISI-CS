          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Debasish Sen, the 14-year-old boy admitted to NRS Hospital with a bullet injury on Monday night, has claimed that he was shot at in a public toilet in Creek Row after a tiff with two youths.        
	Police have expressed doubts over the statement made to a team led by Taltala police station officer-in-charge Tarapada Datta on Wednesday.        
	According to the investigators, the boy was carrying a single-shot gun that went off accidentally when the catch gave way. There was a scorched perforation in his pocket. The gun is yet to be traced.        
	Debasish said he was relieving himself, when two youths asked him to hurry up, leading to a tiff. The boy apparently slapped one of the duo, which made the other one shoot at him, said a senior officer of Taltala police station.        
	Such an incident could not have taken place in a congested locality around 10pm on the night of Poila Baisakh without anyone noticing, asserted the officer.        
	The investigators visited the public toilet described by Debasish but could not find a witness to corroborate his statement. The officers scanned the toilet and its adjoining areas for traces of blood but didnt find any.        
	There are a few kite shops adjoining the toilet where Debasish claims he was attacked and they remain open till late at night. None of the traders heard the gunshot or saw any commotion. If the boy had, indeed, been injured in the area, there would have been blood on the ground, which we did not find, added the senior officer.        
	The Class VII student of a Taltala school, who lives in Muchipara, has made conflicting statements to father Panchu Gopal, mother Aparna and the police.         
	The boy has been charged under the Arms Act. The police have also started an attempt to murder case.        
	We are trying to find the revolver. But much of the case depends on circumstantial evidence. We need to collect some more evidence. The boy seems to be making up one story after another to cover up the fact that he was carrying a gun, said another officer of the police station.        
	Second among three siblings, Debasish was admitted to a boarding school along with his elder brother.         
	He was pulled out last year after his parents learnt that he was not concentrating on his studies. Debasishs parents have denied the charges against their son.

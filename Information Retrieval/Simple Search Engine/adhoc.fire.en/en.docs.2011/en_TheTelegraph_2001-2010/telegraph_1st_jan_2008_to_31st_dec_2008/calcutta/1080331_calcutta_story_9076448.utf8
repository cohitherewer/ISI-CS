                                                                                                               Normality buzz at Besu
  - Parents, teachers take stock, plan action           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Communities associated with Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) are coming together to try and restore normality on campus. The parents of the students met outside the campus, in Mahabodhi Hall, on Sunday to take stock of the situation and discuss their plan of action.        
	We will meet the vice-chancellor tomorrow and submit a memorandum, said a parent, who did not want to be named. The parents primary concerns are the return of campus normality and security of their wards.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi had written to vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea on Saturday, asking him to restore order immediately. He also decried outsider interference in the universitys affairs.        
	Besu teachers have decided to hold a referendum on campus on whether vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea should continue in office. We decided to hold this referendum at a special general meeting on Saturday. The executive committee of the Besu Teachers Association will decide on the modalities of the referendum on Monday, said secretary Partha Pratim Chattopadhyay.        
	Both students and teachers remained sceptical about the effectiveness of the one-man committee formed by the government to probe the cause of unrest at Besu.        
	The need of the hour is to restore normality on campus. Till today, second-year students have not been able to return, said Shyamish Das, a student.         
	Many such committees were formed in the past but the situation did not improve. We are yet to know about the one-man panels terms of reference, said Chattopadhyay.        
	The Besu board of management will meet on Monday.

	A youth who supplied material to a telecom company was gunned down in full public view at Battala, off Dum Dums Gorakshabashi Road, on Friday afternoon.        
	A preliminary probe revealed that Subrata Halder, 35, was killed after he refused to meet the demand of some local extortionists.        
	Police identified Totan, Puchka, Chhotan and Kutti  all aides of extortionist Swapan Bhattacharya  as being responsible for the murder.        
	Totan, Puchka and Chhotan have been arrested and a search is on for Kutti and some other persons whom we suspect to have been involved in the murder, said P.K. Tripathi, the additional superintendent of police (Barrackpore).        
	Halder had lodged a complaint with Dum Dum police station two months ago, alleging that a few local goons were demanding money from him. But he withdrew the complaint a few days later, following pressure from some CPM leaders, said an officer of Dum Dum police station.        
	Subratas mother Madhabi said Swapan had come to their NN Road house around 4.30pm and asked her son to accompany him. They went to a ground barely 500 metres from Subratas house.        
	Witnesses said an altercation broke out between the two. As the duo were engaged in a verbal exchange, two youths standing at a distance walked up to them and pumped bullets into Subratas chest, they said.        
	The body lay in a pool of blood and water for over 20 minutes, till Subratas family reached the spot. No one dared to help us carry the body, said Madhabi. Angry neighbours did not let the police take the body till 8.30pm.

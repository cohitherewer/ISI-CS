  - CCTV in risk zones          KINSUK BASU                          New Market tops the list of vital installations where the police want closed-circuit television cameras installed. A Telegraph picture                                         
	The next time you walk into New Market, you could be on TV  CCTV, that is.        
	Rattled by the serial blasts in Jaipur earlier this month, the city police have suggested closed-circuit television cameras be set up in markets and vital installations that do not have any system of electronic surveillance at present.         
	New Market tops the list, along with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees residence and his workplace, Writers Buildings.         
	The proposal has been forwarded to the home department and work is expected to begin within the next few weeks.        
	While making a fresh analysis of the risk-prone zones, we realised that some of the possible target areas were not adequately covered in terms of surveillance. The list includes not only markets and offices, but also some intersections and places of worship, a senior officer said.        
	Cameras have been recommended for Kalighat temple and a few busy intersections that are thought to be vulnerable, including Hazra.        
	The CCTV footage recorded at New Market will be monitored round the clock, and all visitors will have to pass through door-frame metal detectors. The arrangements will be the same at Writers and the chief ministers Palm Avenue residence.         
	Unless it is a guided missile attack, a metal detector at the gate should provide the first warning of an attack, a police officer said.         
	Apart from CCTVs, the police have suggested installation of door-frame metal detectors at some power distribution centres, including the ones at Paharpur, Metiabruz and Golf Green. A few CCTVs have been recommended for Howrah bridge, too.        
	Our surveillance mechanism has changed over the years, but we have to make fresh assessments at regular intervals. Earlier, we did not deem it necessary to cover installations like the Tallah pumping station, but it is necessary now, the officer said.         
	Surveillance at the RBI building and the police headquarters in Lalbazar will be intensified as part of the new strategy.

	The high court-appointed three-member team probing the felling of trees at the Indian Botanic Garden spent nearly three hours on Tuesday examining the site and relevant documents.         
	Calcutta police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, lawyer Anindya Mitra and the principal chief conservator of forests, Atanu Raha, reached the Shibpur garden at 3.20pm along with two photographers and a cameraman to record video footage.        
	After getting off his car, the police commissioner wanted to know where Girija Sankar Giri, the assistant director of the garden, was. On being told that he was in his office, Chakrabarti said: We had asked him to be present at the site.        
	The three then entered the flower garden, where Chakrabarti asked the labourers how many trees had been chopped off and the name of the contractor who bought the trunks.        
	After some labourers pointed to the spot where a tree had stood, the commissioner asked one of them to dig the area with a shovel. After digging for a few minutes, the labourer said: Sir, digging the mud is of no use. The contractor had removed the roots of the tree.        
	When Giri reached the site with two garden officials, Mitra asked him how many trees had been chopped. The assistant director replied: Eighteen. He accompanied the trio for the rest of the garden tour. Around 4.55pm, the team members went to Giris office and examined documents for over an hour.        
	Mitra declined to comment on the probe till the team placed its report before the court.

                          Behala Nutan Dal                    
	Behala Nutan Dal        
	The final round of CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja started on Tuesday at Behala Nutan Dal. A crowd had trickled in by the time the judges made their way into the pandal in the middle of a winding lane.        
	Modelled on a dilapidated red-brick zamindar house, the structure with a traditional courtyard, false balconies, ornate grilles and chandeliers exuded old-world charm. Is this a real north Calcutta purono bari? asked Parambrata Chatterjee.        
	Raima Sen, too, was impressed, I think the pandal looks very real. I quite like the thermocol work. The pandal is spacious and I also liked the idol, she said.        
	Beth Payne, the American consul-general in Calcutta, got busy capturing images of folk artistes performing in a corner of the courtyard. She joined the other judges to offer anjali with visitors. Raima said she offers anjali almost every year.        
	Bickram Ghosh and Jaya Seal Ghosh were impressed by the artistry. The concept of recreating an era is fantastic. The look seems straight out of an old novel. Minute details have been taken care of but the gate isnt wide or easily accessible, said Bickram.         
	Dilip Samajpati, the senior manager (customer relations) of CESC, was firm. Why is there a juggernaut blocking the gate? By using inflammable material and making only one gate you have created a death trap, he told an organiser.        
	An uneven ground of clay and sand, which made walking difficult for the aged, also cost the puja points. The judges found the Durgadalan suffocating when crowded.        
	Verdict: Four Star                          41 Pally, Haridevpur     
	41 Pally        
	The True Spirit team made its second halt at last years Model Puja, 41 Pally in Haridevpur. Their novel theme  using discarded logs and bark to create a wooden mesh  struck a chord with the judges.        
	Bickram, Jaya and Parambrata headed for a group of tribal musicians sitting near the mandap. Bickram drummed up his rhythmscape on a dhamsha madol, joined by Parambrata, as Jaya swayed to the rustic beats.         
	Samajpati checked out an anti-drug abuse camp and industrialist Sanjay Budhia looked impressed by 41 Pallys simple and aesthetic appeal with good medical, water and fire-fighting facilities.         
	Despite the organisers efforts, 41 Pally didnt live up to its True Spirit reputation. The puja was criticised for placing a wooden revolving door at the entrance.         
	Its interesting, but it worries me. They should probably do without it next year, said Beth.         
	Les Dangerfield, the deputy director of the British Council division of the British High Commission, was happy with the pujas first-aid preparedness. Its an interesting way of looking at the pujas. We tend to focus on the artistic aspect too much and dont find out if a pandal has an emergency exit, he said.         
	The puja may have been far too prepared with first-aid. Do you really have to use two beds? All you really need are Band Aids to fix blisters that you get from walking around in new shoes, joked Samajpati.         
	While Parambrata found the place claustrophobic, Raima didnt seem too impressed either. Its okay. I like the idol  pure and subtle, she said.         
	Verdict: Four Star         
	Tridhara Sammilani        
	Tridhara Sammilani, near Deshapriya Park, was clearly the most impressive. The pandal is modelled on Padmanabhapuram Palace in Kanyakumari. The carvings on the replica of the rosewood structure intrigued Jaya and Bickram, who tried to find out about its history.        
	Never seen as many pandals as I have yesterday and today! Raima told Parambrata, who was signing autographs for some young fans.        
	The pandal, which is open on all sides, pleased Beth. She felt it was safer for everybody. It doesnt get tight or crowded, unlike 41 Pally. Its my favourite!        
	Sanjay, who was examining the intricate woodwork in the mantrasala, pointed out that one could get out of the pandal really fast in an emergency. Besides its simple, fresh and elegant.        
	Raima too took a fancy to the spacious palace. I like the idol too. And the floor looks so real, she said.        
	Parambrata exclaimed: This is an exact replica of the Travancore rajbari! Its great to see a south Indian structure  they are calm and soothing.        
	Verdict: Model Puja                          Kalitala Sporting Club    
	Kalitala Sporting Club         
	The fourth stop was Kalitala Sporting Club, near Ruby General Hospital. Its plaster of Paris and jute structure has been inspired by an ancient west African mud mosque in Mali built by the Dogon tribe that is now a World Heritage Site.         
	Inside, representing the circle of life is an artistic clay model of a tree  since its the earliest form of life  and of Brahma  since according to Hindu mythology, He created life  and sakti rupeno Durga (the goddess in the form of Sakti).         
	Bickram liked the idol but was stumped by the pandal theme. I like the idol  very subdued and underplayed. But the concept of the pandal baffles me. I dont know exactly what they wanted to portray, grinned the percussionist.         
	The puja lost points for its use of inflammable thermocol on the outside. Its styrofoam again, exclaimed Beth, who liked the idol better. What I love best about the pujas here are the children. Just look how delighted they are, she smiled and moved on to click pictures of two kids.         
	I thought it was quite cleverly done. And it seems relatively safe. Unlike the other pandal (41 Pally) there are no naked wood structures that might hurt somebody, pointed out Dangerfield.         
	The rather small entry and exit points also earned the puja minus points besides making the mandap cramped. I think covered structures such as these tend to be a little suffocating, said Dangerfield.        
	Verdict: Five Star                          Chaltabagan Lohapatty    
	Chaltabagan Lohapatty        
	The final destination of the day was Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatty Durgapuja. The former Five Star winner moved the judges with its innovative artwork and hi-tech gadgets.        
	It scored for using metal wire mesh  a non-inflammable material  for building the pandal.         
	The puja is eco-friendly too. With heat sensors, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, drums of water and bags of sand, the organisers seemed well-prepared to tackle fire hazards.         
	The pandal encroaches on the road. But its a good thing inflammable materials werent used, said Dangerfield.         
	The use of alternative sources of energy, like wind and sun, impressed Samajpati.         
	Jaya loved the novelty of it all. I think they really worked hard on the creative aspects. To make a pandal out of metal sieves is in itself very challenging. This is my favourite of the five. There is also a newness to the idol, and the small patch of green on either side of the pandal has a soothing effect, she said.         
	Parambrata looked delighted with an apple the priest gave him as prasad. As he displayed his prize with boyish enthusiasm, Bickram grinned and said: How symbolic. Its like your labours have borne fruit. As long as it is not forbidden, grinned Samajpati, not to be outdone. As long as there is no Eve, smiled back Bickram.        
	As Raima walked past, basking in the crowd adulation, Parambrata remarked, tongue firmly in cheek, There she is.        
	Verdict: Five Star

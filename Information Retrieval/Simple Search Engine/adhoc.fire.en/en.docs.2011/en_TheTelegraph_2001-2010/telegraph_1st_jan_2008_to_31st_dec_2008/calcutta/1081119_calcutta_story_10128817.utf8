          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The state government is working on a comprehensive parking policy to increase vehicular speed in the city.         
	As part of the policy, building construction rules will be relaxed to encourage promoters to keep a floor or the basement of every building for parking. We will allow more floor area ratio (FAR) in highrise buildings to accommodate vehicles. A comprehensive parking policy is being worked out on the basis of a recommendation by the Calcutta Metropolitan Planning Committee, state urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said at Writers Buildings on Tuesday.        
	The panels executive committee recently submitted a draft report to the government with a slew of recommendations. According to sources, multi-level parking facilities will be made mandatory in commercial estates.

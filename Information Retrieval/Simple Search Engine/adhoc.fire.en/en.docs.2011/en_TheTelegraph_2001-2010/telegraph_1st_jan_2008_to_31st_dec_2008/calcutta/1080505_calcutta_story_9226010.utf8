	A second Norwester in as many days struck Calcutta on Sunday evening, the blitz of wind and rain bringing relief to the city after a sultry day.        
	Flight operations at the airport were suspended from 7.45pm to 8.15pm because of the storm.        
	As many as seven planes were forced to hover over the airport for over half an hour before being given permission to land, officials said.        
	The aircraft included a Dubai-Dhaka Emirates flight that could not land in the Bangladesh capital because of bad weather and was diverted to Calcutta.        
	Four outbound flights were delayed.         
	The Met office in Alipore pegged the wind speed at 93 kmph, the highest this summer.         
	The temperature fell by nearly seven degrees Celsius.        
	Thundershowers have been forecast for Monday, too.

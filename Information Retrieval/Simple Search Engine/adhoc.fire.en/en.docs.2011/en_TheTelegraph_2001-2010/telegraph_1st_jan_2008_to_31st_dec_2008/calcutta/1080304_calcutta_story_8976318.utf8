     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Two men were killed and another was seriously injured in mishaps in central Calcutta and Howrah on Monday. 
    
	Around 6.35am, 60-year-old Abdul Hafiz, a resident of Gas Street in Rajabazar area, was crushed under the rear wheels of a private bus when it started moving before he had got off. The incident happened near Prachi cinema hall in Sealdah. 
    
	Hafiz was alighting from the bus slowly. While he was still on the footboard, one of the conductors in the bus sounded the bell. As the driver accelerated, Hafiz lost his balance and fell on the road, said an officer of the traffic department. He was rushed to NRS Medical College and Hospital by pedestrians, but the doctors pronounced him brought dead.
    
	The driver sped away with the bus. The pedestrians could not take down the registration number of the vehicle. The police said bus operators were being contacted to find out which vehicles were scheduled to be in the area at that time.
    
	In the other mishap, Subhas Pal, 27, a resident of Noapara in Amta was killed when the two-wheeler he was riding with his brother Lakshman, 40, collided with a hand-cart on NH 6 near Jangalpur in the Domjur police station area. The hand-cart was carrying iron rods.
    
	One of the iron rods pierced Pals chest. His brother, who was riding pillion, was injured in the chest and head, said an officer of Domjur police station. The hand-cart puller fled the scene.
    
	The local residents rushed the duo to a nearby private clinic. Pal succumbed to his injuries on the way.

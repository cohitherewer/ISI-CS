 Rights flout a rite of life in Calcutta

	The high court verdict on Monday  that Book Fair 2008 on Park Circus Maidan would be in violation of the Calcuttans right to live in a pollution-free environment and enjoy freedom of movement  can provide a ray of hope for the people and open a can of worms for the powers that be. For, violation of such basic rights is a way of life in Calcutta.
    
	This judgment is fine but what about other instances where the same provisions are violated every day? demands retired high court judge Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, who had delivered pioneering green judgments in the late Nineties. 
    
	The Book Fair judgment opens up opportunities to address other issues where similar violations are taking place all the time, adds environment activist Subhas Dutta.
    
	Metro takes the cue to address a few...
       
	Auto Emission (Everywhere)
    
	The violation: Two-thirds of air pollution in Calcutta is caused by about 1.2 million fume-belching vehicles. Less than one-fifth of these have auto emission certificates. Among those that do, many certificates are either forged or flawed. And the government has done precious little for polluting vehicles to switch to clean fuel like LPG or CNG.
    
	What is to blame? Lack of political will; nexus between politicians, unions and transport lobby; corruption at various levels.
    
	Who is to blame? The prime accused are the transport department and police. The environment department and pollution control board have looked the other way.
    
	What can be done? Proper enforcement of the law with prohibitive action against rogue vehicles and errant emission testing centres; deadline-driven phase-out of old and polluting vehicles; forced switch to alternative fuel (led by immediate conversion of polluting autos to LPG).
       
	Traffic trauma (Esplanade)
    
	The violation: Almost every thoroughfare is bad, but the stretch opposite Metro cinema is a daily nightmare. In a metro with the least road space, how can a thoroughfare in the heart of the city be cordoned off for a protest platform? Not only does this violate right to freedom of movement, it also adds to air pollution due to waiting vehicles.
    
	What is to blame? Metro Channel being designated a permanent venue for meetings. This hurts the ordinary commuter without the voices of protest reaching the authorities  Writers Buildings is not within shouting distance.
    
	Who is to blame? Politicians and the police. The rulebook says protesters must take permission from Lalbazar, but political parties rarely do so. And police personnel on the spot more often than not turn a blind eye to the traffic mess.
    
	What can be done? Ban weekday congregations on such a vital stretch; find an alternative and less disruptive site.
       
	Noise pollution (Silent zone)
    
	Violation: Honking of cars and blaring of loudspeakers within 100 metres of medical and educational institutions, which are meant to be noise-free. The most recent example was the loud soiree held in Citizens Park, close to SSKM Hospital, without any police permission. It was attended by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Noise (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, and Article 21 were violated.
    
	Who is to blame? An apathetic state administration, led by the police. The PCB and environment department have also failed the city. 
    
	What can be done? Immediate notification and implementation of all silent zones.

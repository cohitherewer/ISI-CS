          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Teachers selected for Presidency College will have to undergo special training before they can enter the classroom.        
	The decision has been taken on the basis of a recommendation by the seven-member committee that had found partial autonomy to be the most suitable status for Presidency, Sudarshan Ray Chowdhury, the state higher education minister, said in the Assembly on Monday.        
	The training will be offered to the teachers in the government-run David Hare Teachers Training College in Calcutta. The details of the training programme, the kind of projects the teachers would be required to undertake and the duration of the programme will be decided by an expert committee, the minister told the House.        
	The government will soon set up the expert committee, he added.        
	The training programme will be mandatory for both newly appointed teachers and those transferred from other state government-run colleges.        
	Presidency College has been identified as one of the best colleges in India. We are doing the needful to ensure that the institution can retain its high academic quality, said the higher education minister.        
	The statement was in response to a question by Saugata Roy of the Trinamul Congress. He asked what steps were being taken by the government to upgrade Presidency and also whether the government had taken any initiative to implement the recommendations of the panel, which submitted its report last July.         
	Nearly 40 teaching posts were lying vacant in the college and the panel had recommended filling up of the posts by 2007. It also wanted immediate recruitment of experienced teachers at the professor and reader levels on a permanent and non-transferable basis.         
	The government, however, has appointed 17 new teachers for Presidency. They will undergo the training, Ray Chowdhury said.        
	The panel observed that a lack of quality teachers had lowered the standard of the institution. It had urged the government to ensure that Presidency teachers were equipped to teach at an institute of excellence.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	The state government announced a hike of nearly 80 per cent in the stipend of junior doctors on Monday, two weeks after over 1,000 of them struck work for three days demanding better pay.         
	A government panel had recommended more than 50 per cent increase in the stipend.        
	Junior doctors at SSKM Hospital, Medical College and Hospital and Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital had started an indefinite ceasework on August 4, but withdrew it after the government assured them of an appreciable hike.        
	We have done everything we could to meet their demands. We did keep our promise. The order has already been issued to all hospitals, S.N. Banerjee, the director of medical education, told Metro.         
	We are overjoyed. At last the government paid heed to our request. This increases our responsibility towards our patients, said Wasim Firoz Khan, an intern at Medical College and Hospital.         
	There were few voices of dissatisfaction too. Our demands werent fully met. At each level, the hike falls short by Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 from what we had asked for. However, we are satisfied for now, said Kuntal Maity, a first year postgraduate trainee at SSKM Hospital.         
	Mridul Sarkar, the spokesperson for the All India Democratic Students Organisation, said the junior doctors would not launch any protest now.        
	If you compare with other states like Delhi, the hike is nominal. We had also asked for better infrastructure to reduce the inhuman work pressure on junior doctors. The government apparently is in no mood to do anything in that direction. But yes, the hike is a relief for now, he said.

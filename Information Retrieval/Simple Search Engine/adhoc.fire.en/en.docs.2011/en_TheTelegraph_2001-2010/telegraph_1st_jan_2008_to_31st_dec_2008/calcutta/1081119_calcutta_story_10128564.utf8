          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 14-month-old girl died at a nursing home on Tuesday, sparking cries of negligence and leading to mob fury on the premises for three hours.        
	Srishti Ghosh Dastidar was admitted to Tulip Nursing Home near Nagerbazar on Monday night. She had high fever since Saturday and had stopped passing urine and stool, said her father Srikanto, an insurance agent        
	Doctors at the nursing home gave her paracetamol and ORS, said Srishtis mother Shukla, who was with her through the night. The childs condition deteriorated and she passed away at 5.45am.        
	We got her admitted at the insistence of child specialist Kishalay Kar. He is attached to the nursing home but did not come to see our daughter, despite our repeated pleas, said Srikanto.        
	The nursing home authorities, however, refuted the allegations. The resident medical officer attended to the child all night. After almost every death in a nursing home, relatives raise a hue and cry over alleged negligence, said a nursing home official.        
	Srikanto and Shukla walked out of the nursing home at 6am and were soon joined by local residents. Hearing about the girls death, a mob entered the reception area of the nursing home and started ransacking the place. We were moved by the couples plight. When we demanded an explanation from the nursing home staff, they looked nonchalant. That enraged everyone, a witness told Metro.        
	The mob broke glass panes and demanded to meet the doctor and others responsible for the death. The ruckus continued till 9.30am, when police arrived and brought the situation under control.         
	Kishalay Kar was not available for comment.

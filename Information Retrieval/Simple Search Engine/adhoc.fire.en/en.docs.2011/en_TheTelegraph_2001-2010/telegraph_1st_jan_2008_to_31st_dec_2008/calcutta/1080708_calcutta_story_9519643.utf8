	ABACUS MEET        
	Competition was neck-to-neck as students tested their mental arithmetic skills at the 3rd Eastern Regional SIP Prodigy Contest held at Netaji Indoor Stadium. Over 1800 students from around 25 schools across West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand participated in the abacus competition. It was followed by a sit-and-draw contest too.         
	Students aged between four and six years had to solve 60 sums in five minutes. For those aged between seven and 12, the number of sums was increased to 125. Ranging from level one to eight, the advanced learners had to compete in two additional tests comprising multiplication and division sums, lasting three minutes each, along with five minutes for the initial abacus-based paper. The questions ranged from single-digit additions to three-digit multiplications and divisions.         
	Abacus not only enhances arithmetic skills, but also widens visual memory, concentration and listening skills, said Dinesh Victor, managing director of SIP Academy, India.         
	After maths it was time for some creativity. Kids painted the the Big Ben against an overcast London sky, Egyptian sphinx and island scenes to depict their dream vacation  the topic for the sit-and-draw contest. Crayons and colour pencils gave quick shape to inclined bridges and smoky abstract cities, as students displayed their talents.         
	For students of levels one to three, the prizes were distributed in two categories  below and above eight years of age. The winners were given medals and certificates. Abhishek Singh, an eighth level student from Sakshi Area in Jamshedpur, bagged the first prize in his category, while Naktala-resident Govind Gupta topped the below-eight category of the first level. Chief guest Subhash Chakraborty, minister of transport, sports and youth affairs, spoke about the necessity of co-ordination and memory-based skills in todays rat-race. Other guests included percussionist Bickram Ghosh, singers Lopamudra Mitra and Usha Uthup.         
	For students who fear mathematics, learning abacus can help them concentrate. I feel that my concentration level has increased after attending the brain gym course, said a first-time competitor Prateek Gupta, a Class VII student of Shree Bharati.         
	Sudhangshu Mukherjee from Siliguri said: I got my son admitted after my cousins son improved dramatically in maths. My sons concentration has also improved greatly as also his overall academic performance.

	Excitement blended with patriotism as young members of Leadership Training Service (LTS) marked the beginning of their year-long golden jubilee celebrations on July 2 at St Xaviers auditorium. Over 900 LTS members from 25 institutions participated in the event.         
	Chief guest Father George Pattery spoke about the sacrifices that leaders need to make to uphold the image of a nation. The evening started with a dance sequence staged by St Agnes School, Howrah. Dancers in colourful attires swirled around the stage to Tagores Aguner poroshmoni.         
	RK Academic Point staged a collage of various ethnic traditions titled Flavours of India. From the kurta-clad Bengali dancing to Dhitang dhitang bole to the Kashmiri girl twirling to Bhumro, the students encompassed a large part of India.         
	St Pauls School, Raghabpur staged a play titled LTS Way of Life. Boys from Don Bosco School, Park Circus put up a mesmerising vocal performance while Our Lady Queen of the Missions School (QMS) kept the audience spirits high with their dance number.         
	Students of St Xaviers College staged a theme-based dance drama on the leadership of women in various walks of life. Titled The Better Half, it portrayed the structure of todays society and the role of woman in battling odds. Shri Shikshayatan School also staged a drama on the changes affecting the lives of LTSers.         
	A band performance by St Josephs College on Bonds of Togtherness served as a retrospective to the significant historical struggles affecting people. There were also a power point presentation on the aims of LTS and a quiz.         
	For Komal Gehani, a student of communicative English, the concept of multi-religious unity woven among the objectives of LTS is most appealing. Bhavika Surana, a dance performer from QMS, claimed that this event helped her better herself. Performing in front of 900 people is no easy task, but I have gained the confidence now, she added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A run for the Olympics 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A run for the Olympics 
  - Direct flights, visa availability draw tourists          SANJAY MANDAL                                                  
	Calcuttans are queueing up to join the Olympic rush to Beijing  not to win medals but to watch the Chinese win them.        
	With less than a month left for the summer games to open, the Chinese tourist office, airlines and tour operators in the city are flooded with queries and bookings.         
	Lots of people from Calcutta and other parts of eastern India want to travel to China during the Olympics. The tickets for the opening ceremony on August 8 are sold, so they are trying to get their hands on the tickets for the other events, Alice Wang, the deputy director of the China National Tourist Office in Delhi, said on Friday.         
	Direct flights and easier access to visa after the opening of Chinas consulate in Calcutta have boosted the demand. Were expecting a rush in August for visas to China, said a consulate official.        
	Lower costs have clinched the deal for many. Easy connectivity, relatively low tariffs in hotels and culinary attractions are the prime reasons. A tour of China costs a lot less than a trip to Europe or the US (see chart), said a tour operator.         
	We usually get five bookings a week for leisure travel in China. For the Olympics, the number has gone up to 15 a week, said Anil Punjabi, of the Travel Agents Federation of India.                     
	Tour operators are coming up with packages that club sightseeing in other parts of the country with the Olympic experience. Businessman Vijay Bhurani, who is planning a family trip to Beijing in August, is one of those who want to see more of China during the tour.               
	There are concerns about language problems, but tour operators are putting such doubts to rest, said Punjabi.               
	The airlines that operate to China foresee good business next month. quot;July and August are usually lean seasons when we get only business travellers. But the number of bookings to China has already picked up, quot; said an official of Singapore Airlines.               
	China Eastern, which launched operations between Calcutta and Kunming on October 31 last year, is making group bookings for the Olympics.         
	 quot;A group of 30 has booked on our flight and more such bulk bookings are in the pipeline, quot; said an airline official.

          ZEESHAN JAWED                            Jubo Malik: Arson cry. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                          
	Jubo Malik woke up to attend to his six-year-old son on Wednesday night when he spotted tall flames leaping out of Ram Bahadur Shaws room at 276 GT Road.        
	Only a narrow drain and a seven-ft-tall fence separate the building from the one at 272 GT Road, where Malik lives with his wife, son and daughter in a rented room.        
	Ignoring the repeated pleas of his wife, the 37-year-old climbed up the fence and rushed to the spot to try and rescue Shaw and his family members. I told my wife that if I did not take the risk, several lives would be lost, recalled the unemployed youth.        
	On approaching the inferno, the first thing Malik noticed was an LPG cylinder outside Shaws room. Moving closer, he saw a tube attached to the cylinder, its other end thrust into the room.        
	Malik immediately cut off the gas supply, wrapped himself up in a wet quilt and ran into the Shaws room.        
	When I entered, Ram Bahadurs wife Kewala Devi and daughter Deepali were rolling on the floor, the flames having engulfed them. I dragged out Deepali, who was fully burnt. I tried to enter the room a second time to rescue Kewala Devi, but could not, because of the blaze. I think she had died by the time the firemen pulled her out, said Malik.        
	The entire Kazi Para neighbourhood of Howrah is applauding Malik for his bravery, but the youth himself is ruing the loss of precious seconds in his rescue attempt.        
	Kichhui korte parlam na (I could not do anything). Had I woken up a little early, I could have saved the family. Even Deepali died this morning, said Malik. But one thing I can vouch for is that the fire was not an accident. Someone tried to finish off Ram Bahadur and his family. The LPG cylinder and the tube are evidence enough.

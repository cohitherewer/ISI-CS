                Gopal Sarkar, 8, was killed after being dashed by a private car while he was crossing Prince Anwar Shah Road at the Lake Gardens flyover intersection around 4.35pm on Friday, barely 10 metres from a police kiosk and a traffic signal. Local residents blocked the busy intersection for an hour after the accident, demanding better traffic management in the area, and causing massive traffic snarls. According to police, the victim was a ragpicker and a resident of a nearby slum. His father Samir is a rickshaw-puller, while mother Sraboni works as a domestic help. A steel-coloured Hyundai Santro with an Uttar Pradesh number plate mowed the boy down.     A 45-year-old employee of CESC, Satyanarayan Pradhan, suffered burns in a fire that broke out in the power supply station of e-Mall, at Chandni Chowk, on Friday afternoon. According to CESC officials who inspected the site, the fire broke out when Pradhan, a jointer, was connecting a new line while reorganising the electrical circuit in the 6,000-volt transformer. Pradhan was shifted to SSKM Hospital. The mall was shut for the day.     The help of a Tata 407, who is yet to be identified, was crushed under the vehicle after it overturned on the Kidderpore Road ramp of Vidyasagar Setu late on Thursday. The vehicle, laden with potatoes, hit the road divider and overturned on its left side. The driver is absconding.    Two men and two women were arrested from Sonarpur, on the southern fringes, for trafficking in women and children. Police, acting on a tip-off, conducted a raid at Arabinda Pally and picked up the four. They will be taken to the states where they sold the women and children in the name of providing them with jobs or admission to good schools.    The landlords of the Bata outlet, Bistu Basu and Prasanna Basu, on Friday lodged a complaint with Barasat police station, alleging that the outlet had not taken adequate fire-safety measures, which led to a blaze on Thursday. An official of Barasat police station said fire brigade officials, too, lodged a complaint against the owner of the Bata franchisee shop for failing to keep adequate fire-safety measures while storing combustible goods.    Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakraborti on Friday held a meeting at Lalbazar with traders of 15 markets in the Burrabazar-Posta belt, along with officials from CESC and fire department, and issued a series of directives on safety norms to avoid a repeat of the Nandaram disaster.

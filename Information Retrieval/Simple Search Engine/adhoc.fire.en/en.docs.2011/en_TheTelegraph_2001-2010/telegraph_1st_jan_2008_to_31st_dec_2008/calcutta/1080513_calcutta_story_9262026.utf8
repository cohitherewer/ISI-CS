	The detective department has asked Mafizul Haques children to state what had happened at Watgunge police station when their father was subjected to unlawful interrogation, provoking him to end his life.        
	Weve asked Haques son Riazul and daughter Nilofar to give us an account of what they saw at the police station, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	The department took over the probe into Haques death on Sunday.        
	Haque, a civic employee, killed himself on Saturday, hours after he was dragged to Watgunge police station for not returning the money he had borrowed from colleague Mahendra Mandal.        
	Sub-inspector Pranab Kumar Dey Roy allegedly allowed an interrogation, during which Mandal and his aide joined policemen in taunting Haque. The sub-inspector was suspended for not following the procedure of questioning a person at a police station.        
	Sources said eight officers of the police station, who were on duty when Haque was being questioned, are under the sleuths scanner.        
	Once Haques children identify the policemen who had abused Haque, we will interrogate them, said an officer of detective department.        
	Haques family has lodged a complaint charging Mandal, the friend who had accompanied him to the police station and a few cops with abetment to suicide.        
	On Monday, the civic authorities slapped Mandal with a showcause notice and also transferred him. He has been asked to explain why he mentioned my name at Watgunge police station, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the mayoral council member in charge of parks and gardens.

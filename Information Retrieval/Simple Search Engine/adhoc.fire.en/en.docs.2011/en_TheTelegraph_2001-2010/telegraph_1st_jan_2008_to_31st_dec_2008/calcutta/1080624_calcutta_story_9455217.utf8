                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Young Anands lock horns

	The library of South Point High School was quieter than usual on June 21, though abustle with activity. On every table, chessboards had been laid with intent young faces and timers for company.         
	The second edition of Chessmate, an inter-school chess championship, was being hosted by South Point in association with Alekhine Chess Club and as many as 29 teams from 22 schools were taking part. Each player had to play five games as per the Swiss League under Federation Internationale des Echecs rules.         
	Later, as the tabulators got busy with the scores, the team from Frank Anthony Public School started a post-mortem. Chess is not my cup of tea. Id rather stick to dance, decided Arshia Rosaleen of Class IX. But Autri Dutta and Aditya Dutta, her seniors, were happy with the experience and said they would keep playing during tiffin breaks on magnetic chess boards.        
	Suneha Acharya of Patha Bhavan had come with high hopes, having come third last year. It didnt go well today, she rued. Her friend Priyadarshini Das of Mahadevi Birla Higher Secondary School admitted being rusty, having lacked match practice for three years due to study pressures. Priyadarshinis schoolmate Kaveri Sharma was happy, having won three of her five matches. The apple of every eye, though, was Shraddha Kucheria. The Class II student of Modern High School was the youngest participant in the tournament. I won two matches, she reported, adding that she had two chess teachers.         
	When the results were announced, the loudest cheers went up for the boys champions. The home team of Dipayan Ghosh, Debarshi Mukherjee, Shirsha Ghosh and Subhajyoti Saha had won the trophy and the cash reward of Rs 6000, followed by teams from Don Bosco School, Park Circus, and St James School. Little Shraddha did a star turn too, being in the first runner-up team from Modern High School. The winners among the girls were Shrimoyee Ghosh, Debapriya Majumder and Diotima Dutta Gupta of Bidya Bharati Girls High School. We came second last year, This time we were here to win, said Diotima. They went home witha cash prize of Rs 4500. The second runner-up was St Thomas Girls High School.         
	We found a lot of our children to be associated with Alekhine Chess Club. That made us start a chess club on Saturdays. This tournament is a natural extension of that effort, said South Point High School principal Jayati Solomon. Chess helps in increasing concentration. It also teaches children to take decisions on their own, said GM Sandipan Chanda who gave away the prizes.

	For this school, a students background does not a difference make. Silver Point School, near Kasba Rathtala, integrates underprivileged students, whom it supports, with those from more fortunate backgrounds.         
	On June 16, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya inaugurated a spacious new building of the school in the presence of excited students and parents.         
	The school, that got affiliation to West Bengal Board for Secondary Education in 2001, was set up in 1998 by industrialist Pannalal Roychowdhury and his wife Bani. They envisioned it as an institution for the middle class, says headmistress Sudeshna Roychowdhury.         
	Affordable education is the mantra. Monthly fees of the school vary between Rs 125 and Rs 350 from nursery to Class X. Students whose parents are unable to support them, have had their fees halved or waived. Even their books have been supplied by the school, says teacher Supratima Banerjee.         
	The school already boasts of a wealth of talent. Sheikh Arifuddin, a Class VII student, recently came second in the finals of International Art and Crafts Competition organised by Pidilite.

	Feluda on stage   
	Charbaks stage adaptation of Satyajit Rays Apsara Theatre er Mamla revives the charm of the original thriller about the disappearance of Mohitosh, a minor actor in a professional theatre company. The play was staged in May 31 at Girish Mancha.        
	Director Sabyasachi Chakraborty brings out the indomitable investigator in the role of Feluda, played by him, while Subir Roychoudhury does a good Jatayu. The outburst of murderer Mohitosh after being unmasked by Feluda, works as a plea for the restoration of theatrical glory, the plays focus.

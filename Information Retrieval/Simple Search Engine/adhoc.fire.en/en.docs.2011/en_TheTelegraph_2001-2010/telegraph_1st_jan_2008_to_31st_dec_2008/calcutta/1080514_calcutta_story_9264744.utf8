                      Abstract expressions                    A much debated subject in the history of the visual arts, abstract art is but a blending of concept and image, a mere dissolution of form. It intends to stir feelings and emotions rather than convey them. Beyond Figuration, the ongoing group show of works, is characterised by an internalisation of external objects and images, giving a sense of art returning to its most primeval origins. Sunando Basus (a painting by him appears right) exciting expressions bear testimony to his vision of reducing art to its purest, most original state. Featuring blocks of pure colours, shapes and patterns, his paintings generate a sense of movement through time and space. In Vishal Bhands lyrical images, there is a refreshing sense of the simple joy and wonder of existence and at the same time, a frenzied energy and mysticism that elevates his paintings to a more complex, religious plane. Highly charged motifs abound in the paintings of Susmit Biswas. His unique pictorial imagery enables him to create works that are intimate, sensitive reflections of his inner vision. The minimalist compositions of Silajit Ghosh strike deeper than at the sensory level. The childlike simplicity of his works is used to address basic questions of human sensibility.

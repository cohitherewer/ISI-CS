                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Malaria in college

	The vector menace continues to hound the city campuses with resident employees of Presidency College and their family members being diagnosed with malaria. At National Medical College and Hospital, a 32-year-old Sonarpur resident died on Friday, reportedly of Japanese encephalitis.        
	Another Group D employee and his two children, who also stay in the staff quarters, are suffering from an unknown fever.         
	I have been suffering from fever since Sunday. On Thursday, my test reports confirmed that I have malaria, said Dulari Hela, a 59-year-old sweeper at Presidency College who stays on the campus. Her son Raja, 35, and nephews Rohit, 12, and Bunty, 18, who stay with her, are also afflicted with malaria.        
	About 200 workers and their families live in the six staff quarters on the college premises. Some of them alleged that the authorities had not deployed enough sweepers to clean up the compound.         
	Sanjib Ghosh, the principal, said the situation is under control and campus cleaning will be in full swing once the college re-opens on Saturday.        
	According to the workers, at least 24 people have been diagnosed with malaria on the campus since October. With the college closed, many workers and their family members have left for safer locations.        
	After two of my neighbours were diagnosed with malaria, I decided to spend this month at a relatives house in Dum Dum, said Barun Dey, whose mother works in the economics library in the college.        
	At neighbouring Hindu Hostel, at least five students are undergoing malaria treatment. Six boarders have been suffering from an unknown fever for the past three weeks.        
	Many students have gone home since proper treatment facilities dont exist, said Rahul Debnath, a second-year geology (honours) student.        
	The executive health officer of borough V, Bhaskar Bhattacharya, said: Our medical team found mosquito larvae in Hindu Hostel. A notice has been slapped on the hostel authorities asking them to take proper action.        
	Mithu Mondal, from Sonarpur, reportedly died of Japanese encephalitis at National Medical College and Hospital on Friday. A team from the School of Tropical Medicine visited the hospital and collected his blood samples. The chief medical officer (health) of South 24-Parganas said he was yet to get a confirmed report.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jewellery boom during bust
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jewellery boom during bust
  - Traditional methods and dated tools help city industry buck global trend          POULOMI BANERJEE                          A jewellery shop in Dubai. The Gulf region sources a chunk of its ornaments from Calcutta. (AFP)                                      
	The US cold may have given diamond traders and exporters in Surat and Mumbai the shiver but not many Calcutta jewellers can be caught sneezing.        
	All because the bane of not upgrading from hand-made jewellery to high-tech machine-made jewellery has become a boon in the time of downturn.        
	Calcutta jewellers mainly export to the Gulf region where hand-made jewellery is in demand and so the downturn in the US has not had a negative impact on our business. Last year, the total exports from Calcutta were worth Rs 2,000 crore, and we are looking at a growth this year, said Pankaj Parekh, the chairman (eastern region) of the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.        
	So, long branded no-changers for their use of traditional methods and dated tools, Calcutta jewellers are having the last laugh in the time of economic gloom.        
	In India we wear 22-carat gold jewellery that is hand-made. This is not in demand in the West where they prefer light 12-18 carat gold. This kind of jewellery can only be machine-made. Another advantage of machine-made jewellery is uniformity, which is also preferred in the West. With hand-made jewellery no two pieces are identical. In Calcutta, most jewellers continue making traditional hand-made jewellery, explained Parekh.         
	So, the destinations are West Asia and Southeast Asia. Some exporters who were eyeing the US market say the signals of the economic crisis were there even a year ago.        
	We export to the UK, US and the Gulf. In the past we did good business with the USA, but it started slowing down a year back. Now, of course, trade with the US has dropped by at least 50 per cent, said Ketan Doshi of Modern Impex, jewellery exporters for 20 years.         
	The meltdown comes at a time when some city jewellers were poised to shift to modern methods and go West. BC Sen Jewellers is now seeing the virtues of not going too far west.                           
	We have been exporting for many years, but it was only two years ago that we started manufacturing cast-finished diamond jewellery at our unit in Mani Kanchan in Sector V. The Gulf is the main market, but we had plans of expansion in the US. Now that is on hold, said Moumita Sen of B.C, Sen Jewellers.        
	Parekh has been forced to close down his brand Alankars high-tech manufacturing unit at Mani Kanchan. I invested Rs 3 crore in that plant and started manufacturing from January to tap the western market. By the time I was ready with my designs, the slump had set in. So I have closed that plant and we are concentrating on the traditional Gulf market, he said.        
	If the market in the Gulf market is going strong, the one in Southeast Asia is not. Our exports to Southeast Asia have been affected by the depression and the exchange fluctuation. Business has dropped by 50-60 per cent, said an official of a leading jewellery house of Calcutta.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       City lifeline for Pakistani girl 
          RITH BASU                          Wajida at BM Birla hospital                                  
	Wajida Hosain spent this Id like other kids, running around the locality and playing with friends, for the first time, thanks to free treatment at a Calcutta hospital.        
	The seven-year-old girl, from Nawabshah near Karachi underwent a surgery at Calcuttas BM Birla Heart Research Centre last month.        
	Born with a hole in her heart, Wajida used to get tired and breathless after the slightest physical effort. Because of her condition, she even had to discontinue school a few years ago.         
	I will able to go to school again, Wajida had exclaimed with tears in her eyes when she realised after the surgery that she wasnt getting tired easily anymore.         
	Within a week of reaching Pakistan, she was admitted to Almunir KG School near her home, where her sisters also study.        
	Wajida is fine now. She keeps repeating to herself that she isnt getting tired. Its as if she still cant believe it, the girls uncle, Sawan, told Metro from their Nawabshah city home, on the bank of the Indus.        
	Wajida was suffering from Cyanotic Heart Defect. Such children are also called blue babies.        
	She has a hole in her heart, because of which her lungs would receive deoxygenated blood. Consequently, the child would get tired very easily. We performed a surgery to ensure that the blood supply to the lungs improves, said Ajay Kaul, the director of cardiac surgery at the Calcutta hospital.         
	Such operations are best performed on children, he added.         
	Pakistani hospitals had quoted a price of over Rs 2 lakh, which Wajidas father Abid Hosain, who runs a PCO, could not afford. We had almost given up hope. Then a local doctor told us about BM Birlas scheme, under which children of poor families are treated free, said Sawan.        
	He could not stop thanking the city. Not only was the treatment free, we also received help from Rotary Club of Calcutta, Mahanagar. They helped Wajida and her grandparents with the passage money till New Delhi after the operation.

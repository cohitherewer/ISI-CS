                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Girl slits wrist at Presidency
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A philosophy student brooding over a tiff with her husband slit her wrist at Presidency College on Tuesday but survived the suicide attempt because some batchmates spotted her bleeding in the nick of time.        
	Arpita Bhattacharyya (name changed) would probably have bled to death had she not chosen to commit the act in a part of the college that is one of the favourite hangouts of students even after classes are over.         
	She was found sitting in a corner of the quadrangle in the main building by some students who had gone there for an adda session around 5.30pm, when the rest of the campus was almost empty.        
	Fortunately for her, the group of students who discovered her lying there with a slit wrist wasted no time in taking her to hospital, a member of the student union said.        
	Helped by the security personnel at the gate, the students took the bleeding girl to Medical College and Hospital and admitted her to the emergency ward. She needed a bandage and some medication but doctors declared her out of danger.        
	Principal Sanjib Ghosh declined comment on Arpitas suicide attempt on the college campus. It is her personal matter. I dont know the details but Ive been told she is keeping well, he said.        
	One of the students in the group that took Arpita to hospital quoted the principal as telling her classmates that they should take care of her and give her the support she needs to get through this rough patch in her life.        
	The college authorities had contemplated informing police about the suicide attempt but decided against it when Arpitas family said it was a personal matter.         
	The girls husband and parents, who reached the hospital separately after being informed about the incident, took her home when doctors said she was well and only needed rest.         
	There was no official medical report from the doctors who examined her and no complaint from anyone either, a senior officer of Jorasanko police station said. Everyone seemed to be keen to hush up the incident.        
	A classmate of Arpita said her husband admitted that they had quarrelled in the morning. He also agreed that could be the reason for her suicide attempt. Her parents indicated that their daughter was prone to suicidal behaviour.         
	Sources who know the Bhattacharyyas said Arpita had a civil marriage recently but had since stayed mostly with her parents in their Chandernagore home.        
	We didnt know she had quarrelled with her husband before coming to class on Tuesday but in hindsight, she did look distressed all day. But none of us had an inkling of what was to follow, the classmate said.        
	Another student said Arpita wasnt the type to mix with everyone and mostly kept to herself.

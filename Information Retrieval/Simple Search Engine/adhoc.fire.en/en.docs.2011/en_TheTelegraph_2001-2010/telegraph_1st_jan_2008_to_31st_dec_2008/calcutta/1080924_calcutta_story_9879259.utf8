                Calcutta High Court on Tuesday issued a contempt notice to the superintendent of SSKM Hospital and asked him to show cause why the hospital canteen was still using coal ovens, flouting court orders. On July 30, the court had ordered coal ovens to be replaced with LPG ones within seven days. The deadline was extended till August 30 after the SSKM authorities appealed on July 18 for time.    A 28-year-old employee of a leather company was arrested on Tuesday for embezzling Rs 12 lakh. After allegedly stealing the money on September 11, Mohammed Tabriz walked into Tiljala police station and said some motorcycle-borne youths had snatched the money from him on Basanti highway. The police, however, found inconsistencies in his account and contacted his head office in Chennai. The manager came to Calcutta and lodged a complaint, after which police raided Tabrizs house in Topsia on Monday night and recovered the money.     Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on Tuesday that Technicians studio would not be dismantled for now. The chief minister assured us he will look into the matter. We would all be affected if the studio is dismantled, said film-maker Rituparno Ghosh. Actor Prosenjit said they would submit another presentation before the government about their requirements after a fortnight.    Goverdhan Mehta, the chairman of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), stressed the need for restructuring the undergraduate education system in the country while addressing the annual convocation of Calcutta University on Monday. Mehta said there was a mismatch between the skills needed by employers and those taught in colleges. The council will introduce parameters to assess the services offered by colleges and universities in various fields other than education, he added.

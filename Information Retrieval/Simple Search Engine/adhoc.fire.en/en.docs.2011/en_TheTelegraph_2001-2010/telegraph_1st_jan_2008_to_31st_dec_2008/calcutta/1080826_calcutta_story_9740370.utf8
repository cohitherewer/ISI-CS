  - Dum Dum underpass to be wider and brighter        ZEESHAN JAWED                                                      
	Navigating the dark and dangerous Dum Dum underpass will be easier in a month, the rain permitting.        
	In early August, South Dum Dum Municipality took up the long overdue project of widening the footpath in the underpass, clearing its drains and installing lights. The civic body hopes to complete the work in three more weeks.         
	The move has come as a relief for the one lakh-plus people who daily use the underpass, constructed by Eastern Railway and the public works department (roads) below Circular and Metro railways tracks near Dum Dum Junction station.         
	As a result of faulty planning and negligence, the underpass has been a picture of chaos and danger. The site is low-lying, hence there is waterlogging for days even after a smart shower. The approaches on both sides are narrow, increasing the probability of accident. And there are no policemen to rein in unruly buses and autos.         
	Commuters had to make their way to Dum Dum Junction and Metro stations through a fenced footpath wide enough only for two adults. The surface, too, was uneven with interlocking tiles missing. The lights are often stolen plunging the tunnel-like underpass into pitch darkness.         
	Municipal minister Asok Bhattacharya is scheduled to visit the site on August 28 to inspect the repairs, which have been hampered by the rain. The drains have been cleared and the footpath is being widened.        
	The municipality is spending more than Rs 3 lakh on the project. Passengers who take Metro or suburban trains from Dum Dum were suffering badly, said Srihir Bhattacharya, the municipality chairman.We have levelled the surface of the elevated footpath. It is also being widened by a foot and a half so that pedestrians can walk comfortably, said an engineer of the municipality. Lights will also be installed on the stretch.        
	According to Bhattacharya, the PWD and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, responsible for maintaining the underpass, did not undertake repairs despite repeated pleas.         
	Dum Dum Eastern and Metro Railway Passengers Association has welcomed the municipalitys gesture.        
	This might not be a permanent solution but it will ease our woes to a large extent. Now the administration must ensure that hawkers dont occupy the additional space on the elevated plank, said Bikash Pramanik, a member of the association.

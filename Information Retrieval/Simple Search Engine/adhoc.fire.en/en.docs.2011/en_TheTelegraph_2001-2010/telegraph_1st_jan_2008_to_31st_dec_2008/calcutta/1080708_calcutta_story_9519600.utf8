	With mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya making legitimate space for them on the pavements of Calcutta, hawkers today have little to fear. But as they try and muscle out retail giants like RPG and Reliance, some hawkers in prime-spot Gariahat face a civil law suit from an unlikely quarter: their former comrades.        
	A battle pitting yesterdays hawkers against todays hawkers is on as owners of Shatadeep Shopping Complex  a market in Hindustan Park built by ex-hawkers  seek to evict vendors squatting at their door.        
	During the days of Operation Sunshine in 1996, 100 hawkers, driven out of the boulevard of Gol Park and Gariahat, moved to an eight-cottah plot of land at Hindustan Park and built themselves a market complex called Shatadeep. These 100 hawkers-turned-traders were the unsung heroes of Operation Sunshine, a rare example of how a group of hawkers could turn entrepreneurs and strive to be self-sufficient without getting into the way of pedestrians.        
	The market, at the end of a narrow lane, got off to a smooth start in 1998 but rehabilitation dreams soon turned sour thanks to the mayors munificence. Bhattacharyyas decision to allow hawkers back on the streets hit Shatadeep where it hurts. A group of hawkers promptly overran the Hindustan Park lane and blocked the view of the market from the main road.        
	Team Shatadeep approached the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to clear the lane, but to no avail. We had no alternative but to go to court, says Sudeb Pal, the secretary of Shatadeep.        
	A case was filed at Calcutta High Court in 2004 under the division bench of Maharaj Sinha against one Bijoy Saha of BS Sales Counter. Saha had put up shop right in front of the plot where Shatadeep was being built. He had promised to move out once the complex came up. However, later he stayed put refusing to budge and Shatadeep hawkers had to move court. The case till date has been heard only twice.

	The hawker horror at Gariahat is back with a bang as pavements are taken over by a double row of structures that sell everything from pin to porcelain forcing pedestrians onto the congested carriageway near the Gariahat four-point crossing.         
	The pavement-grab model of Gariahat is being replicated all the way to Bijon Setu on one side and Chetla on another.

	FOR: We dont want to grab pavements. Encroachment on pavements causes trouble to both pedestrians and hawkers. The mayors prescription of sharing one-third of the pavements with hawkers cannot be a solution. The government needs to create infrastructure for our resettlement, says Ashish Haldar, a fine arts graduate turned hawker of costume jewellery near Bijon Setu.                
	If it werent for hawkers, the police and the politicians would have been a far poorer lot. We provide a huge chunk of their daily income. But what worries us is that post-Operation Sunshine, they are demanding hefty sums, says Tapas Majumdar, hawking bags and purses in Gariahat.              
	AGAINST: Here at Hazra whenever the issue is raised the pavements are cleared but then they are back again in no time, says Soumi Dutta, an IBM employee living in Hazra.              
	Civic authorities are bound to offer safe passage to pedestrians. How can a mayor of Calcutta, who has a limited tenure of five years, permanently infringe upon the right of pedestrians? The city pavements are not his ancestral property, thunders Debashish Pakira, who works for Wipro, dodging hawkers near Bijon Setu.                
	Hawkers are a specially privileged group in Calcutta who are allowed to run tax-free business at prime locations, shrugs Manik Basak of Maa Durga Jewellers on Rashbehari Avenue.

										                              Students learn with non-academic tools at Akshara 		               
	Rukaiya Banu nurtures dreams of becoming a teacher. I want to spread knowledge amongst all, especially underprivileged children, she avers. Raj Sheikh wishes to reach the stars. I want to become a pilot.         
	Rukaiya and Raj are two of 80 underprivileged children who get to spend an hour every week at Akshara, an educational resource centre for primary-level learning at a school for underprivileged children. It is run by NGO Ek Prayas on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road.         
	In association with the Calcutta chapter of Young Indians (YI), a part of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Ek Prayas is reaching out to children on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and in Tangra and Topsia with non-academic ways of teaching.         
	These include building blocks, puzzles, and activity cards, which help them connect educational concepts to everyday life.         
	We want to teach them things that are beyond the curriculum. We hope that through experimental learning, where they learn through play, children will take more interest in studies, said Arvind Misra, the chairman of YI, Calcutta. The focus is on mathematics and language. We have about 48 Aksharas in 17 Indian cities, with about 11,000 children, says Misra.        
	Ek Prayas is the second Akshara in the city. The other is on the premises of the Assembly of God Church School .        
	The educational tools are so designed that they can be used as effectively by an intelligent child as by one academically weak, explains Rashmi Bhanjdeo, the founder of Ek Prayas.         
	The equipment is not limited to one age group either. A primary section student might pick up a book and follow the pictures, while a Class V student can read the story, says Bhanjdeo.         
	Funded through voluntary donations from corporate houses, YI has allotted Rs 75,000 per Akshara.         
	And their targets are not the children alone. Access to 80 children also means access to as many families. We would also like to teach them various vocational skills, he added.         
	CII-YI is also distributing de-worming tablets to families of the students through Akshara. It has also handed over 120,000 tablets to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to be distributed across its schools.         
	Special teachers have come from Bangalore to train the teachers.         
	The teachers have taken well to non-academic tools in day-to-day teaching. Students, too, learn better if they are showed a model of an object instead of a diagram, said co- founder Deepa Bagla. According to the MoU signed between Ek Prayas and CII-YI, YI will periodically assess the work done by teachers at these schools.         
	There is another Akshara in the pipeline, in association with Anglo Arabic Secondary School, on Mahatma Gandhi Road.

	CHIT CHAT        Voice of the future  
	La Martiniere School for Boys held the first panel discussion of Global Issues Forum, a platform started to provide students with an interactive space, at their auditorium on October 22.        
	The topic was Is India a failed democracy?. Moderated by journalist Kishore Bhimani, the discussion included Rajya Sabha MP Dinesh Trivedi, former director-general of police A.K. Samanta and RJ Jimmy Tangree as panelists. Other participating schools included La Martiniere for Girls, Loreto House and St James School. Bhimani spoke about the origin of democracy in Greece (when it meant the rule of the mob), through the degeneration from polity, which was the effective form of government. Samanta refuted the topic, saying: India has managed to tackle its problems better than many other countries. An audience vote was cast, where most disagreed with the topic.

  La Martiniere for Boys        Tech fest  
	College of Engineering and Management, Kolaghat, held its annual technology fest, Resonance, from October 23 to 25 at the college auditorium. Thirty two teams from various colleges participated. College of Engineering and Management, Kolaghat, came first and Bankura Unnayani Institute of Technology was the runner-up.

                      Classical tribute                    A feast of classical music is in store for city music aficionados with the city playing host to one of the most highly acclaimed classical concerts this week. Featuring 13 of Indias most renowned artistes, the four-day musical soiree beginning today, is being held in tribute to tabla legend Ustad Karamatullah Khan. One of the finest exponents of the tabla, Karamatullah Khan represented the 32nd generation in an unbroken lineage of the Farrakabad gharana, which dates back to Mir Akasa in 1132. Born in a family of musicians in 1917 in Rampur, he went on to become the court musician of the Maharaja of Raigarh. His first remarkable performance was with Ustad Bade Fiaz Khan Saheb of the Agra Gharana, for which he received the title of Ustad at a very early age. His legacy lives on through his son Ustad Sabir Khan and his grandson Arif Khan, both of whom will perform at the festival. Participants: Ayaan Ali Khan, Partho Bose and Begum Parween Sultana (today), Shujaat Khan, Rashid Khan and Satish Vyas (September 5), Chitresh Das, Ulhas Kashalkar and Hariprasad Chaurasia (September 6), Arshad Ali Khan, Sultan Khan, Taufiq Qureshi and Sabir Khan (September 7).

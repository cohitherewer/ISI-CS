                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Waste first, e-waste later
  - Talk by telecom pioneer          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sam Pitroda and Swami Prabhananda, the general secretary of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission, at Belur Math on Tuesday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Mounds of garbage dumped beside the roads struck Sam Pitroda on his visit to the city on Tuesday.        
	I saw garbage heaped along the roads almost everywhere as I was coming to attend this programme. We need to find out ways for their disposal, the National Knowledge Commission chairman said while addressing a seminar at Belur Math on Tuesday.        
	Pitroda, who revolutionised Indias telecommunication industry, made the comment when a member of the audience asked him about disposal of e-garbage.         
	We have to find suitable ways to dispose of the existing garbage before thinking about e-waste, Pitroda said.        
	The 67-year-old was the chief guest at a seminar  titled Making of a Knowledge Society  organised by the computer centre of Ramakrishna Mission Shilpamandira, a polytechnic college run by the Mission.        
	Pitroda said he was ashamed of the fact that the knowledge commissions website, which contains information about its recommendations, registered only 7,000 hits a month. New technologies should be used to bring about productivity and effectiveness in education, he said.        
	Pitroda termed the countrys education system obsolete. Until students demand the change, the vice-chancellors, principals and headmasters will not listen.        
	He wondered why cant a first-year undergraduate student in West Bengal study the second year in Karnataka and the third year in yet another state.... We need your (students) help in bringing about the change, he told the 1,000-odd students present at the seminar.        
	Pitroda later attended the All India Management Association-National Knowledge Commission seminar on Demography, Disparity, Development at Swabhumi.

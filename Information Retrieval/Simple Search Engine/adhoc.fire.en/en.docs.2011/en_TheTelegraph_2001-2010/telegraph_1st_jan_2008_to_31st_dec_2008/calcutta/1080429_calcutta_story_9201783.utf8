The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water from Orissa, ACs for lights
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Water from Orissa, ACs for lights
  - Fingers crossed on Eden arrangement         A STAFF REPORTER                                                   
	The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), police and the state government have taken a series of steps to prevent a rerun of the April 20 fiasco at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. Metro ran a check on the eve of the Knight Riders-Mumbai Indians match:  
	Lights  
	What we saw: Two air-conditioners, connected to a UPS, have been installed in the control room of each of the four light towers, following the suggestion of a panel of engineers of CESC, Philips and government agencies.        
	Large generators have been obtained to ensure continuous power supply to the stands.        
	CAB officials said 30 security guards had been deployed to prevent theft of cables.        
	Reality check: Two air-conditioners in a control room are not enough. The chokes fitted to the 215 lamps on a tower can become so hot that they cannot be touched, said an electrician working at the Eden.  
	Water  
	What we saw: The panel had called for easy availability of water pouches in the stands and continuous supply from the overhead tanks.         
	Besides, the Club House should be kept supplied with water and glasses. The tanks have been installed and atop each tap is a steel glass tied with a steel chain.        
	Police said 300,000 water pouches were on the way from Bhubaneswar. The water dispensers in the Club House had not been set up till evening.        
	Reality check: The last consignment of water pouches had not reached till late on Monday. The real test will be when 80,000 people start asking for water, said a CAB official.  
	Giant screen and scoreboard  
	What we saw: The electronic scoreboard was working. Engineers from Chennai said they had installed capacitors to shield the scoreboard from voltage fluctuations. A giant screen has been set up above D1 block. Engineers were installing another screen above J block.        
	Reality check: Another round of cable theft may render the screens useless on match night, said a CAB official.  
	Special trains  
	Metro Railway will run trains every 20 minutes from Esplanade to Tollygunge and Dum Dum from 11pm till midnight on Tuesday.         
	Tickets will be available only at Esplanade, Chandni Chowk and Park Street stations.        
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty has promised that state buses will be available outside the stadium.        
	Five special trains will run on the Circular Railway section in addition to three local trains on the Southeastern section, from Howrah.

	A woman in her early 30s was beaten up and handed over to police by residents of the Motijheel area in Entally after she tried to kidnap a baby girl on Monday morning.        
	Rekha Koley, of Chanditala in Hooghly, tried to run away with two-year-old Ayesha Siddique, who was playing outside her house in Corbett Lane, around 10am.        
	Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said cops were trying to ascertain whether Rekha was mentally unstable.        
	I was sitting in front of my house and saw the woman trying to lift Ayesha and take her away. I immediately raised an alarm. Some of our neighbours ran and caught hold of the woman, said Ayeshas father, Mohammed Siddique, who works in a shoe-manufacturing unit.        
	The police said Rekha, who was separated from her husband four years back, has a six-year-old daughter.         
	She lives with her sisters, said Goyal. Her family suspects she is suffering from some mental illness.        
	Rekha will be produced in court on Tuesday. It is up to the judge to decide whether she will be sent to hospital, said a police officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Jewelleryshop burgled
                                                                                                            Jewellery shop burgled
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A gang of burglars decamped with gold worth more than Rs 2 lakh from a jewellery shop in Barisha on Saturday night.         
	The burglars opened the gates of the shop with keys and pulled down the shutter before fleeing, said police.        
	Sisir Majumdar, the owner of the shop, said he had closed it around 10pm as usual. I checked all the locks before leaving. I keep the keys in a safe place in my residence and do not have a spare set.        
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said the modus operandi suggested that local criminals were behind the burglary.        
	The burglars must have prepared for the past few days. They probably collected the impressions of the keyholes to make duplicate keys, said an officer of Behala police station.        
	Local residents held a demonstration in front of the police station, alleging that poor surveillance was responsible for the burglary.         
	They alleged that policemen on patrol at night are busy extorting the drivers of vehicles plying on Diamond Harbour Road.

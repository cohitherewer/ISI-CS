                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Docs strike, govt studies

	Under law  and the ethics they are expected to follow  doctors cannot strike work. But around 1,000 junior doctors stayed away from their duties on Monday in two of Calcuttas largest hospitals, inconveniencing thousands of patients.        
	Yet the government and the authorities of SSKM Hospital and Medical College and Hospital have allowed the strike to linger.        
	The director of medical education (DME) announced that it had formed a three-member committee to study the doctors demand for an increase in the stipend from Rs 8,800 at the highest level to Rs 18,800.        
	The striking doctors, among them postgraduate students, house staff and interns, have dismissed the formation of the committee as a solution. Ashutosh Mukherjee, a junior doctor at SSKM, said: We know from experience such committees are nothing but eyewash. We dont want committees, we want a written government order agreeing to our demand.        
	S.N. Banerjee, the DME, said that the stipend, which even some in authority concede is abysmally low, would be increased from September 1 once the committees recommendations came in.        
	Why is the government then not taking action against the doctors, who, being a part of essential services, cannot legally strike work?        
	Health minister Surjyakanta Mishra made it clear that the government was not looking at the option of declaring the strike illegal.        
	It is a question of their career. They are missing classes and I appeal them to stop the ceasework and join classes immediately. They should not force the government to take any action, he said.         
	However, we dont want any confrontation with the students.        
	In the extreme case, the government is free to invoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act but, given Mishras comment, unlikely to.        
	Under a Supreme Court ruling, employees in public services cannot strike work without 30 days notice without inviting prosecution and termination of service.         
	Last year, doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences had called off their strike after Delhi High Court ruled that their salaries should be deducted and licences cancelled.         
	In the hospitals, at least 15 scheduled surgeries had to be cancelled and patients in emergency departments lay unattended for hours.        
	Shikha Sadhukhan, who was to be admitted on Monday in the nephrology department at SSKM, arrived at 7 in the morning and was lying in the passage leading to Emergency until 3pm, crying in pain.        
	At Medical College, Mrityunjay Sengupta, a physically challenged youth who suffered a head injury when his specially made tricycle was hit by a bike on Sunday night, was waiting till 4pm on Monday to be admitted. A hospital employee was kind enough to advise his brother to take the patient to some other hospital.

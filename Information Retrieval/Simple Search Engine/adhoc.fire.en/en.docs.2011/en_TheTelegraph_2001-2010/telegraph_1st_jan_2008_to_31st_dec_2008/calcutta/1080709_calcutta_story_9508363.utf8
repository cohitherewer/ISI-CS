          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, has seen record enrolment of overseas students in its flagship postgraduate programme this academic year.        
	The institute, which usually had three to four overseas students in each batch, has enrolled 14 NRI and foreign students in the batch that joined in June.        
	We have always had some overseas students, but they were very few in number. This is a record high despite having increased our fees to $20,000, said Ashish Bhattacharyya, an economics teacher at the IIM.        
	Not just the Joka institute. The footfall of foreign students in other city campuses, too, is on the rise. Calcutta and Jadavpur universities have seen a rise in the number of foreign students enrolling for both long and short-term courses.        
	There has been an increase in the number of foreign students on our campus over the past two years, said Partha Pratim Biswas, a member of Jadavpur Universitys executive council.        
	The system of the outward transfer of credit has helped JU attract more foreign students, who can study a semester here and the credits earned will be transferred to the home institutes on their return.        
	Before the introduction of the credit transfer, foreign students at JU only attended short-term courses, workshops, seminars and various exchange programme courses.        
	The university now has more than 30 full-time students from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Italy, enrolled in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses in science, arts and engineering.        
	Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) now has around 90 foreign students enrolled in postgraduate, undergraduate and doctoral programmes.        
	Our fine arts and visual arts courses are popular with foreign students. Individual mentoring of students is another reason why they prefer coming here, said RBU vice-chancellor Karunasingha Das.        
	Most foreign students in RBU are from Saarc countries and Thailand, Japan and Korea. A few are from Italy, Turkey and Romania.        
	Calcutta University has foreign students coming to attend workshops and seminars. Last year, the university signed an MoU with Italian universities with which they are running joint and exchange programmes.        
	CU recently altered its admission rules to facilitate direct admission of students from foreign boards to its affiliated colleges.

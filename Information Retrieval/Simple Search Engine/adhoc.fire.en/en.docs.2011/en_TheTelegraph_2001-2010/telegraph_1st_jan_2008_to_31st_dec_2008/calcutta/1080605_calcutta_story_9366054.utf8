          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Thousands of people had to bear the brunt of a Trinamul Congress roadblock on Howrah bridge on Wednesday afternoon.        
	Queues of vehicles extended to the district magistrates office on the Howrah side and to the city centre in Calcutta as 150 supporters of the party held up traffic on the bridge from 4.45pm to 5pm to protest the hike in petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices.        
	Hundreds of people were forced to get off buses and taxis and run towards the Howrah station to catch their trains.        
	Saumitra Mukherjee, an employee of Punjab National Bank, said: I have to take the 5.10pm local to Bagnan. But I dont know how I will reach the station, with road blocked.        
	The Rajdhani Express was scheduled to leave Howrah station at 4.55pm. Dipak Kumar Jha, the chief public relations officer of Eastern Railway, said: I have no knowledge of any passenger missing the Rajdhani because of arriving late.        
	The agitators were led by Arup Roy, the district president of Trinamul. He said: I am sure people gladly put up with such a minor inconvenience. We are blocking roads in the interest of the people. Hike in the prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas will lead to manifold increase in prices of essential commodities.        
	Trinamul supporters also blocked roads in several places in North and South 24-Parganas. Severe traffic disruption was reported in Lake Town, Sinthee, Barrackpore, Alipore and Baruipur.

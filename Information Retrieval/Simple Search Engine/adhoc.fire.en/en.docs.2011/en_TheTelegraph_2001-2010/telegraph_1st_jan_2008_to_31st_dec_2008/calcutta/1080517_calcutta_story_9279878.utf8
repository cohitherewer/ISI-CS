The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Caught unawares by sudden rule change
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Caught unawares by sudden rule change
										                              WHERE NOW? A girl waits outside SSKM Hospital with her bewildered parents, who were not aware of the one-way rule shift that denied them transport from the hospital gates. Picture by Aranya Sen				                           
	The sudden revision of one-way timings by Calcutta police continued to create chaos on the roads on Friday.        
	Patients at the outdoor department of SSKM Hospital had to walk a long way to take a bus home, while some had to pull their two-wheelers along, instead of riding them. Those headed the wrong way, unaware of the change in rules, had to face problems.         
	Deputy commissioner (traffic) Manoj Verma claimed that traffic movement was smooth. There were minor hitches but motorists will soon get used to the new rules.        
	Metro, however, saw more than minor hitches on the roads.                
	Where: Harish Mukherjee Road        
	When: 1.05pm        
	What we saw: Sandhya Ghosh stood perplexed after escorting her aged and ailing mother out of SSKM Hospital: the buses were going towards the JL Nehru Road-AJC Bose Road crossing. I come here with my mother every week for her check-up. We take a bus from Harish Mukherjee Road to Howrah. Today, suddenly, the buses are moving in the opposite direction. I dont know how to find a bus home, said Sandhya.        
	She and her mother, suffering from a heart problem, had to walk half a kilometre in the searing heat to catch a bus.                 
	Where:AJC Bose Road crossing        
	When: 1pm        
	What we saw: As soon as the clock struck one, the traffic cops at the intersection started diverting the vehicles. Many got down from taxis and walked to their destinations.                  
	I was near Shiraz when the police started diverting the vehicles. I have to go to Allenby House, on Park Street. Had I reached the crossing five minutes earlier, I would not have had to get off the taxi. Instead of making a two-km detour, I will walk to Park Street, said S.K. Sengupta, a senior citizen (picture right by Pradip Sanyal).                 
	Where: Park Street-Rawdon Street crossing         
	When: 1.30pm        
	What we saw: Two no-entry boards were facing opposite directions  one pointing towards vehicles moving from Rawdon Street to Park Street, the other towards vehicles on Park Street. The motorists didnt know which way to go and there wasnt a cop in sight to clear the confusion.                 
	Where:Park Street        
	When: 1.45pm                  
	What we saw: Many were pulling their two-wheelers down Park Street instead of riding them. They had reached the AJC Bose Road-Park Street crossing and learnt that the one-way timings on Park Street have been revised (picture left by Pradip Sanyal).        
	Had I known I would have taken JL Nehru Road. This is harassment, said Hari Rajan, walking his motorcycle.                
	Where:JL Nehru Road-AJC Bose Road crossing        
	When: 1.30pm        
	What we saw: The buses started moving in the opposite direction after 1pm. Those travelling towards Nandan or SSKM from Beckbagan had got off their buses and were walking the rest of the way.

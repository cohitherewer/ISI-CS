                      Cause and effect                    A student performance group started by Safdar Rahman and Anubrata Basu, Playhouse presents its maiden theatrical production Boomerang. Its cast comprises entirely of students of several schools of the city (including St James School, Modern High School for Girls, La Martiniere for Boys, La Martiniere for Girls, Loreto House and St Xaviers Collegiate School) who have collectively collaborated on this project. The play introduces us to familiar and unfamiliar sights and sounds and, in the process, makes us aware of certain changes in society and also to our inner selves. It does not deliver a diktat or try to instigate a revolution. Rather, it shows how we are affected by pop culture on a daily basis. The play is not just about being opinionated; it is about identifying prejudices. Instead of presenting a disturbed kaleidoscope, it offers a collage of social conditioning. It does, however, give expression to irrelevant codes of conduct and, most importantly, to fantasies and hidden facets of a human being.                  Event: Play in English, Boomerang, produced by Playhouse When: Today at 7 pm Where: Gyan Manch, 11 Pretoria Street

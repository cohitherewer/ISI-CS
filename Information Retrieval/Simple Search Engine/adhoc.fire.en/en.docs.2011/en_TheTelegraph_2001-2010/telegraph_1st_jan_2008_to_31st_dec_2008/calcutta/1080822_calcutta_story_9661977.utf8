The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Comrades take over school
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Comrades take over school

	A school building in Beniapukur has been turned into a party office by comrades, forcing students to sit cheek-by-jowl in cramped classrooms.         
	The CPM uses the 100-year-old minority educational institution at 3 Anjuman Lane for holding meetings of its local committee and the slum federation. Such meetings are often held during school hours.        
	Two government-recognised madarsas  Beniapukur High Madarsa and Tanti Bagh Girls High Madarsa  are housed in the three-storeyed building that has 12 rooms. A primary school  Beniapukur Primary School  also operates out of the ground floor.        
	More than 800 students study in the three schools. Sometimes, 100-150 people attend the meetings, forcing us to vacate two or more classrooms. We have to squeeze over 70 kids into each class, said a teacher of the girls section.        
	The school authorities, however, plead helplessness. The teachers are too scared to complain against the party cadres, but some spoke to Metro on condition of anonymity. Their terror is such that whenever they want to hold a meeting or a programme here, the authorities have to relent, said a teacher.         
	Last week, the local committee of the DYFI held a meeting in the school over three days, occupying the entire ground floor. Almost every month there is a big meeting of the CPMs local committee.        
	Using their clout with the civic body, the cadres have installed lights on every floor of the building. The walls are plastered with party pamphlets. Imagine, how such activities can affect the young minds, said a teacher of the primary section.        
	Local CPM councillor Manzar Ahsan admitted that the school is used by the people for holding meetings. The school administration is informed beforehand about the meetings. I have arranged for lights inside the building and also had the washrooms repaired, he said.        
	The minister in charge of minority welfare and Madarsa Board, Abdus Sattar, said he had no information of his party men using a school as their office. Once I receive a complaint, I will investigate the matter, Sattar said.

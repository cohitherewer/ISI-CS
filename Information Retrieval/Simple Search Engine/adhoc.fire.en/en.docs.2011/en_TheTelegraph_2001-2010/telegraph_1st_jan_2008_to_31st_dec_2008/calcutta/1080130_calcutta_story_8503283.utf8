             THE PITS: Deep craters have been dug into Park Circus Maidan to erect lamp posts and the Book Fair stall structures. The high court has ordered restoration of the greens within 10 days. But experts are of the opinion that even a quick fix will take considerably longer  a month, at least. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya 
                 
	The high court has given the Publishers and Booksellers Guild marching orders from Park Circus Maidan, but it will be some time before budding cricketer Shah Alam and his friends take guard on the greens. 
    
	The court on Monday directed the guild to restore the ground to its original state within 10 days, but that appears a tall order. On Tuesday afternoon, Metro found labourers busy dismantling the framework of the stalls that the publishers had been erecting on Park Circus Maidan. 
    
	The ground  dug up to erect lamp posts, lay power lines and put up the stalls  was in poor shape. With mud all around and large holes filled with water, it resembled the bed of a pond that had dried up. 
    
	According to experts, the harm done to the surface cannot be undone in 10 days. Even a quick fix will take more than 10 days. The ground will take three to four weeks to heal naturally. That, too, would require supervision, said Somnath Mukherjee, the deputy conservator of forests (urban forestry division).
    
	The soil that had been dug up has become damp after a spell of rain last week. It must be allowed to dry before the craters are filled up, added Mukherjee.
    
	Which means, nine-year-old Shah Alam, a Park Circus resident, will have to wait at least a month to enjoy a game. We were very happy when we heard that the fair will not be held on Park Circus Maidan. My friends and I today carried our kit to the ground but no one can play on such an uneven surface, said the despondent boy. 
    
	The members of the Darga Road Citizens Committee  one of the organisations on whose petitions the Monday order was passed  are worried about the condition of Park Circus Maidan. It is the only open space in a congested zone. We fought a legal battle to save it and now we want it restored to its original state, said Kalyan Saha, the secretary of the committee. 
    
	For the labourers, however, the primary concern is dismantling the structures that had been put up as soon as possible. The guild has asked us to wrap up the work within the next three to four days. We have employed 15 extra labourers today to remove the remnants of the stalls to our godowns, said Naba Kumar, a contractor employed by the guild.

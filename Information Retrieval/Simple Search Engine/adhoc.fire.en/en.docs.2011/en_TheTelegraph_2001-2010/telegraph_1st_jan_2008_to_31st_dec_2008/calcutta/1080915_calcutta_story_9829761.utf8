          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The state governments chief legal advisor has contested the transport secretarys submission in the high court that his department could not tackle the citys air pollution at night because of lack of infrastructure.        
	A department should not say that his government is not capable enough to solve a problem. When a problem is there, the government has to solve it, advocate-general Balai Ray told the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Maharaja Sinha on Friday.        
	Rays assertion prompted the bench to ask the government to state in an affidavit the action it proposes to take to fight pollution caused by goods carriers entering the city at night.        
	Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury had informed the court through an affidavit that the government did not have adequate infrastructure to check night pollution.        
	Ray told the court on Friday that he wanted to file a fresh affidavit, which would mention how our government will solve the problem.        
	Chowdhurys affidavit blamed the spurt in the air pollution at night on the unrestricted entry of goods carriers into the city between 10pm and 8am.        
	Only eight inspectors are deployed to check the pollution caused by heavy vehicles at night. How can the problem be solved? Chowdhury asked, requesting the court to pass an order forcing the government to take steps to bring down the night pollution.        
	The issue first came under the high court scanner in 2005, when green activist Subhas Dutta sought a curb on the entry of goods vehicles at night.         
	Even Victoria Memorial Hall is not spared pollution at night, he stated.

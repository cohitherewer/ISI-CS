You are an independent spirit though you tend to be domineering at times. You do not like formalities. Once you are motivated into doing something, your dedication is unparalleled. You may inherit wealth but be wary of your fondness for gambling. Solving riddles is your favourite pastime. You are always ready for action. You are good at everyday work.

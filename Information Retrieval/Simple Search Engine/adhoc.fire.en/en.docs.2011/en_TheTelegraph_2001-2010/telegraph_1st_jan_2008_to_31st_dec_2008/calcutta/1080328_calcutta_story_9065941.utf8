The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | All for annual test in winter
                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      All for annual test in winter
          Todays question: Would you prefer a return to the January-December schedule in schools?                                                      
	S.K. Bedajna, 
  KB Sarani        
	Yes. The system was implemented on the basis of well-considered opinions of the time but was mindlessly changed to match the all-India trend. Our weather pattern is such that the earlier system would keep students fit during their exams.       
	Kaberi Mukherjee, 
  Santosh Ray Road									      
	The January-December session will be a welcome change. Students will feel nice to start the new year with new books. It will relieve the stress of teachers also since March-April is the time for secondary and HS exams. Besides invigilation duties, the teachers also have to check the answer scripts. They have to attend the Board and Council meetings. So teachers can hardly enjoy Chaitra sale and Poila Baisakh due to the time crunch.

	Most guardians as well as students support a return to the January-December schedule. Students can start attending a new class in the new year with fresh minds. Having annual exams at the beginning of the year is never a good feeling. Planning year-end vacations also becomes a headache for parents.               
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia        
	Absolutely. Students will find it easier to sit for examinations in the cold and comfortable weather.              
	Suyesha Kanungoe, 
  Kalighat Road         
	Yes. There will be more time to teach. Students will also get enough time to prepare during the summer vacation. In the April-May session, they hardly utilise the summer holidays, as little or no part of the syllabus is covered in schools then. Besides, December is the ideal month to hold the annual exams in as children dont fall ill then.              
	P. Pramanik, 
  Santoshpur Avenue         
	A session starting from January is ideal for both students and their parents. The students get three months to prepare for Madhyamik and Higher Secondary exams. While the parents can avail of annual leave to go on vacation with the children free from anxieties of exams, the students on the other hand can attend and participate in cultural activities which are normally held in winter.               
	D. Mukherjee, 
  Behala         
	Yes. It would ensure beginning of studies from the start of the new year. The May to April session normally leads to wastage of almost a month and a half as classes start once the schools reopen after the summer vacations. The summer and puja vacations can be utilised by students to prepare for exams. But if the session starts from January, Madhyamik and Plus II examinations should be completed by January. Admission tests for professional courses like JEE are held in April. So the Board results must be out by March or early-April.               
	Diptimoy Ghosh, 
  Salt Lake        
	When I was a student in the mid 50s-60s, the January-December schedule allowed us to both play and study at the right time. Both half-yearly and annual exams were held in such a season when we could prepare ourselves comfortably besides enjoying the Puja, summer and Christmas holidays. Moreover, it was convenient to count school days that tallied with the calender year.               
	Pooja Agarwal, 
  Burrabazar         
	I dont agree with a return to the January-December schedule. Students are used to taking their exams in March. A change would disturb their mental set-up.               
	Ratan Kumar Halder,
  Behala        
	I think the January-December schedule may put extra pressure on students since the final exam has to be conducted in November. Students will hardly be able to concentrate and prepare for the finals after the Pujas. Besides, they will have to wait to get admission in colleges that follow the June-May session.               
	Pankaj Poddar, 
  Salt Lake        
	Let there be voting on the school and college campus over this.               
	Nidhi Poddar, 
  Salt Lake        
	Examinations are not a merry-go-round. Why should there be such a change?               
	Debasish Chakraborty,
  Nilmoni Mitra Row         
	Definitely yes. It could be better for students.               
	Amaresh Paul, 
  Bandel         
	The Madhyamik Board stipulates that the maximum number of holidays in schools should not exceed 80 days (excluding Sundays). This is practically impossible for schools that hold Board exams. The number of holidays must be reduced if the old schedule returns.               
	Atif Ayaz, 
  Serampore         
	New class, new dresses and new books would be a new year bonanza for students. If the session starts from January then they will cover some part of their syllabus before summer vacation in school. During the vacation they will get time to brush that up.               
	Sachindra Nath Mitra, 
  Beleghata        
	Yes. This will protect students rights also.               
	Manashi Chakraborty, 
  Golf Green         
	No. I remember how as a student I could not enjoy the Puja vacations due to the impending annual exams. And after the vacations, local clubs organised soirees with blaring microphones, making it difficult to study.

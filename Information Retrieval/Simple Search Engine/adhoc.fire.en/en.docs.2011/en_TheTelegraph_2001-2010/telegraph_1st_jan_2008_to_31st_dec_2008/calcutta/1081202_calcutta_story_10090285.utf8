The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rajarhat plots only on paper
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rajarhat plots only on paper
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sold on the dream of living in a world-class township, 58-year-old Shyamali Bhattacharya needed no prodding to buy a plot in Rajarhat. That was in 2002.         
	Six years on, Bhattacharya doesnt know which is the plot she paid for.        
	She isnt the only one. More than 400 landowners of Rajarhat Action Area II have no idea where their land is despite having paid the West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) for these plots six years ago.        
	Five others and I formed a co-operative society and paid Hidco. My share was Rs 2.3 lakh. Hidco allotted us plot AE 131 but we dont even know where it is located, Bhattacharya told Metro.         
	Hidco officials cited land-acquisition problems and the delay in landfilling as the reasons for not handing over plots to their owners.        
	We had procured soil from the southern part of the North 24-Parganas for Rajarhat Action Area I. For Action Area II, we had planned to bring soil from the northern part of the district but brick kiln owners in the area are refusing to let us do so, an official said.        
	Drains will be constructed and water pipelines laid only after landfilling is over. That would take at least another year and a half, a field engineer said.         
	The landowners are tired of waiting. Every time I meet the Hidco authorities, they promise to show me my plot in a few months. I have been waiting for over five years, said a banker who didnt wish to be named. I am not even sure about the transport and other facilities in the area where I intend to build my dream home.

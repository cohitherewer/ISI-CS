The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Failsafe arm around Eden
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Failsafe arm around Eden

	The inquiry committee on Sundays Eden blackout has concentrated on making sure the next match on April 29 goes off smoothly instead of trying to find someone to hang.        
	A string of government and private agencies is coming together to put in place preventive steps suggested by the experts.        
	Home secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti said on Thursday the team was still to arrive at any specific conclusion on who was responsible for the power failure. He added that all the possibilities had been discussed before reaching a consensus on the arrangements for the Kolkata Knight Riders next match.         
	There will be no written report on what went wrong on Sunday, Chakrabarti said. We have discussed the issues among ourselves.         
	A few hours before this, Eden Gardens saw violent protests from cricket fans who questioned how the low-priced tickets for the match against Sachin Tendulkars Mumbai Indians were all sold out within half an hour of the counters opening.        
	The Cricket Association of Bengal dismissed allegations of black marketing.        
	Chakrabarti said: The chief secretary met all the agencies concerned and following the discussion, it was decided that all the precautions suggested by the committee would have to be put in place by Friday.         
	The committees recommendations include dedicated feeder lines to supply power to the floodlight towers, air conditioning the control rooms from where the towers are operated and manning by skilled personnel.        
	It has also been decided that the chokes of all the bulbs on the towers will be replaced, the earthing set right and all loose wires removed.        
	As the generals vowed to keep the toilets and drinking water taps running, the foot soldiers operating the towers wondered what to do with the leaking roofs of the control rooms.        
	So, all may not yet be right at the Eden, but those worrying about getting home after the late finish of the match can expect to be greeted with waiting buses.

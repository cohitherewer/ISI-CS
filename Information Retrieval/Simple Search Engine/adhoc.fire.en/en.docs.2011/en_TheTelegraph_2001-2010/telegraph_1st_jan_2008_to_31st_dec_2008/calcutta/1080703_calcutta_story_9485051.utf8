The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road refresher course for cop drivers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Road refresher course for cop drivers
  - Traffic department practises what it is preaching          PRONAB MONDAL                          The traffic department of Calcutta police is training its drivers to obey basic road rules. A Telegraph picture                                         
	Flooded with complaints about police drivers being among the most reckless, the traffic department is putting them through a refresher course to drive home the point that the rules of the road are the same for everyone.        
	Drivers of government vehicles could be trained next as part of the campaign for safer city roads.        
	The move to train our drivers was initiated after we found them violating traffic norms. Besides, we received calls from people who have witnessed rash driving by police drivers, deputy commissioner (traffic) Manoj Verma said.        
	Batches of 50 drivers each are being taught safe-driving skills and reminded about basic road rules at the Traffic Training School since Monday. It will continue till Sunday.        
	We need to change their mindset. They know traffic norms but do not follow them. Our aim is to make them understand that no one is above the law, Verma said.        
	The police department owns nearly 3,000 vehicles and hires around 200 for sundry assignments. In the past six months, police vehicles have been involved in three accidents in the city. But there are no records of police vehicles being booked for violating traffic rules.         
	Traffic personnel do not book police vehicles and drivers even though they spot them jumping signals or driving recklessly. That fuels their tendency of not following traffic rules, said an officer of the traffic department.        
	Drivers of requisitioned vehicles are said to be the worst offenders. They become excited on getting the opportunity to drive a car that carries a windscreen plate with Police written on it, the officer said.        
	The traffic department intends to conduct a similar programme for drivers of government vehicles after training its own drivers. Almost 4,000 government vehicles and more than 300 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation ply on city roads every day. But it will take us time to cover all drivers of government vehicles. If we can make them follow rules, the incidence of rash driving can be brought down, another senior police officer said.         
	The police have invited drivers of private cars to participate in the training sessions that are under way. If the rule book is to be followed, drivers who are booked for reckless driving have to attend such a training session to get back their driving licences, the officer said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rail yard theft of liquid gold
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rail yard theft of liquid gold
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Gangs of thieves who would earlier target rail wagons carrying cement and iron rods have shifted their attention to mustard oil, currently liquid gold in the inflation-hit food market.         
	Howrah police caught three men emptying cans of mustard oil into large drums after stopping four trucks that were taking the consignment from the Shalimar rail yard to a warehouse at Ramkrishnapur, near New Foreshore Road, on Thursday night.         
	The other members of the gang fled, leaving behind the drums. The theft was being attempted on a stretch of road under Vidyasagar Setu that leads to the rail yard.         
	As many as 39 wagons of mustard oil, which used to cost Rs 60-65 a litre six months ago but is now priced at Rs 80-85, had arrived at Shalimar from Sriganganagar, in Gujarat, around 9.15am on Thursday. Every wagon contained 3,600 cans of mustard oil, each weighing 15kg.         
	Police officials said the wagons brought four truckloads of oil in excess of the quantity that the consignee had ordered.         
	The drivers of the trucks that were taking the extra oil to the warehouse stopped the vehicles at a desolate spot to help the thieves, they said.         
	All four drivers are absconding. The arrested thieves were produced in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Howrah, on Friday and remanded in police custody for five days.         
	Howrah superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said mustard oil had been stolen earlier from a South Eastern Railway godown. Last month, a truckload of mustard oil that had been smuggled out of the Shalimar rail yard was intercepted by the police at Uttarpara, in Hooghly.         
	Birendra Singh, the secretary of the Shalimar Lorry and Tempo Owners Association, said: Earlier, thieves stole cement, iron rods and other commodities. In the past year, after prices of edible oils went up, they have been concentrating on stealing mustard oil.

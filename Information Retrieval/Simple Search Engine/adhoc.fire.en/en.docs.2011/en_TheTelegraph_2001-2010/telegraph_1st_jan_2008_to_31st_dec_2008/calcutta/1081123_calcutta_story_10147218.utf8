Geonkhali
										                                          Located in the Mahisadal Block of East Midnapore district, Geonkhali is a stones throw from Gadiara and Nurpur, where three rivers meet. The confluence of the Hooghly, Rupnarayan and Damodar gives the place the look and feel of the seaside.         
	Regular launch services are available from Nurpur to Geonkhali and Gadiara.         
	The boat ride from Nurpur to Geonkhali is beautiful. Everywhere there is a vast expanse of water. The banks are dotted with babul and coconut trees. You can spot local fishermen on their small boats, waiting for a catch of hilsa, pabda, parshe or bhetki.         
	Geonkhali is a picturesque place. A flotilla of country boats stands along the banks, giving the place an old-world charm. The blue horizon touches the coastline, almost like a watercolour painting.         
	One can stay at the bungalow of the state irrigation department in Geonkhali, which is located right on the bank of the Hooghly.         
	The way to the bungalow from the riverfront is lined with a green cover of sirish, babla, akashmoni and mango trees. The balcony of the bunglow offers a majestic view of the river.        
	Seagulls, cranes and various other types of birds can be seen at the riverfront. River cruises can be easily arranged on country boats for a small amount.        
	In the evening, a cool breeze blows from the river. Dusk approaches slowly over Geonkhali, painting a breathtaking view of the river.         
	Nearby is the Mahisadal palace. There are regular bus and autorickshaw services to Mahisadal. One can also visit the Radha Krishna temple in Mahisadal.

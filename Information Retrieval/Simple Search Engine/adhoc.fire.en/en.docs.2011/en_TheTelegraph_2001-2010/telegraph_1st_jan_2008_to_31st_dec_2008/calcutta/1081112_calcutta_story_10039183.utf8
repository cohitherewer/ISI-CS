The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Frankfurt rolls out red carpet
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Frankfurt rolls out red carpet

	Frankfurt, the commercial capital of Germany, is rolling out the red carpet to tourists in India, with a sharp focus on Calcutta and the Northeast through a roadshow plan and networking with tour operators.        
	We are trying to get rid of our image as an out-and-out commerce place where you come only on business trips. We have put in place a fresh campaign to promote Frankfurt as a complete tourist destination, and Calcutta will be one of our focus metros in India, Jasmin Bischoff, the head of marketing, (overseas), Tourismus+Congress GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, told Metro in Frankfurt.        
	The tourism department has drawn up a multi-pronged communication strategy targeted at Indians, with a stress on softer elements. For instance, Frankfurt has its share of fairs and open-air events, like the Spring Dippemess, a folk-fair with high-tech rides and the Opernplatz Summer Festival, with food and live performances as the main draw.        
	Our market research shows Calcuttans will be drawn to the Museum Embankment Festival in August, an art and culture festival on both sides of the Main river, and also the traditional Christmas Market held in Frankfurts city centre, said Bischoff.        
	The museum district across the Main houses the Museum of Communication and the German Architecture Museum, built in 1912, among others. The Tourismus+Congress GmbH is also highlighting the parks and gardens in the city as another tourist touch-point.        
	The Botanical Gardens, in the heart of downtown Frankfurt, the Zoological Gardens, the Gruneburgpark, the citys largest public parklands or the Bethmannpark, once the private garden of the Bethmann family, the founders of Frankfurts oldest bank, are being included in the campaign.        
	This will provide a huge boost to the travel trade here, as we get to sell a fresh European destination at a time when tourists from Calcutta are scouting for new places, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India.

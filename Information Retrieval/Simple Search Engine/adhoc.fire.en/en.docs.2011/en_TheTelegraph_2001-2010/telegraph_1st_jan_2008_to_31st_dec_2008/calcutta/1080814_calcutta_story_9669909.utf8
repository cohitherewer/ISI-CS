          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has written to the high court administration asking for immediate settlement of a dispute relating to the construction of a water treatment plant near the Bypass.        
	The project could not be started because of a PIL filed by the People United of Better Living in Calcutta in 2006. Alleging that the proposed plant would violate the Wetlands Management Act, the organisation wants the project to be scrapped. The courts decision is pending.        
	We have assured the court that the 20 acres allotted for the project are owned by the CMC. Five acres will be used to set up the plant and the rest will be turned into water bodies or gardens, said Alok Ghosh, the lawyer representing the civic body.        
	The project, according to an agreement between the CMC and the Centre, has to be completed by June 2009. Of the estimated project cost of Rs 90 crore, the Centre had allotted Rs 18 crore in 2006, the CMC said in its letter.        
	The civic authorities fear that the delay might prompt the Centre to ask for the return of the funds.        
	A month ago, the court had asked the CMC to file an environment impact assessment report on the project.        
	The report states that the project would not pollute the environment or disturb the character of the adjacent wetlands. We want the case to be heard immediately. During the hearing, we will ask the court either to allow us to start the project or order it to be scrapped, said Ghosh.

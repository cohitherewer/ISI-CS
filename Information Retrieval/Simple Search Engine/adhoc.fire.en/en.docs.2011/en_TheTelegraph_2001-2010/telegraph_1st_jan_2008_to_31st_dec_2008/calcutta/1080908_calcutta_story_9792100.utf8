The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC sinks   a Puja tradition
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CMC sinks   a Puja tradition
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                    
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has washed its hands of the citys immersion ghats.        
	After suggesting in an affidavit to the high court last year that a ban on idol immersion in the Hooghly was the only way to prevent pollution, the civic authorities have now decided to break the decades-old tradition of repairing the roads leading to the ghats and sprucing up the sites before every Puja.        
	The CMCs refusal to repair the roads and make immersion arrangements this year at 12 ghats is the outcome of a dispute with Calcutta Port Trust, which is in charge of the riverbanks. Yes, I have written to the commissioner of police (about the decision). The port trust maintains its own roads and must maintain its ghats, too,  said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.         
	The CMC had been making immersion arrangements at 12 sites  including Babughat, Bichali Ghat, Dahi Ghat, Baje Kadamtala Ghat and Sarbamongala Ghat  for around 50 years. As in previous years, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti wrote to the municipal commissioner last week, mentioning the ghats and roads that needed repairs.        
	Bandyopadhyay said in his reply that the police department should henceforth liaise with the port trust for this task.        
	The CMC will only set up enclosures at the ghats for Puja organisers to dump flowers, leaves and other items that are otherwise thrown into the river. The civic conservancy department will later remove the garbage from the riverbank.        
	The dispute between the CMC and the port trust is over maintenance of roads. The port trust recently refused to hand over roads under its jurisdiction to the civic organisation for maintenance despite several of them needing repairs. We will repair all 32 roads after the monsoon, Amal Kumar Mehra, the chief engineer of the port trust, said.        
	He blamed the public works department for the state of the roads, saying the department violated a maintenance contract by asking for more money and then walking out. The arrangement had worked only for three years, beginning 2003.        
	Almost all the port trust roads are in bad shape and conservancy service and lighting arrangements are insufficient. When people suffer, they blame the civic authorities. We had repeatedly requested the port trust to hand us those roads for proper maintenance but it did not, said P.K. Dhua, the CMCs chief engineer (civil).

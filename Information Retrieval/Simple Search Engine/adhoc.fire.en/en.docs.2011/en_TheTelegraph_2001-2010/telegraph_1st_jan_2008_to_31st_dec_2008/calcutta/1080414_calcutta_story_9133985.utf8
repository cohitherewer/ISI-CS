          RITH BASU                              
	An injection meant for a woman on bed no. 185 in Chittaranjan Seva Sadan was allegedly administered to the woman on bed no. 165 on Saturday.         
	Kamalika Chakraborty, who has been allotted bed no. 185, delivered a baby at the state-run hospital on Saturday morning. Her blood group is A negative, while the babys blood group is A positive. In such cases, the mother has to be administered an anti-D-gama globulin shot within 72 hours. Otherwise, complications may arise during her next pregnancy.        
	We are poor but we arranged for Rs 1,600 and bought the medicine within two hours, said Kamalikas father Kamal Chakraborty, who runs a tea stall.         
	A nurse called Shikha Acharya gave the shot to a woman on bed No. 165, which is on the same floor but in another room, said Kamalikas husband Jayanta, who works in a stationery shop.        
	Sources at the hospital said that the other patient had been prescribed the same medicine.         
	The doctors promised to give my wife the shot free but they did not do so on Saturday. When we reminded them about the medicine on Sunday, they and the nurses started misbehaving with us. We were scared Kamalika wont get the medicine within the deadline and put up a road block, said Jayanta.        
	The family members of Kamalika also lodged a general diary with Bhowanipore police station. The 30-minute roadblock on one flank of SP Mukherjee Road was lifted at 3pm after the hospital authorities spoke to the relatives  with officers of the police station mediating  and administered the medicine to Kamalika free.         
	A senior official of the hospital said: We are probing the incident. Anyone found guilty will be punished.

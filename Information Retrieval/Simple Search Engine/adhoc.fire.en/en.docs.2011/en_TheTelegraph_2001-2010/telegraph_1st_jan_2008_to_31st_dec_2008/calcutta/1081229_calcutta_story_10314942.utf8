                      Salt stories                    In 1930, a group of Indians, led by a frail, elderly man, marched 241 miles. They marched for salt. Mahatma Gandhi was able to craft an anti-colonial, nationalist movement around a basic issue of livelihood: the right of Indians to make and consume their own salt. Seventy-seven years later, the Wide Eye film team followed the trail of the famous Dandi salt march in search of Gandhis legacy. Set against the backdrop of Gandhis original journey, The Salt Stories (84 min.) is a road-movie about issues of livelihood in modern, globalising India. It is a documentary about the salt stories of our time. Researched, produced and directed by Lalit Vachani. Open to all, the filmmaker will be present at its premiere show this evening and will introduce the film and answer viewers queries on it from after the screening. Hosted by The Seagull Foundation for the Arts.                     Event: Premiere show of The Salt Stories, a film by Lalit Vachani When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: 46 Satish Mukherjee Road, near Rashbehari crossing

  - Guild ready to hold event in any part of the state          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A fresh attempt is brewing to bring back the Book Fair to the Maidan. This time, its not the Publishers and Booksellers Guild but the state government that has taken the initiative.        
	Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb has assured the guild that the state government would do everything to hold next years fair at its original venue, said the secretary of the organiser, Tridib Chatterjee. He met Deb at Writers Buildings on Tuesday afternoon.         
	The chief secretary also told us that if it was not possible to hold the fair on the Maidan, the state government would arrange an alternative venue for us, added Chatterjee.         
	The guild has not appealed to the government for permission to hold the fair on the Maidan. We have only requested the government to finalise the venue for next years fair. The venue can be in any part of the state.         
	The organisation had written thrice to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee between January and June requesting him to identify the site of the 33rd Calcutta Book Fair, said a member. The letters prompted Tuesdays meeting.        
	The next Book Fair will be held from January 28 to February 8. Scotland will be the theme country.         
	We dont want to start the process of identifying the site late. We have already received inquiries from representatives in Scotland and South Africa regarding the venue, said Chatterjee.         
	The guild officials met Deb and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen on June 30. Sen asked them to take a look at the newly built Milon Mela. We told the officials that we would accept any site selected by the government. If the government feels that the fair can be held in the Sunderbans, we are ready to do so provided there is infrastructure support, said Chatterjee.         
	The Book Fair was held on the Maidan till 2006. The army after initial refusal permitted the guild to organise the fair on the Maidan in 2007. But when environmentalists filed PILs citing pollution, the high court denied permission to hold the fair on the Maidan. The guild took it to Salt Lake stadium.        
	This year, the defence authorities again refused permission for the fair on the Maidan. The government helped the guild to hold the event at Park Circus Maidan, but it had to be again shifted to Salt Lake stadium following PILs from Park Circus residents.

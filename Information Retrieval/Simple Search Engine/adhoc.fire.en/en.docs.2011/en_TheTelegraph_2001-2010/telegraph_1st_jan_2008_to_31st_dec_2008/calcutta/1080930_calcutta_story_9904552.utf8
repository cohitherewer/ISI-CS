The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dud drafts for crores
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dud drafts for crores
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A 27-year-old youth was arrested from his Patna home last week by the detective department of Calcutta police for using forged bank drafts to buy goods worth crores of rupees.        
	Tinku Kumar, alias Chandan, was produced before a city court on Monday and remanded in police custody. He was part of a racket that used fake bank drafts to buy goods  including cars, electrical items and clothes  from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh.         
	Tinku was nabbed after a nine-month hunt by the anti-fraud section that had been tracking the gang since January, when the first complaint was lodged by the Central Bank of India in Calcutta.        
	The police said the gang members used drafts purportedly issued by various Central Bank of India branches.         
	The drafts were made with such precision that it was difficult to tell them from the original ones. The thickness of paper, the stamp and every other detail on the drafts looked so genuine that they passed the scrutiny of bank officials, said Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief.         
	The gang obtained the original signatures and employee codes of bank officials of some branches outside Bengal and used them on the fake drafts.        
	Once cleared, the drafts used to be credited in the accounts of the businessmen from whom the goods were purchased. Within days of clearance, a member of the gang would send the trader the order for requisition through courier.        
	By using couriers, they could conceal their identity. The addresses from where the orders were sent were fake, another officer said.        
	In 2004, around 400 drafts went missing from a Central Bank of India branch in West Midnapore. Sleuths are probing whether they fell in the hands of Tinku and his men.

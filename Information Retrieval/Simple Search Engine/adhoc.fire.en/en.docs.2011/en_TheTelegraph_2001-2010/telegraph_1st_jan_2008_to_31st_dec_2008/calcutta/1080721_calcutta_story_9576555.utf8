                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Physio who walked the talk

	Moved by the plight of the lonely senior citizens he would come across every day, a Calcutta-based physiotherapist walked 5,000 km along the coastal belt to draw attention to geriatric needs.        
	Behala resident Tapas Das, 31, began his expedition from Gangasagar on October 13 last year and walked through Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat and the Union Territories of Pondicherry and Daman in 222 days.         
	He returned to Calcutta on May 21, having covered as many as 66 districts on foot and ending the expedition at Gandhijis Sabarmati ashram.        
	I stopped at every village and town on the way and reminded people that the aged should be taken care of. I asked the sarpanch of every village I went to mobilise support for me, and almost everywhere they were very receptive to the idea, said Das, who is the secretary of the city-based Haimabat Adventure Foundation.        
	Dass focus was on raising awareness about the facilities senior citizens were entitled to under the ministry of social justice and empowerments National Policy for Older Persons, 1999. The policy pledges financial security, healthcare, shelter, education, welfare and protection of life and property to the elderly.        
	I get to meet elderly people regularly because many of them require physiotherapy. Their loneliness touches me, especially with the concept of nuclear families making elderly people feel unwanted. I just felt like telling people to love and respect them. After all, we will all be old one day, he said.        
	The physiotherapist carried translations of his messages in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam to places in the south where language was a barrier.         
	There was adventure at every step. I would sleep in my tent and sometimes in panchayat offices. My bag weighed 22 kg, he recalled.        
	Das was arrested on three occasions  in Orissa, Kerala and Karnataka. I had to show the police a certificate from the MLA of our area and newspaper clippings before they let me go, he said.

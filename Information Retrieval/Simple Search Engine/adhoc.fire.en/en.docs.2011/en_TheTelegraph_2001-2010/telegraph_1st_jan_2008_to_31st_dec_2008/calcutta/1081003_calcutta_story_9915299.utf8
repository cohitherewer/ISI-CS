The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bumpy ride for goddess
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bumpy ride for goddess

	The goddess is arriving on elephant back this Puja, but for some idols in south Calcutta, the ride to the pandal will be a lot less grand.         
	Puja organisers in Behala and Thakurpukur are worried that craters on the roads may damage the idols while being transported to the pandals in lorries and tempos. The potholed roads will also pose dangers for pandal-hoppers, they fear.        
	With just two days to go for the pujas, there is hardly any time for repairs before crowds start thronging the pandals. At least 400 pujas are organised within a 31-sq km radius in the Behala-Thakurpukur area, and some of them are major crowd-pullers.         
	The roads have become unusable because of the unfinished work under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project (CEIP). Shoddy work by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), which is laying sewage lines and drinking water pipes, has added to the woes.         
	The civic authorities have hurriedly repaired the arterial roads, but the condition of the lanes and bylanes remains deplorable. The battered roads include Subash Marg near Behala Flying Club, Brajamani Debya Road, Biren Roy Road (West), Karunamoyee Ghat Road, Siriti Road Sarsoona and parts of M.G. Road.         
	A woman and an auto driver were killed and four persons injured in separate incidents in the accident-prone area in the last few days.         
	Biswajit Pal, the secretary of the Airport Local Residents Club in Behala, said: We requested the CMC and CEIP authorities to repair the roads but they dont seem interested in completing the work before Puja.         
	The CEIP authorities, however, defended the quality of work. CEIP chief engineer Soumya Ganguly said: We have repaired the entire road where work has been completed but how can we give final touches to a stretch where work is going on?        
	An emergency meeting was held at Behala police station on Wednesday to discuss crowd management on Puja days. A watch tower would be built near the bus terminus of route number 14 and parking will not be allowed between the bus terminus and Thakurpukur on Diamond Harbour Road. Hawkers will also not be allowed to set up shop on this stretch.

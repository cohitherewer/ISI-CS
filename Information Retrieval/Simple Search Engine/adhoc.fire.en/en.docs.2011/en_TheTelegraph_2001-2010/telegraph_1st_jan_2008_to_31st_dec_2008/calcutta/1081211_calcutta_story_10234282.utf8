          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta Universitys sexual harassment complaints committee on Wednesday filed its interim report on the alleged molestation of a postgraduate student of Viharilal College of Home and Social Sciences by a teacher in November 2007.         
	Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das said the committee would soon start a detailed inquiry into the incident. The panel will take some more time to complete the investigation.        
	The student had stated in her complaint last December that Indubhusan Mondal, a Bengali teacher and a leader of the CPM-controlled Calcutta University Teachers Association, had molested her inside a computer laboratory.        
	The university delayed the investigation though the Supreme Court has made prompt action mandatory for sexual harassment complaints, said a student of the college.        
	The university had initially set up a one-member panel that gave a clean chit to Mondal. Following pressure from students and teachers of the college, the university set up another investigation panel in August, which recommended a probe by the sexual harassment complaints committee.        
	The university did not directly refer the complaint to the cell to buy time, alleged a teacher on Wednesday.

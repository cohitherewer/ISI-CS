                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             B-school beats downturn
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Final-year students of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta are bagging prized pre-placement offers, beating the economic downturn.        
	People on the campus were a little worried whether the economic slump would affect the job prospects of the would-be graduates. But we have already got 54 offers and more than half the companies are yet to announce the results of the summer internship. The indications bode well for the final placements, said Rahul Ajmani, the placement cell representative of the Joka institute.        
	Pre-placement offers are given by companies to final-year students who had interned with them during the summer placement.        
	The students have bagged jobs across sectors, and continents, with offers pouring in from consultancy firms, investment and commercial banks, and marketing firms.        
	Despite the negative sentiment in the international banking sector, the Joka biz brains have been offered jobs by Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Barclays, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Citibank. Marketing and general management firms, including Hindustan Unilever Limited, Proctor amp; Gamble, Aditya Birla Group and TAS, are among the others making a beeline for the IIMC.        
	Offers have also landed from the US, Australia, South Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and a host of European countries.        
	Over 85 companies had participated in the summer placement process at IIM Calcutta in November last year and offered internship in both Indian and international profiles in different sectors.        
	We expect the number to go up as more companies come out with their final offers once the process of evaluation of the internship performances is over, said Krishnan Sekhar, secretary, external relation cell, IIM Calcutta.

                      Scottish ballads                    Having begun her professional journey as a member of music band Fairground Attraction, Scottish singer Eddi Reader (picture right) is better known for her enduring solo career, which saw her showcase the works of Scotlands national poet Robert Burns in 2003. Featuring 11 tracks, Sings the Songs of Robert Burns, her album of material by Robert Burns, is a luscious, captivating intersection, bringing together some of the UKs finest folk musicians along with members of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. Masterfully blending earthy folk arrangements with haunting, ethereal orchestral overtones, it led to excellent reviews and an international resurgence in interest in Scotlands bard. Her latest studio album, Peacetime, features a few songs composed by Burns, alongside brand new material. Performing in the city this weekend, Western music aficionados can discover the magic of her rich, soulful and stirring voice in what promises to be an unforgettable experience.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Protest over market plan
                                                                                                               Protest over market plan
  - Traders cite HC case      A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A plan to develop a Jodhpur Park market, spread over 108 cottahs, into an eight-storeyed commercial complex with the help of a private firm has divided its traders.        
	State cooperation minister Rabindra Ghosh on Sunday afternoon laid the foundation stone of the complex amid protests by traders under the banner of Jodhpur Park Bazar Byabsayee Unnayan Samity.        
	Local legislator and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya were scheduled to attend the ceremony, but did not.         
	We are shocked that the minister laid the foundation stone even though a case is pending in the high court. A cooperation department tribunal had ruled that the steps taken by the Jodhpur Park Society (formerly The Bengal Secretariat Cooperative Land Mortgage Bank and Housing Society Limited) to develop the market with the help of a private firm were not proper, alleged P.K. Nag, the secretary of the Samity.        
	He added that the Samity was not against the development of the market but was protesting the manner in which it was being done.        
	According to the Samity members, those who had entered into an agreement with the developer are not authorised to do so.        
	The members of the society and Ghosh dismissed the allegation. I am sure there is no case pending in the high court. I consulted the society members and my officials earlier, said the minister.        
	The eviction and rehabilitation plan had been worked out. Barring a few, everybody is happy, said D.K. Sengupta, the lawyer for the society.        
	The developer, R.R. Modi, said he had obtained the necessary sanctions and the work would start soon.We will keep the first two floors reserved for the shop-owners and vendors. Space on the other six floors will be sold to realise the project cost, he added.

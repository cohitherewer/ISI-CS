          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 30-year-old electrician allegedly hanged himself after hacking his pregnant wife to death in their house in Purba Boalia, Sonarpur, on Tuesday.        
	Kaushik Biswas suspected his wife Ruma, 27, of having an affair. He also believed that he wasnt the father of the child she was pregnant with. According to police, they were married four-and-a-half-years-ago and used to quarrel frequently.        
	The bodies were sent for post-mortem to ascertain the cause and time of deaths. We are not ruling out any possibility, said police superintendent (South 24-Parganas) Praveen Kumar.        
	The police suspect Kaushik had gagged a sleeping Ruma with an insulated tape and tied her hands on Tuesday morning. He tried to strangle her and then hit her repeatedly with a kitchen knife. Her right arm was severed. He then made a noose with an electrical wire and hanged himself from a ceiling fan.        
	Basudeb Jana, the landlord of the couple, found the bodies around 1pm. He became suspicious after hearing no sound from the couple.

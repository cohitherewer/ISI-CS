                      The story of Kathak                    A visual anthropologist and Kathak exponent, Dr Pallabi Chakravorty is the founder and artistic director of the contemporary dance ensemble, Courtyard Dancers, in Philadelphia. She has specialised in Kathak for more than two decades under Bandana Sen. Chakravortys scholarly and choreographic works reflect her long immersion in Kathak and in ethnographic methods and social theory. Bells of Change: Kathak Dance, Women and Modernity in India is her first book. Sawaal-Jawaab, a conversation with the author on the occasion of its release this evening, will reveal how Kathak as a classical dance form travelled from the kothas to the national stage, and now to the global arts-industrial complex. The session will commence with a live performance and video excerpts from Chakravortys own choreographic works, melding embodied aesthetics with contemporary social theory.

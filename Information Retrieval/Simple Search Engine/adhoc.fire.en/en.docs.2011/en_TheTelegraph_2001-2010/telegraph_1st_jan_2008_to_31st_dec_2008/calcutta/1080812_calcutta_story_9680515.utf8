The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Meteor shower tonight
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Meteor shower tonight
  - Weather permitting, treat for sky-gazers          A STAFF REPORTER       
	Sky-gazers can look forward to a spectacular celestial display on Tuesday with the annual Perseid meteor shower lighting up the night sky.        
	The Perseid meteor shower  a popular astronomical highlight that typically occurs on August 12 or 13 every year  occurs when the Earth passes through the tail of the Swift-Tuttle comet with meteoroids hitting the atmosphere at a speed of 60 km per second.        
	Debiprosad Duari, the director of research and academics at MP Birla Planetarium, said the best time to see the shower in Calcutta is between 9.30pm and daybreak. The north-eastern horizon of the sky will offer a good view, he added.        
	The shower is best witnessed on a clear, moonless night from an open space. It is an accidental phenomenon that can happen anytime at night. In the past, it has produced brilliant fireworks, said Duari.        
	Duari warns that one might have to wait for a long time or even sacrifice a nights sleep to watch the meteor drizzle.        
	Visibility might be poor if the sky is cloudy or the city too brightly lit, Duari added.         
	The Perseid meteor shower derives its name from the constellation Perseus, from which it darts out. Swift-Tuttle, its source, passes through the inner solar system every 130 years, leaving behind a trail of dust and rocky segments that intersects the Earths orbit, producing these vivid streaks of light every August.        
	Once the moon sets around 12.45am on Wednesday, there will be greater chances of spotting the shower, Duari said.

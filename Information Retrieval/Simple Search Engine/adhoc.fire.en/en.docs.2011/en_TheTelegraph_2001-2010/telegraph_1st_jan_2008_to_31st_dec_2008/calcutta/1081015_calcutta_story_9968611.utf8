          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Some officers of Lake police station tried to hush up their nexus with a criminal by folding a page of the FIR book that recorded soft charges against him.        
	Acting under pressure from their colleagues, the officers then registered a fresh case under a non-bailable section of the Indian Penal Code against murder convict Bapi Halder, who had come out of jail after serving his sentence.        
	On October 9, Bapi and his accomplices had severely beaten up three youths in Panchanantala, under Lake police station, said an officer. One of the victims suffered serious injuries on the face.        
	Senior officers were stunned to know that the FIR had been changed keeping them in the dark. An officer has to give a written explanation to his superior if he changes the FIR. No such explanation has been sought from any officer of Lake police station, said an officer at Lalbazar.        
	Deputy commissioner (south) Rajesh Subarno, however, denied knowledge about the tampering with the register. I will conduct an inquiry to find out what prompted the officers of Lake police station to do this. Action will be taken against officers found violating norms, he said.        
	Bapi was arrested after Trinamul Congress supporters staged a demonstration in front of Lake police station last Sunday, alleging that the officers were shielding him. The youth was picked up the same night for his involvement in the October 9 violence.        
	After he was brought to the police station, a section of cops charged him under IPC section 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), which was bailable. The entry was made on page No. 17109 of the FIR book.        
	Some officers protested, saying Bapi would be out on bail as soon as he was produced in court. Sensing that the situation was taking a serious turn, officer-in-charge Debasish Baidya asked his men to register a fresh case on another page, said a source at the police station.        
	On page No. 17110 of the FIR book, the cops charged Bapi under Section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon). This section is non-bailable. Bapi had to spend two days in police custody, said the source.        
	The officers did not tear out page No. 17109 because that would have been a serious offence. Instead, they folded the page several times so that the earlier FIR would pass unnoticed, said an officer.

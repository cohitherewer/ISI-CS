                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A months deadline to okay building plan
  - Citizens charter          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Renovating dilapidated buildings will be easier as the civic body has promised to grant permission within a month.   A Telegraph picture                                              
	The civic body has adopted a citizens charter promising to sanction building proposals within a month. Proposals to modify existing buildings, too, will come under the charters purview.        
	Officials of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) said the building departments charter, issued last week, will help end the harassment faced by people while getting plans sanctioned.        
	The charter is a commitment to deliver services within a deadline, failing which the officials concerned will have to pay a token penalty, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay said on Tuesday.        
	If a proposal cannot be cleared within the deadline, the CMC will have to explain the reason to the applicant.        
	According to rules, the civic bodys approval is a must to construct a building or modify an existing one. Modifications include reconstruction of the roof or staircase and installation of a lift.        
	The charter states that verification of the plan and other documents and site inspection should be over within 20 days of receiving the proposal. Demand notice for the fee will be issued within a week of the inspection and final approval will be issued four days after the payment of sanction fees, said director-general (building) Gora Chand Mondol.        
	A group of 15 officials, including the director-general (building) and borough executive engineers, will be responsible for the execution of the charter. It has been made mandatory for all building department offices to display prominently the names and telephone numbers (including cellphone numbers) of the officials.        
	Among the documents to be submitted along with the construction proposal are        
	 Proof of title right        
	 Mutation certificate        
	 Copy of assessment book        
	 Current property tax bill        
	 Photocopy of the deed plan        
	 Clearance from the land ceiling department for a plot over 7.5 cottahs.        
	Proposals to construct a building on a corner plot (between two roads), or one more than 14.5-metre high or spread across more than 500 sq m will be beyond the purview of the citizens charter. Clearance of such proposals require verification of several documents and it is not possible to meet the deadline, explained an official.        
	The civic body has been releasing charters for each of its department following a directive from the UK government, which has given a grant of Rs 212 crore for the CMCs capacity-building programme.         
	The assessment, lighting and parks amp; gardens departments have already released their charters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Patient wins damages
                                                                                                            Patient wins damages
  - Hospital that denied woman admission to pay Rs 50,000          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	An 85-year-old woman who was refused admission in a private hospital has been awarded Rs 50,000 as compensation by a consumer court.        
	Sabitri Mukherjee, a resident of Salt Lakes BE block, was suffering from age-related ailments. On May 25, 2004, her physician advised hospitalisation due to acute retention of urine and stool. She was unable to walk without help and was in severe discomfort.        
	Sabitri was taken to Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Institute, on EM Bypass. The doctors in the emergency department diagnosed rectal prolapse  in which pelvic ligaments fail to hold the rectum in place, obstructing the passage of stool and urine.         
	The condition is very stressful. Without surgical intervention, things can worsen fast, explained a surgeon.         
	On the advice of the doctors, Sabitri, accompanied by her husband Gopal Chandra (87 at that time) went to the admission counter and filled up the requisition form. Gopal Chandra produced his central government health scheme (CGHS) card but was allegedly asked to deposit Rs 5,000.        
	Despite repeated requests, the authorities refused to admit Sabitri without the money. The hospital officials misbehaved with me. They called the security personnel and snatched the admission form from me, alleged Gopal Chandra, who was a senior official at the Ordnance Factory.        
	Sabitri was later treated by a private practitioner and operated upon at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals. She underwent another prolapse surgery recently.         
	Gopal Chandra had filed a complaint with the district consumer forum of South 24-Parganas. It had directed Peerless Hospital to pay the patient a compensation of Rs 50,000.        
	The hospital had moved the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. In a recent order, the commission upheld the forums directive.        
	The hospital authorities had claimed before the commission that Gopal Chandra did not have a valid CGHS card and the one he had produced at the hospital was a duplicate.        
	The commission, however, ruled: we have strong reasons to believe that the appellant (Peerless Hospital) tried to avoid the patient by hook or crook for the simple reason that there was no scope to get cash payment.         
	Hospital officials said they have filed an appeal at the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. The charges are not true, said P.K. Naik, a senior hospital official.         
	A Supreme Court judgment has made it mandatory for a hospital or a doctor to treat any critically ill patient.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Four criminals with guns in hand chased a rival gangster down a crowded Sealdah station on Monday afternoon and shot him in the chest and head as he tripped on the tracks and fell.         
	Vinod Singh, in his early 40s, died instantly, about 200 metres away from platform 10 on Sealdah south section. The body lay there for 10 minutes but nobody dared to approach it or stop the assailants as they slipped through gaps in the fence around the tracks and ran away.         
	Barun Mullik, the superintendent of railway police (Sealdah), said Singh was a snatcher who had turned an extortionist. He was wanted in a number of cases. The killing was the fallout of a longstanding gang rivalry. No one has been arrested in this connection so far.        
	According to officers of Government Railway Police (GRP), Sealdah, the chase started around 2.30pm. The four men, in their early 30s, spotted Singh on platform 10 and started running after him with revolvers in hand, in full view of thousands of commuters, said an officer.              
	Pedestrians on the Beleghata Main Road flyover could also see the chase as Singh ran to the southern end of the platform and then along the tracks.               
	 quot;The man was struggling to run on the pebbles strewn around the tracks. The attackers fired at him and the bullet grazed his right shoulder before he stumbled and fell under the Beleghata Main Road flyover, quot; said a hawker who watched the murder.               
	The four men surrounded Singh within seconds and one of them pulled the trigger twice. One of the bullets pierced his skull and the other was lodged on the left of his chest.               
	A preliminary investigation revealed Singh was a close associate of Kele Bhola, who shot at a trader under the Sealdah flyover last year.               
	 quot;Singh used to operate in the Sealdah-Muchipara area. Before joining Bholas group, he was a notorious snatcher, quot; said an officer of the detective department.               
	According to a GRP officer, Singh had become a drug dealer recently and was trying to spread his network on the Sealdah station premises. quot;The other group of drug dealers in the area was not ready to give up their territory. quot;               
	Sources said brown sugar, ganja and charas are openly sold on the station premises every evening, especially in the subway that emerges near the flyover.               
	 quot;Drugs worth several thousand rupees are traded in the station every day, quot; said an officer of Muchipara police station.

  - Killer wheels: 23-year-old from Behala              A STAFF REPORTER                          Victor Guha                                   
	A 23-year-old computer engineer from Calcutta was killed in a motorcycle mishap in Pune early on Sunday.         
	Victor Guha, employed with a Capgemini Group company, was on his way to work riding pillion on his shift-in-charges motorcycle when it was hit by a trailer near Dehu Road police station.        
	Both were killed on the spot, police said. The driver of the trailer fled.        
	An officer of the police station said: The accident occurred at 3.15am. Victor Guha was riding pillion behind Ramanathan Kutty, who was from Karnataka. They were headed towards Talwade. A trailer hit the motorcycle from behind, flinging the two on the road and killing them instantly.        
	The Guhas in Behalas Haridevpur got news of the tragedy around four hours after the accident.        
	One of my sons friends in Pune called around 7am and said he had died. I could not believe my ears, said Victors father Arindam Guha, 55.        
	Victors mother Tandra, a homemaker, was inconsolable. She has gone into shock and has often been losing consciousness, said a neighbour of the family in Haridevpur.        
	Victor had studied in South End School before completing his graduation from Future Institute of Engineering and Management in Sonarpur. He joined Capgemini in Pune on June 18, 2007, said his father, an ex-serviceman and retired sales tax officer.         
	Sister Pallavi said they had last spoken to Victor late on Saturday. Hours after that, he was dead.        
	Victors colleagues in Pune have arranged for an airconditioned ambulance, which is expected to bring him back home in 48 hours.        
	Relatives and friends who gathered in the two-storeyed house remembered Victor as a bright and pleasant boy.        
	Victor was such a nice boy. We were very happy that he was doing well, said neighbour Kaushik Ganguly.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court has directed Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT) to hand over a seven-cottah plot in Dhakuria to its owner, a 93-year-old woman, by 11.30am on Thursday.        
	The CIT will have to vacate the encroachment, if any, and hand over the possession of the plot to its original owner by 11.30am tomorrow, Justice Dipankar Dutta ruled on Wednesday. The order followed a contempt petition by the owner of the plot, Mahamaya Roy Chowdhury.        
	The judge also directed Lake police station to provide adequate security to Roy Chowdhury when she would demarcate the plot, beside Dakshinapan Commercial Complex.        
	On September 16, the division bench of Justice P.K. Chattopadhaya and Justice Tapan Mukherjee ordered return of the plot to the owner within a week after the state failed to convince the court that the acquisition was for public good.        
	The state was also asked to pay a fine of Rs 51,000 to Roy Chowdhury for harassing her.        
	On Wednesday, Roy Chowdhurys lawyer Arun Maity moved a contempt petition, claiming that the government was still holding on to the plot.        
	My client had forwarded a copy of the courts order to the state. But there has been no response from the government, said Maity.        
	Lawyers appearing for the state prayed for time to carry out the order but Justice Dutta rejected the plea. The court wants to see that the CIT hands over the plot to the owner by tomorrow morning.        
	The case will be next heard on November 9, when the state will have to clarify why it had failed to carry out the earlier order.        
	During the hearing of the original case, the state lawyer had submitted that the plot was requisitioned in the mid-1980s and acquired in August 8, 1996, for public purpose.        
	The plot was handed over to the CIT and then to the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority for the construction of a shopping complex. When the court asked for the sanction plan of the proposed market, the state could not produce it.

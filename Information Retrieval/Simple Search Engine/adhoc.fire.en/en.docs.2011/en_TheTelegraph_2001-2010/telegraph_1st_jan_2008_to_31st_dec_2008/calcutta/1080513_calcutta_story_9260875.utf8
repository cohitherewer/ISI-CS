	The 57 colleges waiting to migrate from Calcutta University to the West Bengal State University (WBSU) in North 24-Parganas will know after May 15 from where the institution will start functioning and very soon who the vice-chancellor will be.        
	Metro had reported on Monday the possibility of these colleges losing students in transition, mainly because of the uncertainty over how the WBSU would function this year without a temporary office and a management team in place.        
	A senior official said Ashoke Thakur, who heads the West Bengal University of Technology, was most likely to be appointed vice-chancellor. The proposal to appoint Thakur the head of the WBSU has been sent to Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi for approval. An order announcing Thakurs appointment will be issued very soon.         
	A meeting has been convened on Thursday to finalise the site for a temporary office.        
	We will be in a position to announce the site from where the new university will start functioning after the May 15 meeting, Anil Bhattacharya, the chairman of the Society for the New University, said.        
	The Barasat Government College annexe is one of the proposed sites.         
	The society was constituted early this year to oversee the first phase of work on the university.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ride with frills on three wheels
          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                          Sanyasi Jana with his rickshaw. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	The next time you take a cycle-rickshaw and feel thirsty, look around for a bottle of mineral water. If the ride is long, reach for the newspaper or turn on the radio. And dont forget to take a look at the cuddly rabbit behind the back seat after you get off.         
	A pipe dream? Not if you are on Sanyasi Janas cycle-rickshaw. The man from Baleswar in Orissa offers all this and plenty more on three wheels, and at no extra cost.        
	I try to make my passengers, most of whom are busy all the time, relax, says Jana, who ferries passengers in the Lake Town area.        
	The man in his early-40s moved to the city to increase his income. I bought this second-hand cycle-rickshaw nine months ago after working as a cook in a roadside eatery for four years.         
	Since Jana wanted to offer more than the average rickshaw-puller, he had to redesign his vehicle. First came the calendar. People often forget the date, so I placed a calendar in front of the passenger seat.        
	Two racks beside the rod that props up the plastic sheet over Janas head holds a lot more, including a speaker to play the FM radio, a first-aid box, a cellphone and a clock.        
	There is also a copy of the Gita for elderly passengers and small toys for children, said Arun Mukherjee, one of Janas regular passengers.         
	The rickshaw also has an aquarium and three cages containing a rabbit, an injured bird and a white mouse Jana had rescued. Theres even a potted plant at the back.         
	Jana dreams of adding two gadgets to his dream vehicle. I want to install a small LCD television like they have in cars and a fan.

 - Ban lift paves the way

	Chicken dishes are making a comeback on flights and trains leaving Calcutta.
    
	Several domestic carriers had withdrawn chicken from their menu in mid-January after the outbreak of bird flu in the state. Even international flights that load meals in Calcutta had scrapped chicken from their menus. 
    
	The state government had banned buying and selling chicken on February 5. The ban was lifted a week later.
    
	Chicken dishes have been reintroduced on our flights from Calcutta since February 22, said a Kingfisher Airline official on Tuesday. 
    
	Air India has also been serving chicken dishes as part of its Indian and Continental menu on domestic and international flights from Calcutta since Sunday.
    
	In the interim period, some airlines had been serving only vegetarian items, while others were substituting chicken with lamb and mutton.
    
	While booking tickets, passengers were asking if chicken would be served on board, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India. 
    
	International carriers like Singapore Airlines did not stop serving chicken, as they load their meals outside the state.
    
	The railways are also reintroducing chicken on the Sealdah and Howrah Rajdhanis. Only vegetarian fare was available on the two trains since the flu outbreak.
    
	On Monday, we received a note from the state government regarding the ban being lifted. Chicken will be back on the menu in a few days, said a railway official.

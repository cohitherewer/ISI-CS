The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Blame game over crackers 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blame game over crackers 
  - Fireworks not monitored          JAYANTA BASU                           Diwali celebrations in a city home. A Telegraph picture                                        
	The government wings responsible for ensuring a pollution-free Diwali are playing pass-the-buck after air and noise pollution by crackers made life miserable during the festival.        
	The state environment department has criticised the central explosive department for failing to monitor the quality of fireworks that were burst this Kali puja and Diwali. The Union department pleaded lack of infrastructure and claimed that the district administrators had not provided details of fireworks manufacturers.         
	The Centre issued a notification and the Supreme Court a directive stating that the composition of each firework should be mentioned on its packet. The explosive department, responsible for verifying the composition of fireworks, is almost inactive in the state, said Biswajit Mukherjee, the chief law officer of the environment department and the member-convener of the state noise monitoring committee.        
	The fireworks sellers admitted that very few crackers sold in the state, whether made locally or brought from Sivkasi, came in packets mentioning their composition.        
	Chemical compositions of fireworks, even those coming from Sivkasi, are not mentioned on their boxes, said Sanjay Dutta, the secretary of the Burrabazar Fireworks Dealers Association.        
	We are trying to work out a mechanism to check the chemical composition of the fireworks, said S. Bhattacharya, the deputy chief controller of explosives (eastern circle). He claimed that it was the district administrations responsibility to intimate the department about the manufacturers in their area but they seldom do so.        
	We do not have adequate infrastructure to test fireworks, Bhattacharya added.        
	Crackers contain chemicals that can release high levels of particulate matter while burning, said Inderjeet Budhiraja, a fireworks manufacturer and the president of a fireworks dealers association. The level of particulate matter in the air on Diwali was more than three times the normal amount, said the chief scientist of the pollution control board.

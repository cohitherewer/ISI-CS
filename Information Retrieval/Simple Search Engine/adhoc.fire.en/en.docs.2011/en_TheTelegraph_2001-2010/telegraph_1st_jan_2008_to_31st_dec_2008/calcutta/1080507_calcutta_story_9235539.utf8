                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CU bars 97 from tests 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	More than half the second-year English class at Calcutta University cannot sit for the Part-II MA examinations in July because of inadequate attendance.        
	The 97 students who have been barred for not attending classes regularly staged a demonstration on the campus throughout Tuesday, when registration for the examinations closed, but the university authorities were unmoved.        
	Tarun Kumar Halder, one of the 10 class representatives of the batch, said the students who were penalised had less than 55 per cent attendance. The remaining 94 students in the batch of 191 were allowed to fill up forms for the July examinations, but some were fined for not attending classes regularly.        
	 As many as 57 of the 94 students were declared non-collegiate and fined because their attendance was between 55 and 65 per cent, Halder said.        
	The deputy controller of examinations, Debashis Biswas, said: The university rule is that those with less than 55 per cent attendance be declared non-collegiates and barred from writing examinations. But the vice-chancellor has discretionary powers in the case of non-collegiate students.         
	The students who participated in the sit-in in front of the room of Dhurjuti Prasad Dey, the secretary of arts, commerce and law, blamed errors in the system of recording attendance for their plight. Some even accused their professors of landing them in trouble, saying they were in the habit of turning up late or not taking classes regularly.         
	Sometimes classes start after most students have left, assuming the professor wont come, Halder said. Students are also denied attendance markings for reasons like not bringing a textbook to class.        
	The barred students said they should have been told of the universitys decision before the last day for registration.        
	The district president of the Students Federation of India, Madhuja Sen Roy, backed the students. She said irregularities had been detected in the attendance records of the philosophy department last year during a verification by the review committee.         
	The union suggested that attendance records of all departments be published at intervals of three months.         
	The sit-in by students will continue on Wednesday if the vice-chancellor does not step in, a union member said.

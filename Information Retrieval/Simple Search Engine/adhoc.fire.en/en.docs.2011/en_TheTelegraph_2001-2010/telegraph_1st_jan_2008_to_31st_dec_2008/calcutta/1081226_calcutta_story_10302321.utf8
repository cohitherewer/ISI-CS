The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dress circle rules the party zone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dress circle rules the party zone
  - Black or red, daring or discreet, the it silhouette steals Xmas Eve show          POULOMI BANERJEE                                                  
	The dress was the dress code on Christmas Eve as Calcutta partied all night. From the little black dress to the form-fitting red dress, paired with leggings or flashing shapely legs, it sent the fashion quotient at social clubs soaring on Wednesday night.        
	A dress on special occasions makes a woman look prettier and more elegant. Through the year we wear jeans, skirts and tops, said Ashwina Daryanani, a 24-year-old hairstylist and ex- model, partying at Tollygunge Club in a long shimmering, one-shouldered silver dress.         
	Saptami Banerjee, 30, in a long, backless black number, felt a dress combines elegance and sensuality        
	The dress is the it silhouette of the year, and Calcutta was dressed to thrill despite the year-end chill. Black remained the chosen colour on Christmas Eve, though red was also popular, and some beiges and whites were spotted. Long or short, high-waisted or flowing, daring or discreet, every kind of dress was on display. A few did manage to get it wrong though, with an unflattering silhouette or over-the-top bling.        
	Designer duo Dev and Nil gave a thumbs-up to the most visible fashion trend on 24th night. We saw many red carpet-like dresses, form-fitted and knee-length, though the young ones were wearing dresses as short as mid-thigh length, said Nil.        
	At Tolly, some hemlines rose and necklines jaw-dropped. One-shoulder, off-shoulder and flirty straps were the flaunt factors. At RCGC, the A-line was the popular silhouette with the hemline varying from just above the knee to mid-calf length.

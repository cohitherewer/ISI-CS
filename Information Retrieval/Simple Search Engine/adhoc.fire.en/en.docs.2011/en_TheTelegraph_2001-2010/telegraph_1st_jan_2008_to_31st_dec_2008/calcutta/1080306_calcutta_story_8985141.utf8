The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Realtor partners cuffed
                                                                                                               Realtor partners cuffed
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two realtors, Pradip Chakrabarty and Tushar Lodh, were arrested on Wednesday on charges of murdering their business partner Snehangshu Rakshit.        
	The body of the 52-year-old Kasba resident was found floating in a Sonarpur pond, around two km from a plot the three had bought, on February 22 morning. Rakshit had been missing since February 19.        
	The post-mortem revealed that he was strangled.        
	Chakrabarty and Lodh eliminated Rakshit to grab a greater share of their business, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas).        
	There was another angle to the murder, though, with the police saying that Rakshit apparently owed some money to Chakrabarty and Lodh. The duo were pressuring him to pay up, but Rakshit had snapped all links with them. He was keeping his cellphone switched off. Asked for the reason, he told his family members that he was receiving threat calls, said an officer.        
	The sleuths claimed the three were also involved in a sleaze racket. On February 19, the duo sent word to Rakshit that they were waiting for him in a Jadavpur apartment with a woman. Rakshit went over, said an officer.        
	Chakrabarty and Lodh murdered Rakshit the same evening, carried the body to Sonarpur, an area they knew well from their business association, and dumped the body in the pond, he added.

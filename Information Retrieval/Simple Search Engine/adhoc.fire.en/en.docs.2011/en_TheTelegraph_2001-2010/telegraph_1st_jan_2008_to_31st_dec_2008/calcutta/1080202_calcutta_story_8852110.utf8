	Nine teams from across the country vied in the final round of the annual business plan contest of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, on Friday. Mudranik and Uniapply were adjudged the winners and will get a seed fund to make their dreams a success.
    
	Ideas to Implementation (i2I) saw young entrepreneurs presenting plans as varied as vocational training and retail, travel and entertainment.
    
	Mudranik is looking to make forays into the publishing industry, while Uniapply wants to set up business in the education sector.
    
	Mahesh Murthy of Seedfund, the investing partner, proposed to fund the plans of the winning teams and to spend time with two more teams, Tempost and Travacco. Tempost is planning to venture into the music industry and Travacco is interested in travel business.
    
	More than money, i2I provides a platform that was earlier not available to budding entrepreneurs, said Ajit Balakrishnan, the CEO of Rediff and one of the judges.
    
	This year, the i2I finals coincided with TiEGER 2008, the annual two-day entrepreneurial summit organised by the Calcutta chapter of The Indus Entrepreneur (TiE). 
    
	The event was attended by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, former UN under-secretary-general Shashi Tharoor, state information technology minister Debesh Das and K.V. Kamath, the CEO of ICICI Bank.
    
	The chief minister stressed the need of entrepreneurial ventures in sectors like iron and steel, agri-business, food processing, jute, power and health.
    
	We are the highest producer in agri-business but fall short in market mechanism, said Bhattacharjee. The state government is looking at a 100 per cent increase in the number of polytechnic and industrial training institutes by the end of this year.

	Junior doctors at Medical College and Hospital (MCH) stopped work on Sunday evening after an intern was injured in a scuffle with a patients relatives following her death. Two policemen who tried to restrain the mob were injured in the incident.         
	Four youths, including 19-year-old Deepak Mahato, the brother of the patient, were arrested after the incident. Sunil Das, 15, Pintu Sardar, 26 and Mahesh Jadav, 20, are the others who were taken into custody.        
	The junior doctors are likely to resume work on Monday, said hospital sources.        
	The trouble started around 4.15pm, after 26-year-old Punam Mahato, a resident of Delhi, was declared brought dead. Her relatives in Phoolbagan and their neighbours attacked a junior doctor, alleging that wrong diagnosis led to the death.        
	Punams fever was not subsiding for three days. We brought her to the hospital around 12.30pm. The doctors gave her two shots, prescribed medicines and told us to take her home. But her condition deteriorated on the way back. When we brought her back to the hospital, they said she had died, said Rabi Singh, Punams friend and neighbour.        
	Punam, who was brought up in the city, married a Delhi businessman four months ago. She came to Calcutta last Monday to attend a relatives marriage.        
	According to witnesses, after Punam was brought back to the hospital, junior doctor Rajarshi Chakraborty called a senior doctor to check her. He pronounced her dead before walking away. The relatives then attacked Chakraborty, asking why Punam had not been admitted to the hospital earlier.        
	They landed a few blows on me before the guards and the police came to my rescue. My glasses broke and I was injured in the face, said Chakraborty.        
	The scuffle between the family members and security staff continued for 10 minutes.         
	We have lodged an FIR with Bowbazar police station against the patients relatives who assaulted our staff. We are conducting an internal investigation to find out if there was medical negligence, said Anup Roy, the medical supervisor of the hospital.

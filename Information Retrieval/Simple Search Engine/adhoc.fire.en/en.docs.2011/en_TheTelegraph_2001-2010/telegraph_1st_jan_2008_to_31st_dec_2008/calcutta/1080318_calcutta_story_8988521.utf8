The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Terminus trio set for traffic flow redo
                                                                                                               Terminus trio set for traffic flow redo
  - REVAMP ROADMAP FOR BUS STANDS          KINSUK BASU                                                  
	Two bus stands in Salt Lake and another off Howrah station are set for a revamp.        
	The state transport department has prepared a makeover blueprint for the bus stands in Karunamoyee and Labony, while the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is readying an overhaul roadmap for the Howrah bus terminus.        
	While the Salt Lake projects will cost around Rs 1 crore (the final figures are yet to be worked out), the Howrah revamp is valued at Rs 20 crore.        
	The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners has carried out the estimate for the Karunamoyee and Labony projects. There are many shops in and around the stands and there is no scientific layout or circulation plan for the buses entering or leaving the stands. Apart from giving the terminuses a new look, the revamp will also correct these drawbacks, said a transport department official.        
	We would also like to lay a service road around Central Park, so that visitors to fairs on the ground dont have to block the carriageway for taking a bus, the official added. Funds will not be a problem, since the projects have been approved by the government.        
	To begin with, the officials are carrying out a survey of the buses that use the two terminuses, the space available and the requirement once the volume of traffic increases. The CMDA has already carried out a primary survey of the Karunamoyee terminus and handed over the report to the transport department.        
	The Howrah project, CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Bavishkar said, will aim at redoing the traffic circulation to and from Howrah and equipping the terminus with all modern facilities.        
	The terminus will be clean, the buses will be offered bays according to the distance they cover and a waiting room with food corners and computerised ticket counters will be set up, an official pointed out. Besides, there will be pathways for pedestrians.

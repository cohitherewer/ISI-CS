The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Commandos for city streets
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Commandos for city streets
          KINSUK BASU                              
	The Special Task Force (STF) of Calcutta police will raise a team of commandos to tackle terror strikes like the one in Mumbai and other specialised crimes.         
	The Quick Reaction Team will be made up of 50-80 commandos handpicked from the Special Action Force or the Rapid Action Force. They will undergo training under a central force.         
	The commandos will be on their toes 24x7 to handle critical situations, including hostage crises. They will be part of a very focussed group. We dont want the commandos to be used for regular operations, said Rajeev Kumar, the special inspector general of police, STF.        
	The commando selection process will begin soon and senior Lalbazar officers are in the process of finalising the training agency. The decision will be taken by next week. The STF top brass want the squad to be ready in a couple of months, said a source.        
	According to him, the emphasis during commando recruitment will be on physical fitness. The newly formed STF is also exploring ways to recruit skilled personnel for intelligence gathering and analysis, arrests and shooting.        
	The authorities feel an additional 30 per cent risk allowance will help in getting more talent on board.        
	An official of the home department said: Calcutta police has sent us a proposal to offer incentives to the members of the STF. We are working on it.        
	The proposal cites the incentives offered to the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) members in Mumbai. Those in the ATS combat force get 100 per cent additional allowance, officers 50 per cent and vehicle drivers 30 per cent.        
	Unless incentives are offered, you cant expect performance, said a senior home department official.         
	A carrot-and-stick policy is an option. The proposal calls for a provision for out of turn promotion for good officers. Those who do not deliver may be sent back to their parent unit, added the official.

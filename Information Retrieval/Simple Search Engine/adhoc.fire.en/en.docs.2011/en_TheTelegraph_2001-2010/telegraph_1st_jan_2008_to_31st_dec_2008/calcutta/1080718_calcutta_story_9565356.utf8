          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The gang that raided Shyamalbaran Biswass house in Barasat on Tuesday night was probably looking for some property documents, police said.        
	The retired joint secretary of the state government might have identified one of the raiders, which prompted the gang to kill him.        
	The sleuths have found blood stains in the almirahs locker, from where some property documents are missing. Some fingerprints have been collected from the locker.         
	We are trying to piece together bits of evidence that are surfacing. The fingerprints, it seems, do not match with that of Biswas or wife Deepali, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas police.        
	Biswas was found lying dead beside his unconscious wife in the bedroom of their house early on Wednesday.        
	The preliminary post-mortem report suggests that he was stabbed repeatedly and then hit on his head with a blunt weapon.         
	The injury was ante-mortem, suggesting Biswas was murdered.        
	The sleuths on Thursday briefly spoke to Dipali, who is admitted to hospital. They also talked to the couples daughter, Tumpa Das, who lives in Dum Dum with her family.         
	Biswass call details are also being scanned.

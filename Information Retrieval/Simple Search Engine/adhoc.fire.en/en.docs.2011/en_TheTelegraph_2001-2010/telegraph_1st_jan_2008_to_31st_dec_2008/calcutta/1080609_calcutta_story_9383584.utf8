                      Buddhist works of art                    Sacred art is intended to uplift the mind to thoughts of the spiritual. The use of art in religion is essential as it gives expression to concepts of the divine that words would fail to describe. Most Tibetan Buddhist art forms are related to the practice of Vajrayana or Buddhist tantra. It includes thangkas and mandalas, often including depictions of the Buddha and bodhisattvas. The act of creation of Buddhist art is as much considered a meditation as is the art object itself, which is created as an aid to meditation. Sand mandalas, representing pure surrounding in which to meditate, are created by monks before and after construction prayers are recited. Religious works of art are rarely, if ever, signed by the artist. Other Tibetan Buddhist art includes metal ritual objects like vajra and phurba. Tibetan Sacred Art, the ongoing exhibition of Tibetan Thangkas and sculptures, showcases an impressive array of works that, though sacred in intent, are enchanting to the aesthetic eye. Also featuring a series of paintings using Tibetan symbols and bodhisattva images by noted painter Annada Munshi.                  Event: An exhibition of Tibetan Thangkas and sculptures

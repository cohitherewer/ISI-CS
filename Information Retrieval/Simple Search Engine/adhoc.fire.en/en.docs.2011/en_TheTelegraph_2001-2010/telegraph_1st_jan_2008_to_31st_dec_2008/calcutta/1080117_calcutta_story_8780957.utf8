           Vision of epic immensity
          Oxford Bookstore, Calcutta, in association with Bloomsbury Penguin Books, India, presents the launch of Manil Suris much-awaited second novel, The Age of Shiva. The book has received excellent reviews abroad and promises to meet the expectations Suri had raised with his award-winning earlier offering, The Death of Vishnu. Of the book, writer Kiran Desai says,  In The Age of Shiva, Indias birth as a new nation parallels a womans complex psychological journey confronting tradition and modernity. Exchanging sentimentality for clear vision, Suri reveals an immense humanity, a tenderness for women making their way in a world of men.When the protagonist Meera is wedded to the compelling Dev, she finds herself thrust into the male-dominated landscape. It is only with the birth of her son, Ashwin, that Meera experiences fulfilment. She engulfs him with a love so deep, so overpowering that she must fear its consequences. Meeras unforgettable story, embodying Shiva as the symbol of upheaval, of the counter-force, places The Age of Shiva among the most compelling novels to emerge from contemporary India. The book will be launched by eminent writer Nabaneeta Dev Sen, and Sujata Sen, director, British Council East India, will be in conversation with the author. Tomorrow, a signing session with the author at Crossword, 8 Elgin Road, 4 pm.

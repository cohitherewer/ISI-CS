                      A creative experience                    The urgency to look for meaning in contemporary Indian art is, perhaps, due to a need to discover artists definite commitment to a specific set of concerns. Featuring works created specially for this show by a diverse group of established city-based artists, the ongoing exhibition aims to analyse their creative vision and relate it to their artistic identity within the paradigm of current cultural trends. Technology plays a major role in the show, not just as a media option, but as a subject within the artwork. Using a wide range of mediums including photography, sculpture, video and installation art, it examines the role of collective consciousness in modern art together with questions of belonging, spiritual relatedness, roots and rootlessness. The gallery space is used to weave a complex narrative of personal stories and experiences. Each work explores time and space, moving back and forth between what appears to be the present and the past, resembling the way the human mind chooses to recollect people, places and events. Participants include Jayashree Chakravarty, Aditya Basak, Chhatrapati Dutta, Paula Sengupta and Tapati Chowdhury (an artwork by her appears here).

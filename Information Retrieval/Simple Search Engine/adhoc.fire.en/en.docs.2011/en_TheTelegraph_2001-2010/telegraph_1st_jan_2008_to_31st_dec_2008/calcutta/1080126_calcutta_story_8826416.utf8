	For fine-food aficionados, its time to cheer. The city is set to get 20 more eateries in the next year. 
    
	Speciality Restaurants Pvt Ltd (SRPL), which opened the Mainland China outlet on Gurusaday Road seven years ago, will open the outlets, while ramping up its restaurant count to 100 in the next year.
    
	The group, which has 36 eateries in India and three power brands  Mainland China, Oh! Calcutta and Sigree  plans to achieve the three-figure mark through organic growth and acquisition of small-format operators in Italian, Mediterranean or Continental cuisine.
    
	February will see the company opening two new restaurants in Calcutta  a 158-seater Mainland China in the South City Mall and the first Sigree in the city, offering slow-fire cuisine from undivided India, at Silver Arcade, adjacent to Silver Spring, on EM Bypass.
    
	A second Sigree will lay its tables in South City in a months time. SRPL will introduce the first outlet from its theme-restaurant vertical, Machaan, with a simulated rainforest ambience, at Mani Square in March.
    
	Almost every new mall coming up in and around the city will have its quick-service Chinese format Haka, while the group is also taking its flagship brands to Siliguri and Durgapur.
    
	Calcutta, which gave us the launch pad to go full-steam ahead nationally and now internationally, will remain an area of focus in our expansion roadmap, Anjan Chatterjee, the chairman and managing director of SRPL, said on Friday. After London, a foray in Beijing is up next, by the end of this year.
    
	While private equity fund SAIF Partners has picked up 20 per cent stake in SRPL, the company, expecting a turnover of Rs 225 crore in 2008, is planning a public issue in 2011. We want to lead the way in institutionalising the restaurant business in India, Chatterjee stressed.

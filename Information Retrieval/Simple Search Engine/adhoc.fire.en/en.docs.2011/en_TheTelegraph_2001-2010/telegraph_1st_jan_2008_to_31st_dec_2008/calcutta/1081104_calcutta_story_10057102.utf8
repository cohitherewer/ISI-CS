                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vector shadow over NRS nurse death
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Kaberi Bhowmick                                  
	Nurses at Nil Ratan Sircar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital levelled allegations of negligence and suppression of facts over the death of a colleague against the authorities.        
	Kaberi Bhowmick, 32, a nurse at NRS living in the hospitals residential quarters, was admitted to the female medicine ward with high fever on October 22.        
	She was vomiting, having convulsions and complaining of pain in her joints. Her blood platelet count had also dropped significantly, said nurse Parbati Pal. Kaberi was taken to the ward in the afternoon but left on a bench for nearly an hour as there was no bed or trolley available.        
	Kaberi died on October 25 and officials put it down to cardio-vascular arrest.        
	All her symptoms indicated that she was suffering from dengue. Despite repeated requests, no blood test for vector-borne diseases was conducted, alleged nurse Rama Ghosh. She died due to negligence of the hospital.        
	Last month, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had slapped a notice on the hospital after several larvae-breeding spots were identified on the premises. The spots were identified by surveillance teams of the CMC.        
	The state health department had then issued an order asking all state-run hospitals and the public works department to clean garbage and accumulated water on their premises.        
	On Monday, the nurses alleged that despite the circular, the staff quarters were surrounded by garbage and accumulated fresh water.         
	They met the medical superintendent of NRS and demanded a probe by a former doctor of the hospital. They also demanded that 10 beds be reserved for the nursing staff.        
	I have no authority to conduct such a probe. The matter will be referred to the higher officials, said L.K. Ghosh, the NRS medical superintendent.        
	The hospital will refer the matter to the directorate of medical education.

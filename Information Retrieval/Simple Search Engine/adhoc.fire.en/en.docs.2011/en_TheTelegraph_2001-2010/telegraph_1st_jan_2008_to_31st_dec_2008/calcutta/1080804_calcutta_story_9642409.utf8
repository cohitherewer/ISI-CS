The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Doctors strike spreads
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Doctors strike spreads
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Junior doctors of three more state hospitals have decided to join the indefinite ceasework their colleagues at SSKM and Medical College and Hospital have called from Monday to press for an increase in the stipend.         
	The states healthcare services will function without around 12,000 junior doctors, with the ones in National Medical College, Chittaranjan Seva Sadan and Bankura Medical College announcing their decision to join the strike. The doctors will abstain from work in OPDs, wards and the emergency departments.         
	Interns, housestaff and postgraduate trainees of SSKM and Medical College had written to the state director of medical education, S. Banerjee, on July 28, threatening to go on strike within a week if their stipend was not raised.        
	The agitating doctors admitted that the ceasework would affect the health service but pleaded helplessness. Junior doctors in other states get a stipend of over Rs 15,000 a month and those in Delhi get Rs 28,000. In contrast, we get Rs 7,000 to Rs 9,000, said Wasim Khan, a postgraduate trainee at Medical College.         
	We had informed the director of our decision to go on strike in advance but he never met us or wrote back to us.         
	Director Banerjee described the junior doctors move as unethical.        
	Weve set up a three-member panel that will review the stipend structure. According to its recommendation, the stipend will be hiked from September 1, he said. The superintendents of the five hospitals are trying to ensure patients are not affected much.

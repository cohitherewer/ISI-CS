                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Accident cost triggers suicide
          A STAFF REPORTER                          An earlier picture of Kamal Das                                  
	A 54-year-old man, who was seriously injured in an accident six months ago, committed suicide by setting himself on fire early on Sunday at home, driven to despair by the cost of his treatment.        
	Kamal Das was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.         
	Relatives said Das had been depressed over the past few days as the cost of treatment after his accident had left him financially drained.         
	He had fractured one of his legs and also suffered injuries in the hip after being hit by a car near Hatibagan six months ago. The treatment was expensive and we did not receive any compensation as the car could not be traced, said Dass niece Reshmi.         
	Family members last saw Das around 1am, when he stepped out of his first-floor room where he used to sleep alone to go to the toilet. He poured kerosene on himself in his room and set himself ablaze, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	Around 5am Dass wife Rita saw smoke billowing from the room in their Sibdas Bhaduri Street home in north Calcutta. We broke open the door and found him completely burnt. There was thick smoke in the room, said daughter Namrata, 21, who recently joined a private telecom company.         
	Das ran the family business along with his two brothers till eight years ago, when the trio decided to sell the shop and divide the money among themselves.         
	My father then tried his hand at a sari business but he could not continue with it because of his failing health. The accident left him mentally devastated, said Namrata.         
	Uncles mental state worsened last Friday when he learnt that the doctor he went to after the accident treated him only for the leg fracture and ignored the hip injuries, said Reshmi.

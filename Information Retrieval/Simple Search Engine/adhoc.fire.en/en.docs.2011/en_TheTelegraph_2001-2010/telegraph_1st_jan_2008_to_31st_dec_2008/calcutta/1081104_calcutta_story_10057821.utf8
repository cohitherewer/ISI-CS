                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Waiver sought to scrap taxis
        A STAFF REPORTER                           Taxis over 15 years old have to be phased out by March 31                                        
	The state government has asked Hindustan Motors to increase the exchange discount on taxis to help implement the high court order for phasing out vehicles older than 15 years.         
	The transport department will also consider a sales tax waiver of about Rs 30,000 on each new taxi.        
	To implement the ban, about 7,000 of the 42,000 taxis plying in and around the city will have to be replaced by March 31.        
	Hindustan Motors has been asked to increase the exchange discount from Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000, said a senior official of the transport department.        
	A Hindustan Motors official said the company would send a written proposal to the government by Wednesday.        
	The government is trying to accommodate our demands, said Tarak Barik, the secretary of Calcutta Taxi Association. Bimal Guha of Bengal Taxi Association said the taxi owners would need a discount of Rs 70,000. We have asked for a simplification of the registration formalities to avoid paying a bribe of Rs 3,000 per taxi to police for clearance, said Guha.        
	The impasse over the phase-out of private buses and minibuses continued with operators refusing to negotiate till a verdict was reached on their appeal against the order.

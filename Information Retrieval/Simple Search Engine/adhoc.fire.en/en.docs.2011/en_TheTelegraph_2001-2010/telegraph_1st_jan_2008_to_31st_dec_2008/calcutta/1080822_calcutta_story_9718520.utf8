	Gangsters behind bars are running their business as smoothly as they did before landing in prison.        
	Sleuths stumbled upon the fact after being tipped off about an extortion plot of Seukumar Rajak, who has been lodged in Alipore Central jail for the past year.        
	Last week, Rajak had sent one of his aides, identified as Sisir, to collect Rs 50,000 from a trader as protection money. The police laid a trap for Sisir at the traders office in Bhowanipore and arrested him as soon as he turned up.        
	After Sisir admitted that he had acted on Rajaks order, we raided Alipore Central jail and arrested Rajak on charges of extortion, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police, detective department. Sisirs statement proves that the arrest failed to curb Rajaks criminal activities.        
	Rajaks interrogation revealed that his network was as active in Lake Gardens, Tollygunge and Bhowanipore as it had been before his arrest, said an officer.        
	Senior officers are concerned at the gangsters success in running their fiefdom from prison. We stop keeping an eye on criminals once they are arrested and lodged in jail. They take advantage of this and engage associates whose names do not figure in our records to keep the syndicate running, said an officer.        
	The criminals, too, are under compulsion to run their rackets from behind bars. The extortionists know that if they stop threatening businessmen and extorting money from them, the rival group will fill in the void, said an officer of the detective departments anti-rowdy section.        
	Mohammad Sahajada, who was recently arrested on charges of extortion, was caught red-handed while entering Alipore Central jail with a cellphone and the CDs of two English movies from court on Tuesday.        
	Someone supplied him the phone and the CDs in the prison van or in the court lock-up. Reserve Force personnel who were guarding the van and the lock-up are to be blamed, said another officer.        
	The sleuths suspect that other extortionists, including Gopal Tiwari, Gabbar, Gudda and Sona, are also running their businesses from prison through their associates. None seems to have stopped operation, said the officer.

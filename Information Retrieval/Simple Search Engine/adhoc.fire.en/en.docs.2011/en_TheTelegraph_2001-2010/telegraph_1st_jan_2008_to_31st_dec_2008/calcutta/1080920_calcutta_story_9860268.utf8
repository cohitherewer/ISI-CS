          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A branch manager of UCO Bank and five others were arrested on Friday on the charge of defrauding the organisation of Rs 3.45 crore.        
	Investigators said the Alipore branch of UCO Bank granted home loans to 35 applicants in 2006 without verifying their documents.         
	All these loans were sanctioned by the arrested manager, Asit Dam.        
	The bank started an internal probe after the recipients of the loans stopped paying their equated monthly instalments (EMIs). A police complaint was lodged after the authorities discovered that the apartments for which the loans had been granted either did not exist or belonged to people other than those who had taken money to buy these properties.         
	Dam knew the documents were forged and that the loans were being taken against fictitious properties, one of the investigators said.        
	According to the police, some agents had introduced the applicants to Dam for a commission of 5-10 per cent against each sanctioned loan.

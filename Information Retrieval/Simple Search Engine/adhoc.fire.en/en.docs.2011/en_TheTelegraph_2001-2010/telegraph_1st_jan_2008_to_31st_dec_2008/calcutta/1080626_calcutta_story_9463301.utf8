The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Principals for fees review
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Principals for fees review
  - Anglo-Indian ICSE schools raise hopes of partial rollback          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Heads of Anglo-Indian schools in the city on Wednesday decided to write to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations not to hike certain fees, or at least lower some of the revised charges.         
	A section of principals who attended a meeting of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools at St James School was at first reluctant to question the councils revised fee structure. But they later unanimously decided to request the council to review it.        
	Some principals were quoted as saying that the council had a legitimate reason to hike charges, including a four-time increase in the fee that students writing the Indian School Certificate and Indian Certificate for Secondary Education examinations have to pay from next year.        
	Others urged the association to request the council to lower some of the revised charges, especially the examination fees.         
	The Association of Heads of ICSE Schools has already accepted the councils proposals.         
	It appears from media reports that a section of guardians in Calcutta and also in other places in Bengal are disappointed with the hike in fees. As heads of schools, we felt it necessary to inform the council about the peoples reaction to the hike, said Gilian Rosemary Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School and a member of the councils executive committee.        
	The executive committee took the decision to increase its bouquet of fees on April 23, about 15 years after the last hike took effect. Schools have, however, individually increased their tuition fees during this period.        
	While exam fees have been increased from Rs 555 to Rs 2,100, every ICSE school will have to pay an annual registration charge of Rs 10,000, against the old rate of Rs 3,500.         
	Students will have to pay Rs 500  up from Rs 80  for a duplicate admit card. The fee for a duplicate statement of marks has been hiked from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000.

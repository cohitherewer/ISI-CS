The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Raids net cosmetic fakes 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Raids net cosmetic fakes 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The fake cosmetic products that were seized over the past fortnight. Picture by Soumen Bhattacharjee                                  
	Counterfeiters are flooding the market with imitations of branded cosmetics that are outwardly hard to tell from the real ones.        
	Garnier, one of the worlds most popular brands, is the latest victim of the racket. The enforcement branch seized a large quantity of cosmetics bearing the companys name during raids on some Canning Street shops during the past fortnight.        
	The fake products are near-perfect imitations of the Garnier Fructis range. They range from creams and gels to shampoos and hair-colour products, said C.K. Dutta, the deputy commissioner of the enforcement branch.         
	Leave alone customers, even company officials have found it difficult to spot the difference in the packaging. They confirmed a slight difference only after minute scrutiny, the official said.         
	The bulk of the imitation products is sold in the suburbs and rural belts. Kept in gunny bags, the products were about to be distributed among retailers when the raids were conducted.        
	We are trying to map the network. It seems several retailers of these products are unaware that wholesalers are stocking fakes, one of the investigators said.         
	Zaheer Khan, the chairman of an agency that helps companies tackle this menace, said his team gave police the information that was required to plan the raids. They acted immediately after we informed them, he said.         
	Garnier officials asked customers not to hit the panic button. We are concerned over fake products but customers need not worry as we, along with the police, are keeping a watch on the market to ensure that imitations do not infiltrate shops, P.L. Mishra, a senior legal officer of the company, said from Mumbai.

	Home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said on Monday that all police personnel in the state would be trained to operate modern combat equipment and tackle hostage situations.        
	The announcement came on a day when Union home minister P. Chidambaram who was in the city for a programme at the mint on Strand Road  met chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, police director-general A.B. Vohra and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti at Raj Bhavan to learn about Bengals security preparedness, sources at Writers Buildings said.        
	Chidambaram was keen to know our preparedness in handling crises like the one in Mumbai and other places. He also wanted the state administration to remain alert and increase security at vital installations and crowded places. Our officers briefed him about the states security arrangements, said a home department official.        
	The home secretary met Vohra and the police chief separately and announced the state governments decision to train West Bengal police and Calcutta police personnel.        
	He said the government also plans to train personnel of private security agencies as a second step towards increasing trained manpower.         
	We want police officers to train private security personnel as all star hotels, malls, multiplexes, schools and colleges have been asked to upgrade their security systems. We have already increased RPF personnel in Metro stations, said the home department official.

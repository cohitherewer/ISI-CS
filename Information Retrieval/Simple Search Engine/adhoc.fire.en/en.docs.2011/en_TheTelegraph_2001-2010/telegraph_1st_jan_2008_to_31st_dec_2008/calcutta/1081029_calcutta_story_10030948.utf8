	A 24-year-old cycling to work early on Tuesday so that he could celebrate Kali puja with his family in the evening was run over by a dumper truck at Hazra crossing.         
	Soumen Ghosh was on his way to the factory in Bhowanipore where he had been working as a welder for two years. His 22-year-old cousin Basudeb Dey, who works in the same factory, was behind him on another cycle. They reached the intersection around 8.30am.         
	We halted at the signal. As soon as the light turned green, a speeding HRBC dumper truck hit my cousins bicycle from behind. The two-wheeler was hurled to the left of the road but Soumen fell on the trucks path. The driver did not even try to brake, he just ran him over, recounted Basudeb.         
	He along with some pedestrians rushed Soumen to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The youth had sustained injuries on his head and chest.         
	The driver tried to speed away but residents blocked the trucks way. He was arrested by Kalighat police.         
	Soumen lived in Chakdah Thakurbagan, in the Regent Park police station area. His family members said he had set out early on Tuesday so that he could wrap up by afternoon and join the familys Kali puja celebrations.         
	My brothers cycle is intact. If he had been thrown out of the trucks way, instead of the cycle, he would have been alive, said Soumens brother Sujoy.

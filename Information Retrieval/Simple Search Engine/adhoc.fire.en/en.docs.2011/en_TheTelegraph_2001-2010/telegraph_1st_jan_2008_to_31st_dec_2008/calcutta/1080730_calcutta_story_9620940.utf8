	The undergraduate students at SSKM Hospital who were ordered out of the campus on July 25 following a clash cannot return to their hostels at least till the second week of August.        
	The college council of the hospital decided on Tuesday that the 330-odd students would be observed for a week after the classes resume on August 6.        
	If their conduct is satisfactory, they would be allowed to return to hostels after submitting an undertaking that they would not take part in violence, said Pradip Mitra, the director of the Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM.

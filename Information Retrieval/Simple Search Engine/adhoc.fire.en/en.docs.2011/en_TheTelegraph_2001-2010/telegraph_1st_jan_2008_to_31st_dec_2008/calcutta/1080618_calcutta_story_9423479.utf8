                      Songs of the soil                    Formed in 1998, Dohar is a group of energetic young people who have come together with a mission to spread the music of Bengals rustic soil. They represent the voice of the numerous bauls and fakirs, whose lyrical compositions have the power to enchant listeners with their heart-rending melody, form and flavour. Sange Dohar is a series of presentations dedicated to introducing Bengals rich folk music to an urban audience. It aims to discover the essence of folk music which, Dohar believes, lies in the rustic songs, so spontaneously composed and sung by the anonymous minstrels of our villages. The seventh evening of the series features folk songs from various regions of Bengal and the North-East, presented by Dohar. A performance by live puppets (manab putul) promises to make the programme more entertaining.                  Event: Bengali folk songs by Dohar When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

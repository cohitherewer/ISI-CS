  - Kumartuli artisans look forward to a four-day lull without idol touch          RITH BASU                          Idol-maker Ramchandra Pal gets his blood pressure checked on Sunday afternoon. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	Artisan Mintu Pal, 42, could have slept longer than usual on Mahasashthi but he was up by 6am  after just two hours in bed.         
	I did not have much to do but woke up out of habit. I have slept so little in the past few months that my body clock has gone haywire, explained Mintu, who sculpted 45 Durga idols this year.        
	Mintu has promised daughters Rima, 9, and Riya, 6, that he will step out on Saptami to buy a pair of dresses for them.        
	In the adjacent studio, Mintus cousin Dilip, 51, was still at work on Sashthi morning. Members of a puja committee knocked on his door at the crack of dawn to collect the idol they had placed an order for, but Dilip hadnt given the finishing touches till then. They sat impatiently as he hurried through the last few dabs of paint on the idol.        
	Come what may, I will sleep till late on Monday, he muttered, picking up the paintbrushes strewn on the floor after the visitors had gone. Dilip has sculpted 20 Durga idols this season.        
	The Puja lull comes after a pre-Puja storm. Most artisans were so busy post-Mahalaya that they could not even spare time to visit the home of a Kumartuli veteran who died last week. I felt so bad at not being able to visit his family even once. But it would perhaps have been the same had one of my relatives died, said Mintu.         
	Ramchandra Pal, who made 40 idols, had been feeling unwell, too, but did not consult a doctor until Sunday morning. I have hypertension, he said, the weariness showing on his weather-beaten face.        
	 Our work is still not over. We have sent karigars to puja mandaps to give the final touches. A small thing like setting up the chalchitra can make a big difference to the overall look. So, Sashthi is a busy day, too, said Dilip Pal, who had tried to present Mahishasura as Greg Chappell in Puja 2006. But we dont touch the idols after the ghat-sthapan on Saptami.        
	Puja starts for Kumartulis artisans on Saptami evening, after they have paid their apprentices wages with the payments received from puja organisers. My karigars have been part of my family for the last three-four months. They will now go home to Nadia, Howrah and Midnapore and return on Ekadashi to continue sculpting the Lakshmi and Kali idols, said Mintu.         
	For Dilip, Navami is the day to look forward to. We have a feast where mutton is a must. We take our families out in the evening.        
	But work is not far from Dilips mind even when he is pandal-hopping. I carry my camera along so that I can take pictures of the idols and artwork I like. That helps me learn, he smiled.

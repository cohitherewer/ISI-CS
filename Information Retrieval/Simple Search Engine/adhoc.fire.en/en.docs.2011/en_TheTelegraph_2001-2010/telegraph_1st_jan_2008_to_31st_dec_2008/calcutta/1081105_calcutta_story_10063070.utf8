                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Letters
           A dogs life: Tongs being used for catching stray dogs for sterilisation in Salt Lake. A Telegraph picture                             
	Apropos the report Comrades take over school, August 22, I was aggrieved to read that CPM cadres have taken over a 100-year-old minority educational institution (Beniapukur High Madrasa) for holding party meetings and conducting routine political activities.           
	It is shameful for a democratic country. How long will the people of Bengal endure such oppression by the ruling party?           
	A similar incident was reported in Metro on April 15, 2008, under the headline Cadres take over library, school.           
	Such incidents are indicative of the ruling partys indulgence towards its cadres even as they strangulate education and vitiate the cultural atmosphere of the state by illegally occupying public spaces. The local CPM councillors are not above suspicion either.           
	Higher authorities in the state government should take action to rescue these public institutions from the grip of cadres and arrange for them to be run normally.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                       
	Apropos the report Rs 150 to sterilise a stray, August 25, it is good news for the residents of Salt Lake that the authorities have taken, once again, an initiative to vaccinate and sterilise stray dogs.             
	I agree with the chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality that catching dogs with iron tongs is very cruel.           
	As a resident of Salt Lake and an animal lover, I want to thank the municipality for adopting more humane ways of controlling the number of the stray dogs. This step will not only help control the increasing population of stray dogs in the township, but will be the first step towards eradicating cruel and painful methods of catching animals.           
	Sourish Misra,
  Salt Lake                               
	 I was stunned to read how some residents of Ramesh Mitra Road beat up and kill stray dogs in the area ( Torture cell for strays, August 29). I wonder how people can be so inhuman. Do people who beat an animal till it stops moving have any human feelings?             
	I request each and every individual who reads this letter, especially the residents of Ramesh Mitra Road, not to be so cruel towards strays. The civic authorities should also take steps to sterilise strays to control their numbers.           
	Moumita Mazumder, 
  Madhyamgram                   
	Apropos the report Kids flight to Olympics grounded, August 21, it was amusing to learn that an 11-year-old boy had cycled six hours to reach the airport to catch a flight to China to meet Jackie Chan and watch the Olympics. He possesses great stamina, zeal and an adventurous streak. I wish his parents would be encouraged to make an athlete out of him so that he can shine in the Olympics in future. The nation needs children with determination.             
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia                       
	The report Shots near New Market, August 25, was most distressing. One fails to understand how extortionists continue to operate even when they are lodged in high-security prisons. It appears that some jail employees help the criminals operate from inside by providing cellphones and other amenities. It is imperative that prison security is beefed up.             
	A.S.Mehta, 
  New Alipore                       
	Apropos Sick boy endures bandh pain (August 21), kudos to Exide executive A.K. Bhoumik for arranging air tickets for critically ill Supan Biswas, whom he saw lying at Howrah station on a bandh day.             
	Bhupen Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park                               
	One wonders how the enlightened eight made the cover story of Metro on August 28 (Beat- the-bandh brigade). A greenhorn dislikes bandh as it hinders daily life. When a daily-wage earner opposes bandhs as a tool for protest, he puts his financial well-being above all, failing to understand that oppression, like in Nandigram and Singur, can rob his livelihood, too.             
	When you say no to bandh, you say yes to lack of transparency in public life, as in the Singur land deal. You say yes to the brutal murder and burning of Tapasi Malik, you say yes to traffic congestion and pollution by supporting subsidy in the form of cheap land for making small cars, you say yes to the atrocities of the police. And its not true that bandhs yield no results. A bandh called by the SUCI in the nineties forced this government to reintroduce English at the primary level in the state.           
	Chameli Pal, 
  Batanagar                   
	The article Season of sweetness, October 12, had informed that Jalajoga had folded up.             
	Jalajoga is very much blooming, spreading sweetness and cheer in its original avatar, the fabled mishti of Bengal. The brand has been bought over by Switz Foods Pvt. Ltd., the manufacturers of the Monginis brand of confectionery.           
	Jalajoga serves a wide range of traditional Bengali mishti from three exclusive locations in Calcutta  Lords crossing at Lake Gardens, Metiabruz and at The Food Plaza in Howrah station. Jalajoga sweets are also selectively available at all Monginis cake shops           
	Mohan Kumar Maitra,
  General manager,
  Switz Foods Pvt. Ltd.                     
	Metro replies: Strictly speaking, it would be wrong to say that Jalajoga has folded up. But Jalajoga, the shop selling mishti, turned itself into a cake-pastry shop quite a few decades ago. Since the article was on traditional sweets of Bengal, Jalajoga seemed a good case in point to show how some popular old brands are no longer in the reckoning.             
	Apropos the City Diary item Two in net for theft, November 3, Debu Das was the driver of Debasish Dutta, who is the captain of a ship. The error is regretted.       Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

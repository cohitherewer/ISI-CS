   A STAFF REPORTER
        
	M.P. Jain was interacting with his retailers after 11 days. ldquo;I was dying to be here and resume business, rdquo; said the cosmetics wholesaler, who owns an outlet on the second floor of Nandaram Market.
 
	Jain opened his shop on Tuesday, a day after the authorities allowed resumption of trade on the first six floors of the fire-ravaged building. And moments after offering puja in the shop, he found himself surrounded by customers.
 
	The scene was the same in most other shops, though the volume of trade in one of the biggest garment and garment accessories markets in eastern India was not a patch on what it was before the 100-hour blaze broke out at 1am on January 12.
 
	Inside the building, the floors were still wet and the air still heavy with the smell of soot, reminiscent of the brute blaze and the mammoth battle to douse it.
 
	Fearing that the building would be demolished from the sixth floor upwards, the Nandaram Market Traders rsquo; Welfare Association has moved Calcutta High Court. The case will come up for hearing on January 24.
 
	A meeting at Lalbazar on Monday mdash; attended by representatives of the civic body and the fire department, among others mdash; declared the building unsafe beyond the fifth floor.
 
	The association on Tuesday distributed forms to the traders in which they will state their losses. ldquo;This will help us maintain a record of the losses, rdquo; said Purushottam Agarwal, the president of the association.
 
	But while Nandaram was abuzz with activity, the adjoining Kashiram block was still filled with thick smoke. The staircases have crumbled and the floors mdash; littered with burnt merchandise mdash; cracked at several places.

	The developer of a property at the centre of a controversy over its nature has come up with a CMC document that terms the patch land, not a pond.
    
	The dispute on Maniktala Main Road on Saturday had triggered allegations of assault with dogs and firing in the air.
    
	Mani Group, the owners of the plot, handed over a set of documents to Metro claiming the land under scanner was not a pond, but plain land. 
    
	The available assessment records about the nature of the land at 32 Canal Circular Road since 1926-27 reveal that this was a plain land. We have checked the documents till 2005 and nowhere is it recorded as a pond. We had also checked with the land reforms department, said Subesh Ray, the senior vice-president of Mani Group.
    
	According to Mani Group, the developer purchased the 11-bigha plot on Canal Circular Road in 2005 from the Duttas and other stakeholders after verifying all assessment records.
    
	But the civic body, which has slapped a stop-work notice on the developer, is still checking its records. Our records suggest that it is a tank. The assessment reports that they are showing cannot be conclusive Still, we are checking all records, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya. 
    
	On Saturday, the site  adjoining Purbasha Housing Estate  became a battlefield when some residents protested work at the site. A group of youths along with the security guards at the site tried to chase them away by firing six rounds in the air.
    
	The skirmish  barely a few minutes after state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty left the site failing to convince the protesters to give up  left six injured.
    
	The neighbourhood was calm on Sunday, but the residents of Purbasha housing estate were determined to carry on with their fight.
         The copy of a CMC document, according to Mani group, which shows the tract as ldquo;land rdquo;
   
	We dont know what records the group has furnished. This is a pond according to the site plan of our estate and even the civic records corroborate that, said Chiranjib Deb, a resident of the estate that came up in the seventies.
    
	He found support in Anindya Karforma, the director-general (project management unit) in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), who issued the stop-work notice after visiting the site last week. The site is recorded in the CMC tank list as a water body. We had prepared the list in 1998-99, said Karforma.
    
	Mani Group, which has plans to create IT-office space on the site, claimed the civic body had never raised any objections when it filed an application for mutation of the land just a few weeks ago. 
    
	We had submitted all documents and we understand the mutation process is on, said Ray of Mani Group.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Five members of a Calcutta family holidaying in Sikkim died when their vehicle plunged 500 feet off the road en route to Gangtok from Baba Mandir on Monday afternoon.        
	Six other passengers and the driver were seriously injured and are being treated at Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial Hospital in Gangtok.        
	The victims were identified as Ashis Dhar, 50, his father Rakhal Kumar, 80, daughter Debparna, 22, and in-laws Pushpa and Satyen Biswas, both 70. The Dhars are from New Barrackpore and the Biswases from Haltu.        
	Debparna, a student of bio-technology at a private engineering college in Durgapur, died in hospital at 8.30pm, while the others were declared dead on arrival.        
	Two other members of the family  Ashiss wife Deepali and her sister Shefali Mitra - survived as they had not gone with the others to visit Baba Mandir near Nathu-la. Shefalis son Abhisek, who works for IBM, has left for Gangtok.        
	The six injured passengers are members of another family; the two groups had jointly hired the Mahindra Maxx. They are Subhas Chandra Dutta, 42, wife Suparna, 33, daughters Trisha, 11, and Disha, 4, a relative called Krishna and friend Bijoy Adak.        
	The driver, Dawa Tamang, blamed the cars malfunctioning brakes for the accident. But Subhas, a rice trader from Madhyamgram, said the vehicle was speeding and the driver lost control while negotiating a hairpin bend.        
	Rescue teams were sent to the spot. Our department will take the responsibility of looking after the injured and sending the bodies of the deceased to Calcutta, said Sikkim tourism secretary S.B.S. Bhadauriya.        
	The Dhar family had left for Siliguri on October 16, Abhisheks wife Sreetama told Metro. My mother-in-law (Shefali) had an asthma attack and stayed back at the hotel on Monday. Her sister Deepali decided to be with her, she said. I called up my mother-in-law at 4.30pm, but she had no clue about the accident. They were still waiting for the family to return.

                An unidentified man, in his early 50s, was found dead on the banks of Rabindra Sarobar on Thursday afternoon. A preliminary investigation said the man might have committed suicide by consuming pesticide. Police found a bottle of pesticide beside the body, but no suicide note.    Madhur Sarbabhaumya, 45, committed suicide on Thursday by hanging himself in the toilet of the income-tax office on Middleton Street. Police said the body of Madhur, who served notices for the office, was found in the eighth-floor toilet with a rope tied around the neck. Doctors at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital declared him dead. No suicide note was found.    The outpatients' department at Chittaranjan Seva Sadan hospital was plunged into darkness on Thursday morning. Hospital officials said a blown fuse had led to the power failure from 8am to noon, causing inconvenience to patients.    A fire broke out in an Ambassador, WB 23 B1872, belonging to a multinational bank, on Wednesday evening near Karunamoyee, in Salt Lake. The driver, Ashim Bhattacharya, was sipping tea at a stall after parking the car near the entrance of the bank. Suddenly, he saw flames coming out of the car. Bank officials brought out five fire extinguishers but failed to control the flames. The fire brigade was called, and one tender arrived to douse the fire. There were no casualties, but the rear window and the back seat were damaged. Traffic was disrupted in the area for around 15 minutes.

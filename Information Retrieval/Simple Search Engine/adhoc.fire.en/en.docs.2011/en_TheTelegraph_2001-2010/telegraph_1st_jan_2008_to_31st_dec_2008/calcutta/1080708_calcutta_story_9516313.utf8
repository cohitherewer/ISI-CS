          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The state transport department, which spends Rs 400 crore a year on subsidy, has a set a target of cutting losses by Rs 100 crore in the next six months.         
	Announcing the departments measures to increase revenue collection, minister Subhas Chakraborty said in the Assembly on Monday that the conductors of state buses would have to ensure at least 60 per cent occupancy per round trip.         
	We need to increase our revenue. State bus conductors will have to ensure 60 per cent occupancy per round trip daily. Appropriate action will be taken against the conductors who fail to achieve this, the minister said, while answering a question on the losses suffered by the department.         
	Sixty per cent occupancy means the conductor of a state bus will have to deposit the fares of at least 60 per cent of the total seats per round trip. If there are 60 seats on a bus, the conductor has to submit the fares for at least 36 seats (60 per cent of 60 seats) after a trip from the terminus and back.         
	This is the first time the government has set such a target for the staff operating its buses. So far, only the drivers and conductors of private buses have been worrying about occupancy as their earnings depend on it.         
	The government resolved to increase revenue collection following allegations that the number of ticketless passengers on state buses is high because the conductors dont care.         
	Inspection groups will start conducting surprise checks on state buses. Chakraborty said personnel from one state corporation would conduct the inspection of buses of another corporation.         
	The minister admitted that the losses of CSTC, WBSTC and SBSTC were on the rise but those of CTC and NBSTC were declining.         
	To cut expenses, the government has decided to deploy seven employees for each bus instead of nine. Some opposition members, including Manas Bhuniya of the Congress, said the government should maintain a staff-bus ratio of 6:1, as is the norm in other metros like Delhi.         
	According to the minister, one-fourth of the Rs 400 crore subsidy is spent on pension, gratuity, medical allowances and other financial benefits of the employees. The Rs 100 crore the government plans to save in the next six months do not cover these benefits.

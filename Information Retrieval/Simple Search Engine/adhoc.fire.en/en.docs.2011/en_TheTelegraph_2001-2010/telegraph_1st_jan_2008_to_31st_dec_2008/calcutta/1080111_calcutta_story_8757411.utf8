           Tracing footprints on the sands of time
          Oxford Bookstore, in association with Marg Publications, presents the launch of Purva Uttara: Past Forward, an edition of DVDs on the historical sites in India. The films made on Konark (KonarakChariot of the Sun ) and on Taj Mahal (Visions of Paradise  The Taj Mahal) are directed by Shyam Benegal and Zafar Hai, respectively. Benegals film on the Sun Temple at Konark begins with the significance of sun worship in India, dealing with the intriguing question as to why a darkened shrine had been built in honour of the suns brilliance. An attempt is made to reconstruct the grandeur of the structure through an examination of the what still stands. Zafar Hai focuses on the Mughals and their historical and social milieu. It speaks about the Mughal masterpiece in tomb architecture: Taj Mahal. The film chronicles the reactions it has evoked over centuries. Taj Mahal is not only the tomb of Shah Jahans beloved wife Mumtaz, but also a representation of the throne of God on the Day of Judgement. The film also considers the precursors of the Taj garden tomb.

                      Tracing the rhythm of life                    Dance is one of the many human experiences which cannot be suppressed. Dancing has existed at all times, and among all peoples and races. Dance is a form of expression given to man just as speech, philosophy, painting or music. Artist Suvra Chandra has felt the rhythm of the synchronised art form in her veins and the result is Image amp; Impression, an exhibition of her paintings on a long and cherished dream topic  dance. As Maya Angelou had once said, Everything in the universe has rhythm. Everything dances  so do the subjects of Chandras second solo exhibition of paintings. She says she has been tremendously inspired by the multi-faceted talent of Uday Shankar who was a gifted artist, trained at Royal College of Art, but later he changed track smoothly to become a world-renowned creative dancer. The lithe, fluid movement of the body inspires Chandra. She painstakingly traces these movements with precision and transfers them on the canvases. This gives a photographic feel to the moving body of the dancers on the canvases. The figures are well-balanced, in bright hues and emanating with raw energy. She explores the various dance forms in her works and this lends variety to her paintings. Chandra traces the rhythm of life in this series.

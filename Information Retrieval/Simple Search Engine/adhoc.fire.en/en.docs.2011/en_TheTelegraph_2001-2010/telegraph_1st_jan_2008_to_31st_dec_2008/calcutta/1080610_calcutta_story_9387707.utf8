          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          The Victoria Memorial authorities have been accused of failure to carry out high court orders and protect the monument. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	Environmentalist Subhas Dutta on Monday filed a petition in Calcutta High Court, alleging that the state government had failed to carry out court orders to protect the Victoria Memorial Hall from pollution.         
	The order, passed on September 28 last year by a division bench, had asked the government to follow certain guidelines to cut down on the pollution level around the monument.         
	The court had directed the state government to shift the Esplanade bus terminus to a site at least three km away from the Memorial within six months. No action has yet been taken in this regard, said Dutta.        
	The government was also directed to synchronise traffic on the roads within a radius of three km of the Memorial to reduce pollution due to auto emission. But pollution is still on the rise in the area due to auto emission, he said.        
	A green belt was supposed to have been developed around the roads close to the Memorial to reduce pollution. That plan, too, has not been implemented, Dutta said.        
	He complained that the Victoria Memorial Hall authorities were asked to shift the administrative office from the Memorial complex. It was also ordered that arrangements should be made for harvesting rainwater to stop lifting of ground water. No action has been taken on that count yet, Dutta said.        
	Moreover, the Memorial authorities has not yet made a catalogue of the 27,000 valuables in its possession. This is necessary for the safety and security of the valuables, he said.        
	Dutta demanded an order from the court, asking the state and the Memorial authorities to take up the issues immediately.         
	The court, during its last hearing on the case, had asked Dutta to give a list of the court directives that have not been implemented yet.

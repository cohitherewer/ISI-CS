        Method of lsquo;midsummer rsquo; madness
   British Council, in association with Reliance Communications, presents Tim Supple rsquo;s adapatation of William Shakespeare rsquo;s romantic comedy, A Midsummer Night rsquo;s Dream. Performed in English, Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Sinhalese, Bengali, Marathi and Sanskrit, Supple rsquo;s adaptation of the Bard rsquo;s play is a passionate, energetic, thrilling and beautiful re-telling of a widely-loved story. The play is among the most difficult ones as its performances entail a large cast and very peculiar situations. The story is about four young lovers in the city of Athens whose adventures and pursuits of each other, interestingly, are controlled by the inhabitants of fairyland, prinicipally by the king of fairies, Oberon, whose wish to get his wife Titania rsquo;s Indian page-boy makes him resort to mischief. The two plots concerning the two worlds are connected by the wedding of Duke Theseus of Athens and the Amazonian queen, Hippolyta. The play also uses the motif of a stage within the stage, where Oberon becomes playwright and controls the plot through his eccentric servant Puck. This adaptation, commissioned by British Council, was very well received by audiences in the major metros of India last year. It has since had sell-out runs at the Roundhouse in London, in Verona and twice in Stratford-upon-Avon, at the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company and is scheduled for a world tour this year. 

 Event: Performance of Tim Supple rsquo;s adaptation of Shakespeare rsquo;s A Midsummer Night rsquo;s Dream When: January 16 (7 pm); January 17 (8 pm); January 18 (7 pm) Where: Kala Mandir

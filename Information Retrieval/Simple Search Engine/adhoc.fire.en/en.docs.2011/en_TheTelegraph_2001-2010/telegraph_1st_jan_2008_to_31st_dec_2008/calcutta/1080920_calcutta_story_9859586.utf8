The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Schoolteacher harassed for dress defiance 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Schoolteacher harassed for dress defiance

	Another teacher has raised the hackles of the moral police by coming to school in salwar-kameez.        
	When Paramita De, 30, reached Kalikapur Basanti Devi School in Sonarpur on Friday, she was shocked to see posters on the school gates and walls ridiculing her for wearing salwar-kameez to school.         
	The posters were pasted by Chhatri Sangathan, a little-known students organisation.         
	The incident comes barely a few weeks after a 24-year-old teacher, Kasturi Sen, faced the ire of the authorities of Akra Krishnanagar Girls High School in Mahestala for wearing salwar-kameez to school.         
	Hearing of Fridays incident, local CPM MP Sujan Chakraborty expressed his surprise. Teachers can come to school wearing any attire that is decent, he said.         
	Determined to continue wearing salwar-kameez, Paramita said she would inform the headmistress, the managing committee and the district inspector of schools of the incident on Monday.         
	The resident of Baranagar joined the school in June 2005. Initially, she said, she used to come in saris, but switched to salwar-kameez as it is more convenient for travelling.         
	On July 8, when I came to school in a salwar-kameez for the first time, headmistress Sukla Roy asked me to come in saris. She also informed the secretary and president of the school, who gave me the same advice, Paramita said.        
	Roy, however, denied asking Paramita to come in a sari.        
	While some of the teachers of the school are supporting Paramita, a section of senior teachers agrees with the authorities.        
	Most of the guardians and students, however, support the teacher.

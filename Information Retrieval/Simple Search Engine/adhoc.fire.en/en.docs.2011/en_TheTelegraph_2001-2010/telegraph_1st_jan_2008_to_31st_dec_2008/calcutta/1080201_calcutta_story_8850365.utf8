           Brown girls in the ring
          Breaking away from the shackles of a conservative society ruled by male hegemony, a number of young girls in the city try to live out their dream of being secure and independent in a unique fashion. They train themselves to be amateur boxers, not merely to fight in the ring, but to obtain a job at the end of it all. Boxing Ladies showcases 70 black-and-white photographs of these girls by David Trattles, thematically divided into five parts: club, home, streets, park and ring. A pictorial reflection of an exercise of patience and determination, it symbolises their efforts to live life with dignity and on their own terms.
         Event: An exhibition of photographs by David Trattles When: Till February 3; 11 am - 8 pm Where: Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

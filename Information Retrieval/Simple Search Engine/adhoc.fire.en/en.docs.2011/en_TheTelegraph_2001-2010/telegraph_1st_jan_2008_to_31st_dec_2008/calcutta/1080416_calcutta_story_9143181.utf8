	Two people were killed and four were injured in two road mishaps on the northern fringes of the city on Tuesday morning.         
	Around 6.30am, 54-year-old Gour Chandra Roy was killed when a truck moving towards Sodepur overturned and hit an autorickshaw near Kalyani Expressway.         
	The autorickshaw was going to Sodepur. It had stopped to pick up a passenger when the truck hit it, said an officer of Ghola police station.         
	The driver of the truck had lost control over the vehicle before it overturned, said witnesses.         
	Roy and another passenger were in the autorickshaw, apart from the driver. The three-wheeler skidded off the road after being hit. The other two were injured in their arms and chest, said Gopal Mondal, a vegetable vendor who saw the mishap.        
	Roy was taken to Panihati State General Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	The driver and help of the truck escaped. Around 8am, 50-year-old pedestrian Parimal Das was knocked down by an unidentified vehicle in HB Town. He died on the spot, said witnesses.         
	The residents of the area detained the driver of a car and handed him over to the police, but the officers are not sure if his vehicle hit Das.         
	The Madhyamgram railway overbridge has increased the average speed of vehicles on Madhyamgram Road. We are increasing the number of traffic officers in the area to prevent accidents, said P.K. Tripathi, the additional superintendent of Barrackpore police.

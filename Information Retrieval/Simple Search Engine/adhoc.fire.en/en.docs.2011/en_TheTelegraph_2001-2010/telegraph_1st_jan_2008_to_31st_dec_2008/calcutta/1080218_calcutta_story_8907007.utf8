The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Scissor hand on civic heritage list
                                                                                                               Scissor hand on civic heritage list
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Visitors at Jorasanko Thakurbari, a heritage structure. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The civic body is set to prune the list of heritage buildings, erasing more than 600 structures from among 1,365.        
	The owners of the delisted buildings, which do not deserve the heritage tag, will be free to redevelop the premises, said a civic official. The revised roster of around 650 buildings and the list of structures that will lose the tag will be placed before the mayoral council for approval.        
	A six-member sub-committee appointed by the municipal commissioner to grade the heritage structures has found that more than 600 undeserving buildings had been included in the list.        
	Three such buildings are 2/2A Harrington Street, 11 Short Street and 39 Shakespeare Sarani. These are among the structures to be struck off the list.        
	The sub-committee included Barun De, Gautam Sengupta, Samir Rakshit, Anjan Mitra, Debasis Basu and Indrajit Chaudhury.        
	We plan to publish the revised list by August, said civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya had asked the commissioner to prune the list as he thought it was too big, given the resource constraint of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).        
	The CMC doesnt have the resources to look after the preservation of so many buildings. Hence, we need to cut down the list after careful consideration of the status of the buildings, said the mayor.        
	The sub-committee has drawn up a three-tier gradation system, along with recommendations on their use.        
	The buildings under Grade I include the residences of Rabindranath Tagore, Subhas Chandra Bose, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Vidyasagar and Raja Subodh Mullick. The houses of Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Bidhan Chandra Roy are among those given the Grade II status, while the buildings associated with CV Raman, Uday Sankar, Jibanananda Das and PC Roy are under Grade III.        
	The gradation criteria include the stature of the personalities involved and the historical value, architecture, aesthetic beauty and the present condition of the structures.

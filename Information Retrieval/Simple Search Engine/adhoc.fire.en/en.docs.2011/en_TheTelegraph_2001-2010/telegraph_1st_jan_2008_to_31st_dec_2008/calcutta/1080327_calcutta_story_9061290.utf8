The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slum, home in agency focus
                                                                                                               Slum, home in agency focus
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The CMDA on Wednesday finalised a slew of projects that will be undertaken in the current fiscal.        
	Special emphasis will be laid on housing projects for minorities, providing surface water to civic bodies and development of slums.        
	We have allocated Rs 8 crore for housing projects in minority-dominated areas and planned to construct 1,703 flats, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who chaired the budget and planning meeting of the CMDA during the day.        
	Among the other projects are laying a green corridor along the EM Bypass, from Garia to Ultadanga, and another between the Bypass and Red Road. We will also construct three elevated roads at Ruby Park, Parama Island and Bagha Jatin, said CMDA chief executive officer P.R. Baviskar.        
	The agency will also focus on collection of arrears from the 30 civic bodies, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), to which it supplies surface water.        
	The CMC owes us Rs 592 crore and the other civic bodies together Rs 125 crore, said Bhattacharya. Before providing a new connection, we will insist on installation of a meter to monitor consumption of water.        
	The projected budget expenditure for the current fiscal is Rs 1,351 crore, up from Rs 369 crore in the last fiscal.

                      New talents in Kathak                    Essentially a concert artist of repute, Pandit Ravi Kichlu has left his mark on the rich tapestry of Indian classical music in more fields than one. Combining the twin qualities of a singer and a composer, his recitals reflected his acumen in a variety of musical genres  classical, ghazals and even basic regional repertoire. After his demise, his wife Veena Kichlu set up the Pandit Ravi Kichlu Foundation. A laudable venture of discovering and promoting young talents in music and dance, it grants scholarships to potentially meritorious aspirants and acknowledges the best talent of the year through an annual award. It also proposes to carry out social service in the area of education, medical relief and other public utility services. This year, the Foundation hosts its 15th Golden Talent Contest in the discipline of Kathak dance, with its preliminaries being slated for today and tomorrow. Todays prelims will be held for contestants of senior category A in the age group 16 to 25 years. Contestants of junior category B in the age group 9 to 15 years will perform in tomorrows prelims.

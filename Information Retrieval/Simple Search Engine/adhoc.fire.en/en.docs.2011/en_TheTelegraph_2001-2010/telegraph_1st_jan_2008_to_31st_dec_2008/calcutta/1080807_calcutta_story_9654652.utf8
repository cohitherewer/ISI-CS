The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | iPhone in stores from Aug 22 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       iPhone in stores from Aug 22

	The iPhone, the most talked about gizmo since Apple launched the iPod, will start selling in Calcutta from the midnight of August 21-22 as part of a 70-nation launch.         
	Bharti Airtel announced on Wednesday that the iPhone 3G would be available at Airtel Relationship Centres in the city from August 22. Vodafone will also start offering the phone the same day but has not revealed details. The phone is likely to be clubbed with a SIM card.         
	The companies are tight-lipped about the price. Analysts estimate that the 8 gigabyte (GB) model will be priced between Rs 16,000 and Rs 18,000, while the 16 GB version will cost between Rs 24,000 and Rs 28,000.         
	In the US, the 8 GB iPhone costs $199 and the 16 GB model $299. Buyers, however, have to commit to monthly plans of service provider AT amp;T for extended periods.         
	The iPhone 3G is the updated version of Apples iconic smartphone with an in-built iPod that can be operated by touching its screen.         
	After the upgrade, the iPhone allows data transfer through the 3G network, which is faster than currently available options, besides offering access to Global Positioning System (GPS) services and thousands of applications, such as providing minute-by-minute update of Olympic scores and traffic jams.         
	The Indian government recently announced its 3G policy and rollouts are expected by early next year.         
	The launch of the new iPhone on the midnight of July 10-11 saw frenzied buying in the US, the UK and several other countries.         
	In the US, thousands of new owners overloaded the Apple website, preventing others from downloading the software necessary to activate their phones.         
	In several cities, spots were sold on queues to buy the phone. The first man to purchase the iPhone 3G in London bought his spot on the auction website eBay.         
	According to a recent Gartner study, the iPhone has risen to third position globally in the smartphone category in terms of market share, selling over 1.7 million handsets in nine months. Apple CEO Steve Jobs aims to sell 10 million iPhones by the end of the year.         
	Imagine, Apples premium reseller store at Salt Lakes City Centre, is readying for a rush.         
	If Apple and the mall authorities allow us, we would like to keep the store open at midnight on August 21, said owner Sanjay Chordia.         
	Fifty to 100 people visit the store daily to find out when the iPhone is going to be launched. Interest peaked after Apple announced the worldwide launch in early June. The footfall is a bother sometimes, but it has generated spin-off sales, he added.         
	The would-be customers arent bothered by the prospect of a couple of hours in the queue. I have been waiting for the iPhone for over a year. I dont mind standing in a queue at midnight for it, said 24-year-old Neel Bose.         
	Those more restless have already bought smuggled iPhones available in the grey market.         
	But these phones lack service support. Software upgrades may also disable iPhones whose SIM cards have been illegally removed.

   Ramkinkar in Focus mdash; Through the eyes of Devi Prasad is a unique exhibition of photographs which offers an almost complete retrospective of Ramkinkar Baij rsquo;s works from 1920 to 1978. Over a long and prolific career, though relatively less acknowledged, Baij worked in a dialogue with his own immediate social reality and various idioms of the conventional and the unconventional in art. The exuberant personality of the late artist is infused into all his works. The exhibition includes original works collected by Baij rsquo;s pupil Devi Prasad. The photographs showcased take us to the immediate, personal and spontaneous world of the artist, including his drawings: village scenes, quick sketches and some watercolour landscapes that show the worldview in which Baij was located. There are portraits of his muses, contemporaries and the people who had inspired him. Baij rsquo;s fame and respect come principally from his sculptures (one of them, titled Santhal Family, appears here), that are remarkably sensuous and are experimental at the same time. Baij is a genius whose works form a rich treasure-trove of our national heritage. The exhibition has been curated by Naman P. Ahuja. 

 Event: An exhibition of photographs of Ramkinkar Baij rsquo;s works taken by Devi Prasad When: Till January 31 (except Mondays); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Anant Art Gallery, 18A Alipore Road

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The stamp of babudom
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The stamp of babudom
										      In the final part of his account, Czech Mike Hruska talks   about his trials at a post office in the city of his birth                                           
	I have often mentioned with great fondness to my wife the great jewel of Park Street, namely, the Oxford Bookstore. Every time I went to browse or buy books it was as if time had stood still. My last visit had been in the early 1990s. At the entrance customers were always greeted courteously by a turbaned man-mountain with a proud bearing, an impressive handlebar moustache and a Lee Enfield rifle.         
	The store itself was a labyrinth of deep canyons of books running from floor to ceiling. Browsing the top of the bookshelves required jeans and an old shirt, for dust was king there. Each customer needed to be something of a rock climber to negotiate the ladder that reached the upper shelves, where most of the treasures could be found.         
	The Oxford Bookstore covered every subject under the sun and it had many books that had lived on its shelves for decades. The staff were not just courteous and helpful: they were indispensable. If I was seeking books on Assamese umbrellas of the 19th century, they could direct me to the appropriate shelf unerringly. It was worth battling with the dust, for there were real treasures there.        
	After I had made a choice after an hour or two of pleasurable browsing, someone would say: Sahib has made a choice, can I help?         
	Handing him the books, I would accompany him to a bespectacled teller seated behind an elevated podium, surrounded by glass but with a little porthole for the ensuing transaction. At first an invoice book was prepared with at least four or five carbon copy papers placed symmetrically between the pages. The teller proceeded to enter the title, name, and price of every book on to the first page of the invoice book. Then the total was calculated manually and, as if the end result of this calculation was not to be trusted, out came the calculator for verification, a process usually repeated at least two or three more times for absolute verification. Finally all the carbons were extracted and I would receive one invoice copy while the others were delivered to other parts of the bookstore.         
	I would take my invoice to pay and again there was another verification calculation using both principles of manual addition and the calculator.         
	In response to the question whether I wished to pay by cash or credit, I would reply, Credit, please and hand over my card. My card would then be inspected to ascertain whether it was real or fake.         
	This is a foreign card? I would hear. Yes, but it is a Visa card issued by the ANZ Bank of Australia and they own and operate ANZ Grindlays in India. The mention of Grindlays provided reassurance. I would pay; my invoice slip had now acquired a wonderful PAID stamp on it.         
	Where next? I would ask. To the wrapping section. I would proceed to the section where the wrapping person checked the inventory of books on his invoice copy against my invoice copy. On verification that the books had been paid, my invoice was stamped again and he would put his invoice on a needle with other invoices.         
	The books were wrapped and someone else took the books to another table where I would finally receive the books and have my invoice stamped once more with Verified.         
	Is it over? I would wonder, moving to the door. But, no, the security guard had his invoice copy and would verify that it had been paid and wrapped and I would get another stamp on my invoice. Finally, I would emerge with my books and a multi-stamped invoice.         
	Why do I go into such detail about this process? It represents something I love about this country: the human face of business, a gentler way of doing things rather than the cold interface with a PC, barcode readers and printers spitting out bits of paper.         
	But the end result was the same, namely, I emerged with my books.        
	Alas, the Oxford Bookstore as I knew it is no more. The books now on sale represent those that you might find in any modern bookstore; its little walkways and corridors are now replete with popular history and travel, contemporary literature, coffee-table books, mystery novels, popular fiction, magazines, periodicals; it has a tea room and gift store. And I venture that no one will know where to find books on Assamese umbrellas any more. Something has been lost in this headlong drive for modernity.        
	Counter trouble        
	In 2006, I renewed my friendship with Calcutta post offices, where I was reminded that not all bureaucratic processes are as quaint and welcoming as those at the Oxford Bookstore.         
	I went to buy some stamps at Free School Street post office. Behind a huge counter was an assortment of staff spaced every few metres, occupying high chairs and looking busy. At a counter named Stamps, I dutifully presented myself and was directed by A to go to B at the Assessment Counter.         
	The clock started ticking. B took my postcards  seven small and four large  and counted them. He put each one on a scale to weigh them, despite seven being identical. Every one of the 11 cards was weighed and verified. Then he pulled out an information sheet and advised that each card required a Rs 8 stamp.         
	B then directed me to C to actually buy the stamps. I asked for 11 Rs 8 stamps. C grew alarmed, as he noted that the cards were of two sizes. Oh. No, sir! That is not possible. He counted the postcards again and verified that seven were small and four large. Cant be right! I have to check.         
	C then went to see his boss, D, to query if the larger postcards required more stamps. As I gazed at this bureaucratic tableau with my blood pressure slowly rising, I noted that boss D was unsure; he picked up the phone and called his superior somewhere within the bowels of the building.         
	Finally an answer  yes the larger cards required a Rs 15 stamp. Wonderful, I thought; so let us get on with it and buy the stamps.         
	But this was only the beginning. C at the stamp counter had to count the postcards again, seven small and four large. During the count he noted that some postcards were from Hong Kong; this seemed to puzzle him. I assured C that there was nothing sinister about this  we had had no time to post them off in Hong Kong.         
	Seemingly satisfied, he subjected the postcards to another count and finally opened the stamp book and counted off the requisite stamps. Finally, progress. I mentally calculated Rs 116 for the stamps and reached for my wallet. But, no. C at the stamp counter then had the nerve to ask me for my Biro so that he could do the calculations himself on paper. Not once, not twice, but three times! We agreed on Rs 116.         
	As I paid for the stamps, I noted that they had no adhesive on the back and had the temerity to ask if he had stamps that had an adhesive. C then calmly informed me that I would have to cross the street to a small shop and buy some glue.         
	At this juncture I exploded and asked him politely to get up off his rear and get me some glue immediately. After some protestation, he sheepishly walked to E at the Registrations Counter, only to produce a filthy bowl of glue and invited me to dip my finger into it, wet the back of the stamps, and affix them to the cards.         
	I had to wait another 15 minutes to ensure that all the cards were dry prior to proceeding back to F to get the stamps cancelled before placing them in the post box.         
	I was not surprised to note that there was no Customer Satisfaction Counter. This little episode lasted all of 55 minutes.         
	This love of the desk, paper, the rubber stamp, the process, the fear  often financial  that leads one to check and countercheck ones work seems to pervade virtually all sections of society. It may have originated in the bureaucracy of the Empire, or it may be a legacy of the Marxist culture and union power that threw a mantle of lethargy over virtually everything, encouraging inertia and stifling initiative.         
	Whatever its source, a cult of desk worship, paper generation, checks and counter checks has developed. Granted, the commercial sector appears to have become more pragmatic, but the government sector still appears to wallow in its dogma, process and paper.        
	Banners amp; bonhomie         
	Calcutta is a paradox, a city of contrasts, conflicts and contradiction. It is a city that engages you emotionally: it assaults all your senses  the mass of people, the poverty, the noise, the traffic, the supremacy of the car horn, the pollution, the traffic, the feeling of decay, the street cooking, the paan remnants on the walls and streets, the overpowering smells, the banners and slogans, the street secretaries with their typewriters, the street hustlers, the children, the crows, the cows, the dilapidated public transport system  but then it also surprises with moments of wonderful, unanticipated humanity, culture, humour and spirit.         
	It is this latter side of Calcutta that I treasure and that feeds the love and respect I still hold for the city of my birth.        
	(Concluded)

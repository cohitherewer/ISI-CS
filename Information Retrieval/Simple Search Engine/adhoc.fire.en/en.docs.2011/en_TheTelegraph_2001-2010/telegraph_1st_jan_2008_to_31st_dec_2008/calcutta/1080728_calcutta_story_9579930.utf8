The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Surface water for the eastern fringes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Surface water for the eastern fringes

	The civic body is planning to set up a water treatment plant on the citys eastern fringes to ensure a steady supply of filtered surface water to the burgeoning population there.        
	The Dhapa plant, which will treat 30 million gallon of water daily, will be set up at a cost of Rs 300 crore. The water will be brought from the Hooghly through an underground network of pipes.        
	The environment impact assessment report of the project has been submitted to the East Calcutta Wetlands Authority, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay. I hope work will start soon.        
	In the absence of surface water, the million-odd residents of the eastern fringes  the count is increasing by the month  have to depend on underground water and hence, are exposed to health hazards.        
	The need of the hour is to ensure a steady supply of surface water to the housing estates coming up on either side of the Bypass. Or else, the residents will soon start suffering from arsenic poisoning and gastro-enteritis, said chief municipal health officer Debdwaipayan Chattopadhyay.        
	Arsenic contamination has been detected in Barasat and Baruipur. The Rajarhat township is coming up between these two zones. Without surface water, the residents will be forced to draw on the underground aquifer, increasing the risk of arsenic poisoning, Chattopadhyay added.        
	According to an estimate of the civic water supply department, more than 20 million gallons of water are drawn daily from the underground reserve.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the area was so removed from the riverfront, that it was not possible to supply water from the Tallah-Palta network or Garden Reach. The only option is to set up a plant which will treat water drawn from the river and supply it to the residents.        
	The plant was conceived in 2006, when the project cost was estimated at Rs 98.75 crore. The two-year delay has resulted in the cost escalation.        
	Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb has laid down three conditions for allowing the project, one of which requires the civic body to arrange for the sanitation of around 5,000 people of lower-income group in Dhapa.

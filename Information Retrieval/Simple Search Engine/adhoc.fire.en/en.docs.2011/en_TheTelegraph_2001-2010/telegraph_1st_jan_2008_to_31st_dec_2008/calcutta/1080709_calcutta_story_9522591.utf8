The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HS students lose out in admissions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HS students lose out in admissions
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	The level-playing field is not level enough as Higher Secondary students get elbowed out of certain courses in top colleges by compatriots from other boards.        
	In many colleges, students from the Delhi boards  ISC and CBSE  have taken 80 to 95 per cent of the seats in English honours, for instance.        
	In Presidency College, which has 30 seats in English, all the students whose names appear on the first list of selected candidates are from ISC and CBSE curricula.        
	Ishani Das (name changed), an HS student who has applied for English honours in Presidency with a score of 67 per cent in the subject, said she could now hope to get admission only if some of those selected dropped out.        
	The HS council has failed to make the examination system as high scoring as the ISC and CBSE, she said.        
	A conscious decision to pull HS marks to the levels of other boards led to a jump in the pass percentage this year to 80 for the first time.        
	It seems that is not enough in the light of a Calcutta University directive last year, stopping colleges from deducting a percentage of the marks of students from the Delhi boards.        
	While that instruction was issued to create a level-playing field for ICSE and CBSE students, it led to reverse discrimination against HS students.        
	In the directive, the university also asked the colleges to put out a single list of selected candidates, scrapping the practice of preparing two lists  one for HS students and the other for ISC and CBSE candidates. This exacerbated the trend because ISC and CBSE students monopolised the lists, particularly in English, sociology and political science, because of their higher marks.        
	ISC and CBSE students had started figuring in greater numbers on the merit lists from last year, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic) of Calcutta University.         
	In 2007, ISC and CBSE students took 60-70 per cent of the seats in the reputable colleges, sources said. Till 2006, their proportion was 40-50 per cent.        
	Sanjib Ghosh, the principal of Presidency, said: It appears from a quick glance at selection lists that the phenomenon this time could be new. We are examining the trend.        
	In Jadavpur University, too, HS students have taken only seven of the 50 seats in the highly rated English department.        
	They have been outnumbered in other colleges, such as Lady Brabourne, Bethune, Asutosh, Scottish, Sree Sikshayatan and Gokhale, too.

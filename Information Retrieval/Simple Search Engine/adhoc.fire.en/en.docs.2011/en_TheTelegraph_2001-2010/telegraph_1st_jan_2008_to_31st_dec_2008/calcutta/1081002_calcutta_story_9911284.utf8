  - Artisans battle against odds          A STAFF REPORTER                          A Kumartuli artisan paints an idol during power cut. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Kumartuli artisans are fighting all odds to deliver idols on time and earn their living.         
	The problems plaguing them include frequent power cuts, uncertainties over the proposed revamp of the idol hub and pollution concerns.        
	We didnt have electricity for around two-and-a-half hours on Tuesday. We were told it was a cable fault. Our work suffered a lot, said Nemai Chandra Pal, the president of the Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskrity Samity.        
	Last week, the idol hub plunged into darkness a number of times. The supply is disrupted in phases, with each round of power cut stretching to an hour or more. We have to sit idle till the supply is restored, said Babu Pal, another artisan.        
	We are supposed to get power on an emergency basis for a month before Puja. But that never happened, Mintu Pal.        
	As for the proposed rehabilitation, the government had announced two months ago that the artisans would be relocated to a stretch between Bagbazar and Sovabazar. But traders occupying the stretch by the Hooghly have objected to the plan.        
	CMDA officials held talks with Kumartuli Mritshilpa Sanskrity Samity representatives to ascertain how much space each idol-maker would need in the temporary hub.        
	The artisans are also peeved that pollution concerns  stemming from the use of lead-based paints on idols  are raised just before work for the autumn festival starts.        
	The authorities should make an arrangement in advance, said an artisan.

                      Enigmatic images                    As a creative artist, Rebanta Goswami offers a unique vista that only visuals can unfold. His paintings are both baffling and beautiful, distinguishing and thought-provoking, often venturing into the zone of neural plasticity. There are allusions to magic and alchemy in his works; human and animal forms either interchange their roles or are combined to the point of utter absurdity. Laden with symbols, the narratives, however, take the viewer to the primal depth of the collective unconscious. Through the Glass Unbroken, the ongoing solo exhibition of his works on canvas and paper, features characteristically bizarre images that build up cryptic narratives steeped in memory and illusions. A pedlar walking like a somnambulist ignoring a barking dog, a human head resembling the crater of a living volcano, a horned ram against a moon as a recurrent motif, nocturnal sights with weird-looking animals staring at viewers  present a series of seamless narratives that fits into John Onas concept of neuroaesthetics. Goswamis mind conjures up visions that physical reality can never show; visions that convey the artists neuroaesthetic state and defy all verbal explanation.                    Event: Paintings by Rebanta Goswami When: Till September 27; 10 am - 7 pm Where: Galerie Karma, P 505 Keyatala Road

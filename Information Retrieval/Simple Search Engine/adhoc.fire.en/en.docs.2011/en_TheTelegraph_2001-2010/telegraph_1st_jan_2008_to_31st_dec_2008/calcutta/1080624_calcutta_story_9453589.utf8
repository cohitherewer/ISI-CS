	Students passing Class XII from foreign education boards will be able to seek direct admission to colleges affiliated to Calcutta University from this year.        
	The decision was taken by the universitys equivalence committee on Monday after noting the increase in the number of applicants from foreign boards.        
	Till last year, students from foreign boards needed to first apply to the university to study an undergraduate course in an affiliated college. They could seek admission in a college only after obtaining a clearance from the equivalence committee.        
	This is the first time we have adopted a set of regulations for applicants from foreign boards. Such students were required to take the universitys permission individually, said Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs).        
	Colleges will be able to directly admit students from foreign boards recognised by the Association for Indian Universities. The Cambridge School Board and the American International School are two of the recognised boards.        
	Students from other foreign boards will have to follow the old procedure.

                      Darjeeling through the lens        The queen of the Himalayas, Darjeeling is a popular hill resort and home to the world famous Darjeeling tea. Nestling in the grandeur and beauty of towering, snow-capped mountains, the city, home to Lepchas, Nepalis and Bhutias, became the perfect getaway for the colonial Britishers from the sweltering heat of the plains. Though he visited it for the first time after crossing 50, the city had captivated the imagination of Gunter Wehrmann since his very childhood. Awestruck by a documentary on the Darjeeling toy train that he saw when he was 12 years old, Wehrmann was filled with a desire to travel to Darjeeling. Darjeelings Ts, the ongoing photography exhibition, celebrates the citys tea, toy trains, Tibetan temples and last, but not least, Tenzing Norgay. The works on show were taken by him on various visits between November 2005 and May 2008, during his stay at Windamere Hotel in Darjeeling, Cochrane Place in Kurseong, Glenburn Tea Estate and at the homes of his friends. According to Wehrmann, the show marks his way of thanking the people of Darjeeling and the many friends that he made there.

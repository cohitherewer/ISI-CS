          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The youth who died in police custody in Howrah on Sunday morning was Krishna Mandal and not Biswanath Das, as he had claimed, police said on Monday.        
	Krishnas mother identified him at TL Jaiswal Hospital morgue on Monday morning.        
	The mistake came to light after residents of Kunjapara Lane, home to both men, saw Biswanath with his wife on Monday. Police also became suspicious after noticing KM tattooed on the youths right arm.        
	Krishna was caught by residents of Belgachhia on Saturday night while he was allegedly trying to steal a rickshaw and beaten up before being handed over to police.         
	Four persons were arrested for beating up Krishna. They were produced before the chief judicial magistrate, Howrah, on Monday, and remanded in judicial custody for eight days.        
	Two policemen have been suspended.

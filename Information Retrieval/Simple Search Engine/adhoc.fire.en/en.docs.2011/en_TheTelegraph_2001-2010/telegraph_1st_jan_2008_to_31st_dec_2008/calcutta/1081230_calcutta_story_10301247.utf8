          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Academics from south India have held two teachers of Calcutta University responsible for a goof-up in this years question paper for the postgraduate diploma course in Tamil.  
	The reports of the experts mdash; who probed the matter independently mdash; have been placed before the university rsquo;s syndicate and the vice-chancellor has been requested to take a decision.  
	 Students were asked to translate a passage from English to Tamil. The same passage was printed again in Tamil and the examinees were asked to translate it into English. Since the answers to the questions were in the paper itself, the examinees scored full marks mdash; 20 mdash; in both.  
	 The goof-up created resentment among teachers who demanded a probe, prompting the authorities to send the question paper to an expert each of Madras University, Pondicherry University and Madurai Kamraj University.  
	 All three experts said the repetition was a ldquo;gross irregularity rdquo; and urged the university to find out whether it resulted from the negligence of the teachers who set the questions and the moderator.  
	 ldquo;The experts have sent their reports, which have been tabled at the syndicate meeting. The members suggested that the matter be left to the vice-chancellor for a final decision, rdquo; said pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee.
  A syndicate member said the experts had called for action against the teacher who set the paper and the moderator.

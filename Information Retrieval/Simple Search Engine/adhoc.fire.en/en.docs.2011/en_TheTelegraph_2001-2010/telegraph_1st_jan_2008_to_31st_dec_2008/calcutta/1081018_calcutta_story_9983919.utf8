          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The unemployed youth and the college girl who committed suicide in Burtola within half an hour of each other on Thursday had often been seen together, police said.        
	Police began suspecting a possible link between the two suicides after residents of the locality said they had seen Chandranath Chakrabarty, 29, and Rova Seth, 19, walking down the lane together on several occasions. Chandranaths family said he hanged himself around 10am after his father refused to give him Rs 2,000.         
	Rova, a first-year college student, had consumed pesticide in her home around half an hour earlier.         
	The timing aroused suspicion, a police officer said.         
	He said none of the families had yet asked for a probe. We will proceed with a probe if anyone lodges a complaint, the officer added.

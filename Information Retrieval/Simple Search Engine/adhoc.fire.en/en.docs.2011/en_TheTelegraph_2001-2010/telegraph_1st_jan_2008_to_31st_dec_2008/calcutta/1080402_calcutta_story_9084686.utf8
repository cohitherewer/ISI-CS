          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti on Tuesday intervened to take action against traffic sergeant Dibyendu Shekhar Rez, who was caught red-handed while extorting money from hawkers in Lake Gardens on Monday.        
	Chakrabarti ordered deputy commissioner (south) Rajesh Subarna to start a suo motu case against Rez, who has been asked not to join duty till further orders.        
	The top cop summoned the officer-in-charge of Lake police station, Debasish Baidya, to Lalbazar. Sources said Baidya was rapped as he was known to back Rez.        
	We will conduct a thorough probe into the incident, said Subarna.

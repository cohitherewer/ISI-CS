                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       No kidding, lets talk

	Behavioural problems, lack of attention, aggressiveness and the use of foul language were some of the problems that were thrown up when students, teachers and parents of Delhi Public School, New Town, met counsellors and psychologists for an interactive session on Saturday morning.        
	The interactive session, part of The Telegraph Get Life Started Talk Series, provided a platform for parents and students to discuss their problems.        
	Most of the parents have problems understanding how to deal with their children and they do not often have anyone to turn to. That is why we thought of organising an open forum where they could get tips on how to deal with them, said Sujata Ghatak, the headmistress of DPS New Town.        
	Arup Ghoshal, a professor of psychology at Calcutta University, kick-started the session by giving a brief outline of the kinds of problems that parents of teenagers and pre-teens face today.        
	What the children want is your time and majority of the parents today do not have the time. Children need to know that you are around if they need you, Ghoshal told the 50-odd parents assembled in a hall on the school premises.        
	He warned parents about the side-effects of indulgence, a common trait these days  demands for water being satisfied with cold drinks and requests for toffees being met with chocolate bars.        
	Let the children talk, so that you know what they want and then decide how much to give, he urged the parents.        
	Ghoshal also stressed the role of teachers in the development of a child, citing instances of how the school environment affected teens and pre-teens.        
	Case in point: A three-year-old child would vomit every time she was being taken to school; it was later revealed that the class teacher was being harsh on the child as the mother had referred to her to as a grumpy woman.        
	When the floor was thrown open, questions started trickling and then pouring in from anxious parents. They were answered by the panel comprising Ghoshal, psychologist Mohormala Chatterjee, and the principal of DPS New Town Ruma Chandra.         
	Responding to a query from a mother regarding her sons lack of interest in his studies, Chatterjee pointed out that it was not fair to expect teenagers to sit with their books and concentrate for hours on end. They need to have the habit of studying but you should make him start with half-an-hour sessions so that his attention does not waiver, was the parenting tip.        
	Even after the session was over parents and some students went up to Ghoshal and Chatterjee to discuss their problems.        
	The success of Saturdays interactive session has prompted the New Town school to plan another session with students of classes IX and X. The school already has a referral system in place for students from nursery to Class X.        
	Students who were present here did not ask any questions. An exclusive session for them would be ideal, said Ghatak.  
	PARENTING TIP  
	Mother: My teenaged son has picked up foul language in school that he uses without knowing the meaning. He comes and asks me what they mean and I don rsquo;t know what to do.   
	Experts: This is the age when it is but natural for them to pick up foul language as well as concepts that they do not fully comprehend. Do not shut yourself out to him or else he will use it without your knowledge. Explain to him if possible why it is a bad word and why you disapprove.

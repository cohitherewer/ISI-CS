The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Airlines stall runway project
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Airlines stall runway project
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Airlines have objected to Calcutta airports main runway being closed for 18 days to replace the old Instrumental Landing System (ILS).        
	The airport authorities had planned to replace the ILS equipment this month by keeping the runway closed during the day. Flights were to take off from and land on the secondary runway during this period.         
	But airline representatives who met officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) at the airport on Tuesday objected to the proposal. The secondary runway cannot be used if visibility drops. Flights will have to be diverted in such a situation, said an official of the Airlines Operators Committee.        
	Air Indias Haj flights, which will ferry 535 passengers daily from October to January, may be affected by the postponement.        
	The airlines have requested the authorities to install the ILS on the secondary runway and then close the main one.         
	However, the ILS should be installed on the secondary runway only after its extension, which could take more than a year.         
	Installation of the ILS on the secondary runway will take six to eight months. So we are planning to install the ILS on the primary runway in around a week, instead of 18 days, said P.K. Singhal, the regional executive director of AAI (eastern region).        
	The existing ILS was installed in March 1993. It should have been replaced after 10 to 12 years. The new ILS has been imported from the US and should be installed before winter sets in, added Singhal.         
	A review meeting will be held in the first week of October. Work may start in the second week of October, said a source.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fiery end to costly demands
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Swarup and Tumpa Mukherjees rented flat in Kasba, where they had moved in a month ago. Picture by Aranya Sen                                  
	Tumpa Mukherjee, 30, set herself and her two children ablaze at their Kasba flat early on Thursday. The homemaker died in the afternoon, while the children  Saheb, 5, and Mimi, 3  are fighting for their lives at SSKM Hospital.        
	Tumpa, aunt Mamani Roy said, would pester husband Swarup for expensive gifts that he could not afford. But we could never imagine that Tumpa would kill herself and even try to take the lives of her children for that. Swarup works in an electronics goods showroom.        
	Swarups landlord Subhendu Roy, too, said Tumpa often asked her husband for expensive gifts.        
	The family moved into the rented flat in Kasba from Swarups ancestral house in Bhowanipore a month ago.        
	Roy said Swarup woke up around 1.30am and saw flames leaping out from an adjoining room, where his wife and children were sleeping. He rushed in and found the trio in flames.        
	Swarup immediately alerted neighbours, who took the three to SSKM Hospital.        
	Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, said a case of unnatural death has been started. We are interrogating the husband, though Tumpa did not hold anyone responsible for her death in her dying declaration.

           Redefining evolution
          Ground-breaking and startling in its impact, the theory of evolution propounded by Charles Darwin (1809-1882) has had a currency in the field of Systems Biology ever since its appearance. Darwins thesis is composed of three sub-theories: one of genetic variation and inheritance, one of natural selection and one of facilitated variation in the phenotype of a species. On the occasion of Acharya Jagadis Chandra Bose Triennial Gold Medal Lecture, Marc W. Kirschner, Professor of Systems Biology at the Harvard Medical School, shall deliver a talk on the Role of Facilitated Variation in Evolution. Until recently, little has been known about the theory of phenotypic variation. In the light of new information, it is seen how the properties of conserved cellular processes are seen to possess molecular features that increase the rate of evolutionary change as compared to genetic change. One of these processes concerns the way signals of low information content can easily elicit complex but largely pre-programmed responses, often producing major changes. Another acts within normal development to facilitate the acquisition of novel phenotypes through random exploration; these are particularly evident in the evolution of the nervous and vascular systems. Furthermore, stabilisation of physiological states is an especially important source of evolutionary novelty. Finally, Kirschner shall discuss the conditions under which facilitated variation itself can evolve.
         Event: Lecture on The Role of Facilitated Variation in Evolution by Marc W. Kirschner When: Today at 3.30 pm Where: Bose Institute, Main Campus Lecture Hall, 93/1 APC Road

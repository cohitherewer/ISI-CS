          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The charred body of a 40-year-old trader was found in a bedroom of his house in Bantra, Howrah, early on Sunday.        
	Lakshmikanta Das was alone in the room. His wife Purnima was visiting her parents with their 10-year-old son. A murder case was started on the basis of a complaint by her, said police.         
	Lakshmikantas 58-year-old mother Kamalabala noticed smoke billowing from his room around 4am and started shouting for help. By the time her younger son Subhas, who lives next door, had reached the house, her own room was partially burnt.        
	Subhas escorted Kamalabala outside but could not rescue Lakshmikanta because his room was latched from inside. Firemen broke open the door and brought out the body.         
	Purnima said Lakshmikanta, who owned a factory in the neighbourhood, was depressed over a property dispute with his two brothers. Why didnt he cry out for help when the fire broke out in the room? He must have been murdered.

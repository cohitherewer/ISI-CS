          A STAFF REPORTER                          The abandoned woman. A Telegraph picture                                  
	An unconscious woman of about 75 years was abandoned at NRS Medical College and Hospital by a young woman on Tuesday night.        
	The young woman, clad in a sari, arrived at the hospitals emergency gate in a taxi around 11.45pm, said an officer of Entally police station, which has an outpost at the hospital.        
	With the help of the taxi driver, she carried the aged woman to the female examination room. After some time, we could not find the younger woman. She had kept the old woman on an examination table and vanished, added the officer.        
	Because of the bomb scare on Tuesday night, most of the policemen posted at the hospital were patrolling the compound and there were few in the emergency department.        
	One of my colleagues asked the young woman how she was related to the elderly woman. She had said they had come from Beleghata and the sick woman was her mother, said the police officer.        
	The elderly woman lay unattended on the examination table till around 3pm on Wednesday.        
	The policemen said the aged woman was unconscious in the morning. She was looking very sick. We tried to make her talk so that we could trace her relatives, but she couldnt speak. We requested doctors to admit and treat her, said another officer.        
	The doctors were reportedly reluctant to admit her. They said there were no beds. One of our senior officers later contacted the medical superintendent of the hospital, who asked officials to admit the woman, the officer added.        
	Medical superintendent L.K. Ghosh said the abandoned woman was being treated. Some tests have been done and other tests are being done. The doctors are trying to diagnose her disease. She is in a critical condition.        
	We are trying to find out more about the old woman, said a senior officer of Entally police station.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | A cradle of creativity for the young
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A cradle of creativity for the young
          ARKA DAS                          CIMA Gallerys Studio21, housed at 17L Dover Terrace, will be everything that an art gallery isnt. Picture by Pabitra Das                                  
	For a decade now, CIMA Gallery has been a premier space offering the best of Indian and global art to a discerning audience. Now, theres new creativity brewing  with a new space to stir things up.        
	Come September 4, CIMA Gallery will throw open the doors to Studio21, an alternative space that envisions a dynamic multi-disciplinary milieu acting as a platform for creativity.        
	Located in the lazy south Calcutta neighbourhood of Dover Terrace, Studio21 will take up 3,000 sq ft of a ground floor bathed in neutral white, with architecture that harks back to the golden 50s of Bengali cinema.        
	Unlike the larger  and often intimidating  gallery at Sunny Towers, this space will serve a more intimate purpose, with a reading room and a cosy little outdoor cafeteria to add to the atmosphere.        
	An approach wall that can be used by street artists, muted lights, mirror-topped bookracks and an ambience that spells ease  it all adds up to a feeling of warmth at Studio21.        
	It is everything that CIMA isnt, says Pratiti Sarkar of CIMA Gallery. While CIMA is all about the more insular art community, Studio21 is meant to take art closer to the larger community as a whole.        
	The term gallery, explains Pratiti, was deliberately omitted from the name in order to convey this sense of bringing art closer to the people. And also because 21 denotes the century.        
	So the studio will move away from the mainstream art  and the commerce  that is part of a gallerys being. Apart from functioning as a regular visual art exhibition area, the high-ceilinged rooms of Studio21 will be open to discussions, talks, interactive sessions and rehearsals, encompassing everything from music, literature, theatre, films and even fashion.        
	In effect, it will function as a larger platform for young and non-established talents from these fields of visual and performance art and will encourage inter-disciplinary exchanges at this address near Gariahat.        
	To set the tone, the launch on Thursday evening is with an event termed Rehearsal, featuring Bollywood music director Pritam, city rock star Rupam, lensman Rid Burman, artist Ashok Mullick and caricature artist Suman Chowdhury.        
	And in keeping with the relaxed vibe of this melting pot of creativity, the September 4 event will be free-flowing and open-ended.        
	As of now, there is no planned itinerary for the evening. The point is to keep it interactive, explains Rakhi Sarkar of CIMA Gallery.        
	But make no mistake, its not a JLT (just like that) kind of creative hangout.        
	Studio21 is all about the youth; the idea is not only to seek out young talent, but garner their involvement. Ideally, this process will also teach them certain professional aspects that we find lacking in much of our young artistic community, says Rakhi.        
	We have enough talent in our state. We just need to shake off our tendency to stagnate and keep it all dynamic. To create, maybe all that we need is a little inspiration. Studio21 will offer that aplenty, she assures.        
	The message is clear: if youre young and talented and willing to make things happen, this is a platform for you.        
	Any hands in the air?

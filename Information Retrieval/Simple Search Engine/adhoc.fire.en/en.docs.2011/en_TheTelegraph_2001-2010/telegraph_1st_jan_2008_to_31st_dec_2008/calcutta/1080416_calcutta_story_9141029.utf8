                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CU posts await party nod 
          MITA MUKHERJEE                          Key posts in Calcutta University are lying vacant, hampering academic activities                                  
	Key administrative posts in Calcutta University have been vacant for years because Alimuddin Street is yet to identify candidates of its choice. CPM leaders, however, are engaged in parleys to find a successor to the current vice-chancellor.         
	Over a dozen vacant posts are affecting administrative and academic activities in the university, said officials, but the selection of candidates depend on the recommendation of Alimuddin Street.         
	The posts lying vacant  some, for years  include those of inspector of colleges, deputy registrar (administration), development and planning officer, secretaries of four faculties, including those of science, law and home science, curator of Asutosh museum, system analyst, assistant controller of examinations, students services secretary, secretary to vice-chancellor and accounts officer.        
	In contrast, barely three weeks after vice-chancellor Ashis Kumar Banerjee expressed his desire to quit, preparations are on in full swing to select his successor. The universitys senate will meet on Thursday to elect the new vice-chancellor.        
	The party leaders will meet the day before to finalise a panel of suitable candidates between one and three  for the post. The panel will be placed before the senate, which forwards the name of the most preferred candidate of the party to Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi.        
	The Calcutta University Act lays down specific rules regarding appointment of administrative officers. But nearly 16 administrative posts are not being filled up only because there is no consensus within the CPM, said an official in the universitys recruitment section.         
	The vacancies have resulted in various problems. For instance, a section of students alleged, a lift in the universitys radio physics department building in Rajabazar Science College is not functioning for over two months.        
	Repairs and renovations are getting delayed because the post of engineer is lying vacant for several years, added the students.        
	A senior chemical technology teacher lodged a complaint with the authorities last week about an efficient non-teaching staff being transferred to the controller of examination section. Sources said transfers are looked after by deputy registrar (administration), a post lying vacant.        
	We are trying to fill up a number of vacancies in May-June, said registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay.

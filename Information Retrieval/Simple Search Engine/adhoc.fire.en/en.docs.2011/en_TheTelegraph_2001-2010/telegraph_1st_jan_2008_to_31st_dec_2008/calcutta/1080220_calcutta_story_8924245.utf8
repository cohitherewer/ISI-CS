The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nandaram will need IIT nod to reopen
                                                                                                               Nandaram will need IIT nod to reopen
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic authorities on Tuesday decided not to allow permanent reopening of Nandaram Market and Kashiram block in Burrabazar without a structural stability certificate from IIT Kharagpur.         
	A high-level committee set up to decide the fate of the market, with representatives from the fire services, police and CESC, endorsed the civic bodys decision.        
	The municipal commissioner has written to the head of IIT Kharagpurs civil engineering department, requesting him to carry out tests in the fire-ravaged buildings.         
	We will not allow permanent reopening of the markets without a clearance from the IIT, said the commissioner.         
	However, the committee has decided to allow trading in the basement and on the ground and first floors of Kashiram from Wednesday on a temporary basis.         
	The fire brigade raised no objection after the traders agreed to some measures.        
	CESC has declined to restore power supply to the building until a room blocking the passage to the transformer is demolished.

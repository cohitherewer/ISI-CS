The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Foreign trip for twinkle-toed Kalighat kids 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Foreign trip for twinkle-toed Kalighat kids 
          SUBHRO SAHA                                    
	The farthest young Puja Roy or Mohammed Ashique has ever ventured out of town is to Darjeeling.        
	Come August 29, these two, along with seven other children of Kalighat sex workers, will be flying out to Dusseldorf to perform Kathak and contemporary dance before a German audience. The six-week tour of 12 German cities will be followed by a two-week Spanish sojourn.        
	Steering the underprivileged kids from Kalighat to Cologne is the Buro fur Kultur und Median Project, an arm of the German ministry of culture and international cooperation. This is part of Kinde Kultur Karavan, a cultural programme undertaken by the German ministry every two years, inviting children from developing countries.        
	Our students were the lucky beneficiaries of the trip this year, thanks to the initiative of our Cologne-based German partner agency, BONO-DirektHilfe, says Urmi Basu, the executive director of New Light, a community development and HIV/AIDS awareness programme working with the children of sex workers and the local youth of Kalighat.        
	The five girls and four boys, who have been learning Kathak under Pandit Chitresh Das, will perform an 80-minute collage of Kathak, modern movements, Bengali folk dance and Bollywood jigs on special request from German school kids. Local instructor Biswajit Ghosh is teaching them the Hrithik Roshan moves and Madhuri Dixit whirls.        
	The children will be hosted by German families during the fully sponsored trip, says Ralph Classen, who will be co-ordinating the tour on behalf of the German ministry. The Spanish leg will be hosted by the Mundo Cooperante, New Lights partner NGO in Spain.         
	For Puja, Lakshmi, Abhijit and Raju, the long wait to board the flight on August 29 is excruciating. Amid all the excitement, there are lurking worries. Will we have to eat only beef? Is there water in the toilet, or only paper? Is their summer colder than our winter? To ease foreign tongue fears, the children are also learning basic German and Spanish from overseas volunteers.

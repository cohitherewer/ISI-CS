	Definition of water body 
    
	The West Bengal Inland Fisheries Act, 1984, says retention of water for a period minimum of six months will qualify any area as wetland/ water body. 
       
	Benefits of water body 
    
	Helps in natural drainage.
    
	Acts as reservoir for fire-fighting, recharges ground water and maintains ecological balance.
    
	Ensures livelihood.
       
	Laws to protect filling up of water bodies
    
	The West Bengal Inland Fisheries Act, 1984 (amended in 1993), bars filling up of any water body  measuring five cottahs or more  where water is retained for minimum six months.
    
	The West Bengal Town and Country (Planning and Development), Act, 1979, to be enforced by the CMC  says permission for filling of a tank, pond or water body will not be given because of environmental and ecological reasons. Use of water body for pisciculture and its utility in facilitating drainage are some of the other reasons cited in the act. 
    
	Section 24 of the Water (Prevention amp; Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and 4D of the West Bengal Land amp; Land Reforms Act, 1956, can be applied to stop filling up of water bodies.
       
	Agencies responsible for enforcement of law: 
    
	CMC and the pollution control board in the city. 
       
	Water body statistics 
    
	According to a CMC survey in 2000, the water body count was around 3,000. But the list is neither accurate nor exhaustive. Experts involved in a Central Pollution Control Board study in 2002-03 feel the present number is around 2,500.

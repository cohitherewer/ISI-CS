          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	An interactive seminar and lung function or spirometry check-up for asthma patients were organised at Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals to mark World Asthma Day on Tuesday.         
	Asthma can be controlled by maintaining a balance between personal and professional life and through regulated diet and exercise, said Ashoke Sen Gupta, a consultant pulmonologist at Apollo. Anjan Bhattacharya, a consultant developmental paediatrician at the hospital, discussed the symptoms in children.        
	The session was useful even though I have recovered considerably in the last seven years, said Jawharlal Roy Karmakar, a 56-year-old patient from Barasat. Its difficult to get such clear instructions, said BP Chatterjee, a Salt Lake resident whose four-year-old granddaughter is an asthma patient.

	A 17-year-old mason was arrested in Murshidabad on Sunday on the charge of murdering Sudha Ghosh, a Thakurpukur homemaker, on June 1.        
	Police said Kajibul Sheikh, the mason, had an affair with Sudha, who was in her early 30s. He allegedly told the police that he had murdered the woman to steal money and ornaments from her house.        
	A cellphone and some ornaments have been seized from the mason.        
	Husband Sourin found Sudha murdered in her room, which she shared with her seven-year-old son, on June 2 morning. The woman was strangled.        
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said Kajibul, originally from Murshidabad, was living in Mahestala with a relative. He got acquainted with Sudha while working in her locality.        
	Kajibul killed Sudha in her husbands deserted grille factory next door, dumped the body in her room, stole cash and the ornaments, Kumar added.

                      An emotional battle                    A stark and moving exploration of the personal and social consequences of HIV infection, Crab Soup (written by Arthur Cardozo) was developed after many interviews with HIV+ women in India. Based on the discovery of a medicinal molecule in the Indian Mud Crab (a species found only in India), the play looks at the possible use of a gel made from the molecule which could prevent the spread of HIV to a sexual partner. Its story deals with the behavioural changes in the shattered mind of a man who has tested positive for AIDS. Instead of focusing on the external battle for acceptance in society, the performance explores the traumatic aftermath of diagnosis and the imaginary or real changes that take place in the victims relationships, specially with his partner. It also examines the public attitude towards AIDS, the ethics of the research which aims to empower women and the psychological effects upon the victim and his family, all in the Indian context. Based on scientific research, the plays emotional content, though intangible, remains strong and layered. The production is futuristic but has its roots in the Indian tradition and the present social environment. Direction: Ramanjit Kaur.                  Event: Play in English, Crab Soup, produced by The Creative Arts When: Today; 5 pm and 7 pm Where: Max Mueller Bhavan

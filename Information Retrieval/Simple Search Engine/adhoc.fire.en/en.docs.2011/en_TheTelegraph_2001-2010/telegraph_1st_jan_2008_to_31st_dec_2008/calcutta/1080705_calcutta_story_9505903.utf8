          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta High Court on Friday appointed advocate Chandrayee Alam as special officer to observe the mental condition of a 12-year-old boy whose parents are fighting a legal battle for his custody.        
	Justice Asim Banerje also asked the advocate to pick up the boy from his mothers home every Sunday and take him to his fathers house in Calcutta.        
	Appointment of a special officer by a court in a custody case is not new. But this is the first time that the court has asked a special officer to observe the mental condition of a child.        
	The boy will spend some time with his father. After that the advocate will take him back to his mother, said the judge.        
	The order was passed on the basis of an appeal by the boys mother, a city-based gynaecologist.        
	She moved court challenging the validity of a trial court order asking her to inform the boys father about his condition from time to time.

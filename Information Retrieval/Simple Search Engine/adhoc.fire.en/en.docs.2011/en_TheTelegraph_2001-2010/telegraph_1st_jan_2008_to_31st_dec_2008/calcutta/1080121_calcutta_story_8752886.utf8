             BIG VIEW: Science City, on EM Bypass, is set to introduce a three-dimensional science show. A Telegraph picture
                    
	Science City will soon introduce three-dimensional science shows.
    
	A special hall is being set up in the Space Odyssey block, where short films on science topics will be screened, using 3D facilities. 
    
	The hall will accommodate 50 viewers, who will be given polaroid spectacles for watching the films. The spectacles will have to be returned after the show. 
    
	Ten shows of 20 minutes each will be screened every day. The tickets will be priced at Rs 20 and Rs 10 (for students). We are trying our best to open the facility this month. Science City now records an annual footfall of 14 lakh. Once the 3D shows are started, the turnout will increase manifold, said G.S. Rautela, the director of Science City.
    
	Digital technology has opened new ways of presenting images with extraordinary variety. Polaroid-based stereo projection will create a three-dimensional effect in the theatre, Rautela added.
    
	Equipment and software worth Rs 40 lakh will be imported from the US for the 3D shows. American experts will guide the Science City authorities in installing the machines.

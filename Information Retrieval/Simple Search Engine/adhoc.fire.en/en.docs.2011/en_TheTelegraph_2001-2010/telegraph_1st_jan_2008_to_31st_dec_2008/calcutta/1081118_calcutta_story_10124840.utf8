The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Business to cattle class
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Business to cattle class
  - Low-cost carriers make hay as companies cut costs          SANJAY MANDAL                                     
	The next time you fly a low-cost airline, dont be surprised to find the CEO of a company in the seat next to yours.         
	The days of corporate frequent fliers plonking themselves in plush seats at the pointy end of a plane are over. Companies are cutting corners like never before, forcing their executives to shift to no-frills airlines that do not serve even a complimentary bottle of water.        
	Anita Nankani, an IT professional employed by a software company in Sector V of Salt Lake, travels frequently to Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore on business. Until three months ago, she wouldnt be seen boarding a low-cost carrier. She is now getting used to not being served free meals on board.         
	I was a regular on Jet Airways flights but I now have to fly JetLite, Nankani said.         
	The downturn-induced migration from business to cattle class has led to low-cost airlines doing good business in the past two months.         
	IndiGos passenger load this month is 10 per cent more than the figure for the corresponding period last year. We have touched 84 per cent despite higher fares than last year and more flights, an official of the airline said over phone from Delhi.         
	IndiGo had 13 daily departures from Calcutta airport last year. The number has increased to 15 this year and the airline is tying up with companies to offer cheaper fares for business travel.         
	SpiceJet, too, has benefited from the switch. Business on the metro routes is good because these are the sectors where we have the maximum number of business fliers, an airline official said.         
	Subir Ghosh, the CEO of a Calcutta-based company, shifted to low-cost carriers recently and immediately started missing the regular airlines he used to fly with. Full-service carriers handle passengers much better than budget airlines. I have no qualms in admitting that I am missing the comforts.        
	A senior official of a company that has its headquarters in the city said cost-cutting would continue for a while. These are difficult times.        
	The Airlines Operators Committee, Calcutta, confirmed that regular airlines had taken a hit while low-cost carriers were getting more passengers since the meltdown began. There has been a definite shift. The decision by companies to cut travel costs has affected Air India, Jet Airways and Kingfisher the most, a committee member said.

	Ranjana Roy, 24, negotiates two hours of traffic to work and back home daily. Each day, she feels drained, with vague aches and pains. A blood test revealed she was suffering from anaemia  a deficiency of red blood cells.
    
	Anaemia has emerged as a major health problem for working women between 20 and 35 years age.
    
	Data from National Family Health Survey 2005-06 shows 79 per cent of the children and 58 per cent of pregnant women suffered from anaemia, contributing to 20 per cent of all maternal deaths.
    
	Abnormal menstrual bleeding, occult piles (not detected with the naked eye) and hookworm infestations are the key reasons for the rise in cases of anaemia, said Subrata Maitra, a critical care specialist.
    
	Experts believe the staple Indian diet of wheat and rice, which are rich in phytates, impairs the absorption of iron in the body. The phytates are not broken down in the gastrointestinal tract, restricting the absorption of iron in the food to 10 per cent.
    
	Intake of phytate-rich food is primarily responsible for anaemia among women in the child-bearing age group, said an expert. Diet must be supplemented with iron and vitamins, Maitra said, advising the consumption of milk, eggs, fish and iron-rich vegetables.
    
	Most of us are overstressed, eat excessive calories, shun fresh food, do not exercise and do not sleep properly. These contribute to anaemia, said Dr Ilorasri Chakraborty, associated with AMRI and Woodland Hospital.

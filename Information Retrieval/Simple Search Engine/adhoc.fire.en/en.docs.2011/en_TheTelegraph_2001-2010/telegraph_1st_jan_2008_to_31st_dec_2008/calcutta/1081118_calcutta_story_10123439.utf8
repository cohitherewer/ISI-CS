	Boys and girls from schools across the city put aside their textbooks for three days to teach Calcuttans how to make peace work.        
	The PeaceWorks Festival, organised by Seagull Foundation for the Arts between November 7 and 9, saw 70 students from 14 schools, including La Martiniere for Boys (LMB), Modern High School for Girls, St James School, Patha Bhavan, Gokhale Memorial Girls School and Birla High School for Girls, participate in a three day jamboree of music, theatre, films and photography.        
	The festival, titled Thoda Pyaar, Thoda Peace, was the culmination of a year-long curriculum introduced in city schools by Seagull Foundation, where sessions on identity, human rights and gender were conducted through theatre workshops and film screenings.        
	We wanted to conduct a festival that would involve the whole city, said Megha Malhotra of Seagull Foundation for the Arts.        
	The theme of the festival was inclusion  learning to live with difference, not only socio-economic, religious or cultural, but also of opinion.         
	Over the three days of the festival, students performed street plays on human rights violation and pressures of the education system all over the city, including at St Xaviers College, New Market and City Centre, Salt Lake.         
	The Bengali street play workshops were conducted by playwright and director Probir Guha. The Hindi theatre workshop was conducted by Anubha Fatehpuria, while the English workshop was conducted by Soumyak Kanti De Biswas, of the theatre group Tin Can.        
	Sixty-second films on issues like gender discrimination, child labour, violence against women and the recent terrorist attacks, made by students under the guidance of experimental video filmmaker Sanjeet Choudhury, were screened at South City mall and all the Metro Railway stations. A music piece created by the students after a workshop with tabla player Bickram Ghosh will be aired on FM channels.        
	The students were asked to look around them and identify issues that were bothering them and things that they would like to change, said Malhotra.        
	A photography exhibition was also held on the occasion at the chapel of LMB.         
	It saw students expressing their views on several aspects of life. Chandrima Moitra, a student of Patha Bhavan, captured a classroom scene where a child sat disinterestedly. The underlying message was how students are not allowed to study subjects of their choice. Ashis Kumar Rout and Mohammed Rafique Karim of Chowringhee High School had chosen a graver subject. Their still depicted a person taking drugs, suggesting its easy availability among students. Avinash Das of The Cambridge School interpreted Living with Difference through a picture of the traditional hand-drawn rickshaw plying along side modern vehicles.        
	The festival came to a close on Sunday at LMB where the street plays, films and music created by the children were showcased. The guests included singer Usha Uthup, Bickram Ghosh and the LMB principal Sunirmal Chakravarthi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Teachers join protest in JU 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Teachers join protest in JU 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Teachers of Jadavpur University hit the protest path on Friday, following in the footsteps of their students.         
	The members of Jadavpur University Teachers Association (Juta) organised a sit-in in the main administrative building from noon to 4pm to protest ill-treatment at the hands of the students on Thursday.        
	We were harassed and insulted by the students yesterday when we tried to rescue the vice-chancellor and pro vice-chancellor, who were gheraoed for 27 hours, said Juta president Parimal Debnath.        
	More than 50 teachers sat on the ground floor of the building and put up posters against the actions of the students over the past two days. They, however, did not boycott classes, taking turns to join the protest.         
	On the other front, more than 500 students from the arts, science and engineering streams turned up at a rally called by all three unions, protesting Jutas strong-arm tactic.         
	They also demanded that the university scrap the proposals they were opposed to, including segregating first-year boarders to save them from ragging.         
	Registrar Rajat Banerjee said an executive council meeting would be called to discuss ways to stop ragging. But no decision will be taken keeping the students in the dark.        
	On the students demand to set up a placement cell, Banerjee said: We have set up an advisory committee for the cell. All three student unions will be asked to nominate their representatives on the panel.         
	With teachers and students busy protesting, academic work suffered. Some students of the arts faculty refused to join Fridays rally and displayed posters protesting the events of the past two days. We are not against the movement but against the disruption of classes, said a second-year student of comparative literature.

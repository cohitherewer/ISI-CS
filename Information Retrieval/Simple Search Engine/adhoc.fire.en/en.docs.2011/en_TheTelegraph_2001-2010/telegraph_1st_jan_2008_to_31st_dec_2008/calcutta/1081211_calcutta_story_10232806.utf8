                      Passion for paper                    A self-taught paper-maker, Bangalore-based Jenny Pinto deliberately walked off the beaten track and took to experimenting with plant fibres and various river grasses. Making paper the old fashioned way, she makes a unique range of beautiful, translucent and textured paper from agricultural and craft-waste fibres like banana, sisal, mulberry, various rivers grasses, pineapple and more. In love with paper, not simply as a surface to work on but as a material in its own right, she designs a truly organic range of lights, home accessories and stationery. Preferring to call herself a paper maker first and then a designer, she has chosen to reach out to help NGOs with design and technical inputs and has set up a small rural group of women entrepreneurs. Trace of Time: The Art of Papermaking, the ongoing exhibition of art works made of and from paper by this adventurous, innovative artist, showcases an amazing variety of objects that will surely appeal to those with an eye for the aesthetic. It unfolds the way the natural world bends and blends, yields, weathers and transforms over time, changing its form but never its essence.

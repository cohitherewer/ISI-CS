     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	A 17-year-old girl was left nursing 57 stitches and a 14-year-old girl 22 stitches  both on the face  after a pool car carrying four students lost control in the rain on Wednesday afternoon.
    
	The Ambassador that slammed into a pavement near the Park Street-Mullickbazar crossing allegedly had faulty wipers.
    
	The accident took place around 3pm when the car was dropping the students home from Assembly of God Church School, on Park Street. The driver fled.
    
	Sucharita Dutta, in Class XI, and Madhumonti Das, in Class VIII, were in the front seat and suffered multiple cuts from the shattered windscreen.
    
	Samudra Das and Shilajit Dey, both in Class VII, were in the back seat and escaped with minor cuts and bruises. The two boys were discharged after first-aid at the Assembly of God Church Hospital.
    
	Sucharita received 57 stitches and Madhumonti 22 stitches. Sucharita had suffered deep cuts all over her face and a deep cut under her jaw. Madhumonti was discharged in the evening but we are keeping Sucharita in hospital for observation, said M. Sarkar, the medical officer of the hospital.
    
	According to police, the mishap was caused by the wipers that failed during Wednesdays sudden rain.
    
	The driver of the car probably could not see clearly and lost control of the vehicle after slamming the brakes on the slushy street. He fled the scene; some bystanders rushed the children to hospital, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).
    
	The accident once again highlights the pool car peril faced by schoolchildren every day. The owner of the pool car had contacted us outside the school a year ago and Sucharita has been using it ever since, said her uncle Soumitra Dhar.
    
	Madhumonti met with the accident within a week of joining the pool car. We are dependent on pool cars. It is not possible for us to drop our kids and then fetch them from school every day. But the poorly-maintained cars and rash drivers put the lives of children at risk, lamented her father Subrata Ranjan Das.
    
	In July 2007, Kaustav Bhattacharya, a student of Class III in South Point School, had died when a speeding pool car had slammed into a private bus on VIP Road.

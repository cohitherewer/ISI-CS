The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC query on Maidan rally
                                                                                                               HC query on Maidan rally
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                           The Maidan mauled by the CPM rally on January 8. A Telegraph picture                                  
	A legal step has been initiated to ban rallies on the Maidan, coinciding with the Publishers and Booksellers Guilds attempt to bring back Book Fair on the gasping greens.        
	Environment activist Subhas Dutta on Friday moved a petition in the high court, arguing that political parties are violating a judicial verdict by holding rallies on Brigade Parade Ground, which is part of the Maidan.        
	The high court, Dutta submitted, had issued a ruling on September 28 last year, banning events causing pollution within a three-km radius of Victoria Memorial.        
	The division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice R.N. Banerjee asked the government and other authorities to file affidavits within two weeks, stating their stand on the petitioners contention.        
	In their affidavits, the government, Calcutta Municipal Corporation, police and the state pollution control board will have to state why they are allowing political rallies on Brigade Parade Ground and religious groups to set up camps for pilgrims on some other parts of the greens.        
	Dutta produced photographs to prove the damage inflicted on the Maidan during the January 8 rally of the CPM.        
	Opening another flank of assault, guild sources said they will file a fresh case seeking an order allowing Book Fair 2009 on the Maidan. The guild will assure the court that it will take scientific measures to curb air pollution during the fair, said a source.

                      Quest for spiritual experience                    Appearing baffling at first glance as it seems unrelated to the real world, the art of Sunando Basu poses profound questions about life, reality and philosophy. Representing invisible, inner states of being, his works challenge viewers by confronting common perceptions in a variety of startling ways. In a fundamental sense, Basu seeks to depict his experience of the Divine. In Search of Language, the ongoing solo show of his paintings, features works that have an undeniable mystical, ideal quality. His images, consisting blocks of pure colour and esoteric shapes and patterns, try to reach some sort of a cosmic integration, which the artist attempts to achieve by venturing into a space that extends beyond the circumscribed margin of his canvas. His interesting use of colour, along with a skillful use of light and shade, render his images both alive and unrestrained. Mysterious, magical and mystical, the play of light in his works blends tastefully with rich, bold tints, creating a sense of harmony. Darkness never hold much appeal for the artist, who appears to be on an eternal quest for light, reason and understanding on a sublime, ethereal plane.            lEvent: An exhibition of paintings by Sunando Basu lWhen: Till November 29; 11 am amp; 7 pm lWhere: Gallery K2, Supra Court, 35 Lansdowne Terrace

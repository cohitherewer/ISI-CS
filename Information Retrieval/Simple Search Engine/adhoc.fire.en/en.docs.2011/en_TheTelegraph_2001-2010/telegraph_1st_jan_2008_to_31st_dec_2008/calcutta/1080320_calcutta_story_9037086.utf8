                      Mystic verses                    During the latter half of the 20th century, Jibanananda Das emerged as the most popular poet of contemporary Bengali literature. Considered the defining essence of modernism in Bengali poetry, his works evoke nearly all the suggested elements of the modernist phenomenon. Translated by Chidananda Dasgupta, Selected Poems, Jibanananda Das is an anthology of his poetry, which also offers a glimpse into the poets thoughts and imagination. As tribute to the poet and to commemorate Dasguptas English transcreation of Jibananandas verses, Aparna Sen and Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee will read out selected poems from the book and interact with the audience on their thoughts about his works. Hosted by Penguin Books India and Crossword Bookstore.

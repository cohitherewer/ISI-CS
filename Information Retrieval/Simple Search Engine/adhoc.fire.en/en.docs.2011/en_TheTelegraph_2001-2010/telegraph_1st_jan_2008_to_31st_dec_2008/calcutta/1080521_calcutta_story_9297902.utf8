          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A clash between two gangs in Chetla late on Monday left three men injured. Five persons have been arrested.        
	Sources said trouble erupted on Chetla Road when some youths from a gang led by Kumar Saha came looking for Rabi Halder to teach him a lesson for daring to organise a feast for local residents on Sunday night.        
	The youth felt that Rabi had organised the feast to challenge the authority of Kumar, who had distributed books among some residents.        
	Indrajit Bose, an associate of Kumar, beat up Bubai Dey and another youth at Netaji Sangha Club around 11.30pm. Bubai was critically injured in his eyes.        
	Alarmed by his cries, Bubais friends rushed in and and thrashed Indrajit. Bubai and Indrajit are admitted in nursing homes. They will be arrested once their conditions stabilise, said a police officer.

                      A creative journey through time and space                     The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place; from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spiders web  Pablo Picasso.         Sunil Das enjoys a unique position among the front-ranking artists of India. He is probably the countrys most important post-modern expressionist who has been painting prolifically for more than three decades. The ongoing show has two-pronged motives: to celebrate the 30th anniversary of a very unusual kind of friendship  between an Italian career diplomat and an artist. Young Italian diplomat, Juergen Fischer, was serving a stint in Calcutta when he met Das and was struck by his original style of expression. Soon enough, he began collecting Das paintings. Their bond of friendship grew stronger over the years and Calcutta became the confluence point of this friendship. In course of time, Fischer collected a number of Das works. This exhibition comprises paintings from the Fischer collection along with works from the artists own collection. It is unique in so far as it depicts Das long and eventful artistic journey  as he created, moulded, searched for new metaphors, discovered motifs that have become his style statement and have often acted as catalysts of artistic expression. Horses and bulls in motion are the major themes of Dass works. The other recurring theme is the woman with a dark face, haunted and haunting to the viewer. His precision of outline and vigorous sense of tonal gradation are as impressive as his understanding of the effect of light. This powerful and elemental sense of vigour appeals to the deepest level.

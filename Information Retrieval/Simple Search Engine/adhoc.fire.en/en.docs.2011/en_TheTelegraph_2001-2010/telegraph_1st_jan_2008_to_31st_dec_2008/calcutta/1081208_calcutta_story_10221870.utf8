                      Ideas for the future                    Widely regarded as an emerging superpower, India has witnessed great social, political and cultural change since the early 1990s. A key player in the countrys growth story, Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani believes that its future depends more on reform and innovation in all sectors of public life than on economic growth. In his book Imagining India: ideas for the new century, he examines the central ideas that have shaped modern India and offers an original perspective on its past, present and future. Hosted by Penguin Books India and ITC Sonar, Calcutta, this evening, West Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi will launch this book. Looking closely at Indias recent history, Nilekani explores in it ideas and attitudes that evolved with time and contributed to the countrys progress, as well as those that kept it shackled to old, unproductive and fundamentally undemocratic ways. He discusses how early government policies failed despite their good intentions, how information technology has revolutionised every Indians daily life, how urbanisation has transformed society and politics and how, contrary to expectation, the countrys youth has now become its greatest strength. He also asks key questions about our future: How the country can avoid mistakes that global powers have made in the past, how an open market economy will stimulate growth, and how this growth will affect and be shaped by the countrys young people.                    Event: Launch of Nandan Nilekanis book, Imagining India When: Today at 7 pm Where: Pala, ITC Sonar

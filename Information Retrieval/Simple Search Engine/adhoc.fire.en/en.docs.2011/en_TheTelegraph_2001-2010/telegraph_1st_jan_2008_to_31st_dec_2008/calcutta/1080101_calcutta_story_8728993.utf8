     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	The oldest Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) has started preparations for its annual extravaganza. 
    
	The three-day Spring Fest 2008, presented in association with The Telegraph, will see students from leading colleges across India competing for top honours in a variety of events on the Kharagpur campus from January 24.
    
	The top draw this year will be UK-based band Breathe  the delicate sound of Floyd, which performs covers of Pink Floyd.
    
	Apart from the regular attractions, the fest will feature a number of new events. Lit-a-thon, a series of literary activities ranging from the popular Just a Minute (JAM) and the good old Whats the Good Word to Turncoat, the debate with a twist, and Crossword, a medley of dumb charade and cryptic clues, will lure those with a penchant for words.
    
	Events like India Calling, in which participants have to provide solutions to pressing problems facing India today, and a national-level debate will add to the intellectual quotient. Nukkad, the street play competition, and Centrifuge, the dance competition, promise to be heavily contested.
    
	For those looking to let their hair down, the band nights will provide the perfect opportunity. Bands across the country will be on song at rock competition Wildfire. The winner will open for the star act from the UK, described as the best Pink Floyd cover band, according to the organisers. 
    
	The performance by Breathe will enhance the stature of the fest. The Bollywood star night will also feature of a line up of stars from the industry, says Tanuj Dora, the head of the Spring Fest organising team.
    
	The fest had attracted over 12,000 people last year. This time, we have invited over 50 colleges in the state as well as the other IITs and the Indian Institutes of Management. We expect footfall of 15,000 plus, said Dora.

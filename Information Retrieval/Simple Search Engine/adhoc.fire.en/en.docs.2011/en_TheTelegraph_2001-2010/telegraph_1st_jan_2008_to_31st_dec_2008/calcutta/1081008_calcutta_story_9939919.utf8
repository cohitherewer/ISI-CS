	The concept behind True Spirit Puja is very good. Its very environment-friendly and thats what I liked the most. Its also a very well-organised Puja contest.              
	Parambrata Chatterjee         
	The concept of True Spirit Puja is special because it deals with aspects of the festivity that are least cared for otherwise, like fire safety and emergency exits. The event encourages civic sensibilities and civilised behaviour.               
	Bickram Ghosh and Jaya Seal Ghosh         
	The best thing about True Spirit is that it focuses on important issues. As judges we focus on art and aesthetics, which is fine, but we often tend to overlook that there are so many hazards involved in such festivities like fire, stampede. If all puja committee members are made aware of these aspects, then we will have safer Pujas. Art and aesthetics are great but not at the cost of safety. True Spirit has upheld these issues.               
	Les Dangerfield,
   Deputy director of British Council Division, British High Commission         
	I think the approach of True Spirit is fresh. They focus more on legal issues rather than aesthetics. It is important to make sure that the festival is safe and environment-friendly.              
	Sanjay Budhia, industrialist        
	I loved the True Spirit experience for two reasons. First because of the company. Jaya and Bickram Ghosh are friends.... It felt like family and what Puja should be all about  enjoying with near and dear ones. Second, the award doesnt focus on flashy pujas. We picked simple, elegant pujas with a civic consciousness. Safety and comfort of the people, and the environment are very important aspects.

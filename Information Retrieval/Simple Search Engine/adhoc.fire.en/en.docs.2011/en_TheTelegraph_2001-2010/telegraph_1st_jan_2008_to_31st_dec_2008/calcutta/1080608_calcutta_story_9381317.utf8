      Climate Watch       Did the CPM kill two birds with one stone by calling Bangla bandh on environment day? The official reason was to protest against the fuel price hike but many environmentalists feel that the party also wanted to avoid criticism for the dismal failure of the state government in protecting the environment.                     
	Did the CPM kill two birds with one stone by calling Bangla bandh on environment day? The official reason was to protest against the fuel price hike but many environmentalists feel that the party also wanted to avoid criticism for the dismal failure of the state government in protecting the environment.                 
	The whole world celebrated environment day with a pledge to reduce climate change. West Bengal was probably the only exception, thanks to the bandh. The government has done nothing to curb automobile and industrial pollution and wanted to avoid climate change, said green activist Naba Dutta.          
	His NGO, Nagarik Mancha, has come out with a booklet on the high carbon footprint of the state. It was luckily released the day before the Left Front bandh. Ditto for the unveiling of a plan by West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation to construct an energy-efficient building.          
	But hundreds of environment day programmes across the state, including one organised by the pollution control board, had to be cancelled. Delegates who travelled to the city only to attend the programmes were left stranded.           
	Parties think twice before calling a bandh on auspicious days for marriage. But they dont hesitate to call a bandh on environment day, said environment activist Subhas Dutta.

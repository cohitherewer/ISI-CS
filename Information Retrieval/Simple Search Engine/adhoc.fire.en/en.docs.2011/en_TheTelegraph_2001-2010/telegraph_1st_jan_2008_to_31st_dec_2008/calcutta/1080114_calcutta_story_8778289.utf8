	A 200-strong civic demolition squad reached the devastated pocket of Burrabazar around 1pm on Sunday, following fears that parts of the Nandaram-Kashiram complex may collapse in the fire.
    
	Civic director-general (building) Gora Chand Mondol inspected the building, which has been in flames for 48 hours hours, in the morning and found that a few top storeys may crumble any moment.
    
	Now, only those parts will be pulled down that can collapse any moment, causing injuries or death, said chief engineer (solid waste management) Arun Sarkar, who was leading the demolition squad.
    
	For a full-fledged demolition, we will have to wait for the buildings structural report and inputs from forensic experts, who have collected samples from the charred structure, he added.
    
	We need to ascertain whether the load-bearing capacity of the building has diminished following the prolonged exposure to heat. It couldnt be done on Sunday, as the four top storeys were still ablaze, said Mondol.
    
	Mondol submitted a preliminary report to civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and will carry out another round of inspection before submitting the final report.
    
	Bandyopadhyay, after receiving the report, got in touch with police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti and urged him to ask his men to push back the onlookers.
    
	Joint municipal commissioner Asish Thakur, chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity and chief engineer Arun Sarkar supervised the logistic support being extended by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to the firefighters.
    
	An official said the law, assessment and licence departments of the civic body are preparing a status report of the Nandaram-Kashiram complex.
    
	The civic water supply department had a tough day ensuring supply to the firemen at Burrabazar, over a lakh people at the Brigade Parade Ground and more than 50,000 Ganga Sagar pilgrims at Outram Ghat.
    
	At the Mullickghat pumping station, special provisions have been made to fill up four fire tenders with water simultaneously. The civic body so far has supplied over five million gallons of water to the firemen.
    
	Fire norm violation
    
	Fire officials alleged that the owners of Nandaram complex had not obtained a no-objection certificate from their department and had also violated the National Building Code (NBC) of 2005.
    
	The NBC Part 4 lays down the safety measures that must be in place in a commercial highrise. 
    
	None was in place in the Nandaram-Kashiram complex, said an official.
    
	The list of measures include an automatic fire detection and alarm system, automatic sprinklers, fire-resistant doors, fire exits, fire lifts and a fire tower (an enclosed staircase that can be approached from various floors through landings and lobbies that are protected by fire-resistant doors).

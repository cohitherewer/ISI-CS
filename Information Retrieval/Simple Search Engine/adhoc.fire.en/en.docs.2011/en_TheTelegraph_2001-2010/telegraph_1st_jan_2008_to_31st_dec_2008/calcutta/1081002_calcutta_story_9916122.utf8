          A STAFF REPORTER                          Last years idol at the Yuvak Gosthi puja. A Telegraph picture                                  
	This Puja, aesthetics and utility are being given equal importance at Yuvak Gosthi, one of the Four Star winners of the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja 2007.        
	While the goddesses are being draped in the traditional Baluchari sari, the organisers are donating blankets to the less fortunate.         
	It is not just about decorating the idols, we also want to help the needy, said Debasish Roy Chowdhury, a member of the Thakurpukur club.        
	Their theme is Murshidabads Baluchar village  which the organisers claim is famous for its saris. They are being used not only for draping the idols but also for mandap decoration. Weavers from the village will be present at the pandal on the Puja days and visitors can buy saris from them.         
	We thought it will help the weavers earn some extra money and it would also draw more visitors, said Roy Chowdhury.        
	While security is of utmost importance to Yuvak Gosthi, which has arranged for sniffer dogs and doorframe metal detectors, for Behala Club Sarbojanin Durgotsav Committee  also showcasing Baluchar  it is fire safety.        
	Apart from the usual fire extinguishers, the committee is arranging for a water tanker, a water hose and smoke and fire alarms.        
	This Four Star winner of Puja 2007 has spent last years prize money on conducting health and eye check-up camps.        
	This year we plan to improve our club library, which lends books to underprivileged children. We also want to arrange for an ambulance for our para, said Sayantan Bhattacharjee, one of the secretaries of the puja committee.         
	The Senhati Durgotsav Samiti, another Four-Star puja last year, is making sure it comes out a winner this year too.        
	Keeping the rules of the True Spirit Puja in mind, we are paying attention to safety, social commitment and civic consciousness, said Rohan Sen, a member of the Behala club that is using folk art from Gujarat, Rajasthan, south India and Bengal for decoration.

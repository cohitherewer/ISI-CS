The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | JU exams deferred
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             JU exams deferred
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University (JU) has yielded to students and decided to defer the semester examinations of the faculty of engineering to December 2, angering teachers who had opposed any change in the exam dates.         
	At the meeting of the executive council, the teachers had put forward their views that exam dates should not be changed at this stage. We are stunned at the way the authorities have ignored our opinion, said a teacher.        
	This is the first time in recent years that members of the CPM-dominated Jadavpur University Teachers Association (Juta) have spoken out so strongly against the JU authorities.        
	The exams were scheduled to begin on November 14 and classes for the next semester were to start on December 8. Now the next semester will begin on December 17.        
	The dates should not have been deferred at the end of the semester. It sets a bad precedent. We will take up the issue during our next meeting, said Keshab Bhattacharya, the general secretary of Juta.        
	The teachers say the students demand is unjustified as the academic calendar  containing details of all academic activities of the university, particularly exam dates  are prepared at the beginning of each session.         
	A draft of the calendar is shown to students representatives, too, a teacher pointed out.        
	The entire academic schedule has been disrupted. Classes can begin only in the third week of December now. This will affect the academic schedule of the next session as well, Biswas said.

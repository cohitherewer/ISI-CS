The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Visit that paved way for verdict
                                                                                                            Visit that paved way for verdict
  - Chief justice inspection of Park Circus Maidan tilted the scales          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	The green rap from Calcutta High Court that signalled a red light for Book Fair 2008 on Monday could have been powered by an on-the-spot inspection carried out by the chief justice of Calcutta High Court.        
	Chief Justice Surinder Singh Nijjar visited Park Circus Maidan on Saturday, two days before delivering the judgment that slammed the brakes on this years Book Fair.        
	Legal circles in the city hailed the rare gesture of the chief justice. The general practice is that the court appoints a special officer who visits the contentious spot and then files a report.        
	It is rare for a chief justice to visit the site of dispute before delivering a judgment. I cannot recall such an incident in the recent past, said Sardar Amjad Ali, the lawyer appearing for a petitioner battling to save Park Circus Maidan from the boi mela.        
	During his visit to Park Circus Maidan on Saturday, the chief justice visited educational institutions and hospitals located in the area to gauge the problems that the common people would face if the fair was held, said advocate Jayanta N. Chatterjee.        
	Mondays judgment has once again turned the spotlight on the 58-year-old chief justice who had earlier hit the headlines in connection with the two burning issues in Bengal  police firing in Nandigram and acquisition of land in Singur by the state government for the Tata car project.        
	Before assuming charge of Calcutta High Court on March 7, 2007, S.S. Nijjar was the acting chief justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court, and the executive chairman of Punjab State Legal Services Authority.

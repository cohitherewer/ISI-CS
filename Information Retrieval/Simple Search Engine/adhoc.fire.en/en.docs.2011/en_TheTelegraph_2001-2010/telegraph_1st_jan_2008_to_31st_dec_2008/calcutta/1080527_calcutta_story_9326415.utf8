The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro |Freaking out at fun camps 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Freaking out at fun camps

	Anushree Kariwal is not going out of town for the summer vacations, but she is not missing out on the fun either. I am going to a summer camp and have made many new friends there, chirps the Class V student of Modern High School. Stuti Modi, a Class VI student of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy also loves attending summer camps. Learning is enjoyable here as we are taught through games, she says. Four-year-old Sneha Singhi shares similar feelings and is reluctant to go home. These kids are part of an increasing number that prefers activity camps to homes during vacations.         
	Working parents and nuclear families have left children with little recreation at home. Summer camps, on the other hand, have opened up activity options for kids during vacations. Thus parents would rather see their wards in these camps than in front of the television or before a computer playing games. This accounts for the numerous summer camps being organised in the city and their huge popularity. Children are taught a variety of activities from vocabulary building, doing small experiments, puppetry, making face masks, miniature gardening, tie and dye, breadcraft, jewellery designing, bowling, skating to self-defence mechanisms like kick boxing.        
	My daughter is a regular in many summer camps. These camps help her spend time productively, says fashion designer Sweta Malpani who has sent her daughter to the Just Kidding camp at Alipore. Some of these camps are organised by individuals while others are held in popular bookstores or clubs.         
	Parents have little time for children these days, so summer camps come in handy. Besides, kids can learn various creative activities here which cannot be done during school hours, says Saurabh Rungta, director of Kriya, a company organising workshops, events and programmes for children and youth.         
	Kriya has a summer carnival lined up to cater to kids from 5 to 16.         
	We categorise children according to their age and teach them different activities. Earlier we used to have one camp a season. But now parents and kids want it every season and even the number of children attending has gone up, he adds. The group has closed the registration at 300 for this season. We want to give kids a platform to explore their talents and interact with other children, says Nisha Dhannani, one of the organisers of Just Kidding.         
	This time we have stopped the registration at 20 so that we can give every child individual attention. We are also trying to build group behaviour and leadership qualities in them, she adds. The children here have also been taken to a soft drink making factory to see what goes on behind the scenes.         
	 Even if a parent is not working, it is difficult to keep kids tied at home, says homemaker Shradha Rungta. Children these days have such a packed schedule in school that they get bored at home. They want to keep doing different activities. Thus summer camps come as a big relief.

	Chat with Grandmaster                  Anand    
	He wonders whether cricket mania and financial graphics go hand in hand. He does not believe in a single role model, but chooses to follow the principles of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. He wants to see more youths taking an interest in chess in India. Meet Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand as he backs mind games over commercial tactics.         
	A Padma Shri awardee at the age of 18, Anand is busy promoting chess in schools and popularising the game through NIITs Mind Champions Academy. A workshop was held at the NIIT Imperia Centre for Advanced Learning on May 9 to mark the launch of the 2008-2009 series of Chess Master an inter-school chess competition participated in by students from over 4,000 government and private schools in India.         
	The interactive workshop was held simultaneously across 12 cities including Calcutta, Bangalore and Pune, through video conferencing. Around 15 students, winners of various intra-school chess contests, were present for the session in each city. Anand unveiled the horse head shaped Chess Master mascot and demonstrated a few gaming tricks.         
	The Chess Master tournament is held at five levels inter-school, district, state, zonal and national  with over 175,000 participants. The winners are felicitated and mentored by Anand. In his inaugural address, Anand said: Chess is a unique sport. It helps in improving concentration and accelerates success in academics.        
	You must go through the basics everyday, if you want to improve yourself in any field, was his advice to aspiring players.         
	In the one-and-a-half-hour interactive session, the five-time Chess Oscar winner explained a few gaming strategies, some basic moves like smothering and castling and gave an overview of the chess scenario in India.         
	I have heard a lot about Viswanathan Anand, and feel extremely happy to have interacted with him today, gushed thirteen-year-old Aranya Bose, a student of Central Model School, Barrackpore after the session.        
	Anand said he was looking forward to the World Championship and other international tournaments this year.

	The Diary        In a thousand light years
  nI am away from pain,
  From tears and fears,
  When youre there,
  In a thousand light years.
  Im united with the
  colours of the rainbow, when
  You walk up to me
  In sunshine,
  In a thousand light years.
  I visit the oceans depths,
  When you bare your
  soul to me,
  In a thousand light years.
  In a thousand light years,
  I rise like a phoenix
  From fire and ashes
  To live with thee.  
	 Pallavi Singh, 
  Third year, English, Lady Barbourne College        
	 Desired hues        
	I will paint 
  The rainbow for you 
  In my little canvas 
  Of million shades ... 
  Perfection ? 
  Attainable when I am Us. 
  Sustenance? 
  I can promise. 
  Just that 
  Dont bring me a palette of dark black 
  The day after.

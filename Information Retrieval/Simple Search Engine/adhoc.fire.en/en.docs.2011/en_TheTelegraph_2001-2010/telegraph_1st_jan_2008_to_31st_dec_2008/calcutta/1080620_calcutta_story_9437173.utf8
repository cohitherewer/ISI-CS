          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	The driver of the truck that killed Saheli Roy on Saturday morning on the Bypass was arrested two days later but is free on bail.        
	Kechmat Ali was at least arrested. For the 90-odd lives lost in city roads in the two-and-a-half months between April and June 18, the police have succeeded in picking up only 20 drivers and all are out on bail (see graphic).        
	Ali was booked for rash driving (Section 279 of the IPC) and causing grievous hurt (Section 337) and death due to negligence (Section 304A). Officers say in all fatal cases where the victim has had to be hospitalised, drivers are booked under these sections and are released immediately because they are all bailable offences.         
	The case continues, though the driver may be out on bail. Next, he would have to turn up for a hearing before the deputy commissioner (traffic) and his licence would be impounded, depending on the extent of his offence, said a senior traffic officer.        
	So long as his licence remains impounded, a driver cannot drive. Usually, this period varies from a few weeks to six months and stretches to a maximum of a year in rare cases. For a driver, that is a big punishment, the officer added.        
	If the maximum of one years impounding is rare, what is big punishment to the officer may not seem so to many, certainly not to the families of those who have lost their lives.        
	Besides, it is no great secret that driving licences in fake names are easier to get than passports in fake names.        
	An arrest, followed by release on bail, is all the justice that the family of Saheli and of 21-year-old Raju Bag, who was crushed under the wheels of a private bus in Cossipur Road on May 24, can expect.        
	The polices record of failure to arrest  70 in the past two-and-a-half months  itself shows how easy it is pull wool over the laws eyes.        
	An officer said: Going by the registration number of a vehicle, you can trace the owner and ask him for the drivers address. On many occasions, the addresses provided turn out to be false and you cant do anything.        
	In several instances, not only the driver, even the vehicle remains unidentified.         
	In June, for example, of the 21 fatal cases, eight vehicles have remained unknown. Of the eight, we have learnt that five are private buses, said the officer.        
	Even when an arrest is made and the chargesheet submitted quickly, the trial takes time to begin. But that may be a minor hitch compared to what could follow.        
	Ranvir Kumar, the special additional commissioner of police (traffic), said: It is difficult to prove that the driver was driving with an intention to kill. Besides, at the trial stage, drivers sometimes turn up and plead guilty before the court and they are allowed to walk free after paying a fine.

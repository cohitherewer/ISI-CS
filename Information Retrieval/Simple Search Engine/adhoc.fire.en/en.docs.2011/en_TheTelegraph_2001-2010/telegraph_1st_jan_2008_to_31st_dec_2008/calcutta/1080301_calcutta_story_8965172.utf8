The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Caller key to murder, say cops
                                                                                                               Caller key to murder, say cops
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Srabontis husband Partha has been questioned in the probe into the double murders. A Telegraph picture                                  
	A team from Jagachha police on Friday visited several PCOs in the city from where Srabonti Ghosh had received about 30 calls in the past two months. Srabonti and her eight-year-old daughter were found murdered in their Howrah home on Tuesday.        
	We havent obtained a lead yet. The identity of the person who made the calls could hold the key to the murders, said a senior officer of the district police.        
	The investigators found out about the calls from one of Srabontis cellphones. Her other cellphone is missing. We have sought the call records of the missing cellphone. The phone would have helped us nail the killers and thats the reason they fled with it, added the officer.        
	The investigators have again questioned Srabontis husband Partha, neighbour Indrajit Das, alias Chandan, and his wife Shyamashree over the matter.        
	There are contradictions in their statements, said an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department, which has been assisting Howrah police in the probe.         
	A neighbour had seen Shyamashree enter the Ghoshs house on Tuesday afternoon, hours before the murder. Shyamashree and Srabonti were also heard arguing.        
	Shyamashree has denied that there was a heated exchange between the two, said another officer.

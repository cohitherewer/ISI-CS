The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Marks soar after BA, B.Sc review
                                                                                                               Marks soar after BA, B.Sc review
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	The marks of more than 60 per cent of the review applicants of BA/B.Sc Part I and II have increased, prompting academics to question the credibility of Calcutta Universitys evaluation system.        
	The results, announced on Tuesday, reinforced the doubts over the examination system triggered by the review outcome of B.Com (Part I and II). More than half the B.Com review applicants had their marks increased.        
	We will analyse the results later and only then will we be in a position to say why the marks of so many candidates have changed, said Debashis Biswas, the deputy controller of examinations.        
	Of the 6,888 Part I applicants, 4,254 (61.7 per cent) have had their marks increased from one to 15 per cent. The marks of more than 100 students have risen by 11 to 15 per cent. Of the 9,097 Part II applicants, the marks of 6,413 (70.5 per cent) have increased from one to 15 per cent. Around 40 students have had their marks hiked by 11 to 15 per cent.        
	Its a matter of concern that the marks of so many students have changed after the review. We need to find out whether the examiners are properly assessing the answer scripts, said an official in the examination department.        
	Sources said the university may call a meeting with the examiners to find out the lapses in the evaluation system.        
	After the B.Com review results were announced on February 25, senior university officials had hinted that the examination system might have to be recast.

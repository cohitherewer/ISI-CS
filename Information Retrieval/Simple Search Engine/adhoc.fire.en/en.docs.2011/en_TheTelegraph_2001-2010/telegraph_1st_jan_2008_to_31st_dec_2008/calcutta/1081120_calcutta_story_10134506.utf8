          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Police on Wednesday spoke to the three persons whose names were scrawled by 50-year-old businessman Swapan Banerjee on the walls of his flat before entering into a death pact with his wife and son on Tuesday.        
	He was found lying in his Bijoygarh flat with signs of poisoning, while his wife Urmi, 42, and son Rajrup, 12, were found dead.         
	Letters found in the flat claimed Swapan had borrowed around Rs 20-25 lakh and was being hounded by debtors.         
	The police said they could not officially interrogate the trio named by Swapan without a formal complaint. An unnatural death case has been started. We are waiting for a formal complaint from the relatives of the deceased, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Ajey Ranade.         
	Swapan has been admitted to MR Bangur Hospital. He is semi-conscious, but stable, said hospital superintendent Subhasish Saha.        
	We will question him as soon as his condition improves. Cases of murder and attempt to suicide may be started against him once we ascertain the chain of events leading to the deaths, Ranade said.        
	Sources in Jadavpur police station revealed that of the three persons named by Swapan, one is a government employee. The others are a bank employee and a developer.         
	The three persons named by Swapan are close to the ruling party. One of them  a government employee  is a member of the CPM-dominated local ward committee, said a local resident.        
	There are discrepancies in Swapans declaration on the wall. He had mentioned that the trio had confined the family to their flat since November 6. But a neighbour said she had met Swapan and his son on Monday.

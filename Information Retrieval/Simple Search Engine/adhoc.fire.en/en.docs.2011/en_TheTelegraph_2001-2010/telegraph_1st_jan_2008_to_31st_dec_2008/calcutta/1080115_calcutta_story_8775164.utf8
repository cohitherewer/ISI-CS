        On the rhythm divine
   Founded in 2006, Sapphire rsquo;s school section focuses on groundbreaking new ideas in dance forms. It is associated with the various academic and cultural institutions to help make dance a part of the total educational curriculum and child-friendly modules of activities that connect to the overall development of children and youth in general. Souls in Tranzit is a dance recital featuring the lead performers of Sapphire, Dibendyu Nath and Paramita Saha. The piece developed out of Tranz, a choreolab organized by Anita Ratnam in Chennai last year. It explores in a non-linear perspective the flux of human relationships. Also, part of the evening would be three performances by the senior artistes of Sapphire, Ekaki ndash; a celebration of solitude, Dwaitagati ndash; an exchange of duet kinetics and Seduction ndash; a captivating solo (based on a South American ballad). The evening also has guest performers Roger Sinha and Natasha Bakht from Sinha Danse, a renowned dance company based in Montreal. The duo (in picture) shall perform an eclectic combination of traditional and modern techniques and themes.

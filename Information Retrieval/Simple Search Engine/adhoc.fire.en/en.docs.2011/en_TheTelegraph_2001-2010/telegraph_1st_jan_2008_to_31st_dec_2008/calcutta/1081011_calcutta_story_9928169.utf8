          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University is focussing on mental development and counselling of students to stop ragging on campus, after realising that punishment alone cannot curb the menace.        
	The university will introduce a series of programmes for overall mental development of the students so that they do not develop the inclination to rag juniors.        
	The programmes will include lectures and workshops on lifestyle and counselling. Its difficult to stop ragging by suspending or expelling the guilty students. We need to ensure proper development of the mental health of the students, said dean (students affairs) Rajat Roy.        
	Twenty-four students were recently suspended for ragging a first-year girl on the campus.        
	But a week after the authorities announced the decision, another first-year student lodged a complaint alleging that he had been tortured mentally and physically by some seniors.        
	Following interaction with students, the authorities have concluded that seniors often do not realise the hazards of ragging, Roy said.        
	Lack of awareness is driving a section of students to rag juniors. We want to ensure that everyone thinks positive after joining the university, the official added.        
	Sources said the mental health programme will start with lectures for first-year students by psychiatrists and psychological counsellors after the puja vacation.        
	All three faculties  arts, science and engineering  have been asked to allot hours for the lectures.        
	The lectures will also cover issues like hazards of addiction to drugs, tobacco, marijuana and drinking alcohol.

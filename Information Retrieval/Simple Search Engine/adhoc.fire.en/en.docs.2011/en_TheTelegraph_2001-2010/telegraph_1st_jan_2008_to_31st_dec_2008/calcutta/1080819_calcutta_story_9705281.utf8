The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Victory boost to soccer talent
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Victory boost to soccer talent
  - Heroics by Indian team inspire future stars to practise harder         RITH BASU                                                    Children warm up before a practice session at Dukhiram Majumdar Coaching Scheme on the Maidan            Trainees practise heading at Dassnagar Juva Sangha.

	The dream run of Bhaichung Bhutias boys in AFC Challenge Cup has provided a much-needed fillip to young footballers in the city. Energised by the Indian teams victory last week, most of them have been sweating it out on the pitch longer and harder.        
	Celebrating the countrys triumphs in football is an alien experience for most youngsters who want to take up the game professionally. Now that they have had a taste of it, they want to make it a habit.        
	I was always a fan of Manchester United in the English Premier League and Mohun Bagan in Indian tournaments. But today I want to shout out that I am a fan of the Indian football team too, says Rajdeep Roy, a Class X student of Salkia Hindu High School.        
	The 120 others who practise with him at Howrahs Dassnagar Juva Sangha grounds feel the same way.        
	By maintaining a no-loss record and dismissing Tajikistan 4-1 in the final last Wednesday, the Indian team has given the youngsters the licence to dream big.        
	While cheering India on at AFC Challenge Cup, I thought how thrilling it would be if it was the World Cup, says Rajdeep, a midfielder who loves to try bicycle kicks like Bhaichung.         
	Echoing Rajdeep, Bengal Under-14 goalie Shubhadip Bose says he never saw any subcontinent team play better than the men in blue in the AFC Challenge Cup final. It seemed the team was playing as a unit. Defenders were supporting attacking moves while strikers were running back to help the defence. It was an inspiring show. After that, I am practising harder than ever, says the Subrata Pal fan.        
	Coaches are both excited and relieved after the win. They ask those training under them to watch soccer on television, but it only rubs in the fact that Indian football is leagues behind the Brazils and the Barcelonas of the world. But the boys returned to the football field invigorated after last Wednesday.        
	I told my forwards to follow Bhaichungs game. I asked Shubhadip to watch Subrata Pal. Heroics by Indian players obviously inspire them more. My students came to the ground charged after the countrys victory, said former national team winger Monojit Das, who coaches 150-odd boys at Dukhiram Majumdar Coaching Scheme.        
	One of the trainees, 15-year-old Mohammed Akil, has been taking the 3.30am local train from Joynagar for years to attend our practice session at 7am. These are kids who needed the win for inspiration and they got it, adds the coach.        
	Dassnagar Juba Sangha coach Ramen Das, however, stressed the need for decent equipment and proper grounds for talents to flourish. If a child gets injured each time he heads the ball or dives, he will shy away from doing so, he says.

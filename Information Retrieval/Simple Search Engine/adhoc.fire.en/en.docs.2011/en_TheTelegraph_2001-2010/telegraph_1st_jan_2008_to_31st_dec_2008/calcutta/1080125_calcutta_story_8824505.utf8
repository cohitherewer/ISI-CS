	 It is not the visitors but the animals who need better protection at the zoo. Animals at times enjoy the presence of spectators but some irresponsible visitors irritate and misbehave with them in cruel ways. Accordingly they are paid back in their own coin.

	The incidents of December 5 and 25 clearly indicate that the animals need better protection at the zoo. Under Alipore Zoological Garden (Management) Rules 1957 playing radio and musical instruments is forbidden there. Moreover, teasing and feeding animals are strictly prohibited and in fact punishable according to the rules. Communicating this information to the huge population (62,000 on December 25, 2007, or 40,000 on January 1, 2008) may seem a daunting task. But we are in the era of technological excellence. What about CCTVs, motion detector systems, sensors and other security measures which are applicable for safekeeping of museum exhibits? The zoo has been set up to preserve bio-diversity (by captive breeding), educational and scientific researches and permanent exhibition of species to general public. So, we have an ethical responsibility towards the lives in the cages or enclosures.

	 Given the present scenario, I sincerely feel that the zoo authorities should take immediate action to protect people. If this kind of attack takes place again visitors would be too terror-stricken to visit zoos. The authorities should depute guards near the cages so that people do not get a chance to disturb the animals that may lead them to attack a visitor. I think protection is required for both the animals and the people. However not showcasing your animal instincts in front of the animals is the best way in which we can protect ourselves.

	 The zoo is one spot that invariably attracts visitors of all ages. The recent incidents at Alipore and Guwahati zoos are grim pointers to the grave consequences that follow from uncalled-for daring. In the Sipahijwala sanctuary in Tripura too a man paid dearly for playing pranks with animals. The authorities callousness is responsible for the threat to people and animals at the zoo.

	In todays world human beings are torturing animals so terribly that protecting them is becoming essential. Animals born free are being imprisoned in cages for mans entertainment and knowledge enhancement. But the worst thing is the inhuman behaviour meted out to these creatures by visitors to zoos. Animals too have feelings and theyve every right to express them. The zoo authorities ought to think about their comfort and security. It is needless to say that visitors need protection too. They can certainly protect themselves if they remain humane and behave properly.

	 It is only in our country that incidents of teasing animals takes place. Let a few visitors be taught a lesson by the animals; the desire to derive sadistic pleasure will automatically wither away in others. Visitors should not be given extra protection.

	In most of the zoo accidents resulting in death of or injury to a visitor, it will be found that in most cases the animals were disturbed by people, disobeying rules. If the visitors tease animals, they would be provoked to attack. In such circumstances it is the animals who need better protection from the unruly crowd. In a few cases, laxity in locking of the cages may be responsible for an accident. In order to avoid such incidents protective barriers need to be placed between the animals and the people.

	Visitors at the zoo need to be disciplined. The animals are protected but some visitors are repeatedly flouting rules meant for the protection of the visitors. The incident that took place in a zoo in Assam is a classic example. The visitor was mauled by the tiger whose enclosure he had approached to take a close shot. Some years ago a visitor had entered a tigers enclosure to garland the beast. Naturally he was killed by the animal. Every visitor should abide by the laws of the zoo in order to be safe at the zoo.

nAnimals in the zoo, today, need more protection than human beings. People dont mind throwing stones and even makes faces at animals. Given a chance they would possibly poke an animal to tease it. The animals never go out of their way to harm people. But they will grab their prey if it walks up to them. Visitors should maintain a safe distance from the enclosures to avoid accidents.

	Animals definitely need protection if there is a chance of insecurity. It is only lunatic visitors who disturb the animals by crossing the security zone and disturb them as is evident from the incidents that took place in Alipore and Guwahati zoos. Animals have no other means of defending themselves except for attacking the social animals for self-defence.

	The incident at Guwahati zoo is similar to what happened in Calcutta in 2000. Garlanding an animal or aspiring to have a closer view for photography invites the same kind of danger. Both visitors and animals are well- protected. It is the over-enthusiasm of some visitors that cause these accidents.

	The animals obviously need better protection. Most of them are suffering from lack of proper food. The enclosure for the chimps is unsafe. They should be protected from the teasing of visitors. The rusty cages of the giraffes and other animals demand a fresh coat of paint. The authorities ought to maintain the the zoo properly. 
       
	

Dinabandhu Mukerjee,

	The incident of visitors throwing stones at a chimpanzee at Alipore zoo which made the animal retaliate was shocking. They have made it a habit to disturb animals when visitors are not even allowed to feed animals. The animals feel uneasy in cages so if they are disturbed they become furious. During visiting hours, the enclosures should be kept under constant vigilance. The visitors need to know how to behave in a zoo, so notices should be put up in all local languages in front of all enclosures. Short films may also be screened to increase awareness. Spot fines should be realised from visitors who harass animals.

	Security arrangements in a zoo should be for both animals and visitors. People should realise that since the animals have been captivated for our entertainment and knowledge it is unfair to tease them.

	I think the animals need better protection than the visitors. People throw stones, coins and fruits to draw the attention of the animals in spite of the notices warning them not to indulge in such acts. Naturally the animals feel irritated and attack the visitors.

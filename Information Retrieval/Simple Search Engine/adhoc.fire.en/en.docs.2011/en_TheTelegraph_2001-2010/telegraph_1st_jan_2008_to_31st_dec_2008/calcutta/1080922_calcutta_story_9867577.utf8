          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Union urban development ministry has sanctioned Rs 236 crore under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission for Vivekananda and Nagerbazar flyovers and Sector V sewage revamp.         
	At a meeting in New Delhi on Friday, it was decided that Rs 153 crore would be allocated for the first phase of Vivekananda flyover, connecting the Howrah bridge approach to Girish Park.        
	The state urban development minister, Asok Bhattacharya, also announced Rs 49 crore will be released for the Nagerbazar flyover.        
	A water supply and sewer network will be developed and maintained in Sector V with an allotment of Rs 34 crore.        
	For all the projects, the Centre will provide 35 per cent of the total cost, while the CMDA will bear the rest. Work will start after Puja, said Bhattacharya.        
	The Centre also agreed to provide the second instalment of funds for five other projects at the meeting.        
	These are part of the City Development Plan for Calcutta. About six months back, we had sought approval from the Centre for projects worth Rs 3,000 crore under this plan, said the minister.        
	The projects for which funds havent yet been released include an elevated road between Park Circus and Parama Island on EM Bypass. Bhattacharya described it as a fast-track carriageway over the existing Park Circus-EM Bypass connector.        
	The proposed link is expected to cost around Rs 350 crore, according to the minister.        
	The other pending projects are related to sewage and drainage, water supply and solid waste management.        
	The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission was launched as a seven-year programme in 2005-06 to encourage reforms and speed up planned development of designated cities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Slap sparks gang assault
                                                                                                               Slap sparks gang assault
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A gang assaulted the manager of a fast food centre in Jadavpur after he slapped one of his workers, 15-year-old Ram Kumar Shaw, who had broken a jug on Wednesday night.        
	Sukanta Malik, who suffered multiple injuries, lodged a police complaint but no one has been arrested.        
	The accused youths also threatened the owner of the fast food centre, Rajiv Kumar Paul, to close down his establishment. We had never received such a threat before, said Paul.        
	Rams father Mangal Shaw told the police he had no allegation against Malik or Paul. Sukantada had no intention of hurting me, said Ram.        
	Sukanta said Ram had broken a jug when the eatery was closing for the day. When I asked him to be careful, he made obscene gestures at me. I slapped him mildly, after which he ran away and raised a hue and cry. Some youths then dragged me out and beat me up. One of them kicked me repeatedly and hit me on the head with a heavy object.        
	Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police (South 24-Parganas), said: We are looking into the complaint.

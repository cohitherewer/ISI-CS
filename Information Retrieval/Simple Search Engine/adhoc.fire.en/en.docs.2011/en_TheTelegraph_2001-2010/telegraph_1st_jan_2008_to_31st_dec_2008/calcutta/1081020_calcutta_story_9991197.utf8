                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Revved-up youth on bike gives CM convoy a scare
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A young man racing the wind on his motorcycle with girlfriend riding pillion landed in trouble when he tried to zip past Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees convoy on Sunday afternoon.        
	The chief ministers guards saw Santosh Ghosh (name changed), a student of a reputable city college, as a security threat when the motorcycle overtook two of the vehicles in the convoy at the crossing of Syed Amir Ali Avenue and Nasiruddin Road, near Park Circus.        
	Traffic constables deployed along that stretch of road had tried to stop Santosh seconds earlier but he wouldnt pay heed. Girlfriend Rani Majumdar, who is studying business management, had her arms wrapped around him as they zoomed past the constables and caught up with Bhattacharjees convoy.        
	When the duo came too close for comfort, the vehicle carrying commandos blocked the road. A traffic sergeant in pursuit of the motorcycle arrived, too, and forced the youth and his companion to get off the two-wheeler, said a police officer.         
	Santosh and Rani were taken to Karaya police station and interrogated for two hours. The duo told the police that they were going from an EM Bypass apartment complex near Hiland Park to MusicWorld on Park Street.         
	We did not find anything against them. They were allowed to go after we charged the boy for rash and negligent driving, said Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south).         
	The incident occurred around 5pm, when Bhattacharjee was on his way to Nandan from his 59 Palm Avenue residence.         
	The chief minister reached Nandan safely but officers in his security team said the sight of the motorcycle closing in on the convoy at high speed triggered panic, even if for a while.        
	An officer of the traffic department said the average speed of the chief ministers convoy was 60kmph. Other vehicles on the route that the convoy takes are supposed to slow down the moment they spot the row of vehicles or are alerted by the pilot cars siren.        
	We were lucky that the two were college students. They could have been terrorists. This incident highlighted the need to review the chief ministers security, an official said.

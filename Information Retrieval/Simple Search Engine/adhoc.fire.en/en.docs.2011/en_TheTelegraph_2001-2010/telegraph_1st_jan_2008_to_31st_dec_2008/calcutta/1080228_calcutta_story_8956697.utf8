The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Date for court view on CBI probe
                                                                                                               Date for court view on CBI probe
										      OUR LEGAL REPORTER      RIZ DEATH                              
	The high court is likely to express its view on Thursday on the report of the CBI probe into the mysterious death of Rizwanur Rahman.        
	The main hearing of the case, however, will take place on March 5.        
	During the last hearing on February 20, Justice Dipankar Dutta had said he would need some time to go through the report before expressing his views.        
	The judge made the comment after CBI counsel Ranjan Roy submitted that his client did not want the probe report to be made public at this stage.         
	If the report is made public now, the investigation and filing of chargesheets will be jeopardised, Roy argued.        
	Rizwanur, a computer graphics teacher, was found dead on September 21 beside the railway tracks in Patipukur, near Dum Dum. Days before, he had married Priyanka Todi, the daughter of businessman Ashok Todi, against her familys wishes.        
	Rizwanurs family had alleged that the Todis and a section of senior police officers had pressured him to leave Priyanka.        
	The CBIs brief was to find out whether the Tiljala youth had committed suicide or had been murdered, and whether the police had illegally interfered in his married life, said a legal expert.        
	The Todis and the accused officers had argued in court that they be allowed to file affidavits after the probe report is made public. But the plea has been opposed by Rizwanurs family. Kalyan Banerjee, appearing for the Rahmans, said: The probe into Rizwanurs death will not remain fair if the Todis and the police officers file affidavits after going through the CBI report.

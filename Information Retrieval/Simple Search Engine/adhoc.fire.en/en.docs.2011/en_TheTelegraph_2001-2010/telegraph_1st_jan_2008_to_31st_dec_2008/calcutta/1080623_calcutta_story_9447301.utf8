	The state government has taken up a project to preserve monuments and heritage buildings in the city and the districts.        
	Town Hall and BBD Bag are some of the heritage spots that will come under the conservation project, which the public works department will undertake along with the civic body, state heritage commission and the directorate of state archaeology and museums.        
	Among the short-listed structures in the districts are the ancient temples of Kalna, terracotta temples in Bishnupur, a Buddhist monastery in Maldas Jagjibanpur and the Jain temples in Purulia.        
	Around Rs 5 crore will be spent in the first phase of the project.        
	Several monuments and heritage buildings across the state are in a deplorable condition. We will identify them and restore their glory, said Gautam Sengupta, a member of the West Bengal Heritage Commission and the director of state archaeology and museums.        
	There are many structures of historical importance that do not figure on the state or central heritage list. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyays house in Chinsurah and the Hooghly Imambara are the most prominent among them. The commission is trying to identify the structures and conserve them, said Sengupta.        
	A PWD official said the tender process for the conservation of the 108 buildings has begun and work will start after monsoon. The construction work will be monitored by the local bodies, like municipalities and the district administration, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Strike cloud over Metro
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Strike cloud over Metro
  - Contract workers threaten to block tracks           A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Metro Railway contract workers have threatened to block trains indefinitely from Thursday morning to press for permanent jobs.         
	This is the first time a workers agitation threatens Metro services in two-and-a-half decades of operation.         
	The Metro contract workers union supported by the Congress wrote to the railway authorities last week to issue an ultimatum. It said Metro Rail roko was the last resort to secure the demands of the contract workers.         
	There are 960 maintenance workers who have been serving Metro Railway on contract for over 20 years now. We have been demanding regularisation of their jobs and setting up of departments for them. Its time Metro Railway authorities appoint them in permanent positions so that they can enjoy some job security, said Sunil Koley, the working president of the Congress-backed Metro Railways Maintenance Contractor Sramik Union.         
	Over a thousand contract workers affiliated to the union and the Calcutta Contract Labour Union (Metro Unit), supported by Citu, are going to block the trains from Thursday. Trinamul Congress-backed Metro Railways Checking Assistants Union is going to provide moral support for bringing the citys transport lifeline to a halt.         
	Our men are in charge of maintenance. We will turn off the power supply and sit on the tracks at all stations from 8am. We will not let trains ply day after day. Let the authorities stop us if they can, said Koley.        
	Metro services depend largely on the contract workers. From pulling up the shutters at the stations in the morning to switching off the lights at night, the 960 workers are an integral part of the operations.         
	The authorities, however, put up a brave front. If anybody tries to obstruct or resist the normal movement of Metro trains, we will do the needful. Instructions have been issued to our staff to take necessary action and prevent any disruption, Metro Railway chief operations manager Jayanta Mitra told Metro.         
	The demands of the contract workers are already being considered. A decision will be taken by the top management before long, in accordance with the recommendations of the Labour Advisory Board, he added.         
	According to Mitra, nobody can assure the workers that all 960 of them will be regularised and the work that they do will be departmentalised. Under no circumstances must the commuters be harassed or inconvenienced. Such a thing has never happened in Metro Railway.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A team of German experts is due in February 2009 to scout for business ideas. The mixed-bag delegation will visit educational campuses, providing a perspective on Indo-German cooperation potentials.        
	The objective is to identify marketable opportunities, facilitating one-to-one contacts and a series of exchanges, Gunjan Bhardwaj, the manager (business advisory services) of Ernst amp; Young tells Metro.        
	The lecture-workshop series, with students and faculty of IIT Kharagpur, Presidency College and Jadavpur University, is being jointly organised by E amp;Ys India Competence Center and the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta.        
	E amp;Y wants to invest in a centre of excellence with IIT Kharagpur and plans to broker student-exchange programmes between universities of Bengal and Baden-Wrttemberg, in south-western Germany.        
	This forum will provide valuable exposure to our students and a sneak peek into the latest trends in innovation management. We can look at meaningful exchanges, feels Sanjib Ghosh, the principal of Presidency College.        
	The German team will also look at small firms and funding opportunities, besides sponsoring Ph.D candidates. Germany is the intellectual leader of modern Europe and Calcutta has traditionally been the intellectual capital of India. So, theres a lot of natural synergy, says a team member.        
	E amp;Ys India Competence Center feels financial and accounting competence is a core strength in Calcutta which can be leveraged, as can the soft skills and engineering talent. Also, because of its location, it could become the East/Southeast Asia hub for many European firms.

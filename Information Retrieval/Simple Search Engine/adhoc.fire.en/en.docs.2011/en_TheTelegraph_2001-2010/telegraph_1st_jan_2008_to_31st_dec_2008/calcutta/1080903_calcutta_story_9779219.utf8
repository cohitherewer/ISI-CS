          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Thai-Indian consortium ITD-ITD CEM has been awarded the tender for modernisation of Calcutta airport, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said on Tuesday.        
	The ministry took the decision after the bidding process got over. The Airports Authority of India board will approve it tomorrow, the minister said during a personal visit to the city.        
	The bhoomi puja for the new buildings will be performed during Durga puja. Work is likely to start soon thereafter, Patel added. The cost of the first phase of the three-phased modernisation project has had to be revised from Rs 1,942 crore to Rs 2,500 crore because of the delay.        
	Work on the first phase was scheduled to start in January 2008 and end by 2010. Details of the two other phases are yet to be worked out.        
	ITD of Thailand, which was involved in the construction of Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok, and its Indian partner ITD CEM had quoted the lowest price among the four bidders.         
	After winning the financial bid which was opened in June, the ITD-ITD CEMs proposal was vetted by a technical committee. We have set ourselves a two-year deadline to complete the project. Work will start soon after we get the formal clearance, an ITD-CEM official said from Mumbai.        
	The group is involved in various construction projects in Bengal, including a highway.

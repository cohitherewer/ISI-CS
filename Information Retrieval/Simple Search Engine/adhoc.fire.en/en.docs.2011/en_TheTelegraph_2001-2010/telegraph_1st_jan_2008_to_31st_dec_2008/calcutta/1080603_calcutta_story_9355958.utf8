                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dacoity ward-off claim in death
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sudha Ghosh: Throttled to death. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                
	A homemaker in her mid-30s was found murdered at her Thakurpukur home on Monday morning, with strangulation marks on her throat and blood stains on the lips.        
	Sudha Ghoshs husband Sourin, 52, told police that his wife might have been killed while trying to resist dacoits, who looted cash and valuables from the house. But police are not convinced, as there were no signs of the house being raided.        
	There are some other discrepancies, too. Ghosh said he had no idea when his house was raided as he was sleeping in an adjacent room. Even the couples seven-year-old son Vishal, who was with Sudha, had no clue that their room was barged into and his mother was killed at night, said an investigating officer.        
	Sudhas father Shankar Dutta told the police that Ghosh, who runs a grille manufacturing unit on the same premises as the house, would return home drunk home every night and beat up his wife. We questioned Ghosh following the complaint, the officer added.        
	Sudhas cellphone is missing since morning. The sleuths came to know that she had received two text messages, around 9.30pm and 11.30pm on Sunday, and a call around 2.30am on Monday. The messages and the call came from the number of Khwaja Ahmed, who hasnt yet been traced.                  Sourin Ghosh: Conflicting accounts. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya       
	Ghosh told the police that he woke up around 5.30am and found the door of Sudhas room open and the almirah inside ransacked. My brother had given me Rs 1 lakh before leaving for Mumbai a few days ago. The money and other valuables were missing from the almirah, he told the sleuths.        
	He claimed he tried to wake up Sudha but found her dead.        
	But the sleuths found that the lock on the gate was intact. It was lying on the floor, as if a family member had opened it, said an officer. There was also no sign of any fight or ransacking in the room.        
	A few days ago, neighbours had allegedly caught a mason, identified as Kazimul, while he was coming out of the house at night. Kazimuls brother Hasimul was called to the police station and asked to produce his brother within a couple of days.

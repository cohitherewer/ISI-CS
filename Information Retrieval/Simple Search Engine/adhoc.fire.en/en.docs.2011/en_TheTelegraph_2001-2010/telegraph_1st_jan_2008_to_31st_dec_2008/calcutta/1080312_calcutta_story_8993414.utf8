  - Multi-purpose pilot vessel developed        A STAFF REPORTER                          SUITED TO BENGAL: Ma Ganga, stationed for now at Sagar                                        
	A pilot vessel that escorts foreign ships, checks the water depth, conducts hydrographic surveys and also dredges the river.        
	Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) has come up with such a multipurpose pilot vessel, that is now stationed at Sagar. Ma Ganga, a CPT official said, is the largest pilot vessel developed by any shipyard in India and is ideally suited to Bengal conditions.        
	Of the 12 major ports in India, Calcutta alone is not sea-based. In fact, a ship has to navigate 232km from the Bay of Bengal to reach the port. Hence, the port cannot do without pilot vessels, said B.K. Sahu, the chief public relations officer of Calcutta Port Trust.        
	A pilot vessel carries specially trained pilots who remain stationed in the delta and take charge of foreign ships navigating the tidal river to reach the port.        
	Earlier, Bengal had two pilot vessels that were made in the UK. The indigenous Ma Ganga  centrally air-conditioned with a capacity to ferry 40 persons  is half as expensive as the foreign-made vessels. The acquisition cost was Rs 13.7 crore.        
	Ma Ganga is fitted with state-of-the-art equipment like radar, differential global positioning system and hydrographic echosounders.         
	Primarily a pilot vessel, Ma Ganga can also serve as a multipurpose ship. It is fitted with sophisticated research equipment and also a sewerage treatment plant, which will ensure that discharge from the vessel does not pollute the river, said Captain J.J. Biswas, the CPT deputy director.        
	Ma Ganga, with 14 pilots on board, will remain stationed at Sagar till the monsoon, after which it will be engaged in hydrographic survey and dredging.

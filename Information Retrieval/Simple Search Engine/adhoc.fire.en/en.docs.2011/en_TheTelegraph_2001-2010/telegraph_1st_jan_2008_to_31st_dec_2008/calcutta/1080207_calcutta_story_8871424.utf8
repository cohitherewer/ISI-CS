                                                                                                            Fake law papers: two held
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two men were arrested late on Tuesday on charges of supplying fake Ll.B certificates to lawyers arrested last week.        
	Madhab Mandal, in his mid-40s, was picked up from Canning and Amarendra Nath Bala, 71, from Bongaon. The duo were produced in Bankshal court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody till February 15.        
	We are trying to find out how Mandal and Bala got hold of the fake certificates, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (detective department).        
	Six lawyers were arrested last Friday on charges of securing bar council registrations by producing fake certificates. They are Ashoke Burman, 53, Dilip Acharya, 36, Ananda Das, 27, Partho Das, 25, Somenath Sarkar, 28, and Masood Karim, 36.        
	A preliminary probe has revealed that Mandal had supplied a fake certificate to Karim and Bala to Burman.        
	We are looking for those who had supplied fake certificates to the other four, said an officer of the detective department. We stumbled upon the racket after the arrest of a Rajarhat resident, Kalyan Bhattacharya, who had supplied a fake certificate to a student from Bangur.

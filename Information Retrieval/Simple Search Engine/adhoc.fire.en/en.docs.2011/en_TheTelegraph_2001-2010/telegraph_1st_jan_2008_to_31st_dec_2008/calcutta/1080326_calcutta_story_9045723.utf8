The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Board plea to CU on entry rules
                                                                                                               Board plea to CU on entry rules
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations will urge Calcutta University (CU) to allow students who have cleared Class XII with environmental science as a main subject to study honours courses.        
	The council will also approach the University Grants Commission (UGC) to find out whether CU can enforce such a ban, said a senior official.        
	Environmental science was recognised as a compulsory paper in ISC on a Supreme Court directive. There were similar instructions from the UGC. CU should not bar students from studying honours in this way, said Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive of the council.        
	According to the new CU admission rules, students who clear the board exams with environmental science as one of the four compulsory subjects can only seek admission in general courses.

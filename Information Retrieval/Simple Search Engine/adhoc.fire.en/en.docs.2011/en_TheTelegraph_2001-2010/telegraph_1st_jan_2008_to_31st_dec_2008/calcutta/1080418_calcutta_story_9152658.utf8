                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Burglars round it off with beer 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A gang cleaned out a flat in Salt Lakes FD block while the residents were away on Thursday afternoon.         
	Before leaving, the robbers probably sat for a round of drinks, as the floor of the living room was found littered with several empty beer cans.        
	Cash and valuables worth more than Rs 2 lakh were robbed from Dibyendu Roys third-floor apartment. Police have no clue how many robbers had come, as no one in the neighbourhood had seen the gang entering or leaving the apartment.        
	A preliminary probe suggests that the gang broke open an eight-lever lock on the grille gate and sawed the one on the main door before entering the flat.        
	They were inside for three hours, picking up whatever valuables they could lay their hands on. Among the items missing are a handycam, a digital camera, jewellery, silver vases and Rs 20,000 in cash, including a few dollars, said an investigating officer.        
	It seems the gang members knew where the valuables were kept, said sub-divisional police officer Subhankar Bhattacharya.        
	Roy, an executive with a retail group, and his wife left the apartment at 10.30am to visit their new home in Rajarhat. Their son was in school.        
	I dropped my wife back around 2pm and left for Kankurgachhi. She called me after 15 minutes and said our flat had been burgled, recounted Roy.        
	The sleuths interrogated the domestic help, who was hired a year ago. The help comes in the evening.

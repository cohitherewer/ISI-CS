                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HS council backs model
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sampurna Lahiri                                  
	A school cannot deny admission to a deserving candidate because she or he is into modelling, state Higher Secondary education council secretary Debasish Sarkar said on Monday.        
	He was reacting to a verbal complaint from Niladri Lahiri, whose daughter Sampurna was denied admission to Class XI of Multipurpose Government Girls School for her interest in modelling.         
	Sampurna, who passed Madhyamik in the first division from the same school, was among the top 10 in this years Sananda Tillotama beauty pageant. Metro had on Monday reported the discrimination the girl had to face for taking part in the pageant.         
	The girls father had called me and narrated her plight. There is no way a school can deny admission to a deserving candidate. I have asked her father to file a written complaint, Sarkar said.         
	Once the complaint is filed, we will conduct a probe and speak to the school authorities.        
	Lahiri explained to Sarkar that his daughter was being denied admission even after scoring around 68 per cent in Madhyamik. He (Sarkar) sympathised with my daughter and asked me to meet him personally with a formal complaint, Lahiri said.         
	But Jayanti Roy, the principal of the Judges Court Road school, stuck to her stand. Modelling was hampering her studies. I cannot allow this in school. Had it been a college, I would not have objected, said Roy.         
	Krishna Damani of South Point School refused to agree with Roy. We try to encourage students interested in, say, modelling or acting. He, however, stressed that the school was strict about attendance and academic performance of all students.         
	Roys logic that Sampurnas interest in modelling would spoil the institutions homely environment was also contested.         
	We are proud of our students who have made it big as models or actors. We have always extended full support to them, said Heena Gorsia, the honorary general secretary of the Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College.         
	I went to Loreto College and Ballygunge Science College and have never faced any problems there, said Jessica Gomes, a leading city model.

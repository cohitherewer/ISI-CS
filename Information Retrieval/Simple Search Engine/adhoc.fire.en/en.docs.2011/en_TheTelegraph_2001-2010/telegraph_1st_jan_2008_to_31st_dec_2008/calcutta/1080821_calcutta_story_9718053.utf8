                      Colours of emotion                    Articulating their thoughts through various mediums, moods and subjects, five artists have come together in Shades, the ongoing art exhibition, in an attempt to portray the diverse bundle of emotions aroused by the objective reality they see around them. For them, intensity of expression is a more important end than a search for aesthetic harmony and form. Featuring 40 art works including dokra scuptures, the show provides a colourful bouquet to stimulate and satisfy the spirit. A student of visual arts, historical research and conservation, Chandranath Das (a painting by him appears here) is inspired by his love for Himalayan art and way of life. Also influenced by impressionism, the contrasting patches of colour on his canvases are a reflection of his state of mind. Jayanta Kumar Pals collages are abstract expressions of the trials and tribulations of modern life. Jaspal Singh explores psychological relationships through his works. While Pulak Mukhopadhyay uncovers the agony behind the obvious charm of everyday scenes of life, romanticism is the keynote of the works of Ashoke Roy.

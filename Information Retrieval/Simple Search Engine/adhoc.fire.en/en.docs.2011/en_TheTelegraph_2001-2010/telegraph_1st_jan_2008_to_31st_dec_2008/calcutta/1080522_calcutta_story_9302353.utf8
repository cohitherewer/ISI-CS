	A Burrabazar landlords 30-year-old son, allegedly abducted from Howrah station on Tuesday evening, was found in a godown on Strand Road on Wednesday.        
	Vivek Pandey and Sonu Jhan, who were guarding Vivek Sharma in the godown, next to North Port police station, were arrested.        
	Vivek, whose father Ghanshyamdas owns a property in Burrabazar, works in a tarpaulin shop. He said he was stopped by the two men at Howrah station on his way home in Uttarpara.        
	Suresh Sharma was accompanying Vivek. The two asked Suresh to inform Ghanshyamdas that his son would not return home at night, said N.D. Paul, the officer-in-charge of Burrabazar police station.        
	Vivek told the police that the duo took him to Uttarpara on a local train but could not explain why he did not raise a hue and cry. He claimed that he was later shifted to the godown in a car and beaten up by the two.        
	In a complaint lodged with Burrabazar police station, Ghanshyamdas said that an abductor called his cellphone to demand a ransom of Rs 50,000 for his sons release and asked him to meet them at a spot on Strand Road on Wednesday. The lead helped the police to track down Vivek.        
	A preliminary investigation revealed that Pandey and Jhan were aware that Viveks elder brother Ranjit had fallen out with Ghanshyamdas over a property dispute.         
	There are a number of unanswered questions. Its not clear why the abductors took Vivek to Uttarpara on a crowded suburban train. The ransom demanded is also low and arouses suspicion, said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Vineet Goyal.

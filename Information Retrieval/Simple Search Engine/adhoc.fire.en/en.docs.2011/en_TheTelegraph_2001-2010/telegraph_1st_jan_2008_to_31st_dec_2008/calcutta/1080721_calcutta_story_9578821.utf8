The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Pay cops and park cars illegally 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pay cops and park cars illegally 
          
	Civic rules prohibit parking in front of schools and places of worship. But the rule is flouted with impunity in the citys central business district, thanks to the collusion of cooperatives manning parking lots, police and local goons. Metro visits a few spots on this busy stretch.                                    (From top) Illegal parking around Portuguese Church, Headquarters traffic guard and Saifee Masjid      
	 Where: Portuguese Church        
	 What we saw: The church on Portuguese Church Street is surrounded by parked cars, taxis and cycle vans, which perpetually block both entrances to the shrine compound. Those who visit the church have no option but park their cars far away.         
	When approached by Metro, one of the linemen in charge of parking admitted that the practice was illegal. The place is not being declared a parking zone because of the church. But vehicles are allowed to be parked here against a monthly payment to the sergeants of the local traffic guard, said the lineman.        
	 CMC version: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation does not give permission for parking in front of schools, hospitals and places of worship. If vehicles are being parked illegally, police should take action and remove them, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the mayoral council member, parking.        
	 Church version: We have lodged many complaints with the civic authorities and the local police station, but parking still continues. Local goons, helped by the sergeants of the Headquarters traffic guard, are responsible for this. The devotees face problems, as they have to park their cars far away from the church, said an official who did not want to be named.               
	 Where: Saifee Masjid and Jain Vidyalaya        
	 What we saw: The entrances to the mosque and the school, on either side of Brabourne Road, are blocked by parked vehicles  two-wheelers, cars, cycle vans and small goods  that eat up half of each plank.         
	 Civic version: Police should remove the vehicles, said Khan.        
	 School version: A mishap may occur any time as vehicles rush down the road. Several applications have been sent to the traffic department but the situation has not improved, said a senior teacher of the school.        
	 Where: Headquarters Traffic Guard at 32A Brabourne Road        
	 What we saw: Not more than 25 vehicles are allowed to be parked on the stretch in a single line. But vehicles, many more than the stipulated number, are parked here in two or three lines, while the custodians of the law look the other way.         
	We have to buy the cops silence. If we default on the monthly payment, they impound the cars, said a member of the Pioneer Co-operative Parking, which looks after the stretch.        
	 Official version: The sergeants of the traffic guard refused to speak.        
	 Localspeak: Who should we turn to? Both the police and the CMC make money from this illegal practice, said a local shopkeeper.

  - Private schools shine but   HS show still better        A STAFF REPORTER                                                   
	A city that had not produced a single state Madhyamik topper in 13 years was on Wednesday saying three cheers for as many students in the top 10.        
	Niranjan Das from Akra Shaktigarh Rabindra Vidyapith, near Budge Budge, scored just a mark less than Ronita Janas 798 out of 800 and Sanjukta Ghoshal, a student of Vidya Bharati School in New Alipore, aggregated 795 to be ranked among the 10 best performers in Madhyamik 2008.        
	The citys overall performance was better than the state pass percentage, which dipped by 2 points from last year.         
	There has been a significant increase in the number of high performers in Calcutta, especially those with more than 700 marks, school education minister Partha Dey said.        
	The citys pass percentage increased from 74.32 last year to 77.09. Private schools did better in the Higher Secondary examinations, the results of which were declared last week, but showed improvement in Madhyamik, too.        
	The trend of Madhyamik results has changed. The overall performance of many city schools has improved, Ashok Maiti, the general secretary of the West Bengal Headmasters Association, said.        
	The improved performance was nowhere more visible than in the number of students who scored a Perfect 100 in the subject that is fashionably dreaded: math.        
	As many as 835 students scored 100 in the math paper, compared to only 343 last year.        
	South Point, which had the maximum number of candidates, put up a good show. Of the 773 students who took the test, 768 secured first-division marks and 120 of them more than 90 per cent.         
	Our results are much better than last years, and the girls of our school have outdone the boys this time, principal Joyoti Solomon said.        
	Patha Bhavans success rate was just as good, with only four of the 137 candidates not getting first-division marks. Nava Nalanda High School had 443 candidates, of whom 416 earned first-division marks.        
	The improvement in the performance of government institutions like Hindu School, Hare School and Bethune Collegiate School has been attributed to better infrastructure and induction of high-calibre teachers.

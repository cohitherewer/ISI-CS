          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Passing exams can be tougher for students studying from classes V to VIII in ICSE schools.        
	The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) has given the liberty to its affiliated schools to fix the pass marks on their own in the internal tests for these classes.        
	The school authorities can now fix the pass marks in the internal and promotional tests from classes V to VIII, said Gerry Arathoon, the CISCE additional secretary and officiating chief executive.        
	Hence, the pass marks can be as high as 50 per cent if the schools feel they could maintain their desired standard that way. But under no circumstances, the council has clarified, can the cut-off percentage be too low.        
	The official has also asserted that all its affiliated schools will have to adhere to its guidelines on the pass criteria for students from classes IX to XII. According to the rules, the pass marks in each subject should be 35 per cent for classes IX and X, and 40 per cent for classes XI and XII.        
	The relaxation till class VIII will help the schools maintain a high academic standard, said the principal of a south Calcutta institution who did not want to be named. But the council should also consider a similar measure for students from classes IX to XII.        
	The head of a central Calcutta school objected to the councils rule to fix the pass marks at 35 for classes IX and X, and 40 per cent for classes XI and XII.         
	The council rules say that schools should allow every student to take the board exam once he/she is promoted to class X or XII. So, we need to be strict while assessing the students in IX and XI, he said.

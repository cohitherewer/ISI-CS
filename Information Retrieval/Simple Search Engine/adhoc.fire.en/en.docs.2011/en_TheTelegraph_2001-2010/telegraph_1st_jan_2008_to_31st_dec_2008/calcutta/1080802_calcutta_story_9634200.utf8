          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	An 84-year-old widow moved the high court on Friday alleging that despite complaints, Baguiati police had not taken action against her two sons and their wives, who are trying to throw her out of the house built by her husband. Laxmi Rani Ghosh also claimed that her sons were torturing her and her daughter.         
	Justice Nadira Patheriya passed an interim order directing Baguiati police to take all possible steps to maintain normality and peace at Laxmi Ranis house at Deshbandhunagar.        
	In her petition, Laxmi Rani said she and her daughter Meera Ghosh have been living in a portion of the three-storeyed building constructed by her late husband Santosh Ghosh, while her sons Shyamal and Pradip and their family members have been occupying the larger part of the house.        
	Since early last year, my sons are trying to occupy the part in which I am living. They are attempting to throw me and my daughter out of the house by torturing us mentally and physically. We went to police in January but did not get justice from them. Please ask the police to take steps so that we can live peacefully, said Laxmi Rani.

	Calcutta University (CU) students have organised a three-day career fair to open up placement opportunities.
    
	The fair started on Monday on the College Street campus. More than 400 students from the seven CU campuses are taking part in it. The fair is also open to students of colleges affiliated to the university.
    
	The first day of the fair saw 15 students being placed.
    
	The departments of the university take initiatives to place their students but there had never been a concerted effort to create a platform for all students to seek placements, said Payal Dutta Chowdhury, a second-year masters student in linguistics.
    
	Companies like HSBC, IBM Daksh, Wipro, Aviva Life Insurance, Ma Foi and Prosper Overseas are offering placements to MA final-year students at the fair.
    
	IBM Daksh is hiring for its voice process units, while HSBC has on offer positions in security and banking. 
    
	The initial screening is being done at the stalls. The selected candidates are being sent to the central library hall for a written test, said Somnath Chatterjee, an M.Com second-year student. 
    
	Professional training institutes are also taking part in the fair. NIIT and the Institute of Finance Banking and Insurance (IFBI) have been enrolling students for courses on the spot.
    
	This kind of an event is a great opportunity for us to attract students. More than 200 students visited our stall with queries on the first day, said Subhradeep Nandi, an academic executive for the IFBI. 
    
	The institute is enrolling students by promising guaranteed job offers from ICICI and HDFC with starting salary between Rs 2.57 lakh per annum and Rs 3.04 lakh per annum.
    
	The results have been very encouraging. We are planning to make the fair an annual affair, added Chatterjee.

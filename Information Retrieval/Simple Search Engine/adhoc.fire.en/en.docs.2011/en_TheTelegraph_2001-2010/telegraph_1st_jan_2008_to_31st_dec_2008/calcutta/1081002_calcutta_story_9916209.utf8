  - HS council told to pay damages for addition error          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                  
	The marks in the physiology paper of a Higher Secondary (HS) student was raised from 49 to 54 during scrutiny but the examination authorities told him he was still stuck on 49.        
	Justice Soumitra Pal of the high court detected the goof-up after going through Rajarshee Dass answer script on Wednesday and ordered the council to pay a fine of Rs 2,000 to the student within a month.        
	The council is also directed to conduct an inquiry and identify the employee who had committed the mistake. The fine amount will have to be realised from his/her salary, the judge ruled.        
	Rajarshee, a resident of Chinsurah, passed HS 2008 in second division from Hooghly Multipurpose School. His score in physiology was 49.        
	Unhappy with the marks, Rajarshee had applied for a post-publication scrutiny in the first week of July. After a month, the council informed him that his marks in physiology remained unchanged.        
	Rajarshee then moved the high court, praying for an order asking the council to produce the physiology answer script. My client is confident that the council gave him wrong information about the scrutiny marks, Rajarshees lawyer Kaushik Chanda had submitted.        
	Justice Pal granted Rajarshees plea but asked him to deposit Rs 500, which was to be forfeited if his claim was found to be false.        
	After council lawyer Ranajit Chatterjee produced the script on Wednesday, the judge added the marks and found that Rajarshee had scored 54. He then handed over the script to Chatterjee and asked him to add the marks. The lawyer counted twice before admitting: There is a mistake. The student should get 54.         
	Justice Pal then fined the council and also ordered that the student be refunded the Rs 500 he had deposited.

Bhonsraghat
                                            
	A stones throw from Kharagpur, on the lap of the Subarnarekha, lies Bhonsraghat, a retreat of quiet beauty. It is ideal for a day-trip or a picnic. The drive itself is half the fun.         
	After spending a night in the well-equipped IIT Kharagpur guesthouse, we drove towards the river early next morning. The picturesque road lay straight as an arrow for about 35 kilometres.        
	It was spring and Mother Nature was making her presence felt. We were soon greeted by the foliage of the Hijli forest. Once, it covered a huge area around the famous Hijli jail. Many freedom fighters took shelter in the forest to escape the British authorities.        
	Now, only a fraction of the forest exists. But the beauty is still apparent. Fresh leaves on sal, Sonajhuri and eucalyptus trees shone in the sunshine. It was a feast for the eyes.        
	After some time, we came across a settlement called Salwa, where we had tea and singara.        
	The best aspect of the journey was the surprises waiting for us at every turn. We just didnt know what to expect. All of a sudden, the jungle opened into a breathtaking khoai, which is the local name for a barren moor land where soil erosion, mainly caused by rain, has created amazing patterns on the ground. The grandeur of the landscape kept us transfixed.        
	Greenery and fire-coloured simul and palash enveloped the road for the rest of the trip. The tranquility was often broken by the melodious call of koyels.        
	Crossing the Keleghai river, we reached a largish settlement called Khesiari. It houses an old Sarbamangala temple. The deity bears a resemblance to the Jagannath idol of Puri. The architecture of the temple also has Oriya influences.        
	At Bhonsraghat, we were immediately struck by the wonderful wide-angle view of the Subarnarekha. It was nearly summer, so there was very little water in the river. Thin blue streams trickled through silvery sand to merge with the arc of the horizon.         
	Four ramshackle wooden bridges that are usually submerged by the river during monsoon connect the banks.        
	Emboldened by the sight of buses plying on the dry riverbed, we drove our car close to the water. The view was spectacular. In the distance, a fleet of country boats floated down. Fishermen cast their nets, while another group gathered pebbles for reasons we could not fathom. A thick green cover of Sonajhuri and eucalyptus bordered the banks.        
	The slowly flowing water was cool and transparent, allowing refreshing midday dips.        
	After a pleasant picnic, we set off for home as the setting sun turned the fine white sand golden.   
	Going   
	Kharagpur is about 135 km from Calcutta. It is easily accessible by road or rail. Bhonsraghat is about 40 km from Kharagpur. Driving is the best option. Buses also ply from Kharagpur to Bhonsraghat   
	Staying  
	There are several hotels in Kharagpur. The best option is the Technology Guest House on the IIT campus. Enquiries can be made at the IIT extension office in HC Block, Sector III, Salt Lake, Calcutta 106.

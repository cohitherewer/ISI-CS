The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | City moons over mission
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             City moons over mission
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Chandrayaan-1 at the launch pad in Sriharikota (PTI)                                  
	Astronomers and stargazers in the city are eagerly awaiting the successful launch of Chandrayaan-1, Indias maiden moon mission. The unmanned spacecraft will lift off from Sriharikota on Wednesday.         
	Debiprosad Duari, the director (research and academics) of MP Birla Planetarium, said: I am receiving more than 20 calls a day. People want to know what is unique about this mission, as there have been several lunar missions since the first one in 1959, about its implications on Indias space achievement and if it will make our country a leading contender in the space race.        
	Soumen Mukherjee of Skywatchers Association, a city-based group of amateur astronomers, feels the mission will boost the younger generations interest in stargazing.         
	For 24-year-old Snehasish Mukherjee, the launch technology is of greater interest. I hope the PSLV rocket  the spacecrafts launch vehicle  lives up to its reputation of successful lift-offs, he said.         
	Science organisations in the city have decided to provide more information on Chandrayaan-1. Birla Planetarium will dwell on the mission during its shows on the solar system, while the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum plans to organise a series of lectures if the lift-off is successful.

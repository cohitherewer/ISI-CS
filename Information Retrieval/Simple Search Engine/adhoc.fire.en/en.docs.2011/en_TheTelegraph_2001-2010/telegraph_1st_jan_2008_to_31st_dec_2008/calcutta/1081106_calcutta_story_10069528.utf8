          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A dozen students of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) were injured after two groups of students clashed, prompting the authorities to call in police and clamp a night curfew on the Shibpur campus.        
	Kapildeb Karmakar, Abhishek Dey and Ankur Mondal were admitted to SSKM Hospital following student trouble on Tuesday night and Wednesday evening.        
	Registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay said: The police will remain on campus for the next three days. Curfew will be imposed after 10.30pm. The police can take direct action against hostel boarders flouting the order. Besu will not be responsible for that.

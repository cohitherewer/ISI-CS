                                                                                                                 We Ask You Answer      Wanted: an exam-free winter
          Todays question: Would you prefer a return to the January-December schedule in schools? More letters will be published next week

	It is better to return to the January-December schedule in schools because in winter children fall sick much less than in the scorching heat of March and April.They will be able to perform better.               
	

Shiv Shanker Almal, 
  Rawdon Street         
	During the 50s when we were in school the session was from January to December. I fail to understand why it was changed.               
	

Priyanka Dutta, 
  Nagerbazar        
	No. I would not prefer a return to the January-December schedule in schools. The change in routine will make it difficult for students to adapt to the new curriculum. Examination and study pattern will be disrupted for sometime before they settle down again.

	Changing of the academic session from April-March to January-December may not make much of a difference to schools located in the plains but it will definitely tell upon the number of academic days required for schools located in the hills and for missionary schools which have long Christmas vacations. The NCERT fails to provide text books even in April when the existing session starts in CBSE-affiliated schools. The students of CBSE-affiliated schools abroad will be the worst sufferers if the session is changed from April to January. Leading private book publishers will also face problems in supplying books to students of the schools affiliated to CBSE/CISCE if the existing session is changed.

	The January-December session in schools is preferable as the annual exams in this scheme generally falls in November or the first week of December when the weather is pleasant. But owing to this change of session, students should not lose precious study time before any of the competitive examinations begin. Before the shift in the education session the Board should consider all the pros and cons of the schedule, otherwise students will suffer for no fault of theirs.               
	

PRATIKA GUPTA, 
  Phoolbagan        
	No. Students will suffer the same mental pressure over exams. They will not be able to enjoy the Pujas in October-November. Second, sports days are generally held in winter, but if the exams are also held in winter the students will not be able to participate in such events. Third, a child is prepared to take his or her exams in March, so a change will also disturb their mental set-up.               
	

INDRANIL SANYAL, 
  Dhakuria         
	No, the present schedule suits students best. Schools in other parts of India follow the April-March schedule. Therefore, changing the pattern will not keep the students updated with other educational boards. Besides, the Class X and Class XII finals are also conducted in February and March. The old schedule will not match with it and a student will lose at least three to four months during admission to a new class.               
	

Suman Kanti Das, 
  Santoshpur        
	I prefer the January to December session because when we take our annual exams in May or June the heat is unbearable and sometimes it rains as well. On the other hand, if the session starts at the beginning of the year the exam will happen in winter, which is a pleasant season in Bengal.               
	

Prantik Sanyal, 
  SP Mukherjee Road        
	The session from January to December is not at all unwelcome.               
	

ANUSHRI MONDAL, 
  Gol park        
	I think the primary advantage of the January-December session is that the final exams can be held in winter. This will be followed by a short vacation prior to the results when the students will have the scope to travel and recharge their batteries. On the contrary, the present academic session forces them to sit with books in the winter months in preparation of the forthcoming exams.               
	

Tuhina Ray, 
  Sinthee         
	 Yes. In this schedule, no time is wasted while in the present system the students sit idle at home for at least two months (March and April). In rural areas, many farming families can afford to pay school fees and purchase new books as it is the harvesting season in Bengal. Booksellers and publishers will also be happy with the new schedule for they dont have to run in the scorching sun to canvas their books from school to school.               
	

Sukumar Ghosh, 
  Mukundapur         
	Yes, I prefer a return to the January-December schedule in schools. When I was a schoolboy and even in college, we enjoyed the January-December session. The comfortable climate in this period helps students study better. They also suffer less from diseases then.

  Bandpur         
	Students of our state had earlier faced the brunt of the whims of the education department. The state government had changed the school session and banished English. Now English has been brought back. If the earlier schedule is resurrected the whole process will change. Students will ultimately suffer. The fickle-minded authorities should find ways of imparting quality education first.

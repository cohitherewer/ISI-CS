	Three children were allegedly beaten up by Munna Varma, the principal of Irish Educational Academy, an English-medium nursery school at 84 Charu Chandra Lane, Howrah, on Thursday.        
	Two of the trio, all residents of Rajballabh Saha Lane, suffered injuries. Sudipta Senapati, 12, and Anuj Rajak, 4, were given first-aid at Howrah District Hospital. Local residents demonstrated in front of the school, demanding punishment for Varma.         
	Police said the children were chatting on the road opposite the nursery around 11am when some local boys threw stones at the school and fled.         
	Varma rushed out and dragged the three inside. He locked us in a classroom and started beating us. He slapped us and pushed Anuj on the floor. Anuj hurt his chin. Aakash was beaten with a stick, said Sudipta, a student of BK Pal Institution, Shibpur.        
	Sudiptas friend Rakesh informed his mother Barnali, who rescued the children. She said: I heard them crying in a classroom whose door was locked and windows shut. I pushed open a window and asked Varma why he was beating the children. He then opened the door and let the boys go.        
	Sensing trouble, Varma locked the school and fled. His father, Hareram, said: My son is not capable of doing such a thing. There is a conspiracy to shut down this school.        
	Sudiptas father has lodged a complaint with Howrah police. A Howrah police station officer said: We are looking for Varma. He is absconding.

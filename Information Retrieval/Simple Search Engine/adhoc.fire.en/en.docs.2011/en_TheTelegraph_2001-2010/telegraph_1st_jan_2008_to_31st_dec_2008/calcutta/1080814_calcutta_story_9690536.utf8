                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fatal turn to fight over ball 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Swapan Kumar Deys son Soumalya                                  
	A 65-year-old cardiac patient died on Wednesday morning after a heated exchange and a scuffle with his next-door neighbour over a cricket ball.         
	As news of the death spread, about 300 residents of Cossipore gathered around the house of 62-year-old Kalipada Halder, who had allegedly abused, pushed and spat at Swapan Kumar Dey, a retired businessman. Police rescued Kalipada and his wife Rani, 55, from their JK Mitra Road home and arrested them. They denied the allegations.        
	On Tuesday evening, Swapans 19-year-old son Soumalya, a BBA student, was playing with his friend Soumya Mitra when the ball landed in the Halders garage. When the boys knocked on the door to retrieve the ball, Rani abused them and asked them to come back the next morning.         
	Swapans 24-year-old daughter Sanghamitra said Rani later came over to their house to complain against Soumalya for playing cricket on the road and used foul language once again.         
	Around 10am on Wednesday, Soumalya asked the Halders for the ball once more. The couple started abusing us once again. Hearing the shouting, Soumalyas father, who was having tea at home, came over. The Halders abused him too and pushed him to the ground, said Soumya.         
	Sanghamitra, who was leaving for office, said Swapan started shivering and could not speak. Soumalya and some neighbours accompanied him home.        
	When his condition began to deteriorate, we rushed him to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. He was declared brought dead, said neighbour Jayanta Ghosh.         
	The body was handed over to the family in the evening after a post-mortem         
	Residents described the Halders as trouble-mongers and said they knew Swapan had suffered a heart attack four years ago but still abused and pushed him.         
	There was no car in the garage. The Halders dont even own a car. There was no reason for them to get so worked up about the ball entering the garage, said Soumya, a first-year B.Com student.         
	Kalipada Halder and his wife Rani have been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. They will be produced in court tomorrow, said a senior officer of Chitpur police station.         
	The Halders denied all the charges. Some of our neighbours cannot stand us and are taking this opportunity to malign us, said Kalipada.

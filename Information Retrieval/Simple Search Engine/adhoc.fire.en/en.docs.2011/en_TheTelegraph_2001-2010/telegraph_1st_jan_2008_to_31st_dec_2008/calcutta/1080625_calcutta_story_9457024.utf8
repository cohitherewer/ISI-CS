           Campus crusaders: Students remove a display board nailed to a tree trunk                             
	Apropos the report Blaze in Chandni Market, May 28, the basic level of surveillance needed by various agencies to prevent fires in markets is absent in West Bengal.           
	It is difficult to understand why the electric supply, civic and the police authorities do not check fire prevention measures and power supply system of an establishment before granting it trade licence.           
	Periodic checks by the authorities remain too much to ask for. Had there been such a system, the establishments that violate fire safety rules could have been prosecuted and their trade licences cancelled. This would have brought down the number of fires.           
	Years of inaction by the authorities have emboldened the shop owners who flout rules with impunity. A comprehensive survey should be undertaken by the government to identify the shop owners who violate the fire norms. If they do not adopt the necessary measures within a reasonable period of time, they should be punished stringently.           
	Nishith Mitra, 
  Mahinagore                       
	Apropos the report Painting the city green, May 29, it is nice to see that school girls are playing an active role in preserving the environment of the city.             
	The time is right to start rainwater harvesting in schools. Plastic bags should also be banned on campuses. Motorists should be punished for honking unnecessarily outside school compounds.           
	B.N. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park                   
	Apropos the report Money early but morgue delayed, May 23, it is disheartening that a forensic examination morgue has not been set up at SSKM Hospital despite sanction of Rs 1 crore for the purpose. The health minister should look into the matter.             
	Sukumar Ghosh, 
  Mukundapur                   
	Apropos the report Five injured in VIP Road mishap, May 24, as a motorist I have observed that pedestrians, cyclists and rickshaw pullers in Calcutta have no regard for motor vehicles. Neither are they aware of the dangers that they expose themselves to by callous movement on the road. Since my childhood, I have noticed that Calcuttans derive pleasure in standing or walking in the path of vehicles. Such attitudes combined with an indifferent administration have led to chaos on the road.             
	Media reports also tend to blame the motorists for road mishaps though in many cases the person who has been run over is equally to blame.           
	Soumitra Das Gupta, 
  Address not given           
	Steps by the transport department and police have failed to curb the number of mishaps on city roads. Bus drivers are responsible for the maximum number of accidents. Reckless driving and overtaking must be stopped at any cost.           
	Sourish Misra, 
  Salt Lake                   
	The article The habit of human touch, May 25, raised several interesting points. The author is right about many aspects of the American way of life  the emphasis on privacy, rules and codes of conduct and the paucity of interaction. The author makes an exception for students living in American university towns but as one such student, I think more or less the same rules hold.             
	There is indeed less social interaction between people in the US, but whenever I have faced a situation that I didnt quite know how to handle, it is the privacy-loving and ostensibly detached Americans who have come to my aid. Be it unclogging a shower drain at midnight or an emergency shopping trip when I didnt have a car, it is the Americans who magnanimously extended a helping hand. This is not to say that fellow Indians havent been helpful  they have. Its just that while being available for help, Americans do like to keep to themselves. It allows everyone to do what they want without worrying about unwelcome social scrutiny and unnecessary criticism  something sorely missing in India.           
	Priyanka Aich, 
  Washington, US                   
	The report Battle over litchi litter goes to court, May 17, states that litchis come to the city from Baruipur, Chandernagore, Barasat, Kaliachak and Bihar. However, when I asked a fruit vendor on May 16 where his stock of litchi came from, he said the early-season consignment came from Arjunpur, near Farakka, in Murshidabad.             
	Tapan Pal,
  Batanagar             
	Apropos the report Untreated girl critical, May 14, it is sad that doctors of AMRI Hospital resumed treatment of an 11-year old girl after her father complained against the hospital authorities. Had police not intervened, the girl would have had to languish without treatment. Such undesirable events have become common nowadays because hospitals and nursing homes give more importance to money than service. The Indian Medical Association should intervene in such cases.

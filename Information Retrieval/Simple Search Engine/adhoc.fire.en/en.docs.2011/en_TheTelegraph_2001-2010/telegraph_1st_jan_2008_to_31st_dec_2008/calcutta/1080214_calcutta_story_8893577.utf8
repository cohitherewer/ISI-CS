The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU panels minus state nominees
                                                                                                               CU panels minus state nominees
  - Varsity confusion, school breakthrough        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	The new senate and syndicate of Calcutta University (CU)  formed four months ago  have been functioning without government representatives, contrary to rules.        
	We have sent a number of reminders to the state higher education department, asking for the list of nominees for the senate and syndicate, the two highest decision-making bodies of the university. There is no reply yet, said CU registrar Samir Bandyopadhyay.        
	The government is required to send nine nominees to the senate and one (usually the education secretary or any other official not below the rank of deputy secretary) to the syndicate.        
	Ashoke Mohan Chakraborty, the additional chief secretary in charge of higher education, said a list of nominees for both bodies is ready, but he has no clue why it has not reached the university. I will find out the reason for the delay, he said.        
	Elections to the senate and the syndicate  the terms of both bodies expire after every four years  were held in September. According to Calcutta University Act, the list of government nominees should reach the institution within a fortnight of the completion of the election process.        
	Since the state is CUs main funding agency, the involvement of its nominees in the universitys decision-making process is mandatory, said a senate member.        
	Sources said the university is yet to get the names of the two nominees of the chancellor for the syndicate, though it has received the names of the five nominees for the syndicate.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hunt for faceless duo in mail case 
  - Kaushik Basus domestic help takes police around Salt Lake but fails to spot suspects        A STAFF REPORTER                                                   
	Sabitri Dandapat, the domestic help arrested in the bomb hoax case, was taken around Salt Lake on Thursday to spot the two neighbourhood youths she claims were in her employers cyber caf when the terror mail was sent.        
	When neither could be found, the detective department drew up identikits based on the descriptions given by her.        
	The computer-literate domestic help of Kaushik Basu, the main accused in the case, first guided the police team to Purbachal and then IA market and some other areas in the vicinity. She said the youths were known to frequent these places and often visited Basus cyber caf to surf the Internet.        
	Although Kaushik is the one the police arrested first, they suspect Sabitri too played a role in the bomb hoax that triggered panic in the city on Tuesday. Both have denied it and said the email was possibly sent by one of those who visited the cyber caf in house number 50 of IA Block that afternoon.        
	We are trying to identify these youths to match their statements with that of Sabitri and Kaushik. Both have told us that they had nothing to do with the terror mail and blamed it on visitors to the cyber caf, an official of the detective department said.        
	Sabitri has been remanded in police custody till August 13.        
	After producing Sabitri in court, the police went to the Salt Lake residence of the Basus and video-recorded the house and the interiors of the cyber caf on the ground floor.         
	We have got some critical information and are assessing them, an official said.        
	As the police team scanned the house, members of Kaushiks family stood in silence. Neighbours described the accused as an introvert who looked incapable of writing the terror mail.        
	I have never seen Kaushik even chat with people. I have no idea what he does in front of a computer, but it seems difficult to believe he sent such a mail to the media, said Mousumi Dutta, a resident of IA block.        
	Almost everyone in the locality was aware that although Kaushik owned the cyber caf, it was Sabitri who ran the show.        
	A divorcee with a 15-year-old son, Sabitri did not study beyond Class VIII. But her computer skills surprised investigators. One of them said she could type fast and would chat regularly with her contacts on Orkut under the aliases Rani Love u love and Rani Love.        
	The police are checking her email IDs and cellphone call records. The hard disks of the computers in the cyber caf, especially the one from which the mail was sent, are being examined, too.

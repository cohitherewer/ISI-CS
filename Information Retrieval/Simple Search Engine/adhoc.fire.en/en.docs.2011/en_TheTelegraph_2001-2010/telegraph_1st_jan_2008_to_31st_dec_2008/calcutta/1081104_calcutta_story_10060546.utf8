The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Once a park, now a garbage dump
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Once a park, now a garbage dump
										      ONTHESPOT - SHRADDHANANDA PARK                         Garbage strewn around the Shraddhananda Park vat. Picture by Amit Datta				                                 
	Sadrul Hussain, a Class IX student of ML Jubilee Institution, skips a heartbeat everytime he crosses the Amherst Street-Surya Sen Street crossing to reach his school. For Sadrul has to do a tightrope walk between the speeding vehicles and the litter spilling over from a large vat.         
	More than 30 years old, the 220-sq m vat stationed in Shraddhananda Park is one of the biggest in town. Though the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) cleans it twice daily, the garbage piles up in no time with shopkeepers from Sealdah, Baithakkhana Bazaar, Amherst Street, MG Road and Surya Sen Street dumping trash through the day.                   
	The stink drives customers away from the nearby shops, allege shopkeepers. The situation becomes unbearable especially when traders of the Manindra Mitra Row wholesale egg market dump rotten eggs into the vat.         
	Kajal Dutta, the secretary of Calcutta Egg Merchants Association, pleads helplessness. Since the crates travel a long distance, a lot of eggs break or crack, which we have to throw away, he says         
	Sometimes, its a case of more-litter-few-trucks that leaves a lot of waste behind, say local people. The payloaders are often unable to reach corners where trash is tucked in. Those pockets are never cleared. At times, there are not enough vans to cart the load out, says Ashok Sarkar of Medicine Corner.         
	ML Jubilee Institution, located on Surya Sen Street, bears the brunt of the stink and squalor. The vat pollutes the surroundings. Our students go out during lunch-break and the food they buy from vendors or shops almost certainly carry germs. We are worried about the health of our students, says headmaster Anwar Ali.

	The Shraddhananda Park vat generates about 35-40 tonnes of waste every day and it is cleaned twice daily. But the local people must become conscious of their duties. Many of them dont even bother to dump the litter into the vat; they fling it outside the vat, alleges Arun Sarkar, the principal chief engineer of the CMCs solid waste management cell.         
	We are considering a project to install portable compactors in the next seven-eight months. This system will help collect the garbage in trays and then stash it in containers, he adds.

	It is true that the waste often reaches the road and when that happens we report to the borough conservancy head, who gets it cleared. I had placed a proposal to cover the vat so that the stench is less but it was rejected in the borough meeting on the pretext that it will encourage criminal activities, says Aparajita Dasgupta, the Congress councillor of ward 49.

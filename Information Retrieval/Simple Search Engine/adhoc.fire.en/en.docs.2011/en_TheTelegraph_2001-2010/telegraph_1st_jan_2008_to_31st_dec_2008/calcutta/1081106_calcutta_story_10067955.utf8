          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	I am to die and I am also taking her with me.        
	A suicide note and a confessional letter penned by Kuntal Ghosh Dastidar has put the seal on the tutor-student romance that led to her murder and his suicide on Saturday.        
	The suicide note was unsigned and addressed to no one in particular, but the letter was signed by the tutor.        
	In both, penned in Bengali, 35-year-old Kuntal admitted to the murder of his student Anushree Pal, 19.        
	Kuntal, an electrical engineer from Jadavpur University who ran a coaching centre at Narkelbagan in Garia, allegedly killed the second-year physics honours student on Saturday evening and then hung himself from the ceiling fan of his bedroom.        
	Kuntal lived alone in a rented house near Garia station  away from his estranged wife Leela  while Anushree lived with her family in Sonarpur.        
	The unsigned letter read: I was behind the cause of your sorrow and suffering. I had gone beyond my limit. So I am freeing you from your suffering.        
	The suicide note stated: My life was becoming hell as she was pressuring me so much. I doubted whether she would be able to survive without me. I am to die and I am also to take her with me. Sorry, mother.        
	Sleuths said Kuntal and Anushree wanted to get married but his marital status stood in their way as the separation proceedings were pending in court.        
	We have had preliminary talks with his wife. We will interrogate her later as she is in no position to talk, said Sunil Kumar Chaudhuri, the additional superintendent of police (industrial), South 24-Parganas. We will talk to the family members of Anushree after a few days, he added.         
	At Basanti Devi College, her friends and teachers remembered Anushree as a quiet but happy girl who of late had started behaving differently.        
	She was a good student and was always eager to learn, said principal Maitreyee Bardhan Roy. But the teachers have told me that she had started missing classes often in the past few months.

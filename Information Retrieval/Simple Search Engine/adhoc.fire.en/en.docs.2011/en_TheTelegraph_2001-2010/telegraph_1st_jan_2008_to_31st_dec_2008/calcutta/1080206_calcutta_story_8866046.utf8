           Up in flames: Nandaram market burns as a police official and a fireman watch helplessly. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                             
	Apropos the report Cool car goes up gift ladder, January 12, I am surprised to learn that many parents, including middle-class couples, are eager to gift the recently launched Nano to their children.           
	Till now, a mobile phone was the most expensive item on the gift list of parents for their children. The stakes will shoot up with the launch of Ratan Tatas small wonder.           
	The manufacturers of the car will no doubt be happy to sell as many units as possible. The transport minister should, however, be more circumspect. Licences should be issued to youngsters only after they undergo proper driving training. Otherwise, road mishaps in the city will go up manifold in the near future.           
	Parents, too, need to exercise caution while gifting cars to their children. They should be counselled to drive responsibly.           
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur                       
	Apropos the report Hellhole in August, horror house in January, January 15, hundreds lost their livelihood in the fire at Nandaram complex. Corruption in the civic body, fire brigade and the police is the reason that the blaze turned so deadly. If this doesnt shake up the authorities enough to make the system transparent, nothing will.             
	Sachindra Nath Mitra,
  Beleghata           
	Apropos the report Desert storm over Pratim, January 15, it is difficult to understand why state fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee refused to meet a delegation of ministers, MPs and MLAs from Rajasthan. The misbehaviour by the minister seems jarring at a time when his department was cutting a sorry figure in putting out a blaze at Nandaram and Kashiram markets. The chief minister should ask his colleague to be more courteous and humble in times of crisis.           
	Prahlad Agarwala, 
  Majdia, Nadia           
	I believe the Nandaram fire was an act of arson. But it would not have assumed such proportions if it was not for negligence on the part of the government and civic body in ensuring that traders adhered to rules. Since the shop-keepers in the market have lost to the tune of Rs 200 crore, the government should help them financially. Otherwise, small traders might not be able to recover financially and turn to crime.           
	Harish Gupta, 
  Salkia                       
	Apropos the report Idols lure runaway boys, January 10, it is sad that most guardians today fail to perform an integral part of their duty towards their wards. Five teenagers who fled home by collecting money from their parents were not sure of the consequence of their action. They ran behind a mirage. It is the responsibility of the parents to guide children along the right path. Grown-ups should ask more questions before handing out money to children. In the case of the five runaway boys, none of the guardians could see through the lame excuse.             
	Parents should try to be friendly with their children and know their friends to pre-empt such incidents.           
	Ratan Kumar Halder,
  Behala                   
	Apropos the report Cop hub a security sieve, January 10, it is intriguing that the murder of a student in a Visva-Bharati hostel is serving as a reminder for the police to be alert about security in vital establishments in the city. Must the doctor always come after the patient is dead?             
	Govinda Bakshi,
  Budge Budge    
	Apropos Sisters fight molester, January 3, the molestation of a 28-year-old Ph.D candidate in Salt Lake by a domestic help must be condemned. The incident raises questions about the safety of women in the city after sunset. While credit must be given to the two women for fighting back, the role of the family that employed the help is discouraging. They not only tried to protect the help but also misbehaved with the sisters. Police, however, did not let the brave sisters down and arrested the molester promptly.             
	Sunil Banerjee, 
  VIP Road                   
	Apropos the letter Cops muscle into library, January 16, the Calcutta police programme at the Bhasa Bhavan auditorium in National Library on December 27 was an awards ceremony for policemen and civilians. No musical or other performance was part of the event. Moreover, no restriction was imposed on the readers, members and the visitors at the library.             
	Since the programme was held indoors, readers being disturbed is out of the question. None of the library users has lodged a complaint.           
	Manab Bandyopadhyay,
  public relations officer, Calcutta police, Lalbazar                               
	Apropos the report Gift of life through amity, February 4, the cross-donor kidney transplant surgeries were carried out on the two couples on January 23 this year.       Letters on reports appearing   in Metro may be sent to:

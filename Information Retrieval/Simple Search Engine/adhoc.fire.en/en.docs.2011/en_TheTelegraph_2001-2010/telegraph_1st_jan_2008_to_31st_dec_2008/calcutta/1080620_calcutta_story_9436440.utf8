          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Joyottam Mallick, a second-year student of microbiology, went missing on Wednesday afternoon after attending his tutorial class in Bagha Jatin. Police said his family had not received any calls till Thursday night.        
	The 20-year-old headed for his classes from his Sitaram Bose Street residence, in Amherst Street police station area, around 2pm, said Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).         
	A preliminary investigation revealed that Mallick, a student of Sammilani College in Bagha Jatin, completed his tuitions around 5.30pm. While leaving, he refused to take the book his teacher had given him, saying he would collect it later, said an officer of Amherst Street police station.        
	He had called his parents but the line got disconnected.        
	According to the officer, Mallicks friends at the tutorial had no clue where he was heading for after class.        
	We tried to track his cellphone but it was switched off since Wednesday afternoon, said the officer.         
	It is yet to be ascertained whether he was abducted or he disappeared on his own. We are not ruling out the possibility of revenge either, said another officer.

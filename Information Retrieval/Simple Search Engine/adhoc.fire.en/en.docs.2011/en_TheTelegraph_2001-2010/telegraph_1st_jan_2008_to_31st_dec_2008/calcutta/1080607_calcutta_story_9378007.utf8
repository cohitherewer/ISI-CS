The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Firm resolve to reach office
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Firm resolve to reach office
                                          
	Buses, taxis and trams did not ply on Friday. Metro Railway was running but there was no way one could reach the nearest station. Yet, a few people made it to work, risking inconvenience.        
	Metro salutes the bravehearts...                
	Name: Amalesh Sarkar        
	Age: 42        
	Occupation: Service (CESC, Ultadanga)        
	How he made it: The Garia resident had no option but to get onto an overflowing garbage van near the Ruby General Hospital rotary on way to work. I left home early as I knew transportation would be a problem. But a 20-minute delay in Garia and another hour and a half at Ruby upset all my plans, said Sarkar.        
	Around 200 people were waiting for transport on the Science City-bound flank of the Bypass at Ruby when the garbage van showed up. Sarkar and a few others rushed to board the van. This is my only chance to reach office, he shouted from the drivers cabin.                
	Name: Bapi Das        
	Age: 42        
	Occupation: Guard at a Salt Lake ATM        
	How he made it: Das left his Dakshindari house (on VIP Road) at 8am and had to wait for transport till around 10am, when an ambulance appeared. The driver, who was ferrying a family from the airport to Ruby General Hospital, agreed to drop Das at his ATM for Rs 100.        
	I had to report for work on Friday. I could not come on Thursday as the situation was worse. The guard on duty on Wednesday did my shift, said Das.                
	Name: Sneha Guhathakurta        
	Age: 30        
	Occupation: BPO professional        
	How she made it: On both bandh days, Sneha walked five km from her Park Side Road home, near Deshapriya Park, to Ruby General Hospital, from where she went to Karunamoyee on her managers motorcycle.        
	It took me an hour to reach Ruby on foot. My shift starts at 5.30pm but I left home around 1.30pm to reach office on time, said Sneha.                
	Name: Vikas Kedia        
	Age: 36        
	Occupation: Business.        
	How he made it: It was an ambulance that came to Kedias rescue when he arrived from Delhi on Friday morning and got stuck at the airport.         
	Not a single cabbie was willing to take me home to Sreebhumi as it is a Trinamul Congress stronghold, said Kedia.                
	Name: Chayan Das        
	Age: 29        
	Occupation: Service, Max Mobility (IT)        
	How he made it: The Santoshpur resident walked to Ajoynagar but could not get any transport and had to return home. His shift stretches from 10am to 6pm.         
	I waited for two hours at Ajoynagar but there were no vehicles. I decided to try again after Mamata Banerjee announced that vehicles would start plying a little sooner. I again walked to Ajoynagar and got a share taxi around 2.30pm, said Chayan.

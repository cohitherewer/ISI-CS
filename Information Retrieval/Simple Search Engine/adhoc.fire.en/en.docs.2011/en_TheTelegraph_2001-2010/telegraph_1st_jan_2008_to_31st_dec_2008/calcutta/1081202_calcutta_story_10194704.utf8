The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Risky ride down expressway
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Risky ride down expressway
                                          
	Motorists who drive down Belgharia Expressway, which links Dum Dum airport to Mumbai Road and Delhi Road via Nivedita Setu, put their lives and limbs at risk. Regulars complain that cobbled stretches of the road become death traps after sundown. Metro runs a check              
	Battered bitumen        
	Parts of the road, including the slope from a bridge in Shaktigar, are badly broken. Cars speeding down the incline are forced to slam the brakes suddenly to keep from plunging into the craters, exposing themselves to the risk of being hit from behind.        
	The airport-bound flank of the road is broken at the mouth of the bridge on Jessore Road. The stretch in Durganagar, too, is unusable, said Sunit Saha, who regularly drives a goods carrier on Belgharia Expressway.        
	There are accidents almost every other day near the Shaktigar bridge, said Amol Krishna Mandal, who lives in a roadside shanty at the foot of the bridge.              
	No lights        
	Long stretches of the road remain dark after sunset. Metro found that even the street lights that were working did not come on till 5.30pm, by when it was dark.        
	During winter, visibility is very poor by the time the lights come on. The authorities need to make a simple adjustment and switch to a new schedule during winter. But no one seems to be bothered, said Amalendu Sarkar, who was riding a motorcycle to Uttarpara from Dum Dum.        
	Others complained of the undulating surface of the expressway. As the road goes up and down at many places, drivers are inconvenienced by the headlights of vehicles coming from the opposite direction, said a commuter who did not want to be named.        
	The stretch near Nivedita Setu, where Belgharia Expressway meets GT Road, was pitch dark. Every time I cross the stretch, I get down from my cycle and walk. But with trucks whizzing past, even walking is dangerous, said Sadhan Kumar Sarkar.              
	Lack of roadsigns        
	There are a few road signs on the stretch. First-timers driving down the stretch have no clue which turn leads where.        
	To add to the woes, if one turn is missed, a motorist has to drive an extra 10 km and pay a toll tax of Rs 26 to get back to the spot. The few road signs that have been installed cant be seen at night.              
	Official comment               
	Barrackpore sub-divisional officer Alokesh Roy said: We are aware of the dark stretches on the expressway. The National Highway Authority has to clear some CESC bills. We were told that once the bills were paid, supply would be restored.

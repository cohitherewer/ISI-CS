                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Metro stations stormed
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Metro Railway services were affected on Thursday as CPM cadres stormed Tollygunge and Dum Dum stations and drove out the staff to enforce the 12-hour bandh.        
	Metro Rail sources said the passenger count between 7am and 6pm was as low as 10,000, against the weekday average of 3 lakh-plus.        
	Only 65 trains ran between 7am and 6pm, against the 160 that ply during the same period on weekdays. The trains ran at an interval of 20 minutes till the evening, said an official.        
	The assault on the Metro Rail started around 7am, when CPM cadres barged into the panel room and the station masters office at Tollygunge station while a Dum Dum-bound train was about to leave.        
	They asked the employees to leave the premises and threatened to use force if they did not, a Metro Rail official said. The first three trains from Tollygunge had to be cancelled and the service could not resume till 8am.        
	The situation was worse at Dum Dum, though the first three trains rolled out from the northern terminal station smoothly.         
	Around 8.30am, the first group of cadres stormed the station and forced the staff to leave.         
	The situation worsened as the day progressed, with bandh supporters repeatedly swooping down on the station and disrupting the service. We had no option but to suspend the service from Dum Dum, said a Metro official.        
	From 8.30am to 6pm, the trains ran between Girish Park and Tollygunge, though CPM supporters downed the shutters of both stations to prevent commuters from stepping in.

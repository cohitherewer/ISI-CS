The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minerva, then Chaplin, then no more
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Minerva, then Chaplin, then no more
                              Football remains a top draw in the city, with an East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match ensuring choked roads and traffic snarls. A Telegraph picture                            
	August was an unlucky month for Calcuttas built heritage. Two landmarks have been given the quietus. The seafarers church in Hastings has already been razed, and Chaplin cinema, formerly Minerva, will soon meet the same fate.         
	The seafarers chapel was supposed to be in the care of the Central Public Works Department. In the 1950s the building standing on about 9000 sq ft had been sold to a promoter for as little as Rs 7,000. Since then a legal battle has been raging to save the ancient building. The CPWD never raised a finger to protect it. Last week the Supreme Court verdict went in favour of the promoter. It is all veiled in mystery.         
	And now Chaplin, once notorious for its rats, will be turned into an office building. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation has not heard of heritage.        
	When less is more         
	Theres no end to the woes of BSNL customers. A senior citizen, a Salt Lake resident, is harassed by the smallness of his bills. He uses two BSNL phones, having been hard-sold the second one, though he has no use for it. It is virtually free  but he regrets it. For the bill comes to less than Rs 10 a month. He has to spend at least Rs 10 to go to the telephone office to pay it. A conscientious bill-payer, he had been doing so without complaining too much and contemplating the surrender of the phone. But the last bill was the limit, literally, on the lower side. It amounted to Re 1!         
	Cant the BSNL, which is so bent on building a cool image with its television ads, pay a little more attention to its older customers? Maybe it could show a little more courtesy and send a composite bill of a few months, for an amount that is worth more than the auto rides to and from the telephone office?         
	Passion and pain        
	Another Salt Lake resident faced another problem, which was of shorter duration, but not less painful. She was supposed to attend a film show at 7.15pm at a south Calcutta multiplex. She started around 5.45pm, just in case the Sector V rush hour traffic detained her.         
	As she approached the Wipro crossing, from where one has to turn right, past Nicco Park, to hit the EM Bypass, she saw that the stretch was jammed with traffic that was moving like a snail. Sometimes stopping altogether. It took her 45 minutes to reach the bypass, when on a good traffic-free day it takes about five minutes.         
	The delay was caused by football fans. An East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match at Salt Lake stadium had just ended, with Mohun Bagan winning the match. The supporters of the two teams were returning home, choking all Salt Lake arteries opening into the bypass.         
	Moral of the story: It takes a traffic jam for many to realise the huge passion that football still inspires in the city.

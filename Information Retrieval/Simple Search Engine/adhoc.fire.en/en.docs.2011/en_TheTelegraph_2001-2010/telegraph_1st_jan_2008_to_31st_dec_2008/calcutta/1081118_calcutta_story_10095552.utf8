The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Early Puja push for flood fight
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Early Puja push for flood fight
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                          Pandal-hoppers wade through water outside Mohammad Ali Park. A Telegraph picture                                  
	An early Puja next year has prompted the civic authorities to start working on a waterlogging prevention plan barely a month after this years celebrations.        
	Mahalaya next year will be on September 18, the day after Viswakarma puja. Arijit Roychowdhury of Gupta Press Panjika said the last time Mahalaya came this early was in 2001, when it was observed on on September 17. While Mahalaya 2008 was on September 29, the next Puja will be over by September 28. Id-ul-Fitr will also be early next year.        
	This year, there was moderate to heavy rain on at least six days in the second half of September. The same pattern of rainfall next year could inconvenience pandal-hoppers if the civic body does not ensure that the accumulated water drains out quickly.        
	If the weather pattern does not change, it might pour during the next Puja. The municipal commissioner has asked the drainage department to be ready to tackle the waterlogging problem, said chief engineer (drainage and sewerage) Tushar Ghosh.        
	Last week, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay directed the drainage department to draw up a list of areas most prone to waterlogging and suggest short-term preventive measures.        
	According to a civic estimate, more than 300 community pujas of the 1,200-odd in the city face problems because of waterlogging.        
	The pockets identified as vulnerable are Cossipore, South Sinthee, Bagbazar, Paikpara, Tallah and Thanthania in north Calcutta; Sealdah, Narkeldanga and Entally in central Calcutta; Panchanantala, Dhakuria, Hazra, Kalighat, Chetla, Picnic Garden and Ballygunge in south Calcutta; and Kasba, New Ballygunge, Tangra, Beleghata and Phoolbagan in east Calcutta.        
	The steps to be taken varies from place to place. While desilting of brick sewer and gully pits will serve their purpose at Mohammad Ali Park or Santosh Mitra Square, regular cleaning of surface drains is a must in Tiljala, Topsia and Kasba, said a civic engineer. In some pockets, portable pumps should be kept ready to quickly drain out the accumulated rainwater to a nearby brick sewer or surface drain, he added.

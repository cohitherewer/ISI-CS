  - State wants two years to shift Esplanade bus terminus        OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          The Esplanade bus terminus. A Telegraph picture                                        
	The state government will seek two years from Calcutta High Court to shift the Esplanade bus terminus.        
	The court, in September last year, had set March 29, 2008, as the deadline for the government to shift the terminus beyond three km of Victoria Memorial Hall.        
	The ruling, along with another one asking the state not to issue fresh licences to eateries around Park Street, was aimed at protecting the marble monument on the Maidan from pollution.        
	The transport department decided at a recent meeting that it would be unable to meet the deadline and would file an affidavit in the court seeking two years for the shifting.        
	After receiving the court order, the department had discussed with experts probable plans to shift the terminus from Esplanade. The state had approached the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), seeking land for a permanent bus terminus on the eastern side of Band Stand. But the CPT is not ready to part with land, said a transport department official.        
	He said the government had already constructed a terminus at Band Strand (adjacent to Eden Gardens), where most private buses and minibuses have shifted. These buses used to terminate their journey at Esplanade. They have been redirected to Band Strand to contain the growing level of pollution at Esplanade. Very few private and long-distance buses now use the Esplanade terminus. But until a suitable plot is available, the Esplanade terminus cannot be shifted, the transport department has stated in its affidavit.        
	There are some long-distance buses that enter the city illegally and park on Strand Road. The state had proposed the construction of a terminus for them in Howrah, off Vidyasagar Setu, but the plan was put off considering the problems commuters would face following the relocation, said an official.

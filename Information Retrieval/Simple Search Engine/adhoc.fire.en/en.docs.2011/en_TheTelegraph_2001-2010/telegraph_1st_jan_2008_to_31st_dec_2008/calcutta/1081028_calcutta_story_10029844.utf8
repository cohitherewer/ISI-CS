                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Court orders Todis arrest
          STAFF REPORTER                                             
	A court on Monday directed the CBI to arrest by November 3 industrialist Ashok Todi, brother Pradip Todi and relative Anil Saraogi in connection with the case of Rizwanur Rahmans death.        
	The seventh metropolitan magistrate of Bankshal court, Bibhas Chatterjee, issued non-bailable arrest warrants against the Todis and Saraogi after they failed to appear in person in compliance with an earlier order.        
	In the evening, the sleuths went to the Todis houses in Salt Lake and their office in Burrabazar, but the duo could not be traced. Nor could Saraogi be found at his Alipore home.        
	CBI officials said they had alerted the airport authorities to stop the Todis and Saraogi from leaving the city.        
	As for the other four accused, the magistrate ordered judicial custody for Sheikh Mohiuddin, alias Pappu, till November 10 and extended the interim bail of three police officers  Ajoy Kumar, Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das  till November 3. All seven were charged with abetting Rizwanurs suicide.        
	The computer graphics teacher, whose body was found beside the railway tracks in Patipukur on September 21, 2007, had married Ashok Todis daughter Priyanka against the wishes of her family. Rizwanurs family alleged that the Todis, in collusion with the police and Pappu, had tried to separate the couple.        
	After the CBI filed its chargesheet on September 23, the court issued summons to the accused directing them to appear on October 27.        
	Other than the Todis and Saraogi, who were represented by their lawyers, all appeared before the magistrate in person.        
	Though the court had allowed the accused to be represented by their lawyers, magistrate Chatterjee maintained that given that this is not a petty case, all seven were expected to appear in person. The accused (the Todis and Saraogi) tried to drag the proceedings by not appearing in person, Chatterjee said.        
	The Todis lawyers argued that their clients had only exercised their right to be represented by their counsel and pleaded with the magistrate to set a fresh date if he wanted the duo to appear in person. But the magistrate turned down the plea, saying: The submission of the learned counsel does not inspire the confidence of this court.        
	Legal experts said the Todis and Saraogi could move a higher court challenging the magistrates order.        
	On Pappu, whose anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the sessions court last week, Chatterjee said: If the accused is released on bail at this crucial stage the case will be jeopardised and the accused could tamper with evidence.        
	While the proceedings were on in Bankshal court, a vacation bench of the high court was hearing a petition filed by Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur, challenging the bail granted to the three officers.        
	After hearing both sides, the bench adjourned the case till November 5 and sent it to a regular bench for disposal. Rukbanur said his family would continue its fight for justice till it was delivered.

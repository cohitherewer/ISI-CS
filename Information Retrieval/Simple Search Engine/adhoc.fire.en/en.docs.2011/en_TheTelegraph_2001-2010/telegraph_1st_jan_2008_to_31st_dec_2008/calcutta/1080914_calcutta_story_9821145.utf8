The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Violent brush, peacock throne
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Violent brush, peacock throne
										      eyewitness                        S. Gopinaths painted circular stoneware piece and (below) a work by Akhilesh				                                 
	Aakriti Art Gallery has put up a well-chosen exhibition of non-figurative (call it abstract if you will) works titled Empty And Full.         
	The works of six artists are on display. Akhilesh from Bhopal is known for his grey rather bleak canvases that make no reference to the world we see around us. This time he has burst into colour  red, orange, maroon, green and yellow. The effect is like that of a kaleidoscope.        
	The paintings of Manish Pushkale are in delicate and dark hues and look like shadows layered upon shadows or applique with pieces of gauze. Subtle shades of buff with dabs of yellow, and pink, and an opaque background with traces of rust  such are the canvases of Yogendra Tripathi.         
	Remnants of ancient civilisations, and stele in particular, discovered after archaeological excavations seem to have inspired Sunil Des paintings.         
	Samindranath Majumdar may have had similar archaeological finds in mind when he sat down to paint, but this artist has churned out too many similar works over the past few years.         
	Amitava Dhars works are exercises in expressionism with their criss-cross of lines, slathered paint and violent brushwork.               
	Ganges Art gallerys current exhibition, as its title, From beyond the Vindhyas, suggests, is all about artists from south India. With 13 artists in all, and barely two works per artist, it can hardly be termed a representative show.         
	The quality of the works is quite uneven. Surya Prakashs flaming forest, K.S. Charis equine head and woman and M. Senathipathis lovers, who resemble illustrations dating back to the 1960s, are quite disappointing and crude.         
	S.G. Vasudevs works with their high finish resemble enamel but thats about all. Beyond that it is all clich.         
	The sophistication of R.M. Palaniappans charged drawings and K.M. Adimoolams fluent lines look out of place here. K. Muralidharans two smaller works are delightfully nave, but the larger piece takes it a bit too far.         
	There are two other pieces that stood out. S. Nandagopals Garuda defined with metallic lines has the grace of classical sculpture. S. Gopinaths painted circular stoneware piece with gold leaf on top holds interest with its painted figures of a nude man and woman and the skeleton of a horse.              
	Josh P.S.s paintings and photographs being exhibited at Bose Pacia Kolkata suggest that they are drenched in our colonial past.         
	Actually, the paintings are straight copies in white and grey of photographs associated with the freedom struggle and of land denuded by gold mining. The furrowed hill is the only painting that makes some impact as an independent art work. The peacock throne installation is monstrous and clumsy.       SOUMITRA DAS

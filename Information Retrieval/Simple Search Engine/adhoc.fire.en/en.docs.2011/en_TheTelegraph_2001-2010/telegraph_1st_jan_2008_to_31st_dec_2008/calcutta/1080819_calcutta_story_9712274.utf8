                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fresh probe in harass cases
  - Calcutta University sets up panels to look into allegations          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                
	Calcutta University has ordered fresh inquiries into two sexual harassment charges in Harimohan Ghosh College and Viharilal College of Home and Social Sciences.        
	A 10-member panel has been set up to probe the allegation that the principal of Harimohan Ghosh College, Bikash Majumdar, had used inappropriate language with sexual innuendos.        
	A three-member committee has been formed to probe the allegation of a Viharilal College student that she had been molested by a teacher, Indubhushan Mondal.        
	We are not satisfied with the report of the one-man committee that probed the Harimohan Ghosh College incident, said Tarun Patra, a member of the universitys undergraduate council.        
	The probe was conducted by Ujwal Basu, a former president of the state secondary education board.   
	The panel had recommended that the principal be given three months to mend his ways. The suggestion is unacceptable. Teachers and students have complained that the principals behaviour had worsened over the past few weeks, said Patra.  
	The teachers and students had recently lodged a complaint with the state women rsquo;s commission, demanding action against the principal. The commission, too, has urged the university to order a fresh probe.
    
	Majumdar disputed the charges. ldquo;A section has been trying to malign me ever since I caught a boy and a girl in a compromising position and wanted to punish them. rdquo;  
	In Viharilal College, a postgraduate student had alleged that Mondal, a Bengali teacher, had molested her in a computer laboratory on November 30.
  The university had set up a one-member panel, headed by Sanjukta Dasgupta, the dean of arts, to probe the incident.
    
	 ldquo;The committee gave a clean chit to Mondal. No action has been taken against him, rdquo; said a student of Viharilal College. The students are boycotting Mondal rsquo;s class.
  Pro vice-chancellor Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee said the one-man committee was only a ldquo;fact-finding panel rdquo;. 
    
	 ldquo;The second committee will conduct a full-fledged inquiry, rdquo; he said.

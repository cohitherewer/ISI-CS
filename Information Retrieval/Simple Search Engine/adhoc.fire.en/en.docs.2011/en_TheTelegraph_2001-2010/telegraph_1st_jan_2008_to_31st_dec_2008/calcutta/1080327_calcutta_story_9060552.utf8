The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Madhyamik syllabus to shed flab
                                                                                                               Madhyamik syllabus to shed flab
  - Move to restrict questions to Class X topics aims to ease exam stress          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Madhyamik examinees will soon have a trimmer syllabus to grapple with, as the government is planning to restrict the questions to the topics taught in Class X.        
	Now, Madhyamik questions are set on the combined syllabus of classes IX and X.        
	The proposed system was introduced long ago by the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations and the Central Board of Examinations. The state government itself had introduced it in the Higher Secondary exams last year.        
	A comprehensive exercise is on to overhaul the school education system. Our main objective is to reduce exam-related stress that students go through. As part of the exercise, we are considering the restriction of the Madhyamik syllabus to the Class X topics, school education minister Partha Dey said in the Assembly lobby on Wednesday.        
	The minister refused to set a deadline, saying the government will need some time to decide when the system will come into force, but sources said the education department wants to introduce the truncated syllabus by 2010.        
	The department wants to implement the system at the earliest, as Madhyamik is the only board exam in the state that still sticks to the practice of setting questions on the combined syllabus of two classes, said an official.        
	The government has held a series of discussions on the issue with various teacher associations, the official added.        
	As a first step towards bifurcating the Madhyamik course, the state board of secondary education has restructured the internal exams from classes VI to X in its affiliated schools. Now, apart from the annual exams, the schools hold a series of unit and block tests, said an education department official.

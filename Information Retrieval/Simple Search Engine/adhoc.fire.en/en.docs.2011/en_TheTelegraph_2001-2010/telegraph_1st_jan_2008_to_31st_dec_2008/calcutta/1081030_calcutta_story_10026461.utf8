The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Road fixed in haste subsides
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Road fixed in haste subsides
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The stretch of Jessore Road between Milk Colony and Bangur Avenue that was repaired just before the pujas is already showing signs of a cave-in.        
	The stretch had been a traffic trauma for the past two years because of a Rs 50-crore pipe-laying and road-widening project by the Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project (CEIP). But after a partial laying of sewer lines and relaying of the road, traffic woes have compounded.        
	We suffered in the hope that the situation would improve after the work was over. But it has deteriorated. We dont know how long we have to face such hardship, rued Biren Sarkar, of Kalindi.        
	The cave-ins have made the road surface uneven, causing car crawls between Shyambazar, VIP Road and the airport.        
	CEIP officials are aware of the situation and blame the hasty repair work. We were in a hurry to throw open the road before the festive season. If roads are repaired in haste, cave-ins may occur. We will get the affected parts repaired, said a senior CEIP official.        
	The difference in elevation of the two flanks of the road is visible. Near Lake Town, the difference is five to six inches.        
	Police say the accident count has increased because of the uneven surface of the stretch. Seven mini-trucks overturned in the past 10 months. Unless the road surface is repaired, more mishaps may occur, a police officer said.         
	Officials of the public works department (PWD) questioned the CEIPs repairing process. Ideally, the soil should be allowed to stand for a few months before the brick layer is laid. But roads are always repaired in haste. Filling with proper materials is very important, said an official of the PWDs road maintenance wing.

	When you look at Prayas Biswakarma, the first thing that strikes you is his sunny smile. Although one is told that the boy from Kalimpong understands only broken-Hindi and no English and requires someone to explain things to him, it is soon clear that the violin player who plays Vivaldis Konzert G Dur with ease, knows his mind. And he can strum the violin at will.         
	In the city as part of Dr Grahams Homes Choir, he has performed everything from Vivaldi to Yanni, Vengaboys My Heart Goes Sha La La to Abbas I have a dream and Bollywood numbers. He has also played Vivaldis Spring  a part of The Four Seasons concerto  solo. He picked up the violin at the age of three, says his mother Laxmi. The boy himself is too young to remember the day he listened to a recording of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and picked up a violin and played the tune. Give him a sheet of music and he will play it for you, says Shane Saviel, the choir master.        
	What began with nursery rhymes, soon extended to the gamut of musical genres available in the household, from pop classics to Bollywood numbers and Nepali songs. It must have helped that his parents are music teachers at the local Gandhi Sevashram school.         
	The boy, whose favourite is Vivaldis Summer, was picked up by M.J. Robertson the chairman of the management board of the homes, after he heard him perform. The school has waived his tuition fees and music training costs.         
	Not just the violin, Prayas is at ease with the Spanish guitar, can play the drum and has even tried his hand at the recorder flute. He took the Grade 6 exam in music for violin from Trinity College, London, in September this year, where, says his mother, he was awarded a distinction.

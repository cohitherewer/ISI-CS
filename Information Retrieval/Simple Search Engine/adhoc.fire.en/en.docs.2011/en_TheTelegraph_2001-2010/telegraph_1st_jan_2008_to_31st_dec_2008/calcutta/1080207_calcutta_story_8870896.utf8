The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bong connection in French opera   Padmini in Paris
                                                                                                            Bong connection in French opera     - Tanusree Shankar choreography for Bhansali show on Paris stage          RESHMI SENGUPTA                            THE MELTING POT: Sanjay Leela Bhansali is directing a French opera about a Rajput queen which will be choreographed by Tanusree Shankar                                       
	Theatre du Chatelet in Paris will have a Bong connection this spring. Tanusree Shankar is Sanjay Leela Bhansalis chosen one to breathe life into a French opera about a Rajput queen.        
	The Palm Avenue-based danseuse is choreographing Padmavati, the opera that Theatre du Chatelet  impressed by the lush-and-lavish Devdas  has commissioned Bhansali to direct.        
	Sanjay had seen one of our shows in Mumbai. He called me in December 2006 and asked if I would choreograph for the opera. I agreed, but I didnt hear from him for a year. Then he called me up in November 2007 to say that the project was on. We got cracking immediately, Tanusree told Metro on Wednesday, her plans of a final rehearsal foiled by the bandh.        
	Between December and now, the maker of Saawariya made three hush-hush trips to Calcutta, sitting through rehearsals at Tanusrees residence-cum-dance school and auditioning students. He has handpicked 22 dancers from Tanusrees troupe  along with three Manipuri performers from Imphal  to form the core of the choreography.        
	Padmavati, written by Albert Roussel in the early 20th Century following his trip to Rajasthan, tells the tale of Queen Padmini of Chittor, immortalised by her act of self-immolation to guard her honour from invader Alauddin Khilji. Tanusree has choreographed seven pieces to Roussels philharmonic orchestra.        
	Sanjay, of course, is creating something grand and opulent. He has given me a free hand. Blending Indian dance with opera music was the most difficult part. I would perform a piece in various ways and Sanjay would choose one set of movements, explained Tanusree.        
	The two-hour-long spectacle featuring Indian characters will be in French, performed by top-line French opera artistes. The 25 dancers from Calcutta and Manipur will be warriors, slaves and queens.                          
	I have followed the Shankar technique, which my father-in-law Uday Shankar and husband Ananda practised. We are using Manipuri acrobatic movements too and just retaining the essence of Rajasthan through costumes and sets, said Tanusree.        
	Fashion designer Rajesh Pratap Singh is stitching together colourful Rajasthani costumes for the entire cast. The scenography is by Mumbai-based Omang Kumar, who had created the black and blue worlds in Bhansalis Black and Saawariya.        
	Team Tanusree sets off for Paris on Friday and Padmavati premieres at the Theatre du Chatelet on March 14 with six shows on the trot. Once there, we will start intensive rehearsals with the French actors to live music by the chorus. Sanjay and I will decide on the movements of the opera actors and integrate the Indian and western elements, said Tanusree.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Cellphones and recharge vouchers worth nearly Rs 2 lakh were stolen from a shop at Madhugar in Dum Dum on Saturday night.        
	In nearby Gosthobehari Avenue, a gang raided a flat on the third floor of a four-storeyed building. The robbers assaulted the flat-owner and decamped with electronic goods and decorative items.         
	Ujjal Kundu, the owner of the mobile shop, closed it around 8pm on Saturday. When I entered the shop on Sunday recharge vouchers and cellphones were lying on the floor, he said.        
	Police said the thieves entered by breaking the iron grille of the toilet at the back of the shop. It seems at least two people were involved, said an officer.         
	The robbers entered Apanjon Apartment by breaking the lock at the back of building. They locked the doors of the other flats from outside.         
	I was sleeping when the robbers broke in. They hit and then gagged me, said Debashish Mondol, who was alone in the flat on Saturday night.        
	No one has been arrested.

                      Laughter riot                    Indians are the second largest population in the world, but were invisible on TV  everything is either black or white  Russell Peters (Western Gazette; November 24, 2000).        Russell Peters decided to change all that in his inimitable way and the rest, as they say, is history. This comedy superstar has been doing stand up for 20 years and has an impressive resume. Peters is as much a humorist as a comedian. He doesnt really tell jokes. Rather, he uses his wry observations on the subjects of race, class and culture to illuminate our human shortcomings with the sizzling accuracy of a well-aimed laser. His quick wit and ability to mimic language and accents allow Peters to create characters of all races and cultures and forge an immediate bond with his audiences, regardless of their racial and cultural background. Russell Peters: Outsourced is Peters first DVD release. It is a stage act dedicated to the memory of his father. Its topics range from different types of Asians, the English accent, terrorists, racists, Pho Phuc Lai Vietnamese restaurant, Africans, and his own adventures with the Chinese in KFC, Beijing. Peters new DVD/CD combo, Russell Peters: Red, White and Brown, was recorded on February 2, 2008 at the WAMU Theatre at Madison Square Garden and has been selling like hot cakes worldwide. Peters is all set to activate the Calcuttans funny bones in this much-anticipated home-coming tour this evening.

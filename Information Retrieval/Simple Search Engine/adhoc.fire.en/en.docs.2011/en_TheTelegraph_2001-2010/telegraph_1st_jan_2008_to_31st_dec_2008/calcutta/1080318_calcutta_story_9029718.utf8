	For a over a week from Monday, residents of Kumartulis Banamali Sarkar Street will return to their Shantipur roots once more, as they celebrate a 207-year-old festival.        
	Gopal puja is an integral part of Doljatra in Shantipur, the ancestral home of many city-based clay modellers. In Kumartuli, it is observed with more fervour than Durga puja, with events like Balok Bhojan, jatra and cultural programmes lined up for the festival.        
	Our forefathers brought the tradition with them from Shantipur, where the Narugopal idol is worshipped in every house, said Monty Pal, a member of Kumartuli Thakurpatti Barwari Samiti, which organises the festival.        
	This years festival was inaugurated on Monday by a monk from the Ramakrishna Mission. The puja will begin on Tuesday with the worship of a 15-ft Kali, flanked by the idols of Brahma and Shitala. On March 21, the residents will worship gigantic Gopal images.        
	The immersion is scheduled for March 26.        
	Half-finished images of Gopal  chubby, grinning and holding narus in their hands  can be seen on Kumartuli streets. Craftsmen collaborate in completing each image, with the master Palmoshai of each unit putting in the final touches.        
	About 10-11 ft in height, the Kumartuli Gopals are still smaller than the Shantipuri ones. Besides, the idols in Shantipur are in a crawling posture, said craftsman Swapan Pal. The pujas are of special significance to our elders. They feel like they are back in Nadia again, he smiled.        
	Throughout the year, our Palmoshais keep aside a certain sum for each idol supplied by his workshop. This is entirely voluntary, a gesture in tribute to Gopal, explained Monty. The budget this year will be between Rs 80,000 and Rs 1 lakh.

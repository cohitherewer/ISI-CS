The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja touch-up for potholes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Puja touch-up for potholes
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The civic authorities have allotted Rs 4 crore for pre-Puja repair of roads.        
	The monsoon shower and the resultant waterlogging have turned 150 km of city roads unusable, besides creating around a lakh potholes. We need 10 sunny days before the Puja to complete the repairs. Not just roads, damaged footpaths, too, will be repaired, said civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	Among the arteries that will be repaired are Bagmari Road, Maniktala Road, Raja SC Mullick Road, Tollygunge Road, Jadavpur Central Road, Selimpur Road, MG Road and BB Ganguly Street.        
	More than 1,200 civic and contractual workers have been deployed for the project, mayoral council member (roads) Tuhin Bera said. Work started in August but had to be suspended frequently because of rain.        
	Though the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is confident of giving a makeover to the potholed stretches in time, questions are being raised on the delayed response from the civic authorities.        
	They could have started the project earlier this month. Every year, a huge amount of money is wasted on road repairs because the CMC wakes up late, said Madan Mitra, of the Progressive Taximens Union.        
	Keeping in mind the traffic load on the city streets, the project should have been carried out in phases, he added.        
	A senior traffic police officer echoed Mitras views. The traffic load goes up further before the Puja. Repairs at this time create serious problems.        
	Mayoral council member Bera admitted that around Rs 1.5 crore is wasted every year on pre-Puja road repairs because of the wet surface. But the alternative is to keep the damaged roads unattended during the festive season. Work could not be taken up between June and the middle of August because of monsoon.

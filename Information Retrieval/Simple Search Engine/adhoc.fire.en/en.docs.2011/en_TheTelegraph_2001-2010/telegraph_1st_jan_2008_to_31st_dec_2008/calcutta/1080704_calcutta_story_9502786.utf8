The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ph.D count up after process overhaul
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ph.D count up after process overhaul

	Calcutta University is sprucing up its system of awarding doctoral degrees and its already showing results.        
	Around 250 scholars will be awarded the Ph.D in the 2008 convocation, up nearly 100 compared with last year and the highest in the past six years.        
	We have completed the procedure for awarding Ph.D to around 240 researchers this year. Some more scholars may be included in the list. After many years, we will be awarding the doctoral degree to so many students in a year, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	In the 2003 convocation, the university had awarded the degree to 125 students.        
	Das attributed the rise in the number of Ph.Ds to the measures the university has taken to speed up the process of awarding the degree.        
	According to the rules, the theses submitted by scholars are examined by experts in foreign universities. For the past several decades, CU would send the thesis to experts by post, which took a lot of time.        
	We are gradually switching to a dual system of sending theses. As soon as we get a dissertation, a copy is sent to the foreign expert through the Internet. A printed version is sent later by post. This cuts the delay in examining the thesis, Das explained.        
	To further expedite the process of granting the degree, the university has simplified the rules for online viva.        
	Earlier, a scholar joining an institution abroad immediately after submitting his thesis had to seek the vice-chancellors consent for appearing in viva online. If the permission was denied, the scholar had to come over for the test.        
	Now, any candidate can take the test online, the vice-chancellor said.        
	That apart, the university is trying to introduce a system of submitting dissertations online.        
	The scholars have welcomed the move, though a section is peeved over the lack of guidelines for research guides.        
	Sharmila Roy (name changed), who has almost completed her research in physical science, admitted that the measures have started bearing fruit.        
	We would like to bring it to the notice of the authorities that scholars are still puppets in the hands of their guides and this is resulting in a decline in the quality of research. The university should frame guidelines on the eligibility of guides and assess each research work, said a spokesman for Calcutta University Research Scholars Association.

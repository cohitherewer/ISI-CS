The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 4-lane solution to VIP chaos
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       4-lane solution to VIP chaos
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A four-lane artery will be laid parallel to VIP Road in Baguiati to ease traffic load between the airport and Ultadanga.        
	The plans for the 500-metre bypass have been finalised by Rajarhat-Goplapur municipality and North 24-Parganas police.        
	We will overhaul traffic management on this stretch. City-bound buses from north will ply down a dedicated thoroughfare instead of VIP Road, said Tapas Chatterjee, the chairman of Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality.         
	The two pedestrian crossings on VIP Road, which see a footfall of nearly 2,000 per hour, are primarily responsible for the congestion in Baguiati. So, we will construct a four-lane parallel road between Joramandir and Narayantala, said Monodip Mukherjee, the executive engineer of the municipality.        
	Work on the project will start next week after a Bangalore-based firm dealing in sophisticated signalling systems finalises the blueprint, he added.        
	Municipal officials said space for the proposed road would not be a problem. The bypass will come up on the space demarcated for a bus stand of route number 44 as well some adjoining vacant land, an official said.        
	The first bay, farthest from VIP Road, will be dedicated for autorickshaws, which will only be allowed for one-way movement, he added.        
	The second lane will serve as a parking bay for nearly 25 buses, while buses on route 44 will ply on the third lane, where a 100-feet long bus shed will be constructed.        
	All other buses will enter the fourth lane from VIP Road near Joramandir. They will ply parallel to VIP Road, bypassing the two bottlenecks at Baguiati, and re-enter VIP Road near Narayantala, said Sugata Sen, the additional superintendent of police of Barasat.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The depression that led to a deluge in the city on Tuesday has moved to Jharkhand and is showing signs of weakening, the Met office said on Wednesday.        
	The weather in Calcutta and the south Bengal districts will improve from Thursday. We can only expect scattered showers in the city on Thursday, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Debnath, however, warned of heavy rain in the north Bengal districts.        
	The city woke up to an overcast sky on Wednesday. There were intermittent drizzles throughout the day.        
	The rain also brought down the maximum and minimum temperatures five degrees and four degrees below normal, respectively.        
	According to a Met official, the depression that lay near Burdwan on Tuesday evening moved north-west and lay about 50 km from Dumka, in Jharkhand, on Wednesday.        
	The depression is expected to move further in a north-westerly direction and weaken gradually, said the official.        
	The depression is likely to cause heavy rain over Jharkhand, north Orissa and north Chhattisgarh.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jadavpur University (JU) will suspend 24 students found guilty of ragging a fresher.        
	The gang had on July 17 locked the first-year architecture student in a room on the university premises, forced her to smoke marijuana, drink alcohol and swallow cigarettes. The girls parents stated in a complaint that she had also been sexually harassed.        
	A probe by the JU authorities revealed that three of the 24 students took part directly in the ragging.        
	The trio  two of them are girls  will not be allowed to attend classes, sit for exams or participate in any other academic activity for the next two years.        
	The other students, whose participation was found to be indirect, face a years academic suspension.        
	All 24 students, however, will be given a chance to defend themselves.         
	They will have to state in writing within 10 days why they should not be punished for their conduct. The suspension orders will be issued after we go through their replies, said Parthapratim Biswas, a member of the executive council, one of the two highest policy-making bodies of the university (the other being the court).        
	The executive council also decided to act against six former students who were involved in the ragging. The university will file FIRs against them, lodge complaints with their employers and withhold their certificates in the next convocation scheduled for December.        
	Investigations have proved that the fresher was subjected to severe torture  physical, mental and sexual. Such heinous acts will not be tolerated in our institute, said a member of the executive council.        
	The girl fell ill after the ragging. The next day, her parents lodged a complaint which was placed before the universitys anti-ragging committee.        
	The executive council discussed the panels report and unanimously decided on Tuesday  in the presence of student representatives  to suspend the 24 students and act against the former pupils.        
	This is the first time the university has punished so many students for ragging, said Biswas.        
	The council also asked the teachers of the architecture department to be on guard so that such incidents do not recur.

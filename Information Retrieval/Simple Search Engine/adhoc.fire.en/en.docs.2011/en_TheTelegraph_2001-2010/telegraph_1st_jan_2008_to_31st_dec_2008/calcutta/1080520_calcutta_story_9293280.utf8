                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Spilt acid scalds two

	Acid spilling out of a tanker that toppled over off the northern end of the Taratala flyover a little after midnight on Sunday scalded two laundry workers who had come out of their shop on hearing the sound of metal hitting concrete.        
	The driver of the tanker, which was carrying 13 tonnes of concentrated sulphuric acid, lost control after it hit a culvert. The vehicle fell sideways on the footpath around 12.20am, tea vendor Akhilesh Ram, who witnessed the accident, said.        
	Shankar Mistry, who owns a laundry in the same area, was injured when he opened the door of his shop to see what had happened. I heard a big bang and opened the door. I dont remember anything after that except crying out in pain as the hot acid coming out of the tanker washed my legs.         
	Another laundry worker, Bahauddin Ansari, was injured when he rushed to Shankars aid. The duo were admitted to SSKM Hospital with severe burns on their feet.        
	Two fire tenders reached the spot some time later. A truckload of sand was brought to keep the acid and the gas from spreading.         
	Residents said the culvert was a threat to all motorists. Only two days ago, a motorcyclist hit the bump and landed on the footpath. He was hospitalised with serious head injuries, Dhiman Bhattacharya, who owns a stationery shop in the area, said.         
	With the tanker remaining at the site for over nine hours, traffic on Diamond Harbour Road moved slowly throughout Monday morning.

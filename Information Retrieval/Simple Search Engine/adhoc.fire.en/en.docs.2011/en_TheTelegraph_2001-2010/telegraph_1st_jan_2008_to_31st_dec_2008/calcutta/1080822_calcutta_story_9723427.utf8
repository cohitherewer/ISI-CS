	Universities and colleges in Bengal cannot retain experienced faculty beyond the age of 60 despite needing them because the government doesnt want to displease two CPM-controlled unions.         
	The West Bengal College and University Teachers Association and the West Bengal Council of College Principals are opposed to Delhis decision to increase the age of retirement on the ground that it would block new appointments.         
	Such a step will restrict the entry of a new teacher to any college or university in our state for five years. The Centre should first give us an assurance that it will create teaching posts in every college and university on a regular basis. Only then will we allow the state government to go ahead with the proposal, said Tarun Patra, the general secretary of the teachers association.        
	Gyanankur Goswami, the president of the principals council, echoed him.        
	The UPA government raised the retirement age of teachers working in central universities and other institutes of higher education from 62 to 65 last year and wrote to the state government to do likewise. The idea was to ensure that universities and colleges continued to have a blend of experience and youth instead of phasing out an entire batch and inducting another.        
	In Bengal, central institutions like the Indian Statistical Institute, Indian Association of Cultivation of Science, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology and Visva Bharati have already increased the retirement age.         
	Subimal Sen, the chairman of the West Bengal Council of Higher Education, said Delhis proposal hadnt been discussed yet.         
	Although the retirement age in state institutions remains 60, universities have the option of retaining select teachers for five years by splitting the re-employment period into 2+1+1+1 years. But a source said most institutions were known to retain only those teachers who were close to the CPM.        
	Tarun Naskar, who teaches engineering in Jadavpur University, said state-aided institutions were running short of experienced teaching staff. The central governments proposal could have rectified this. It is unfortunate that the state government has not responded to the proposal.         
	Naskar is the general secretary of the All Bengal University Teachers Association, a rival of the two CPM-affiliated organisations.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Illegal structures have come up on a pond partly filled up next to a temple in Howrahs Ramrajatala. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                  
	The green bench of Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the Howrah Municipal Corporation and Howrah police superintendent to remove illegal structures constructed after filling up a part of a tank belonging to Ramraja Temple Trust at Ramrajatala.        
	Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh of the bench also directed the civic body to restore the tank to its original condition within two months.         
	The court order followed a petition by residents of Ramrajatala. They alleged that despite repeated appeals, the district police had not taken action against traders operating out of the illegal structures.         
	The petitioners stated that the 0.85-acre tank, commonly known as Nonapukur, belongs to the temple trust but at least 60 illegal structures have been erected by filling up a major portion of it.        
	They claimed that preparations for offering puja used to be made beside the tank before the temple was built. Residents consider the area holy, and, hence, it should be maintained properly.        
	The advocate appearing for the state pollution control board told the court that his client had issued eviction notices to the encroachers.         
	The lawyer appearing for the civic authorities stated that the claims of the petitioners were genuine.         
	The bench observed that filling up the water body was an offence. The settlers will have to leave the place. The Howrah civic authorities should take measures so that the tank might be restored to its original form, stated the judgment.        
	According to the petitioners, the temple was founded by the zamindar of Santragachhi in 1740.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta airport operated without a radar for more than an hour on Wednesday morning, following a power cut. As a result, 20 flights took off 10 to 15 minutes late.        
	The power failure, between 9.11am and 9.25am, shut down four radar, digital clocks and the flight data processing system. The gadgets were functional again after 10.25am.        
	An Airports Authority of India official said the supply on both essential and non-essential power lines was cut off in the morning. Usually, one of the lines remains operational. The power backup in the form of batteries allows the radar system to work only for five minutes.        
	The air traffic control (ATC) had to do without a radar for an hour and 10 minutes. Flight operations continued but there were delays in the peak period.        
	The airport has one terminal approach radar and three route radar. The terminal approach radar has a primary and a secondary system, which monitor the take-off and touchdown of aircraft, while the three route radar oversee flight approach and departure routes.        
	The digital clock on the ATC tower helps the officials keep track of flight timings. The flight data processing system records speed of aircraft, type of aircraft, route taken by flights, points of departure and destination of flights, flying level and estimated times of flights crossing points on the route.        
	The radar, clock and the flight data system are crucial for the ATC tower operations and flight movements.

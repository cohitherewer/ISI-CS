The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tale of a cultural city
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tale of a cultural city
										      flashback                        
	At the Calcutta launch of The Untold Charminar writings on Hyderabad, author Syeda Imam declared emphatically: Calcutta and Hyderabad have better taste than most other cities in India.         
	While that might be said in kindness or as a marketing exercise, the fact remains that Calcuttans do think highly of themselves, their culture and taste as was evident in the panel discussion after the launch. And so do Hyderabadis. Perhaps justly so.         
	The city that was once ruled by the worlds richest man houses the most valuable old treasures, including the 187-carat diamond used as a paperweight by the Nizam, had the most IT-savvy chief minister who transformed it into a hi-tech hub and still has a modern treasure: a young international tennis star who wears her attitude on her sleeves.         
	The evening saw the screening of Zafar Hais charming film Hyderabad  a Place in the Heart and Pandit Vijay Kichlu reciting a few Urdu couplets.         
	The Untold Charminar is a collection of pieces by Sarojini Naidu, Sir Mark Tully, William Dalrymple, Ian Austin, Meenakshi Mukherjee, Shyam Benegal and Nagesh Kukunoor, among others. The book is one of Penguins city anthologies.         
	Dogged         
	Journalist Hiranmay Karlekar has picked up his pen this time to condemn human aggression against animals, particularly canines.         
	Set in the backdrop of the Bangalore killings of mongrels in 2007, Karlekar explores fundamental questions about human behaviour towards animals and the environment in his second book Savage Humans and Stray Dogs, published by Sage and released at Oxford Bookstore on Friday.         
	Launching the book, music-critic and dog lover Kishore Chatterjee spoke of how the city was most tolerant towards dogs. Here beggars shared their meals with their canine companions.         
	IAS officer Prasad Ranjan Ray spoke of how the Ray-Karlekar family, including Runuda (Hiranmay) and he, grew up amid quaint tales of canines. This perhaps inculcated the passion with which both Ray and Karlekar spoke.

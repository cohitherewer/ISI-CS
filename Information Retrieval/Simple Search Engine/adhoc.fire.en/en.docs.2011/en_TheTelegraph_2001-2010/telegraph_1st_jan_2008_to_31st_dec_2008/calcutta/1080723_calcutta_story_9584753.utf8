                      A world of nonsense                    A satirical social commentary disguised as witty nonsense rhymes, Sukumar Rays book of verse, Abol Tabol, is one of his most immortal creations. Originally meant for children, its poems take us on a journey to a delightfully absurd world. Rays profound comic vision clothes his characters like Head Officer Barobabu, Kumro Potash, Bombagarher Raja, Ramgorurer Chhana and others in eccentric, though lovable garb. Distorted mirror images of the people we see around us, they help us discover many hidden truths of life. This evening, child artistes of Agami Nirman, an NGO working with the youth, present a musical representation of Abol Tabol, as part of Kolkata Smiles 08, the ongoing exhibition of cartoons celebrating the cartoon heritage of Calcutta. Recapturing the magical charm of these well-loved verses, the performance by children promises to fascinate, amuse and entertain.                  Event: A performance of Sukumar Rays Abol Tabol, by child actors When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Weaver Studio Centre for the Arts, 94 Ballygunge Place

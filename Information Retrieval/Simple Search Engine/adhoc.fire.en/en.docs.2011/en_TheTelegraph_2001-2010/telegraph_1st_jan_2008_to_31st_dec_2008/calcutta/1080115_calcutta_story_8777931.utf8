	The Dabur Red Great TTIS Challenge, Calcuttas biggest school fest, promises to be bigger and better than ever before, with 100 schools from the city participating. 
    
	The action started at Swabhumi on Monday, and will continue through Sunday, with a one-day gap on Thursday between prelims and the final competitive events.
    
	The carnival includes a variety of events, from creative writing to Antakshari, fusion dance to poster designing. This is a truly mega event where talent is recognised. It gives students from diverse backgrounds a chance to compete on a large scale, said Shilpa Asopa, a former Tiger reporter of The Telegraph in Schools and the emcee for the event.
    
	The inauguration ceremony, to be held on Tuesday, will include performances by tabla exponent Tanmoy Bose, as well as a performance by a troupe of children who paint while they dance. 
    
	The TTIS Challenge will also have kids from the TV show Chhote Ustad to perform at the finale on January 20, along with hosts Abhaas and Kunal Ganjawala. The DJ night and fusion dance finals are the other show-stealers at this weeklong extravaganza of fun, games and creativity.
    
	Some of the competitions lined up are slightly offbeat, like Three Minutes To Fame, which allows students to showcase any talent, however strange, and an unconventional instrument event where participants can choose to play anything.
    
	The Champion of Champion Awards is given to the student who participates in and wins the maximum number of events. This Champion is felicitated with a trophy and is named face of the year.
    
	The best thing about this Challenge is that we get to meet lots of old friends as well as make new ones. The general atmosphere of the carnival is of unadulterated fun with lots of action taking place at all times, says Prateek Lohia, a TTIS Tiger and a member of the core committee organising the events.

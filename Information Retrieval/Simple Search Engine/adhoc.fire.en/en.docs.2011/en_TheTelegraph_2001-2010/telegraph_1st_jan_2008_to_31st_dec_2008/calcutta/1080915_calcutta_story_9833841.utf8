                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Touch of resolve in terror times
  Lifeline restored, but life ends
        AMRITA GHOSH                          Subrata Mandal                                                  
	When Subrata Mandals mother Basanti lost her cellphone 10 days ago, it was as if his lifeline had snapped. On Saturday, he lay lifeless on a Delhi street, clutching the box containing the cellphone he had bought minutes earlier to send to his mother back home in Howrah so that they could resume speaking once every day.        
	We have been told that he was about to get into an autorickshaw after buying the cellphone from a Karol Bagh store when the bomb exploded. He died on the spot, Subratas uncle Kushadhwaj Mandal told Metro on Sunday.        
	Subrata, 23, used to work in a Connaught Place jewellery shop. He had followed his elder brother Sanjay, a jewellery artisan working in a Chandni Chowk store, from Domjur to Delhi seven years ago.        
	He was very close to his mother and used to call her every day. He was restless ever since Basanti lost her cellphone while attending a family function, Kushadhwaj, 55, said.        
	Nepal Sardar, a 22-year-old rickshaw-puller from Fakirdanga, near Nabadwip, died in the same blast. Shibu Bagh, another young migrant from Bengal working in a jewellery shop, was wounded. Shibu is from Choukhandipota, in Singur, and polishes gold and silver jewellery in a Karol Bagh shop. His brother is a landless farmer who lives with their mother and sister in Singur.        
	Many youths from Domjur, Makardah, Panchla and Uluberia work in gemstone and jewellery shops across the country.        
	We do not have employment opportunities here. So, going to other cities is the only option. But look what happened to such a nice boy, said Kushadhwaj, a farmer, lamenting the loss of his nephew to an act of terror far from home.        
	He recounted how Subrata would save money to visit his village at least twice a year and help his family maintain the tradition of organising Kali puja at home. The Mandals were planning a grand celebration this year.        
	Subrata was very hardworking and loyal to his family. He and his brother got all their sisters married off, said Naba Kumar Mandal, another uncle of the youth.        
	Sanjay called his brother-in-law Sanat Dhara at 3.30am to convey news of the tragedy. He asked Sanat to head for Delhi with his mother.        
	Basanti hadnt been told her younger son was dead until she and Sanat reached Delhi by a morning flight. She only knew that he (Subrata) had met with an accident. I cant bear to think how she reacted when she learnt the truth, Naba Kumar said.        
	At Fakirdanga, another mother was fighting to come to terms with a terrible reality. Nepals mother Sandhya, a domestic help, received a phone call from a friend of her son at 8.30pm on Sunday, saying that he had died in the blast near Gaffar Market.        
	Nepals friend Bimal was crying on the phone. I could not believe my ears. My son had gone to Delhi against my wishes three years ago. He never attended school but was desperate to earn a livelihood. He told me that without education he would not get any job in Bengal, Sandhya recalled.        
	Unlike Basanti, she didnt get to see her sons body. Bimal called a second time at night to say that Nepal had been cremated.

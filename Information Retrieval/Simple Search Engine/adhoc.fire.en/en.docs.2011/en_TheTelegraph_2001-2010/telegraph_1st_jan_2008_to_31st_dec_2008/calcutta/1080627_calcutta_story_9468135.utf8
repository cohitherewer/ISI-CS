          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court has asked the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education to show the mathematics answer script of a girl who twice failed in the subject but cleared the All-India Engineering Entrance Examination this year.         
	Justice Soumitra Pal on Thursday asked Paramita Mukherjee to deposit the answer script in court as soon as she received it from the council.         
	The order came in response to a petition filed by Paramitas father Kishore Mukherjee, who believes that his daughter would not have cracked the entrance test had she been weak in mathematics. He appended Paramitas Higher Secondary marksheets to the petition.        
	A student of Chandernagore Krishnabhabini Nari Siksha Mandir, the girls scores in the 2007 examination were 61 in Bengali, 63 in English, 33 in chemistry, 42 in physical science, 71 in biology, 87 in environment science and 22 in math.        
	As she could not succeed in mathematics in 2007, Paramita appeared again in Higher Secondary this year. She got 85 in Bengali, 69 in English, 63 in chemistry, 63 in physical science, 73 in biology, 95 in environment science and 19 in mathematics, advocate Abhijit Chakraborty, counsel for the Mukherjees, said in court.        
	In this years exam, Paramitas marks in each subject increased, except in mathematics, and she could not pass the exam. But the same student appeared in this years All-India Engineering/Architect Entrance Examination and her national rank in the said examination was 24,126. She was ranked 982 in the state.         
	Chakraborty requested the court to ask the council to show the mathematics answer script, saying it was the only way to remove the Mukherjees doubts about the fairness of the evaluation process. Paramitas father wants to know whether her paper was properly assessed or not, the lawyer said.        
	Paramita, he pointed out, was sure she would pass Higher Secondary last year itself. After publication of the results in 2007, she felt her math paper had not been assessed properly. But still, she decided to take the test again.        
	Counselling of students for admission to engineering colleges is slated for July 9. It will be unfortunate if Paramita is not allowed to be part of the process, Chakraborty said.

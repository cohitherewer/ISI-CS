The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | HC raps hawker pass the buck
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HC raps hawker pass the buck
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Friday came down on the state government, police and the civic body for failing to remove hawkers from pavements.        
	The situation is horrible, Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar said. From the government to the police to the civic body, everyone is passing the buck on the issue.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice Nijjar and Justice Maharaja Sinha ordered the government to file an affidavit within five weeks, stating its views on the draft national policy on hawkers.        
	The government says there is no policy based on which laws could be framed, while the police and the civic authorities say there are no laws to prevent hawkers from returning to footpaths. But we must find a permanent solution to the problem, the bench observed, while hearing a petition filed by green activist Subhash Dutta in September 2003.        
	Justice Sinha said traffic flow in the city would never be smooth unless the authorities put an end to unauthorised parking and encroachment of footpaths by hawkers. Streches of Harish Mukherjee Road are perennially clogged because of illegal parking.        
	Advocate-general Balai Roy said the state had suggested a few changes to the draft hawker policy, such as allowing hawkers to operate in certain areas during particular times of the day.

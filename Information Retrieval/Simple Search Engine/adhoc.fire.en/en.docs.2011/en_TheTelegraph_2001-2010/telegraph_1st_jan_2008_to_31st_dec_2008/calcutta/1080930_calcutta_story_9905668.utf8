	An Irishman and a Belgian citizen were arrested at the foreigners regional registration office on Monday for overstaying in the country.         
	David Simon Peter Mooney, 41, from Ireland, and 51-year-old Chalngura Jahau from Belgium visited the office on the advice of their embassy and travel agent, respectively. They will be produced in Bankshal court on Tuesday.        
	Mooney, a teacher, arrived in Calcutta from Kathmandu in March. He claimed he was teaching in a missionary school as a volunteer. His visa expired on September 25. He told us that he did not have any money, said Basab Talukdar, the deputy commissioner (security control) and foreigners regional registration officer.         
	Mooney underwent three weeks of psychiatric treatment in a Baruipur clinic from August 16. He was discharged after he said his visa was about to expire and he needed to leave, said Pushpal De Sarkar, the psychiatrist who treated him.         
	The teacher told officials that he was staying on pavements. There were self-inflicted cuts and burns on his body. When Mooney called up his embassy to ask for money, he was advised to contact local immigration authorities.        
	Jahau claimed he was a consultant at 13 restaurants across the globe. He visited India thrice after January 2006. He did not return after November 2007, said Talukdar.         
	Jahau claimed he was visiting his wife and daughter in Mizoram. I called my travel agent today to fly out of India but was told me that my visa had expired long back, he said.         
	Airport scare: An unattended bag near the Air India check-in counter in the international terminal building sparked a bomb scare in the airport on Monday evening. The bomb disposal squad cordoned off the area and opened the bag, only to find that it belonged to a Jet Airways employee.

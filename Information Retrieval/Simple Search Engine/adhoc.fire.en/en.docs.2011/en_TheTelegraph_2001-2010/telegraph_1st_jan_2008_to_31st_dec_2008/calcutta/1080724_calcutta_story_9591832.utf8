                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Unrest in Besu, too
          STAFF REPORTER                              
	Teachers of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) have refused to hand over mid-semester answer scripts to anyone other than the governor and demanded that the new academic session, delayed by over a fortnight, be started immediately.         
	The Besu Teachers Association, which organised a protest on Wednesday for the delay in announcing end-semester results and starting classes, said the dispute over mid-semester answer scripts was created by the authorities.        
	Not once in the 150 years that this institute has been in existence have mid-semester answer scripts been submitted to the vice-chancellor. These are internal assessments. The vice-chancellor is asking for these only to victimise the students, said Manas Hira, the secretary of the association.         
	He said the faculty had given the university office all the end-semester answer scripts and that the results should have been declared by now. The new academic session was supposed to start on July 7.        
	Mid-semester examinations were held when students were protesting against alleged atrocities by police and activists of the Students Federation of India. Most examinees submitted blank answer scripts in protest against those incidents. Many wrote about the turmoil on the campus and said they were unable to take the test in the right frame of mind.        
	Registrar Biman Bandopadhyay blamed the faculty for the delay in announcing the results. All answer scripts should be with the controller of exams in accordance with the Right to Information Act. Who is going to be the custodian of the answer papers if not the university administration?        
	The teachers said they were ready to hand over the scripts to Gopal Krishna Gandhi, who is the chancellor. The teachers association has already sought an appointment with the governor.         
	 If need be, we will submit the answer scripts to the chancellor on the understanding that they will be used for academic purposes and for upholding the law of the land.         
	Bandopadhyay said the teachers would be answerable if final-year students recruited by companies lost their jobs. Not only is the academic schedule slipping, many of the final-year students who have been recruited are unable to join work because they need to submit their marksheets. Their future is in jeopardy.        
	 The vice-chancellor was unavailable for comment.

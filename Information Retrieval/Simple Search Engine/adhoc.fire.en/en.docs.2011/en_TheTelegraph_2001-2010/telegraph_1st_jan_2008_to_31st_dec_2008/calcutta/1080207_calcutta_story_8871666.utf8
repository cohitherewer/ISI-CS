The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Extortion net on Delhi cop
                                                                                                            Extortion net on Delhi cop
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A constable from Delhi police and two youths were rounded up near Gol Park on Wednesday afternoon on charges of extortion.        
	Shaitan Singh, the cop, arrived in the city on Tuesday to execute an arrest warrant pending against Pallab Dutta, a resident of the Lake area. Dutta has been charged with a petty crime.        
	Singh went to Duttas house on Tuesday night without informing the local police, but had to return empty-handed as the accused was away. Before leaving the house, Singh collected Duttas cellphone number, said an officer of Lake police station.        
	Singh then reportedly contacted two youths from the Gol Park area and gave them Duttas phone number. The three started calling Dutta, asking him to cough up Rs 5,000 on Wednesday.         
	Dutta was first asked to hand over the cash at the Park Circus seven-point crossing, but the venue was later shifted to Dhakuria. Finally, Singh agreed to meet Dutta at a spot near Gol Park.        
	A few residents of the Gol Park area smelt a rat on seeing the trio talking on their cellphones. Suspecting that they were part of an extortion racket, one of the residents called Lake police station.        
	A team of plainclothesmen rushed to the spot and laid a trap, waiting for Duttas arrival. As soon as he turned up, the cops detained the trio.        
	Singh later claimed that he had asked Dutta to come with the money, as a bail bond of that amount was pending against him in Delhi. But this is no way to collect a bail bond, said an officer.

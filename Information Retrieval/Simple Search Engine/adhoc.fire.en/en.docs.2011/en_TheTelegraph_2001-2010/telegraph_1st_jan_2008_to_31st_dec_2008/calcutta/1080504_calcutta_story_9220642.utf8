										      Calcuttan of the week                        C.P. Ghosal            Pulak Goswami                           
	Name: Chandika Prasad Ghosal and Pulak Goswami         
	Claim to fame: The duo contributed essays to Reflections on Teaching: Today and Tomorrow published by Cambridge University Press. The book is endorsed by University of Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) for use by teachers pursuing the Cambridge International Certificate for Teachers and Trainers.         
	Ghosal, 48, wrote the essay, Identifying the Needs of Learners in Middle School: The Challenge for the Teacher, focussing on the need to encourage children rather than pressure them.        
	Goswami, 60, wrote Teaching Approaches to Involve the Learners underlining how to make lessons joyful and effective through interactive classroom sessions.         
	Prize project: The CIE had approached the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education for contributions to the book. The council, in turn, approached Ghosal, a senior English teacher at Oriental Seminary School, and Goswami, the former assistant headmaster of Jadavpur Vidyapith.         
	Ghosal describes himself as a very strict teacher who felt frustrated when students could not follow him. But attending a training session by an NGO changed his views.        
	Goswami wrote from his experience. The essay is not based on theory. I believe teachers should continuously upgrade themselves, he says.         
	Global reach: Cambridge University vice-chancellor Alison Richard presented the teachers with a copy of the book at the launch in Delhi.        
	I never thought I will meet the vice-chancellor of Cambridge. I wrote what I practised but didnt know it will be used by teachers across the globe, says Ghosal.        
	It feels good to have an international readership, adds Goswami.         
	Plans: Ghosal, who writes on a wide range of topics, will continue to do so.         
	I am very lethargic and take up the pen only after a lot of goading. But I wish to develop the English-speaking skills of Bengali-medium students, says Goswami.

                      Songs of spiritual love                    Perhaps the most poetic form of Indian classical music, thumri derives its content from the Krishna cult, expressing emotions of devotion, mystical love and viraha, the pain of separation. Although ragas and talas associated with it are closely aligned to folk music, thumri retains its classical compositional form and is a very important segment of Hindustani classical music tradition. Its lyrics, usually derived from the Radha-Krishna theme, is of primary importance. The words are strictly adhered to, with the singer attempting to interpret them with melodic improvisations. It is quite usual for a singer to deviate momentarily from the raga in which the composition is set, by using accidentals and evoking other ragas that might be suggested by the words, but the original raga is always returned to. With a view to help renew our understanding of the various styles of thumri and to revive thumri gayan, Sangeet Natak Akademi, New Delhi is hosting Thumri Rang, a four-day festival of thumri songs. To be inaugurated this evening, it will feature performances by eminent vocalists from all over the country. Participants: Sucharita Gupta, Shanti Hiranand and Chhanulal Mishra (today); Purnima Choudhuri, Jagdish Prasad and Rita Ganguli (tomorrow); Murad Bano, Subhra Guha and Ajoy Chakraborty (November 15); Savita Devi, Mashkoor Ali Khan and Girija Devi (November 16).

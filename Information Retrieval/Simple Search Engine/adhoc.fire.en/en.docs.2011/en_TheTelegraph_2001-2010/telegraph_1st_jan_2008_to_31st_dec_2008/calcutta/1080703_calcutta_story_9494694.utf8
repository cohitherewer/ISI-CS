          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) is set to introduce an integrated course leading to a doctoral degree in association with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.        
	The M.Tech-Ph.D course in astronomical instrumentation is the first full-fledged programme the university is launching in association with a central institution.         
	The degree will be awarded by both institutions.        
	The course will be taught in CU, while teachers from the Bangalore institute will come at regular intervals to deliver lectures. The students will also visit Bangalore to avail themselves of the facilities there.        
	The universitys faculty council on Wednesday unanimously approved the proposal to introduce the course. The councils decision will be placed before the syndicate, CUs highest decision-making body, for approval.        
	Students will benefit in a big way from this tie-up with a renowned institution like the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	The university has signed a memorandum of understanding with the institute.        
	Officials said the university has chosen astronomical instrumentation for the tie-up as job opportunities in the field are increasing.        
	The university is also planning to tie up with other renowned institutions in the country for launching similar integrated courses.        
	The syllabus and the rules and regulations of the astronomical instrumentation course will soon be framed by both institutions. Students willing to enrol for the programme will have to clear an all-India test.

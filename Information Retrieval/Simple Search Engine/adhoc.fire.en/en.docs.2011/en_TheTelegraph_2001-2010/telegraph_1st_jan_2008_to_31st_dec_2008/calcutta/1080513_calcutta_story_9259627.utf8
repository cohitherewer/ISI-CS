                      Many moods of Tagore                    The majestic and distinguished personality of Tagore has attracted numerous painters, sculptors and photographers the world over. Among the celebrated artists who have attempted to portray a reflection of this personality are the poets elder brother Jyotindranath Tagore, his nephews Gaganendranath and Abanindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Ganguly, Jamini Roy, Mukul Dey, Muirhead, William Rothenstein, Za Fein, Boris Gionglev and Atul Bose. In spite of their unquestionable achievement, the luminous personality of the great poet still remains elusive. Thou hast made me endless, the ongoing exhibition of portraits of Tagore in oil and pastel by Tapan Ray Choudhuri, presents a selection of 25 paintings depicting varying moods of the poet. The artist does not make any claim to characterise his subject through his paintings, which are based on a wide assembly of photographs of the poet. Rather, he humbly acknowledges that his works are intended to share the unmixed delight that he himself experienced while painting them.              lEvent: An exhibition of Tagores portraits by Tapan Ray Choudhuri lWhen: Till May 14; 3 pm - 8 pm lWhere: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road      Event: An exhibition of Tagore rsquo;s portraits by Tapan Ray Choudhuri When: Till May 14; 3 pm - 8 pm   Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55 Gariahat Road

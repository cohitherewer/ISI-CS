          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Three youths on a motorcycle, brandishing a revolver, snatched Rs 3.88 lakh from the cashier of a state power utility on Monday afternoon.        
	The trio disappeared before Pankaj Mitra, the cashier of the Andul Bazar branch of West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd, and a guard accompanying him could raise an alarm.        
	Police said Mitra and the guard, Shibshankar Maity, were on their way to the Mouribazar branch of UCO Bank to deposit Rs 3.88 lakh. Mitra was carrying the bag containing the money.        
	Around 3.30pm, when they were a few feet from the gate of the bank, the youths on the two-wheeler appeared on the scene. Holding Mitra at gunpoint, they snatched from him the cash-filled bag and fled towards Andul Rajbari Math, along National Highway 6.        
	They wound up the operation in less than a minute. Of the three, one got off the vehicle and snatched the money, pointing a revolver at my chest. The guard and I started shouting for help while the three were fleeing, but they were out of sight before others could react, said Mitra, who has been working with the utility for the past 10 years.        
	The power distribution company has lodged a complaint with Domjur police station. No one has been arrested.        
	All police stations in the district have been alerted. It seems the youths were tipped off by their local contacts that Mitra would be carrying the money. We are verifying the statements of Mitra and Maity, said Howrah police superintendent N.K. Singh.

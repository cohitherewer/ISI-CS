          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	An underage girls love for her husband and regard for her in-laws moved the high court on Monday to legalise her marriage. The division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice P.S. Banerjee allowed Renuka Nandi, who is 17 years and nine months old, to live with her husband.        
	Its a fact that the Hindu Marriage Act prohibits girls below 18 years from marrying. But the girl told us she loved her husband and held her in-laws in high esteem. She will turn 18 three months later. If we sent her to a home, her marital life may be affected. So, we are not passing any order on the marriage, the bench observed.        
	Renuka, a resident of Burdwan, went missing on August 12. Father Himangshu lodged a police compliant alleging that her daughter had been kidnapped by Anup Mondol, 26, who runs a sweet shop in the neighbourhood.        
	Anups three brothers were arrested. A Burdwan court denied them bail. Renuka then moved a bail plea in the high court on behalf of her brothers-in-law. On Monday, the court granted bail to the trio and allowed Renuka to live with her in-laws.

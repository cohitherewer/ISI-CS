                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pocket money funds scholarship
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A student being awarded a scholarship funded by one of the schools at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence                                  
	The belief that a small sacrifice can make a big difference in the lives of others has inspired schools to sponsor some scholarships that are awarded at The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence.        
	In many schools, teachers and principals donate a small part of their salary to fund the education of underprivileged children. The students do not sit idle either. They set aside a part of their lunch allowance to help those not as lucky as them through school.        
	I attended The Telegraph School Awards in 2005 and felt that if The Telegraph Education Foundation can provide for so many, then even a small school like ours could come forward and contribute, said Vandana Paul, the principal of La Martenelle High School.        
	Students put the money they would spend on a cold drink or a packet of chips into a charity box every month. Teachers, too, contribute a part of their salary every month to the fund. The money is handed over to The Telegraph Education Foundation to be awarded as scholarship.        
	There is no target amount for the students and teachers. It is not a compulsion. The students and teachers are eager to help underprivileged children, said Paul.        
	Chowringhee High School, which sponsors two scholarships at The Telegraph School Awards, believes in setting a goal.        
	All teachers contribute Rs 60 from their salary every month and the principal contributes Rs 120. If we fall short, student members of the Interact clubs pitch in from their funds, said Harshit Damani, the school administrator.        
	Ranihati High School in North Dinajpur and Bhavans Gangabaux Kanoria Vidyamandir are two other schools where teachers funded scholarships awarded at the Science City auditorium on August 31.        
	Frank Anthony Public School collected money for 40 scholarships through a carnival organised by the staff, students and parents, while the Class XII students of Loreto House sold handicraft to raise money for the Loreto House Scholarship by Students.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ill-prepared for trauma care
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ill-prepared for trauma care
										      OUR BUREAU       Hospitals                              
	A series of meetings over the past four months to boost disaster-preparedness and security of the five medical colleges has failed to change the situation on the ground.        
	A visit by Metro to the medical colleges following the terror attack in Mumbai revealed that the measures proposed at the meetings were followed more in breach than in compliance.        
	Plagued with inadequate treatment facilities, the hospitals are anything but prepared to rise up to the occasion if Calcutta came under a terror attack. Lax security is only adding to the woes.        
	Meetings were held earlier and are being held now to beef up security at the hospitals. Steps are being taken to ensure that victims get proper treatment, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra claimed on Thursday.        
	The meetings over the past few months decided to install closed-circuit TV cameras and bomb detection equipment in the hospitals, ban unauthorised parking on the premises and keep 50 beds and 100 units of blood ready for terror victims.        
	But sources in the health department pointed out that none of the hospitals has a trauma-care centre. The Union health ministry has sanctioned trauma care centres for SSKM Hospital and Medical College and Hospital.        
	We hope the centre will be commissioned by the next fiscal, said an official of Medical College and Hospital.        
	At NRS Medical College and Hospital, eight closed-circuit TV screens have been installed  and eight more would be put up soon  but none is operational yet.        
	At SSKM Hospital, five cameras have been sanctioned but not one has been installed.        
	The hospitals claimed that only vehicles bearing monograms signed by proper authorities were allowed to park on the premises. But when Metro ran a check in the afternoon, many authorised vehicles parked on the premises of all hospitals. Also, the vehicles and visitors were not being scanned.        
	It is not possible to man all vehicles entering a hospital with such skeletal manpower, said U. Dutta, the principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.         
	An official said around 40 guards were hired for each medical college, though the strength should be three times more.

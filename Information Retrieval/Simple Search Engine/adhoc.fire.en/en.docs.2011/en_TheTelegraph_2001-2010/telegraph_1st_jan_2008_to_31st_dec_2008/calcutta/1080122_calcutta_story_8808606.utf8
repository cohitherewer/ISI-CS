     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	An Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) employee lost his left leg in a mishap on the airport tarmac on Monday.
    
	A pushback vehicle (which propels planes out of the parking bay) crushed 55-year-old Ajit Karmakars leg after being hit from behind by a Deccan airline tractor in the apron area around 11.45am. The driver of the tractor was arrested. 
    
	Karmakar, a helper in IOCs aircraft refuelling vehicle, was standing with his colleague Badal Kumar Pal near parking bay number 26 to fill up the fuel tank of a SpiceJet plane. 
    
	A two-member team is generally deployed for fuelling planes. Karmakar and Pal were waiting for the aircraft to position itself, said a spokesperson for IOC, where Karmakar has been working for 25 years.
    
	The tractor, carrying registered luggage, hit the pushback vehicle, which rammed into Karmakar. Pal managed to jump out of the vehicles path.
    
	A medical team of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) attended to the Birati resident. He was bleeding profusely and his left leg had almost been severed below the knee, said a member of the team.
    
	Karmakar was provided emergency treatment in the medical room of the airport but the bleeding did not stop. He was taken to Charnock Hospital, off VIP Road. The doctors referred him to Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.
    
	Orthopaedic surgeon Buddhadeb Chatterjee amputated the leg in an hour-long surgery. We consulted a reconstructive surgeon, but there was no way the leg could be saved. We had to amputate the leg below the knee.
    
	He added: If we didnt perform the surgery, the patient could have died of gangrene.
    
	Karmakar was shifted to the intensive care unit of the hospital after the surgery. His condition was stable. 
    
	The driver of the tractor, Ritish Majumdar, was detained at the airport police station and later arrested. He was the only one responsible for the accident, said a police officer. 
    
	Airport officials said they could not recollect a similar incident on the tarmac.

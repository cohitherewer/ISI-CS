                      Colours of life                    Art is an endless journey of creativity and thought-process. It brings forth the emotions aroused in the mind of the creator, reflecting his responses to his environment. Autumn Mystique, the ongoing group show, features works that capture slices of life in all its myriad colours and moods. It showcases paintings by nine artists who work in diverse styles and scales. Focusing in some way or other on the relationship of man with nature, each painting bears the distinguishing mark of its creator. Whereas Nabendu Roy shows the disillusionment of todays youth, Vani Chawlas work celebrates the beauty of nature.

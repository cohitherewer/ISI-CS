          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 42-year-old unidentified cyclist was crushed under the wheels of a speeding private bus at Thanthania, in central Calcutta, on Monday afternoon.        
	Police said the victim was taken to Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead.        
	An officer of Jorasanko police station said the accident took place at the Bechu Chatterjee Street-Bidhan Sarani crossing. The private bus hit the mans cycle from behind.         
	The bus was travelling fast and the driver did not apply the brakes in time. It was a case of rash and negligent driving, the officer said.        
	A large crowd gathered on the spot and informed a traffic sergeant posted nearby. Bleeding profusely, the man was taken to hospital in a taxi.         
	The driver and the two conductors fled, another officer said. A mob tried to ransack the bus but a police contingent arrived and brought the situation under control.         
	We have registered an FIR against the driver and contacted the motor vehicles department for the bus owners details, the officer said.         
	The man would have been alive had the driver slammed the brakes in time, said Ramesh Kumar, a local resident.         
	Residents alleged that the absence of traffic police on the busy stretch had resulted in accidents in the past.        
	We sent many letters to Lalbazar, but nothing has changed. The absence of traffic cops encourage the drivers, added Kumar.

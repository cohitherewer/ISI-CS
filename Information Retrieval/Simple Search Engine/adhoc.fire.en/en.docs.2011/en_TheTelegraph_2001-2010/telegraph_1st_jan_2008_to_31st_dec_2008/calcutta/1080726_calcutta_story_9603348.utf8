                      Off the beaten tracks                    With its origins in African-American communities of the United States, blues music emerged out of work songs, chants and rhymed simple narrative ballads. It influenced later American and Western popular music, becoming the roots of jazz and rhythm and blues. Lovers of blues and jazz music in the city have reason to celebrate with Anjum (picture right) and Los Amigos presenting Offbeat - Volume One, an evening of songs by celebrated singers like Billie Holiday (Stormy Blues, My Man, Strange Fruit), Karrin Allyson (I Found My Turnaround, Yeh Yeh, This Is Your Life), Diane Schuur (Funny That I Still Love You), Cassandra Wilson and Diana Krall, among others. Offbeat in both treatment, style and choice of material, the idea behind the performance is to create an intimate music situation for the audience. Featuring tracks rarely heard in city music concerts, it seeks to generate a dynamic and vibrant music ambience, in which performers and listeners bond in a unique relationship. Participants: Anjum (vocals), Monojit Datta (percussion), Willy Walters (bass), Pradyumna Manot (keyboards) and Surajit Mitra (violin).

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Hospital administrators are in great demand in the city and colleges are rolling out courses to plug the gap.         
	Thanks to rapid corporatisation and focus on quality services, more and more hospitals are breaking away from the traditional system of training administrators on the job and are looking for applicants with the right qualifications.        
	Hospitals are run differently now. We can no longer afford to employ graduates and train them on the job. We have to employ trained professionals to deliver quality services, said Rupali Basu, the CEO of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.        
	Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM) has launched a two-year diploma in hospital management to keep up with the demand. West Bengal University of Technology offers a two-year course in hospital management.        
	The demand for students with hospital management degree has gone up with the opening of private hospitals in the city. Hence, we introduced a masters degree in hospital management in addition to a bachelors programme, said Santanu Ray, the director of NSHM.        
	With increasing segmentation of work within the new private hospitals, the authorities prefer those with degrees in hospital management over those with general management degrees.        
	According to Kamal Dutta, the chairman and managing director of Ruby General Hospital, the increasing demand for quality services from patients is responsible for the rise in demand for qualified people.        
	Proper management has become a key instrument in delivering better services, he added.        
	Front office management in hospital is different from that in hotels, stressed Ray.         
	A fresh hospital management graduate can expect an annual salary between Rs 1.5 lakh and 3 lakh.        
	The demand for the courses among the students is also picking up. More and more people from non-medical backgrounds are signing up for the courses.        
	Non-medical students are more interested in hospital management than those who have studied medicine, said Ray.

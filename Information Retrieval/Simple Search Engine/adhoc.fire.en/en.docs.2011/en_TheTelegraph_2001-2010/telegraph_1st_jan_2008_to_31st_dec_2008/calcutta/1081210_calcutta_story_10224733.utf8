The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | State buses exempt from Citu strike
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             State buses exempt from Citu strike
          OUR BUREAU              OFF            ON                                
	Private buses and minibuses will be off the road on Wednesday because of a Citu strike to protest stringent action against bus drivers involved in fatal mishaps.        
	State buses will not join the one-day strike, said Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh.        
	About 9,000 private buses and 2,500 minibuses ply in the city.        
	The strike call followed the arrest of several private and minibus drivers under the non-bailable charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Earlier, drivers involved in mishaps used to be charged with negligent and rash driving.         
	Mounting death toll in mishaps involving buses has prompted the governments decision to prosecute drivers under the sterner charge. According to the government, the charge of negligent and rash driving, a bailable offence, had failed to act as a deterrent.         
	Drivers alone are not responsible for mishaps; passengers and pedestrians lack traffic rule awareness. Bad road condition is one of the major reasons for fatal mishaps. So why should drivers be accused of culpable homicide and denied bail? asked Subhas Mukherjee, the leader of the Citu-affiliated West Bengal Road Transport Workers Federation.         
	At Writers Buildings, state home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said on Tuesday that the state and city police would try to ensure that passengers travelling in state buses were not harassed or assaulted by supporters of the strike.        
	Commuters will be able to use state transport to reach office or return home. Police have been instructed properly in this regard, added Chakrabarti.        
	Swarna Kamal Saha, the president of Bengal Bus Syndicate, welcomed the strike. The strike is justified. However, the Citu did not consult the bus-owners before calling the strike. If they had, we could have taken up the issue with the transport department. Drivers cannot be blamed for all mishaps.        
	Abasesh Daw, the general secretary of Minibus Co-ordination Committee also supported the strike: There may be lapses on the part of some drivers but there should not be a blanket charge applicable for all drivers involved in fatal accidents. The circumstances of an accident should be considered.         
	The home secretary said the transport department had not been approached by the bus operators association in this connection.

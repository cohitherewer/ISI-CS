          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                        
	Jose Ramirez Barretos hopes of an early return to Brazil were dashed on Wednesday.        
	The high court during the day stayed a Barasat sessions court order asking the Customs to return the Brazilian footballers passport so he could leave for home. The court had asked the Mohun Bagan star to come back by May 25.        
	The Customs authorities had seized the passport after Barretos arrest on March 20, moments before he was to board a flight for Sao Paolo. He has been charged with carrying foreign exchange in excess of what is allowed.        
	The Barasat additional chief judicial magistrate had granted him bail the same day but allowed the Customs to keep his passport. On April 7, the sessions judge asked the Customs to hand over the passport to Barreto.        
	The Customs authorities appealed against the order in the high court.        
	Moving the appeal before Justice Asim Roy, Customs counsel Biswaranjan Ghosal said Barreto had declined to name the two men from whom he had procured the foreign exchange.        
	Its crucial for my clients to know the names. So, they want to keep the passport till the probe is over, the lawyer said. Besides, Barreto, who is in India on a tourist visa, may never return to the country, he added.        
	Appearing for the footballer, lawyer Joymalya Bagchi argued: Barreto has committed to return by May 21.        
	Justice Roy then asked the lawyers of both sides whether the Brazilian consulate is ready to give an undertaking that Barreto would return to India in time.        
	The hearing will resume on Thursday.

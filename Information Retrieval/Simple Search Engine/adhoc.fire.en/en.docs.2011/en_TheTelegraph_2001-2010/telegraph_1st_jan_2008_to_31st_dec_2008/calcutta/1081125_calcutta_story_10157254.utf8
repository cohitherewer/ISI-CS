                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Alert prompts security beef-up at Assembly
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Safety first: The Assembly building                                  
	Security at the Assembly has been beefed up for the winter session that began on Monday, following police reports about possible terror attacks between November 22 and 30.        
	Security has been beefed up in the House following a tip- off from police about a possible terror strike. We cannot ignore the threat perspective in the wake of terrorist strikes across the country, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said on Monday.        
	Adjourning the House for the day after brief obituary references, Halim held a meeting with finance minister Asim Dasgupta for increasing the annual budget allocation for the Assembly.        
	Our present annual budget allocation is only Rs 30 crore. We have asked the government to increase the allocation as we need to overhaul security, Halim added.        
	To boost security, the authorities have decided to erect a 2-ft-high barbed wire fence on the 7-ft iron grille that encircles the Assembly complex spread across 11 acres.        
	More than a dozen closed-circuit television cameras will be installed at strategic points on the premises.        
	Officials said of the five gates at the Assembly, only two would remain open.        
	All 52 members of the Assemblys security staff, including four women, are undergoing a training in handling untoward incidents during the session.         
	Fifty plainclothesmen will be deployed to assist the Assembly security staff.

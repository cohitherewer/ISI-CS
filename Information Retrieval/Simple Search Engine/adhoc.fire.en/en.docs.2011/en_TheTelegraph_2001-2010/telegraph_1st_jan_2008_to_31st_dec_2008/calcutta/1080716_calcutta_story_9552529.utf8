                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Panels to assess tax, land pleas
          A STAFF REPORTER                          A filled-up pond on the Bypass. A Telegraph picture                                   
	The civic authorities have constituted two committees to review prayers for property tax exemption and change of character of reclaimed land.         
	Former chief secretary Tarun Datta has been appointed chairman of the committee that will review requests for change of character of land described as jala or doba (tank) in old land record documents.        
	Representatives of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority, environment department and the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority make up the panel. It will review cases individually and make recommendations to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).        
	The other committee  to review prayers for exemption of property tax under section 172 of CMC Act, 1980  will be headed by retired IAS officer Hirak Ghosh. The other members of the committee are Amalendu Ghosh, also a retired IAS officer, and civic bodys chief manager (revenue) Aniruddha Mukherjee.         
	We are introducing third-party ombudsmen in civic administration to offer transparency in services, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	Thousands of Calcuttans appeal to the civic body every year to treat their plots as land though they may be described as tanks in several-decades-old land records. If the civic body does not recognise such plots as land, the owners will not get loans to build houses. Their building plan will also not be sanctioned.         
	Middle and lower middle-class people have been hit the hardest. The CMC cannot relax the rules for them fearing allegations of high-handedness. However, there is no reason to accept a plot that was a tank even 10 years ago as land, said mayoral council member (building) Dipankar De.         
	There is hardly any vacant plot in Calcutta that was never a water body, he added.        
	Problems concerning character of land have multiplied after Behala, Jadavpur and Garden Reach became a part of the CMC. Rapid urbanisation of the eastern fringes also had a role to play.        
	Civic authorities also face problems in granting prayers for exemption of property tax by educational institutions because of lack of clarity in the CMC Act. Section 172 of the act empowers the civic body to offer property tax exemption to burial grounds, burning ghats places of worship, building with annual valuation less than Rs 300 and charitable organisations. But educational institutions are not on the list. The character of charitable institutions is not well-defined.        
	A childless widow surviving on a meagre pension, said the municipal commissioner, cannot be granted property tax exemption because the CMC act does not have any such provision.

	A middle-aged man riding his sons motorbike was crushed under the wheels of a bus that dashed him twice from behind before running him over near Rabindra Bharati University, on BT Road, on Wednesday morning.        
	Witnesses said the bus was racing another when it suddenly veered to the left to pick up passengers and felled Tulsi Dutta Banik. The 55-year-old saw mill owners skull was smashed along with the full-mask helmet he was wearing.         
	Dutta Banik had tried to get up the first time he was hit, but the bus remained in motion and hit him again. The tyres rolled over his thighs and head. He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, where a doctor confirmed his death.        
	The killer bus (WB04 C4056) was racing another on route number 230, said Bipul Das, who was in a breakdown van and saw the accident.        
	The bus driver sped away after the mishap, but some local residents stopped it near a Kali temple 200 metres away. The driver and the conductors alighted immediately and fled.        
	 We have started a case of rash and negligent driving, leading to death. We are looking for the driver, a police officer said.         
	There was confusion over the identity of the accident victim when personnel from Cossipore police station found someone elses driving licence on him. The licence turned out to be that of Dutta Baniks 26-year-old son Tanmoy. Neither his family nor the police would confirm whether the victim himself had a licence.        
	Dutta Baniks identity was ascertained after the police used the SIM of his cellphone in another handset  the victims phone was damaged in the accident  to call up one of the stored numbers. His brother Manab took the call.         
	Family members said Dutta Banik had left his East Canal Road home for his second house, under construction at Tobin Road, around 9am.        
	Dutta Banik was carrying a packet containing flowers to his Tobin Road address. He must have bought the flowers for some rituals in our other house. He was going there to oversee the roof casting, Manab said.        
	Traffic on BT Road was held up for 20 minutes after the incident with a mob trying to target the bus, as is the practice whenever a mishap occurs on chaos-ridden city roads.

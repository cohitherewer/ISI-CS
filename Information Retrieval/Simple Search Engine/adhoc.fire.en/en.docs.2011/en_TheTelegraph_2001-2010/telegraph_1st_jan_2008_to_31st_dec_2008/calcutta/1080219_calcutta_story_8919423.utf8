                                                                                                               Cop, checker face off 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The trouble between travelling ticket examiners (TTEs) and Railway Police Force (RPF) personnel at Howrah station continued on Monday even as railway authorities suspended a TTE and a constable for Sundays face-off.        
	K. Banerjee, a TTE, was detained by RPF jawans at Howrah station on Monday morning on the charge of taking bribe from passengers.        
	Banerjee was released around 4pm. He did not lodge a complaint, said a senior officer of Government Railway Police, Howrah.        
	An RPF officer alleged that Banerjee had stopped some passengers of a long-distance train and demanded money from them.        
	The passengers were carrying more luggage than is permitted. One of our jawans was standing there and he reported the incident to us. We asked the TTE to provide an explanation, said the officer.        
	The TTEs denied the charge. The ticket examiner had fined some passengers for travelling without tickets. The RPF personnel were just harassing our colleague, claimed a TTE.        
	On Sunday, TTE Sudip Singh had got into a fight with RPF constable Iqbal Ansari, over a ticketless passenger. Singh wanted to take the passenger to the TTE room, while Ansari wanted to take him to the RPF booth. Singh allegedly punched Ansari during the argument.         
	The TTE was suspended by Eastern Railways Howrah division on Monday.        
	R.S. Singh, an RPF constable, was also suspended, said railway officials.        
	According to the officials, R.S. Singh had led a group of about 20 jawans who ransacked the TTE chamber on platform No. 12 on Sunday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Apex court blow to Todi 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Apex court blow to Todi 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT IN NEW DELHI                              
	The Supreme Court has rejected Ashok Todis plea for a stay on the high court order that paved the way for his trial in the Rizwanur Rahman case.        
	Todi stands accused of criminally intimidating Rizwanur for secretly marrying daughter Priyanka, leading to his suicide on September 21 last year.         
	The hosiery magnates brother Pradip, relative Anil Saraogi, former detective department chief Ajoy Kumar, former assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty, sub-inspector Krishnendu Das and the Rahmans family friend, Pappu, are the other accused in the abetment to suicide case.        
	A special court took cognisance of the CBIs chargesheets in the case and issued summons to the seven accused after an eight-hour drama at Bankshal court on Monday. Todis lawyers filed a petition in the Supreme Court on the same day against the high courts directive to the investigating agency to file the chargesheets.        
	Senior counsel Rohinton Nariman contested the high courts order on several grounds.         
	He argued in the apex court on Thursday that the accused had not even received a copy of the purported FIR or the CBI report to be able to defend himself ably in the case.         
	But a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan dismissed the plea for a stay.         
	Lawyer Rana Mukherjee, who had filed Todis appeal in the apex court, insisted that his client had been unfairly denied copies of the high court order and CBI report. This is unheard of in a criminal case, he said.         
	He also contested the high courts decision to allow the CBI to investigate the case despite the police departments opposition to it. The state has to give its consent to a CBI probe, he said.        
	Mukherjee said the issue of whether the high court had the power to ask the CBI to probe a case without the state governments consent was yet to be resolved by the apex court.        
	Todi and the other accused have been asked to appear before the metropolitan magistrate handling the case on Saturday.         
	The seven accused will be tried under sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 503 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Simulator for target practice
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Simulator for target practice

	Calcutta police have bought a Rs 30-lakh simulator to sharpen the shooting skills of the personnel.        
	The simulator is slated to arrive at the police training school in Alipore from Hyderabad in a couple of weeks.         
	With the help of three-dimensional computer graphics, the gadget will duplicate conditions of a terrorist strike. Officers will be asked to shoot at the images of terrorists from special guns.        
	The training is expected to improve trigger control, shot placement and rapid-fire technique.        
	Using a simulator is the modern way of improving the shooting skills of the policemen. The best part is that shooting ranges and bullets are not required for the training, said the additional commissioner of police, Sivaji Ghosh.        
	During the 2002 American Center attack, the policemen guarding the building failed to fire a single bullet at their assailants. The Lalbazar top brass believes that training with the simulator will prevent a repeat of the incident as the reaction time of policemen will improve.        
	To ensure that the policemen get to practise actual shooting more often, the Lalbazar headquarters has urged the public works department to quickly complete the construction of the second shooting range at the Police Training School.        
	The authorities have also decided to augment the armoury by importing AK series and sniper rifles.         
	The Union government has offered Calcutta police Rs 1 crore to obtain the latest weapons.        
	Some of this money will be used to procure bullets. Most of the bullets we use for practice are outdated. It makes no sense to have sophisticated arms when the bullets are outdated, said a senior officer.        
	Just providing training is not enough. Even our service revolvers need to be replaced, said a senior officer of Amherst Street police station.

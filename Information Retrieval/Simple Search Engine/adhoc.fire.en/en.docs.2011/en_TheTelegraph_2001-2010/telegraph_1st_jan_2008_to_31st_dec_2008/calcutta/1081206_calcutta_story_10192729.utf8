The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Malaria fight lost in pipe dream
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Malaria fight lost in pipe dream
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcuttas go-slow municipal authorities could take decades to implement a two-in-one solution recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to water scarcity and vector-borne epidemics.         
	Scarcity of water leads households to store water, which creates a breeding ground for mosquitoes that spread diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya. So arranging for round-the-clock water supply means solving not one but two problems, an official said.        
	Based on WHOs suggestion, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay recently asked the water supply department to arrange for 24x7 water supply throughout the city at the earliest. But the department pointed out to him that arranging for round-the-clock supply in Calcutta without water meters would mean round-the-clock wastage of filtered water.        
	Calcuttans are prone to wasting water because the corporation doesnt charge a fee for filtered water. Most citizens do not turn off taps after use, leading to gallons of water being wasted.         
	So why not install meters and make citizens pay for the water they waste?        
	 The cost of installing meters for all household water connections will be in excess of Rs 150 crore. We have already shortlisted suppliers of water meters and the one who is selected will be asked to install them as well. If households are not charged for the meters, the CMC will have to spend Rs 5,000 for each connection, said Bandyopadhyay.        
	According to mayoral-council member (water supply) Mrinal Kanti Mondol, the supplier would be asked to install 15,000 meters in two years.         
	If that is the official timeframe, uninterrupted water supply will remain a pipe dream for decades to come. At the rate of 7,500 meters a year, it will take 33 years to cover 2.5 lakh households in the city. If the additional connections  which will come up in these 33 years  are taken into account, the timeline will stretch to 2050, an official said.         
	WHO had suggested 24-hour supply as a solution to the vector menace after a pilot project in parts of Hyderabad revealed that minimal water storage led to a significant decline in the incidence of water and vector-borne diseases in those areas.         
	Officials in the vector control wing of the CMC say that tenants, families living in undivided property, households of lower income groups and slum dwellers are in the habit of storing water.

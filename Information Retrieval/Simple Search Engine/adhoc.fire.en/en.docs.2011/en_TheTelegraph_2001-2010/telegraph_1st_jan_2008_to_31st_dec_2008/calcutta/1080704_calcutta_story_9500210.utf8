          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two youths have been arrested on charges of abducting and murdering Simantini Dey, who went missing on June 24 morning.        
	The duo  Sankar Mandal and Sonu Chowrasia  are among the six whom Simantinis father Narayan Chandra named in the FIR lodged with Shibpur police station. They have been remanded in police custody for five days.        
	Police suspect a love triangle behind the murder. The 23-year-old had an affair with Sonu, which she broke off a few days ago. She later started seeing Sankar. Less than a week before she went missing, Simantini had returned the gifts that Sonu had given her, said an officer.        
	Sonu and Sankar have been charged with abduction and murder. But we cant say for sure whether the death was a murder or suicide before going through the post-mortem report and other documents, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of Howrah police.        
	The sleuths are also examining the statement of the driver of the Down Ispat Express that someone had jumped in front of his train around 9.30pm, just before it passed Phuleswar station on June 24.         
	Simantinis body was found beside the tracks near the station 10 minutes later.        
	Police sources said Simantini, who worked in a private finance company, and Sonu went to Phuleswar on June 24 and spent a few hours in a guest house.        
	Talking to a few vendors of Phuleswar station and some commuters, the sleuths came to know that the two had a heated exchange on the platform in the evening.         
	A few minutes later, Sonu boarded a Howrah-bound local train.        
	A call went from Simantinis number to Mithun Mal, a Deulti resident, in the morning after she was found dead. The police said Mithuns brother-in-law, Palash Manna, who lives in Phuleswar, found the phone beside the tracks around 10am on June 25. It was Palash who called Mithun from Simantinis number, said police superintendent Singh.

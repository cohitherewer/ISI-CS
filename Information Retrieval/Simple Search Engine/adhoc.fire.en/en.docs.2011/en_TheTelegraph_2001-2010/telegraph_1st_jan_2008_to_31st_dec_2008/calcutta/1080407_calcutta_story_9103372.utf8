	A Bangladeshi national fell ill at Calcutta airport, in transit, and was granted special permission to be admitted to a private hospital on Sunday.        
	Nargis Begum, 27, was travelling on an Air India flight from London to Calcutta and then on to Dhaka. She comp-lained of a severe pain in her lower abdomen and also vomited while waiting in the transit lounge, officials said.         
	Her flight landed at Calcutta airport around 11.30am. She was waiting for Air Indias flight to Dhaka, which was scheduled to take off around 3pm. The airports medical officer examined her and advised immediate hospitalisation.         
	She did not have a visa to enter India, but was granted one on humanitarian grounds, an official said. She was rushed to AMRI Hospitals, Salt Lake.Preliminary investigations suggest she has a urinary tract infection, said A.S. Sarkar, the emergency medical officer at AMRI. Her condition is stable, he added.

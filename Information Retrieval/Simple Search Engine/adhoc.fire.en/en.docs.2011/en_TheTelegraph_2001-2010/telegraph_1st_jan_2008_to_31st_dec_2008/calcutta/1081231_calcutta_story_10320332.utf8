                      A mixed bag of art                    Featuring small and affordable artworks by young and upcoming artists of Calcutta, Santiniketan and Vietnam, the ongoing exhibition showcases a mixed collection including acrylics, charcoals, woodcuts and small sculptures. Among the participants, Avijit Mukherjee and Arunava Mondal (a painting by him appears here) use images of everyday life to express abstract concepts like the emergence of the spirit and the superficiality of outward appearances. Sambhu Saha uses a rainbow palette of colours applied in tiny strokes, using a knife, to recreate his impressions of nature, in a style and form reminiscent of the Impressionists. Nguyen Van Tuyen uses bright colours like orange and yellow, delicately applied on canvas and rice paper to produce local scenes of Danang, his home town in north Vietnam. Santiniketan-based artist S K Sahajahan symbolises the reality of human suffering and exploitation through his distortions of the human form. However, he also expresses his belief in equality and harmony through the visionary anguish portrayed in his works. Viraag Desai uses woodcuts and lithographs to express the surreal. Using anthropomorphisms, mainly with animals, he probes into the subconscious of his viewers. The exhibition also includes small animal sculptures in green stone by veteran sculptor Gopi Nath Roy, as well as a unique paper-cutting by Tanay Kumar Pal.

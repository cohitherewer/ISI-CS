The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Lay drains, mar walls
                                                                                                               Lay drains, mar walls
  - Mayor dashes off protest note to Delhi        A STAFF REPORTER                          A house in Behala that has developed a crack and has to be propped up with bamboos for the residents safety. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya has shot off a letter to the Centre, expressing concern over the sub-standard drainage revamp work in Behala, that has resulted in cracks in over 100 buildings.        
	The letter, dated March 11, is addressed to Santosh Mohan Dev, the Union minister for heavy industries and public enterprises.        
	The drainage work, under the Calcutta Environment Improvement Project, is being executed by Engineering Projects (India) Limited (EPIL), that functions under Devs ministry.        
	The mayors letter states that EPILs performance has been consistently poor, resulting in damage to houses on both sides of the roads.        
	EPIL, the letter says, has hired a sub-contractor without the civic bodys consent. The sub-contractor is handling all the work, with EPIL virtually abdicating (responsibility) everywhere.        
	Bhattacharyya has urged Devs intervention in repairing the damaged houses, as the EPIL authorities have turned a deaf ear to the repeated pleas of the civic body to do the needful.        
	On Friday, the mayor told Metro: Those handling the project are not taking proper steps to prevent damage to buildings. We will not tolerate such negligence, leading to harassment of the residents.        
	Metro had reported on January 2 the plight of the residents of more than 100 buildings in ward 129 that have developed cracks because of the drainage work.        
	My house was damaged after the project started in December and it can collapse any moment. The civic body and the project authorities are not offering us any help, said Sumit Basu, a resident of Mohendra Banerjee Road.        
	One of my rooms has collapsed. The authorities have backed out on the promise to repair the building, said Ranjit Dutta Ray, a retired teacher.         
	Project director Santanu Basu said the damaged buildings have been inspected but repairs cannot start till the work is over because of technical reasons.

                                                                                                               Towel used in Howrah murders found 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The handkerchief and towel allegedly used by Somasree Das to kill eight-year-old Prapti in her Jagacha home on February 26 have been recovered.        
	Police, however, are yet to recover the weapon with which Somasree allegedly stabbed the girl in the chest.         
	On Tuesday morning, the investigators took Somasree to Howrah police station from Howrah District Hospital, where she has been admitted since her arrest.         
	During interrogation, she told the officers that she had thrown the handkerchief and the towel into a well. The police took Somasree to the well, in her in-laws house, and recovered the articles.         
	Somasree was allegedly assisted by Samir Barik in the murder of Prapti and her mother Srabonti Ghosh. The bodies were found in a bedroom of their house.        
	Samir and Somasree told the police that they had an extramarital relation and they often met in Srabontis home when her husband was away at work. According to the two, they decided to kill Srabonti after she took some intimate photographs of them on her cellphone and started blackmailing them.

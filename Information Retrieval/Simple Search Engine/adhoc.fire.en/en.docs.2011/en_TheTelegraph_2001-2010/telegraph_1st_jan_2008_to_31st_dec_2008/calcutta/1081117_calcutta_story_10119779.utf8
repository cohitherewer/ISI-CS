	Trains to and from the city were disrupted following a 12-hour bandh called by the Jharkhand Disom Party, leaving thousands of passengers stranded.        
	As party supporters protesting the CPM-police attack on them blocked tracks on Eastern Railways Howrah-Burdwan chord and mainline sections, five long-distance trains from Howrah were cancelled and four short-terminated. Those bound for the city were stranded at various stations since Sunday morning.        
	In the chord line section, the tracks were blocked at Moshagram, Jougram and Gurap stations from 6.30am and at Rosulpur from 7.05am.        
	Railway officials said 15 long-distance trains were stranded at various stations. The Sealdah-bound Rajdhani Express arrived at Durgapur at 7.16am and remained stranded for more than five hours. The Howrah-bound Rajdhani got stuck at Asansol from 7.45am to 2pm and reached Howrah more than five hours behind schedule.        
	We are stuck at Asansol since 7.45am. No one knows when the train will start. We are planning to take a bus to Calcutta, said Ashish Chowdhury, a passenger on the Howrah-bound Rajdhani.        
	Virendra Urya, 45, said he had never been caught in a blockade before. Thankfully, I am alone, said the Howrah-based businessman.         
	Among the other trains that were stranded at various stations were the Kalka Mail, Chambal Express and the Varanasi-Howrah Vibhuti Express. The Malda-Howrah Intercity Express was short-terminated at Rampurhat. The Coalfield Express from Dhanbad was stopped at Mankad.        
	Several trains left Howrah and Sealdah hours behind schedule. The Howrah-Kalka Mail, scheduled to leave at 7.40pm, will depart at 1.30am on Monday. The Howrah-Amritsar Mail will leave at 7.40pm on Sunday, instead of 2am on Monday. The Down Steel Express and Down Gitanjali Express were delayed following a blockade at Ghatsila by Youth Congress supporters.

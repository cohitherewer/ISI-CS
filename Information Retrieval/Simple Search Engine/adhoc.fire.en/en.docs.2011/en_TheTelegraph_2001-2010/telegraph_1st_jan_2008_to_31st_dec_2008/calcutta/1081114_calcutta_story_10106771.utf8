          A STAFF REPORTER                          Tarakeswar Shaw                                  
	A teenager drowned and another is feared to have drowned while taking a dip in the Hooghly on Thursday as part of Kartick Purnima rituals.        
	Tarakeswar Shaw, an 18-year-old student of a reputable Hindi-medium school in Salkia, drowned at Belur ghat while performing rituals. The boy was fished out by a boatman within 10 minutes and rushed to a private hospital in Bally. A doctor declared him dead.        
	Police said Tarakeswar left his Liluah residence around 7am with his friend Dharmendra Singh, 17. While Dharmendra sat on a step of the ghat, Tarakeswar entered the water.        
	Suddenly, I saw Tarakeswar being swept away by the current. Since I cant swim, I started shouting for help. There were many people around but nobody tried to rescue him. Finally, a boatman dived in and fished out Tarakeswar, said Dharmendra.        
	Ashok Biswas, the boatman, said: I could not find the boy because the water was so murky. The current was also taking him away from me.        
	Tarakeswars 55-year-old father Sreeram, who runs a sweet shop at Liluah Kesto Bazar, said the teenager could not swim properly. I cant understand why he tried to take a dip.         
	Tarakeswar was the youngest of Sreerams two sons. Around 7.30am, 17-year-old Anand Singh, a resident of Garden Reach, went under water while bathing at Surinam ghat.         
	Officers of West Port police station suspect the boy, who worked in a garment shop, slipped on a ghat step, fell in the water and was swept away. People bathing nearby tried to save Anand but could not trace him under water.        
	Divers of river traffic police could not find the body till late on Thursday.

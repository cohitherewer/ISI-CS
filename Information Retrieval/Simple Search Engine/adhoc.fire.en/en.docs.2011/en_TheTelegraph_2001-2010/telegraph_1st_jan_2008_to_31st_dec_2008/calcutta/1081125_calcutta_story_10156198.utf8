                      Numbers game                    An annual event, the Vodafone Odeon theatre festival is one that city theatre lovers look forward to with much enthusiasm. As part of its ongoing eighth edition, Tin Can presents this evening a bilingual play, Onko. An experimental play built upon a structure of scattered, disjointed monologues, it explores concepts related to unity, liberty and personal identity, along with the obvious contradictions that arise among them when they co-exist. Fundamentally, it deals with the idea of numbers in our lives and the manner in which it shapes power, politics and mass psychology in any country, including ours. 15th August is a date on the calendar which Indians celebrate as Independence Day to mark that day, more that 60 years ago, when the country won its freedom from British rule. But, young people in modern India, living and thriving in a cosmopolitan society, cannot really understand the significance of this hard-won freedom. Brought up in a free country, they have never experienced anything but independence. Yet, the desire to be free remains constant, rather like a primal urge to break free of anything that restricts us or forces us to act in a particular way. Direction: Soumyak Kanti De Biswas.            Event: Onko, a play produced by Tin Can When: Today at 7 pm Where: Gyan Manch

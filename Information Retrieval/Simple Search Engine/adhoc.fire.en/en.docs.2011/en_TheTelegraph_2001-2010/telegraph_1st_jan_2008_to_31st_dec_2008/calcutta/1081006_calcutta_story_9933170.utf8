                      Hope and fulfilment                    Loneliness and insecurity are perhaps the largest evils of modern, urban life. An in-your-face play on the lives and dreams of common, middle-class people, Alokanandar Putrokanya explores the dichotomies and dilemmas we suffer in our everyday life and how we strive to escape from it. It focuses on the life of Alokananda, a childless lady past her prime. Her life is likened to a tree under whose cool shade many take shelter; her husband Rajaninath, a frivolous, single mother Debahuti and street urchin Lala. Even her brother Badal comes to her for solace. Perhaps, she herself seeks assurance from those under her adopted children Shuvo and Manashi. Unfortunately, no one is safe in a malicious world, where causing harm to others is considered mere entertainment. Shuvo brings home a dubious friend and Manashis letter brings news of her torture in her husbands home. Their mother is apprehensive of their fate; will they show resilience in the face of adversity or simply be swept away in its tide? In spite of everything, she is optimistic. She deliberates that darkness lingers even as dawn is about to break. Confident that better days lie in wait for her and her children, she renews stringing the garland of her unfulfilled dreams.

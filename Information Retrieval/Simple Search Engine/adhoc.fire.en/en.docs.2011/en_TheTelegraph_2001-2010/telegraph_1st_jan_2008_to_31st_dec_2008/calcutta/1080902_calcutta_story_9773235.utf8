The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Ladies only diktat flops
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ladies only diktat flops
  - Commuters blame Metro for failing to communicate          A STAFF REPORTER                          Look before you step in: A Metro Railway coach                                        
	Metro Railways move to reserve two compartments of each train for women fell flat on the first day, courtesy lack of publicity.        
	The first and last coaches of most trains on Monday had more males than females, despite the Ladies Only stickers that hung above the gates.        
	Starting Monday, the the first and last coaches of all trains will be reserved for women from 9am to 7pm. The decision has been taken keeping in mind the safety and convenience of female commuters, said a Metro Railway official.        
	But most commuters were unaware of the move and failed to notice the Ladies Only boards.        
	I didnt know that this compartment is reserved for women. There was no notice or announcement. Since nobody objected, I took a seat here, said Alok Basu, a trader from Sinthee heading for Esplanade.        
	The move even caught female commuters unawares. Most rushed to the facing rows in the middle of each compartment, which were earlier reserved for women.        
	Some of the intended beneficiaries were not impressed by the move. I fail to understand how this arrangement will be safer or more convenient for us, said Radhika Shaw, an executive with a private company. I take the Metro from Tollygunj to reach my Park Street office everyday. Though the coaches get crowded during peak hours, I never had any problem commuting. Moreover, there are no Metro Railway officials enforcing the system and asking the men to leave the compartments reserved for women. Im not surprised that the move flopped on the first day.        
	Sharbani Mitra, a schoolteacher, said: If the Metro authorities are so concerned about our safety, they should ensure that a policewoman patrols the coaches. Reserving compartments for women is not a solution.        
	Nandini Ghosh, a homemaker from Shyambazar, goes to pick up her nine-year-old daughter Jyotsna from school near Rabindra Sadan. I always board the first compartment with my daughter. Today, as on other days, it was crowded with men.        
	The new system, however, inconvenienced the aged and the handicapped.        
	Physically challenged Rathin Halder, 56, who commutes from Tollygunj to Chandni Chowk daily, boards the last compartment as it saves him the strenuous walk to the escalator. Now, I have to board the second or third compartment, he said.        
	Dyuti Sen, 52, a central government employee who often takes the Metro during late hours, said: After 7pm, there will be no reserved seats for women. That will be a problem for aged commuters like us.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Secondary runway ready
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Secondary runway ready
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The extended secondary runway at Calcutta airport was opened for flights on Monday.        
	The secondary runway has been extended by about 440 metres on the northern side, facing the mosque, which will enable bigger aircraft to land on and take off from this runway, an airport official said.        
	The turning pad at the edge of the secondary runway was ready by the end of July, and some landing equipment was installed in August, he added.        
	According to airport sources, a proposal had been sent to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) headquarters in Delhi in July, seeking permission to make the extended portion of the secondary runway operational by the first week of September. A few days back, the authorities of Calcutta airport received the AAIs green light and decided to open the secondary runway for operation from Monday.        
	After the extension, the secondary runway measures 2,840 metres in length. With flights landing on and taking off from the extended runway, the load on the primary runway will ease, resulting in smoother operation.        
	Until mid-August, the primary runway could not be closed for the mandatory 24 hours every month for repairs because of visibility and other problems on the secondary runway, an airport source said. But now that the extended secondary runway is complete, the authorities can concentrate on the maintenance of the primary runway.

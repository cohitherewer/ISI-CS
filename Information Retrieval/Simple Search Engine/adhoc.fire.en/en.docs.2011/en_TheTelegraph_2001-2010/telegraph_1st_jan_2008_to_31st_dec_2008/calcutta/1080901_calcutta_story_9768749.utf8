	A huge consignment of arms and ammunition was seized in Bishnupur, on the southern city fringes, following a series of raids that started on Saturday evening.         
	Five men have been arrested under the Arms Act. If found guilty, the five can be imprisoned up to 10 years.        
	Among the seized items are seven single barrel guns, eight pipe guns, 11 bullets and three 12 bore cartridges. Lathe and welding machines were also seized during the raids that continued till 4.30am on Sunday.        
	Acting on a tip-off, a team from Bishnupur police station arrested Prasanta Kha, 28, on Saturday evening, said Ajay Ranade, the superintendent of South 24-Parganas police. The resident of Kulerdari, in Bishnupur, was picked up from the nearby Nepalgunge Bazar.        
	Prasanta reportedly admitted to trading in firearms during interrogation. On the basis of information collected from him, a 13-member police team picked up Mohan Gyne, 35, who allegedly bought firearms from Kha.        
	Mohan Gyne was picked up from Noor Sikdar Chawk, under Bishnupur police station, said Ranade.        
	Kha and Gyne, both with criminal records, told the police about the involvement of Jain Nair, 50, a factory-owner in Bishnupur, and his sons, Biswajit and Sanjit, in the racket.        
	The lathe and welding machines and most of the seized ammunition were found in the Nairs factory. The machines were used to manufacture guns, said an officer.        
	We arrested Jain Nair and his two sons early on Sunday. There was no resistance from any of the five men arrested during the operation, said Ranade.         
	The police suspect the group has links with a bigger gang that buys arms and ammunition from them. We are trying to get information about the people who bought arms from the five. The arrests can lead us to a racket with links beyond the state, an officer said.

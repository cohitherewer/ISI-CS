The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Tech town lights out
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tech town lights out
  - Darkness on stretches of Rajarhat Road          OUR BUREAU                          DRIVE in the Dark: The showpiece zip-zap-zoom corridor, where streetlights dont shine after dark. Picture by Pabitra Das                                        
	When S.P. Mukherjee, the managing director of Databazaar  a Salt Lake-based BPO firm  decided to take an overseas client on a tour of Rajarhat a few days ago, he didnt know the road to the showpiece tech town in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal would be cloaked in darkness.         
	He had to cut short the trip, as not a single streetlight along the main arterial road in New Town was on.         
	I took my client to Rajarhat to show him around the place, but the entire stretch was darkWe had to return, Mukherjee told Metro.         
	The 11-km Rajarhat Expressway  connecting VIP Road and Sector V  was opened in May 2004 for quick travel between the tech hub and the airport. But it has mostly been a bumpy ride on what was supposed to be a zip-zap-zoom stretch.         
	The condition of the road has improved, but the stretch is now dark, said the CEO of an IT company.         
	The six-km stretch from Mahisbathan, near New Town bus stand, to Nababpur was in darkness on Tuesday evening with the streetlights not working. The leg from the Ambuja housing project site till Chinar More was dark, too.         
	Those stretches that were illuminated had some lampposts without the lights on.         
	This high-speed zone has witnessed eight accidents in the past six months, and cars passing through at night are easy prey to muggers.         
	We do not have enough personnel to man the entire stretch. The fact that the road has been mostly dark since last month has made it harder for us to maintain security, a senior official at Rajarhat police station said.         
	State government agencies have been playing pass-the-buck. We cannot do anything about the power cuts. It is the responsibility of the state electricity board, said Sumantro Chowdhury, the managing director of Hidco, the nodal agency for New Towns development.         
	Power secretary Sunil Mitra put the blame on the New Town Power Supply Company, which distributes electricity and maintains power infrastructure in New Town.         
	Officials of the power utility refused to accept there was a problem.

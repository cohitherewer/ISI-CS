The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | The blessing of a Barack 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The blessing of a Barack 
										      Made in Manhattan      In search of a moniker that passes the litmus test                                     
	Over the last two years of the US election campaign, I have often heard Americas President-elect Barack Obama (in picture) make fun at the unusualness of his name. Think about my name, he would say, how can a man with a name like Barack Obama be the front runner in this race? Barack meaning blessing, unheard in the US, is a common name in Africa, which was home to Obamas father. Of course, post-elections, more and more people in the US are naming their children Barack (and also Michelle after the next first lady).         
	Monikers introduce us, spell out our lineage, and its the way people remember us long after we have left the room or the world. Having an Indian name, or for the matter any foreign language name in America is a big challenge  something Barack Obama knows well. In a country where Iraq is pronounced I-raq (as in eye-raq), its not hard to imagine how even simple names are mispronounced and misspelt.         
	In a foreign land, names are subject to much discussions and pre-conditions, especially when relatives or friends are trying to name a new family member. Americans are sticklers for trying to get your name right, and will ask numerous times about the correct pronunciations.         
	But anything beginning or ending with vowels are inevitably subject to distortions for Americans tend to stress the first two syllables. Also, nicknames evolve from the given name  Daniel becomes Dan, Robert becomes Bob, so any name should in all fairness have the versatility to become a shorter, perkier nickname.        
	However, my name faced many challenges even before I came to this country. If I had a common and popular name, it would have been such as easy ride, I would think growing up. Instead, thanks to my fathers creativity, my sister and I were stuck with names that needed long-winded explanations regarding their Sanskrit origin and coinage. But over time the anguish over my given name has evolved into a sense of gratitude for it.         
	Over the years, the long clarification I offer has evolved into a rewarding exercise  one by which I get to lead the conversation when asked the meaning of my name  whether it is at a job interview or when speaking to a top diplomat.         
	But it is more useful than just a means of breaking the ice or having control over the conversation  having a name that is uncommon and unique provides an opportunity to provide a glimpse of my world, my family and heritage. Through my name I get to elaborate about my country of origin as I explain the Sanskrit meaning of my name, about my father who, in spite of being a bureaucrat, enjoyed his forays into literature and creativity and is a virtual encyclopedia of original names, or my sister who has as uncommon a name like mine.        
	So when it came to naming my own new family member recently, I looked around for an original name, but faced the same dilemmas as many of my fellow Indians. Each moniker went through multiple litmus tests  will it fit into Indian and American milieus, was it foolproof from American mispronunciations, can it withhold the inevitable teasing by school bullies, and, of course, can it be shortened to a cheery nickname?        
	But perhaps I was over-thinking the problem. When a man named Barack Obama can become the president of United States, perhaps anything is possible. Perhaps an uncommon Indian name may even one day become part of the norm, fitting seamlessly into American life.       Oisika Chakrabarty     (The writer, a Calcuttan, works at the UN in Manhattan.

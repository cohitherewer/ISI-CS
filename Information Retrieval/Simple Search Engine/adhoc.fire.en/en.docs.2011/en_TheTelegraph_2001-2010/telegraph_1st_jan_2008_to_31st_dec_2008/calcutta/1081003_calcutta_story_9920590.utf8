                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Beef-up after serial blasts
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The serial blasts in Agartala have turned the police scanner on not just Puja pandals but also a host of city hotels and guest houses where the guests are mostly from Bangladesh and the Northeast.        
	The special branch of the city police has been asked to check the records of these hospitality addresses  most of them in central Calcutta  and note down the addresses and other details of the guests.        
	The sleuths will also meet the owners and brief them about the steps to be taken to strengthen the security blanket.        
	Scanning information about guests in the hotels and guest houses is a key component of the revamped security drill. The move is in sync with the other steps we are taking to beef up security across the city, said a special branch officer.        
	A group of officers has also been assigned to keep a tab on those who make frequent long-distance calls from PCOs in some city pockets.        
	The officers-in-charge of the police stations will ask puja organisers to report unmanned vehicles and articles found in or around the pandals.        
	We will keep in touch with the organisers to check whether they are implementing the guidelines, said a senior officer at Lalbazar.        
	A select group of volunteers from some of the major pujas will be trained in operating security gadgets, such as hand-held and door-frame metal detectors.        
	Officers have also been asked to train the organisers of a few pujas in recording the feed captured by closed-circuit television cameras.         
	We would like to find out details of crowd management at these pujas, said a senior officer.        
	A club in north Calcutta has been asked to create windows in a long dark tunnel that has been built as part of the pandal. The windows are a must to tackle an emergency, the officer added.        
	Insiders claimed that with two-wheelers emerging as the vehicle of choice for the agents of terror, sleuths have been directed to be monitor motorcycles parked near pandals for a long time.         
	The officers also announced that security in the Metro Railway and in parking lots has been tightened.        
	There is no need to panic. We are doing whatever is required to face any untoward incident, said police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.

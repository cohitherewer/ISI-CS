                      The art of harmony in life                    We view the world through the objects we see around us. It is the concrete form that defines our perceptions. But there exists a parallel or perhaps even a far greater abstract world, that has no form and is ensconced in our very psyche. It is the world revealed through our thoughts, dreams, fantasies and illusions. The mixture of such reality and profound abstruseness is found on the canvases of Ananya Banerjee. The melange of paints, the riot of colours and the strokes of her brush provide a perfect blend of abstraction, in the midst of reality and definiteness. Among the kaleidoscope of various shades and hues, forms emerge with very different interpretive possibilities. Banerjees canvases express the multiple emotions of our daily lives: joy and sorrow, ecstasy and agony. Her works create an extraordinary mixture of forms and fantasies, conveying elements of magic realism, surrealism, or simply, a harmony of hues.                  Event: Exhibition of paintings by Ananya Banerjee When: Till today; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Chitrakoot Art Gallery, 55, Gariahat Road

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Ashok Todi                                  
	A Supreme Court division bench on Monday restrained a city CBI court from starting trial in the Rizwanur Rahman case till a petition by his father-in-law Ashok Todi against a high court single-bench order is disposed. The order had allowed the investigation agency to file a chargesheet against Todi.        
	The apex court bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, asked the Calcutta High Court division bench to dispose of the appeals filed by Todi at the earliest.        
	According to lawyers representing the Rahmans, the Supreme Court order would not come in the way of the CBI starting initial proceedings of the trial, like issuing summons to Todi and six others who had allegedly forced Rizwanur to commit suicide.        
	The trial of a case commences after initial proceedings are completed and charges are framed against the accused, said Kalyan Banerjee, a lawyer representing the family.         
	In his petition in the Supreme Court, Todi sought a stay on the trial proceedings and claimed that the CBI had no authority to file a chargesheet against him till the high court division bench had disposed of his appeal.         
	According to him, Mondays order will stop the CBI from framing charges against the seven accused.         
	Also on Monday, a vacation division bench of Calcutta High Court allowed a petition by the Rahmans, which challenged the legality of the bails granted to the three accused police officers by the chief metropolitan magistrates court.        
	On October 1, the court had granted bails to former deputy commissioner (detective department) Ajoy Kumar, assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das.         
	The officers, Todi, his brother Pradip and relative Anil Sarogi had filed separate appeals before the high court division bench to challenge Justice Dipankar Duttas order that had allowed the CBI to file chargesheets against them and proceed with the trial.

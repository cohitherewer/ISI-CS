     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Masseuse Dipali Maity, accused of killing Shukla Dey in her Dhakuria flat, wants to make a confessional statement before the magistrate.
    
	She expressed the wish after being produced in the additional chief judicial magistrates court in Alipore on Thursday. 
    
	Dipali, 24, was arrested on Wednesday on charges of murdering Shukla by hitting her with a nutcracker and a grinding stone. 
    
	Shuklas husband Aloke, a bank official, and their daughter Chaiti were not at home when she was killed.
    
	Forensic and finger-print experts went to the flat on Thursday and collected a few items for tests. The nutcracker and the grinding stone, which were seized on Wednesday, have also been sent for tests.
    
	We are probing all angles. The relatives and neighbours of Shukla will be questioned, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Pravin Kumar.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The civic body has been removing unlicensed publicity materials displayed by puja committees in and around pandals.        
	Since early last week, civic workers, with the help of Green Police, have been dismantling and carrying away banners, festoons, gates and display boards sponsored by companies for north and south Calcutta pujas.        
	The drive, the first of its kind by the civic body, is being undertaken at night to minimise resistance by puja organisers and avoid traffic disruption.        
	On Saturday and Sunday nights, more than seven truckloads of publicity materials were seized in Gariahat, Rashbehari, Jadavpur, Bhowanipore, Chetla and other parts of south Calcutta. Licence fees of Rs 20 lakh were collected.        
	Four truckloads of publicity materials were seized earlier last week and released after puja committees shelled out licence fees of about Rs 10 lakh. The drive was carried out in parts of Chittaranjan Avenue, Jamunalal Bajaj Street, Raja Katra, Hatibagan and Shyambazar. More raids are on the cards.        
	Under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) Act, 1980, a fee must be paid to the civic body for displaying commercial publicity materials. The fee is payable even if the materials are displayed on private premises.        
	A licence is generally issued for a month at the rate of Rs 15 per square foot. Puja banners of organisers are exempt from the fee, provided they are not sponsored by companies.        
	The civic body undertook the drive this year as no company bought the rights to realise unpaid licence fees. Last year, an agency paid the CMC Rs 49 lakh to collect licence fees on Puja publicity materials.        
	We expect to earn licence fees of about Rs 1 crore on Puja publicity material this year, said civic advertisement manager Debashis Sen.        
	According to a civic body estimate, over 20,00,000 sq ft of publicity materials are displayed in and around the 1,100 community pujas in the city. Licence fees are paid by about 20 per cent of the pujas.        
	We plan to collect the fees from at least half the pujas this year, added Sen.

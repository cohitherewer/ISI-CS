          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Bapan Santras father returned home drunk every night and beat up his mother. Unable to take it any longer, the tormented youth killed his father on Wednesday night.        
	The 22-year-old, a resident of Lakshmanpur Santrapara, in Domjur, has been arrested and remanded in judicial custody.         
	He has admitted to the crime, said an officer.        
	The police said Bapans father, Dilip Santra, was a van-puller. A drunk Dilip would beat up wife Rekha every night. Around 10.30pm on Wednesday, Bapan had a fight with Dilip over his habits. Bapan lost his cool and hit his father on the head with a chopper. The 50-year-old died on the spot, said Milan Kanta Das, the additional superintendent of police.        
	Dowry death: In Domjurs Baluhati Paschimpara, Swapan Bag, 38, killed wife Totan after a spat over dowry. The police said Swapan, who worked in a jewellery shop, frequently assaulted his wife for dowry. Around 1am on Thursday, he strangled Totan following an altercation.

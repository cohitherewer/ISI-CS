                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jail clash claims second life
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                 The Metro report on Azharuddins death      
	Last Tuesdays clash of inmates and warders in Presidency jail has claimed the life of a second undertrial.        
	Mohammed Jahangir, 31, who was injured when warders launched a baton-charge to control two groups of warring prisoners, died at SSKM Hospital early on Sunday.        
	While the jail authorities claimed that Jahangir had been suffering from various ailments, including tuberculosis, SSKM sources pointed out that the undertrial facing dacoity charges had been brought in with multiple injuries.        
	Jahangir was admitted in a critical condition on Saturday night. He had high fever and injury marks all over his body, said a hospital official. A post-mortem is being done as the patients relatives have lodged a complaint alleging that he had been beaten up in jail. Internal injuries might have led to the death.        
	Undertrial Mohammad Azharuddin, who suffered head injures during the clash, had died in the jail hospital on Tuesday night. His family had lodged a complaint with Hastings police station and the state human rights commission, accusing the jail warders of killing him.        
	Jail superintendent Khairul Alam, facing a murder charge for Azharuddins death, said Jahangir had sustained minor injuries during the clash.        
	He was suffering from some ailments and had to be admitted to MR Bangur Hospital twice, in February and March. It seems he was suffering from tuberculosis. An autopsy is being done to ascertain the cause of the death, said Alam.        
	A jail official, however, said Jahangir had suffered blows to the stomach and mouth when warders attacked the inmates to restore order in the jail last Tuesday. He was treated in the jail hospital.        
	On Friday, he suddenly started bleeding from the upper lip and was taken to MR Bangur Hospital. He was released after a couple of hours.        
	Jahangir complained of severe pain in the chest and stomach on Saturday evening and was taken to the jail hospital. As his condition worsened, doctors asked the authorities to shift him to SSKM Hospital, said an official.        
	Jahangir was taken to SSKM around 10.30pm. He died within hours.

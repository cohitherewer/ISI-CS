 - 4-DAY TRAINING SESSION
     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                  
	The state government will organise a four-day training session for teachers of select schools that have been allowed to open English-medium sections.
    
	The training, starting February 7, aims to make the teachers aware of the new methods of teaching English and other subjects through the language.
    
	More than 80 teachers from the state-controlled institutions that will open English-medium sections  including Hindu School, Hare School, Bidhannagar Government School, Bethune School, Sakhawat Memorial School and Ballygunge Government School  will attend the programme.
    
	The demand for learning English is increasing among parents, particularly in the urban areas. We want to ensure there are a good numbers of teachers who can teach English and other subjects in that medium, said Sulapani Bhattacharya, the president of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education.
    
	The training session is part of an overall drive of the government to boost the proficiency of the teachers of state-aided and controlled schools in English. The government has taken the right move that will finally benefit students, said Dipak Das, the general secretary of the West Bengal Government School Teachers Association, which is organising the session jointly with the government.

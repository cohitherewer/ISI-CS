The trains were running on diverted routes since last month as the tracks on the Kharagpur-Bhadrak section were damaged in flood.    A Thai Airways flight from Bangkok to Dhaka was diverted to Calcutta on Thursday morning as the runway at Dhaka airport was blocked by a Biman Bangladesh aircraft with a flat tyre.

Pronab Mukherjee, a store superintendent of a central government office on the Indian Museum campus, was arrested by officials of the CBIs anti-corruption wing on Thursday morning after they caught him taking a bribe of Rs 1,000 from a supplier of computer peripherals.    Calcutta University on Thursday opened a coaching centre for SC, ST, OBC and other minority students.

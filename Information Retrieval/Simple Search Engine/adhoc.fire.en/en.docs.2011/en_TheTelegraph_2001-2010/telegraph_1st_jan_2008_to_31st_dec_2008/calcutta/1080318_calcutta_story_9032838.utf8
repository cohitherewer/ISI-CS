          Autism expert Krishna Roy charts a roadmap for inclusion of special kids                          A special educator gives individual attention to a child              
	Typically developed (normal) children are capable of fulfilling their needs. A child needs to develop some skills and follow certain rules to become self-reliant and cope with social demands. He develops reciprocal social skills as he looks into your eyes, smiles back when you smile, runs into your arms or waves at you. These are signs of a normal child. If a child shows the absence of these skills and reflexes, it may be an indication that he needs extra help.         
	If special children went to a mainstream school it would be difficult for a layman to single some of them out. But mainstream schools are not equipped to handle such kids. They cannot survive without adult supervision.         
	Where will they go? What will their parents do? Who will lend them a helping hand after their parents are gone? Who will help them handle money? Is it their relatives, their communities or the state?         
	An intervention programme is necessary to help these children. Not all children with special needs benefit from inclusion. Children with severely impaired cognitive, communication and social abilities need special schools.         
	Special schools working side by side with mainstream schools on the same premises are the need of the hour. This would save special kids from being marked out.         
	Successful inclusion can be possible only if mainstream teachers and special educators receive the support of the school authorities.         
	A teacher needs to be a visionary with pragmatic views to make inclusion a possibility. This needs dynamism. The old saying If theres a will theres a way holds true for inclusion as well.         
	Make the school environment barrier-free and accessible so that the special children can move around freely. This will help them gain confidence.         
	Remember that such children develop at their own pace. A collaborative approach between home and school is essential. We need trained special educators to see that a students individual education plan is successfully implemented. A mainstream teacher can also become a successful facilitator if she/he is sensitive.         
	A class teacher with B.Ed degree in special education can fit the bill. It is heartening to see that Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy has started such a course in collaboration with Jadavpur University.         
	Successful inclusion:         
	Starting with satellite schools targeting toddlers, make all Montessori and kindergarten schools inclusive.         
	The situation is better in villages where parents face little difficulty in putting their children in mohalla or para schools even if they are autistic. Teachers dont discriminate, and if not academics, children learn social skills. Villagers take collective responsibility to look after them. It is mainly in cities that discrimination is seen.         
	Nursery school/satellite schools:         
	Try to develop social skills, independent skills, fine and gross motor skills in the child. This can be done without labelling him and is the simple version of indirect early intervention. Satellite schools are the catchment area. Early detection of a child will hasten his successful transition into an inclusive middle school.        
	Middle school :        
	The child should be allowed to cope with the academic pressures in a general class at his own pace. If he is not on a par cognitively with other students of his age, he should follow his own level and his progress should be monitored through assessments. The stress should be on discovering talents in music, art and craft, computer, mathematics, sports and performing arts. Ten per cent of children with Aspergers syndrome have special talents. They can even be assets for the school. Why not give them a chance to prove their mettle?        
	Mainstreaming:        
	This depends on the availability of resources. Each class must ideally have two teachers: a mainstream teacher and a special educator. Collaboration is the pillar of inclusion. A sensitive and understanding mainstream teacher can also act as a co-teacher helping children with special needs.        
	lResource room:         
	Special children must have access to a resource or silence room. It is here that they would receive extra support and individual attention. It is like a school within a school, where special educators would teach essential skills individually or in small groups. The special children should be made to follow their timetable partly in regular classrooms and partly in the resource room. In this way they can be brought on the same platform as regular children.        
	Include an activity session with special children in the daily timetable. Give the games easily pronounceable names like Jumping Joe, Footprints, Hawa Badal or Action Time. Take the help of the physical training teacher. Sometimes Downs Syndrome children are extremely stubborn and special educators need to intervene.         
	Promote a competitive environment. Teach them skills for sports day or dance steps that they can perform on the prize distribution day. You can also organise quiz competitions.        
	When the situation demands, special children can easily mingle with regular ones and perform without much difficulty. It is a balancing act. Within a small group you can develop a special childs leadership qualities or other gifts that are difficult to identify in a classroom.        
	Training teachers:        
	The special educator should help the teacher understand how best a special child can be included in a class of regular children. Regular interactive sessions, workshops and training will help them. They need to inculcate a flexible attitude while working with these children in a mainstream setting.        
	Schools should introduce and seek affiliation with the Open Basic Education and National Institute of Open Schooling. This will open up opportunities for special children, who are unable to make it to the board levels, to pursue a career.         
	Having a pre-vocational and vocational infrastructure for job training is an important part of inclusion. Now schools are getting affiliated with ASDAN (Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Network, affiliated with Qualification Authority council, UK). They issue certificates to children after completion of the course making them self-reliant.         
	Authorities often miss out children with disabilities while framing rules. All special children deserve the opportunity to learn along with their normal peers. The inclusion project must take off from here.

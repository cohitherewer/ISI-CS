                      Power of the people                    As part of Hindi fortnight, EZCC hosts the staging of Gardish, a play which explores the oppression and exploitation of poor villagers by the powers-that-be. Adapted from Karel Capeks original, it is set against the background of a typical Indian village, with its familiar police chowki and a bunch of poverty-stricken villagers. As is common in such rural areas, the administration and police thrive on the patronage of a rich and powerful landowner, using their might to harass the poor. The action of the play begins when a protester directs a stone at a powerful village head. On investigating the incident, Chhota Babu of the police chowki comes across an incredible truth. The stone was so heavy and flung from such a great distance that it even surpassed the Olympic shotput record! The man who threw it is found to be very lean and frail who could hardly be strong enough to perform such a feat. The policeman is amazed by his own findings and begins to contemplate what drives the poor to remain strong and protest against wrongs in spite of their hardships. Drama and direction: Avinash Gupta.                    Event: Play in Hindi, Gardish, produced by Renaissance When: Today at 6 pm Where: Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, IB 201 Salt Lake

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Rap for tuition ban flout 
                                                                                                            Rap for tuition ban flout 
  - Minister announces steps to curb malpractice          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	College and university teachers are rampantly violating the ban on private tuition, higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury said on Sunday.        
	Among the accused teachers, some are in state-run institutions like Presidency.        
	To curb the malpractice, the government is considering a series of steps, including surprise inspection of the campuses by education department officials.        
	The trend is disturbing. The teachers have to stop tutoring students in private, the minister said, while addressing the annual conference of the CPM-controlled West Bengal Government College Teachers Association in Presidencys Derozio Hall.        
	We have come to know that some of the teachers engaged in private tuition even ask their students to recommend their names to friends if they score well in exams. This will not be allowed any longer, Ray Chaudhury asserted.        
	The state government had banned private tuition by teachers of schools, colleges and universities four years ago. But the order is followed more in breach than in compliance.        
	The ban was announced to ensure that teachers give their best in class. The lure of private tuition often prompts a teacher to be irregular in class, said an official.        
	Without mentioning the hike in their salaries, the minister said there is no need for the teachers now to attend private coaching classes.        
	It seems private tuition is like an addiction. The teachers themselves often do not know why they are indulging in the malpractice, just as smokers do not realise why they are smoking, the minister reasoned.        
	He hoped the surprise inspection of colleges and universities will help curb the menace. The inspectors will check how many classes the teachers are taking and also the students attendance.        
	The inspection will be carried out by officials of the higher education department. Now, university authorities conduct inspection of the affiliated colleges, Ray Chaudhury.        
	Haren Bhattacharya, a teacher of Presidency College and the general secretary of the association, said: True, a section of teachers is involved in private tuition. There are some complaints against teachers of Presidency College as well. But the association will not stand by any errant teacher if the government takes any action against him/her.        
	On the partial autonomy granted to Presidency, the minister said the model is ideal for the institutions upgrade. Similar status will be bestowed on other colleges, too.

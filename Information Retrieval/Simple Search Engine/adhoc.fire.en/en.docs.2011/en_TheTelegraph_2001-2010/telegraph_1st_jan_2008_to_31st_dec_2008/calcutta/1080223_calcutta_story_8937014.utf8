The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Examinee claims abduction
                                                                                                               Examinee claims abduction
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A Madhyamik examinee found crying in Howrah station on Friday morning told police that four youths had kidnapped her on her way to the examination centre.        
	Railway Police Force (RPF) men spotted the Entally girl crying inconsolably around 11.30am, minutes before the history paper was to start.        
	She said the gang had dragged her into a Maruti van. When the vehicle stopped near the station, she fled after biting a kidnappers hand, said an RPF officer.        
	An officer of Entally police station said: The girl may be lying, as she has shown signs of exam phobia. Scared of taking the test, she might have fled to the station on her own. We have still launched a search for the abductors.        
	The RPF handed over the girl to Government Railway Police officers, who escorted her to the examination centre.         
	Though she was late by an hour, secondary education board officials allowed her to write the test. The girl was also allowed extra time to complete the paper, said board president Mamata Ray.        
	The girls family members refused to comment.

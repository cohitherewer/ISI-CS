          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Bus and minibus owners have challenged Calcutta High Courts recent order approving the state environment departments decision to phase out 15-year-old commercial vehicles from plying within Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) by April 1, 2009.        
	Challenging the legality of the principal secretarys notification on phasing out vehicles, two bus owners associations, Bengal Bus Syndicate and Minibus Operators Co-ordination Committee, and 15 individual minibus owners filed four petitions in the court on Friday.         
	The petitioners have contended that the state environment authority has no jurisdiction to fix the age limit of commercial vehicles.         
	The principal secretary of the state environment department on July 17, 2008, had issued the notification relating to phasing out of vehicles under Section 20 of the Air (Prevention and Care of Pollution) Act and the high court had put a seal of approval on the notification. But, the environment department and principal secretary have no legal right to issue such a notification, the petitioners argued.        
	They also claimed that age limit of the life of motor vehicles can only be fixed under the provision of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.         
	But in that case, only the central government has the right to fix the age limit and no state authority has the said power, they claimed.        
	The petitioners have sought a revision of the high court order passed on July 18 approving the notification.         
	According to high court sources, the court is expecting similar petitions from other bus, minibus and autoricksaw owners associations and individual owners. The court will hear the petitions within a month, the sources said.        
	The July 18 court order had also said that all autorickshaws, irrespective of their age, will have to convert to either CNG or LPG for plying within the CMA.

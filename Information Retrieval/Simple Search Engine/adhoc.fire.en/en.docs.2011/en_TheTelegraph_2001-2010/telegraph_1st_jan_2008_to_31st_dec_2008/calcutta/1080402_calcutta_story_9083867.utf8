The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Besu clash probe on wobbly ground
                                                                                                               Besu clash probe on wobbly ground
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	The vice-chancellor of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), N.R. Banerjea, has issued a notification detailing the terms of reference for the one-man commission that will probe the unrest on campus.        
	But the person who will head the probe, former Besu vice-chancellor Sparshamani Chatterjee, said: I will consider the proposal only when I am asked by the chancellor of the university.        
	Higher education secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said: Since Besu is an autonomous institution, the appointment of the commission needs to be ratified by its board of management. Once it is ratified, Prof Chatterjee will be intimated through proper channels. The vice-chancellor and the registrar could not be contacted.        
	The notification, dated March 31, stated that the terms of reference of the commission include probing the campus clashes on March 19 and 20, and ascertaining whether the students were drunk and used abusive language, whether there was any motive to disrupt the mid-semester exams and whether outsiders were involved in the March 20 unrest. The panel will also suggest ways to improve the academic atmosphere.        
	A similar one-man commission was appointed by the state government to probe the violence in Jadavpur University in April last year. The report of the commission, headed by former additional chief secretary Ashoke Mohan Chakrabarti, is gathering dust, with none of its recommendations implemented by the authorities.        
	On Tuesday, vice-chancellor Banerjea held a three-hour meeting with the heads of departments, directors, hostel superintendents, service associations and non-academic staff to discuss ways to restore normality on campus.        
	Starting Wednesday, Banerjea will meet a delegation of around 30 students from each year and listen to their grievances and involve them in restoring order.        
	Asked whether police will be withdrawn from the campus, registrar Biman Bandopadhyay said: It will be done in phases. Legal cases against the students will also not be withdrawn, said an official.        
	A section of students held a convention at the university gate on Tuesday to protest the victimisation of students by the Besu authorities.

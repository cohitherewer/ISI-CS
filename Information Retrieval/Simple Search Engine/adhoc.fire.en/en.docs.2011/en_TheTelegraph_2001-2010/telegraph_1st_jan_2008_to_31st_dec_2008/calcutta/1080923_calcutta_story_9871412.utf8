  - Schools blame government move to limit DA          MITA MUKHERJEE                                    
	Some leading English-medium schools may be forced to raise their tuition fees following a state government move to limit the number of non-teaching employees getting dearness allowance (DA).        
	A school education department order issued on September 19  effective from September 1  has specified that a DA-getting institution cannot hire more than 17 such employees for every 1,000 students.        
	From now on, if a school recruits non-teaching employees beyond that limit, it will have to foot their DA bill. The government, however, will keep providing DA for all such employees already on the rolls, till they retire.        
	The notification has put around 60 English-medium schools  including St Xaviers, Don Bosco, the Loreto branches, Calcutta Boys and Calcutta Girls  in a fix. Most of these schools are functioning with 30 or more non-teaching employees, pushing it beyond the government limit.        
	We will hire as many non-teaching employees as we need. If the government refuses to provide DA for them, we may have to raise the tuition fee, said the spokesperson for a Christian missionary-run school in south Calcutta.        
	The schools will be hit hard by this decision. Most of the affected schools are known for their high academic standard and efficient management. The non-teaching employees contribute a lot to the smooth functioning of the schools. If we drastically reduce number of teaching posts, academic activities will suffer, said Father Faustine Brank, the vice-president of the education cell of the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba, an umbrella body of Christian organisations.        
	The founder bodies of the missionary schools will meet on Tuesday to decide their course of action.        
	The government-specified ceiling of 17 non-teaching employees for every 1,000 students includes four Group D employees, two clerks and one librarian. If a school runs a hostel, it can appoint two cooks, two helpers and two sweepers. The school can hire a driver and a cleaner if it owns a vehicle and a mali and a cleaner if there is a garden on its premises.        
	The government order reads: In some DA-getting schools, the number of non-teaching staff is abnormally high compared with the teaching staff... There is no rationale for this...         
	The bottomline for the guardians could be yet another round of fee hike.

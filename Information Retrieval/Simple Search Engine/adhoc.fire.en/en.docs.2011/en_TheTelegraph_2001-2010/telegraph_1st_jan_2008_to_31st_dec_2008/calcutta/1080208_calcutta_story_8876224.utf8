                Parts of north Calcutta and Howrah will suffer power cuts on Friday as CESC will carry out maintenance work at its Grey Street and Howrah (North) distribution stations. Aurobindo Sarani, Sovabazar, Abinash Kabiraj Street, Jadu Pandit Road, BK Pal Avenue, Rabindra Sarani, Hatibagan and APC Road will go without power from 10am to 11am. In Howrah, Madan Biswas Lane, Khetra Mitra Lane, JN Mukherjee Road (South), Ghoshal Bagan and KD Jalan Road will be affected from 10am to 2pm.    Three-year-old Sarita Das was injured when the chain of a reclamation van, towing away the jeep of a police officer, snapped on Chetla Central Road and hit an autorickshaw in which she was travelling. Sarita was taken to SSKM Hospital, from where she was released after treatment.    The Union human resource development ministry has asked the state government to admit students to Bengal Engineering and Science University through the state joint entrance examination for the 2008-09 session.    The city police arrested Sujit Kumar Roy, a doctor, from Muri, Jharkhand, on Thursday for cheating Parimal Maity of Rs 20 lakh. Roy had promised that if Maity paid the sum, he would get half the income from Roys nursing home in Garia. Maity was not given any share.

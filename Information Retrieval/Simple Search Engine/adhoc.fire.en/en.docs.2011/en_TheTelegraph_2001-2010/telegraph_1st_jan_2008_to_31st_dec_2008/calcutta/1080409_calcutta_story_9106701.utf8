                      Discourse on poetry                    One of the most well-known writers of the post-Tagore era, Buddhadeva Bose was a versatile genius, excelling in every literary genre. A brilliant poet, he also wrote novels, short stories, plays in both prose and verse, and non-fictional prose such as travelogues, memoirs, and literary essays. He was also an editor-publisher, a translator, a writer for children and a consummate critic. A seminal figure in the literary scene of his times, he nurtured all major, modern poets through Kavita, the famous poetry magazine he founded, edited and published for 25 years. It became the leading Bengali poetry magazine of its time, in which all important poets aspired to be published. It was also an extremely important magazine for the discussion and review of poetry. This evening, hosted by the Buddhadeva Bose Centenary Committee, renowned scholar and poet Dr William Radice (picture above) will deliver the second Buddhadeva Bose Centenary Lecture on On Being Modern: Buddhadeva Boses Poetic Style.

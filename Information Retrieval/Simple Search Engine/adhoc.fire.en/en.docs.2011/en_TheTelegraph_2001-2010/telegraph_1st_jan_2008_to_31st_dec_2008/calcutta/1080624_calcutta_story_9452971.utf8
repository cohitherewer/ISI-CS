	A gang of four extortionists struck a Tiljala trader on his head with a revolver butt on Sunday night for declining to pay them Rs 5,000, after having met their demand twice.        
	The gangsters also beat up two others, who tried to come to Ram Paras Singhs rescue.        
	Three of the four criminals  all are absconding  have been identified as Manoj, Puran and Jibat.        
	Police said the gang had raided Singhs fodder shop on Tiljala Road on Friday and Saturday night and forced him to cough up Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000, respectively.        
	On Sunday, they came around 9.40pm, held me at gun-point and demanded Rs 5,000. I turned down their demand as I had already paid them Rs 7,000. My refusal made them furious and one of the youths hit me on my head with a revolver butt. The gang also beat up two others, who came to my rescue, recalled Singh.        
	Around 200 residents blocked Tiljala Road around 1pm, protesting police apathy in arresting the extortionists. The blockade was lifted after two hours, following an assurance of prompt action from officers of Tiljala police station.        
	The youths have unleashed terror in our neighbourhood. They extort money from the owners of at least 50 shops on Tiljala Road, said Arjun Prasad, a trader.        
	Bapi Roy, another trader, said: They visit the market areas on motorcycles, carrying firearms and bombs. If we put up any resistance, they hurl bombs indiscriminately.        
	The gang goes on an extortion drive if any of the members or relatives get married, alleged Roy. If a family member dies, they force us to bear the cost of the last rites.        
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said: The accused were arrested several times. We have launched a search for them.        
	Local Trinamul Congress MLA Javed Khan said: The criminals enjoy the backing of the CPM. We are trying to unite the residents against the gangsters.

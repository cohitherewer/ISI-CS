                      Tapan Sinha in focus                    Since a little over five decades, Tapan Sinha has remained a striking figure in the world of Indian cinema, with the rare distinction of making successive commercial hits while staying away from the safe parameters of formulaic blockbusters. Always the quintessential Bengali bhadralok, a man of deep conscience and versatility, his films are more than merely aesthetically wholesome entertainments. Casting an alert eye over critical social concerns and carving out a personal celluloid diction, Sinha has never repeated themes in his career. Almost each of his over 40 thematically different films, from the classy historical thriller (Jhinder Bandi, 1961) or the sheer fantasy of a middle-class Bengali family (Galpo Holeo Satyi, 1966) to a super hit childrens film (Safed Haathi, 1978) or the crisis of a scientist in the face of social antagonism (Ek Doctor Ki Maut, 1991), are redoubtable milestones in the history of Indian cinema. The World of Tapan Sinha, the ongoing exhibition of photographs coinciding with his birthday today, features the master director and his works through the lens of Sukumar Roy along with a selection from his personal archives. Also showcasing some of the maestros film memorabilia. Hosted by Sensorium. Conceived and curated by Sounak Chacraverti and Arpan Mitra.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs on Tapan Sinha along with some film memorabilia When: Till October 3; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, 9A Ho Chi Minh Sarani

	Sheikh Vinod, accused of jailbreak, murder, dacoity and extortion, was granted bail by Barasat court on Thursday.         
	Vinod (Telegraph picture left) left Alipore Central jail around 11.30am.        
	Police said the undertrial was granted bail in an extortion case.         
	A number of cases are pending against him in various courts in South 24-Parganas and Calcutta. Thursdays case was the last one in which he got bail, said a police officer.        
	Vinod had fled from Dum Dum Central jail in 2002 with three other criminals.        
	He was re-arrested along with his wife a few months later by a joint team of South 24-Parganas and Hooghly police. Since then, he was lodged in Alipore Central jail, said an officer.

	They all had dreams to chase. Some were sceptical, others hopeful. Some flocked in groups while others were escorted by equally ambitious parents. These students formed an interesting crosssection at the 17th Career Fair organised by Afairs at the Ice Skating Rink from April 18 to 20.         
	Students were given tips on a variety of careers  ranging from BCA, BBA, MBA, air hostess training, engineering, hotel management, MBBS, jewellery designing, journalism and many more  with 70 institutes from across the country participating in the three-day extravaganza. Bangalore boasted of the maximum number of participating institutes.        
	The rest came from Pune, Mangalore, Chennai, Agra, New Delhi, Kochi, Nagpur, Haldia and Calcutta. But amidst a haze of names, only a few reputed ones could be spotted. Students were also offered comprehensive training programmes by AIESEC.        
	The high point of the fair was an online aptitude and psychometric test that drew the maximum number of students. Its scores indicated the best career option one can opt for.         
	But for Smriti Gupta,who had just given her ISC, her goals and aptitude clashed.While the test indicated Smritis aptitude for interior designing, law school is where she planned to head. I am indeed interested in interior designing but will be studying law as it is my parents wish, she said.         
	Most visitors could be seen moving about aimlessly collecting pamphlets from different stalls. However Commerce student Aashish Shah found the fair very helpful.         
	I wanted to check out the available courses in animation. I got all my answers from Arena Animation and Digital Magic Animation Academy, said the student of Bhawanipore College.         
	The objective of the fair is to offer students all kinds of information under one roof and help them compare various institutes. We are also conducting special activities like career counselling sessions, aptitude tests and interactive sessions on careers which will supplement their information, said Sameer Bolia, CEO of Afairs.         
	The fair has travelled from Ranchi and Patna. Educational fairs like these are essential in smaller cities and towns where people have limited access to information, he added.         
	The students were given a magazine, Career Guide, dwelling on unconventional careers like choreography, film production, disc jockeying, modelling, bartending, medical transcription, tea tasting and jewellery designing. They also got tips on how to become private detectives. A career counselling session with Pervin Malhotra was organised on the second day.         
	There were also interactive sessions with adman Mousim Mitra, fashion designer Sharbari Dutta, disc jockey Charlotta Lackman and journalist Sulakshna Mukherjee. Journalism seemed to be the most sought after career with the speaker addressing a packed house.

	A day of creativity            A child recites a poem at the Shishu Sahitya Academy workshop. Picture by Anindya Shankar Ray       
	Shishu Sahitya Academy held creative writing and art workshops on April 14 at Eden Park. The organisation works to encourage reading among school students
  Over 80 students, representing various schools in the city and districts, participated in the workshops.   
	 The day started with Ranbindrasangeet performed by Meghna Mukherjee of St Teresa rsquo;s High School, followed by a recitation and story-telling session.  
	 ldquo;I was always afraid of singing in public. This programme helped me get over my fears, rdquo; said Ashish Mukherjee, a Class IX student of St Teresa Secondary School who sang a Rabindrasangeet.  
	 The creative writing chapter was aimed at giving young minds a chance to pen their thoughts and develop original ideas. ldquo;With televisions and Internet flooding our homes, children no longer like to read, rdquo; said Himangshu Sarkar, secretary of Shishu Sahitya Academy.   
	 When it came to painting, most students opted for traditional landscapes. 
  ldquo;Owing to the hectic lifestyle and academic pressure faced by most middle and high school students, there is a dearth of ideas among them. Art without a new dimension is like repetition of a mathematical formula, rdquo; said artist Judhajit Sengupta, who conducted the workshop.   
	 At the writing workshop, students were given a free reign to write on any subject. Many focussed on poverty and natural calamities while a few stressed on the effects of political conflict and the need for peace. ldquo;The spirit of creativity needs to be nurtured from time to time for one to become a confident writer, quot; said Shailen Ghosh, who coordinated this workshop. Subho Singh, a Class VI student of G B Memorial School said: ldquo;I am happy as I got to meet many people here. rdquo;  
	 His mother Rika Singh emphasised on the importance of such workshops. ldquo;Such extracurricular activities help in the overall development of the child, rdquo; she added. Several students felt that they had learnt much more in a day than in the eight years of school.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic work cripples fire brigade hub
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Civic work cripples fire brigade hub

	Any blaze in the heart of city now could spin out of control as sloppy civic work has almost crippled the state fire service headquarters at 13D Mirza Ghalib Street.        
	The stretch in front of the building has remained dug up for the past three months, preventing tenders from rushing to the spot of a fire.        
	The Calcutta road has been dug up to revamp the underground sewer lines, funds for which have come from the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission.        
	Work started in February and was scheduled to be completed by April. But it is still far from over. Asked about the delay, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said: I would not like to comment on it.        
	The state fire and emergency services directorate has repeatedly lodged complaints with the civic body, but there has been no visible effort to speed up work.        
	Our repeated complaints have yielded no results, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director general of the state fire and emergency services.        
	We have knocked on the doors of the municipal commissioner, police commissioner and deputy commissioner (traffic). Let alone taking any action, they havent even bothered to get back to us. The road in front of our office is in such a state that it is impossible for the fire tenders to ply over them, he added.        
	One flank of the entire road has been dug up, leaving open a narrow space that even autorickshaws find difficult to negotiate.        
	The office on Mirza Ghalib Street covers a large section of central Calcutta. Its crucial for us to reach a fire spot on time. Even a minutes delay can turn fatal, said Bhattacharya.

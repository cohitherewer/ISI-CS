          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two gangs clashed with revolvers, swords and iron rods in Kalighat on Wednesday evening, injuring a pedestrian.        
	The fight continued for over 10 minutes, but police are yet to track down the culprits.         
	The gangs are led by Jagannath and Kartik, an officer of Kalighat police station said.        
	Jagannath bagged a contract to supply building material to a promoter, elbowing out Kartik, whose muscle power proved inadequate, the officer said.        
	Trouble started when Kartik beat up one of Jagannaths men on Wednesday afternoon. To seek revenge, Jagannath and his men assembled at Patuapara and started searching for Kartik, the officer said.        
	Kartik came out on the road and challenged Jagannath and the clash ensued.        
	According to officers of the detective departments anti-rowdy section, both Jagannath and Kartik are extortionists who started working as construction material suppliers recently.         
	We have started a case of rioting against them, said an officer.

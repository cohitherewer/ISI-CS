                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Spat threat to library collection 
          ANASUYA BASU                          The Esplanade reading room. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Rare, old newspapers in the National Librarys collection might be lost forever if a dispute between the authorities and a group of readers delays steps to preserve them.         
	The Esplanade Reading Room of the library has 8,000 volumes of old newspapers. As part of a modernisation and restoration drive, the library wants to shift the newspapers to its Belvedere address, where they shall be preserved, digitised and micro-filmed.        
	The Friends of the National Library, a two-year-old forum of readers and research scholars who use the Esplanade reading room, has written to Union culture and tourism minister Ambika Soni, asking her to stop the shift on the ground that the centrally located reading room was used by senior citizens who would find commuting to the Belvedere library difficult.        
	It is a criminal offence to let these papers turn to dust. I know we are already late and a lot of them are beyond restoration, yet whatever is left has to be preserved, said a library spokesperson.         
	The authorities met forum members to sort out the issue.        
	We are going to install microfilm readers at the Esplanade office and readers will be able to requisition and read the papers once they are digitised, added the spokesperson.        
	The Friends are not convinced. We will not let the papers leave the Esplanade reading room. The library authorities can digitise the papers there, said Abdus Subhan, the convener of the forum.        
	Conditions at the Esplanade office  cracks in walls, termites, dripping drain pipes  are not conducive to preserving the newspapers, including 18th century editions of Calcutta Courier and 19th century editions of Englishman.        
	Can the newspapers be digitised in Esplanade? Our equipment and the rest of the newspaper archive are at Alipore. Besides, the papers cannot be preserved at Esplanade, the spokesperson said.

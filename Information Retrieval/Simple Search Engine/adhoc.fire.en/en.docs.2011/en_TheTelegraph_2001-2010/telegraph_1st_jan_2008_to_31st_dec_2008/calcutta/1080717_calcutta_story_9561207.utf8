	Some Hawkers Sangram Committee members on Wednesday lodged a complaint with Gautam Gupta, the officer-in-charge of South Traffic Guard, alleging that traffic sergeant Ritwik Mukherjee had beaten up Khursed Singh, a hawker.         
	Mukherjee bought a toy from Singh and demanded one more as a gift. Singh was hit after he rejected the request, said a committee member.

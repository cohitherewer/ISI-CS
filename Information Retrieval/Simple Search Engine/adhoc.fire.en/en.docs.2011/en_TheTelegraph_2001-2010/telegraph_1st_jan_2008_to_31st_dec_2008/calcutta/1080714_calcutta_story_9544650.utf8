The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Repairer by day, pilferer by night
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Repairer by day, pilferer by night
          JAYANTA BASU AND ZEESHAN JAWED                          Tankers wait for their turn to enter the Indian Oil depot in Budge Budge. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                  
	Kerosene is available easily  though clandestinely  and cheaply from ration shops. It can also be bought off the market, at a higher price. But petrol or diesel or, possibly, naphtha can be purchased or pilfered in large quantities from few sources: the terminals of oil marketing companies, tankers and petrol pumps.        
	About 400 tankers, each with a capacity of 12,000 litres, are filled in Maurigram every day, making it the biggest terminal in Bengal. Budge Budge, the other Indian Oil depot near Calcutta, in comparison, fills only 25 a day.        
	The contrast shows outside the depot. Budge Budge looks nowhere near as busy as Maurigram  fewer shops, fewer tankers queued up outside.        
	We need diesel, we tell a tanker driver in a vest and rolled-up trousers who looks puzzled.        
	We explain we need a large quantity but at a rate lower than the market price. After a pause, the young man replies that we will have to go to the depot.        
	Told that we have heard petrol and diesel can be bought outside the depot, he narrates how Budge Budge has changed from an in-the-middle-of-nowhere place to a fast-developing residential area.         
	Even five years ago, Budge Budge was an isolated stretch. We would just move into one of the green patches and unload some diesel. But the huge grounds have disappeared. Now the entire operation is streamlined, he says.        
	Taking oil out of tankers has not gone out of fashion, though. At Berunapukur, off the Barasat-Barrackpore expressway, about 30 km from the city, an unpaved road forks out. We drive for about five minutes down the road through a hamlet and turn left to confront a godown. The iron gate is shut.        
	We are accompanied by a thin man in his early twenties, neatly dressed in bell-bottom trousers, who says he used to be in the katatel business till about a year and a half ago but left because it was getting too dirty.        
	This man, who had worked with the godown owner, says that during the day the place looks like a repair garage. After dark, tankers roll in and oil is siphoned out by people skilled in the art, the proceeds shared between the godown owner and the tanker owner and the driver.        
	Petrol is mixed in the godown  there are said to be several in the area  with kerosene and possibly naphtha to prepare katatel, which is then supplied only to known customers. Oil is sold in unadulterated form also.        
	A few weeks ago, the petroleum dealers association wrote to transport minister Subhas Chakraborty to complain about fuel being sucked out of tankers on their way to pumps. They submitted a CD with the complaint to highlight an incident where a tanker was caught in a pump with evidence of fuel having been taken out.         
	Repeatedly, we have brought the matter to the notice of oil companies and ministers, like the finance and transport ministers, but nothing has been done, said Bidyut Sarkar, the secretary of the association.        
	Indian Oil disputes that oil can be siphoned out of tankers. If the petrol pump authorities are not involved, it is impossible to take out fuel, because there are specially designed locks for each tanker, said Ramesh Kumar Singh, the senior terminal manager at Maurigram.        
	It would seem the petrol or naphtha, in very large quantities, for katatel is coming from some mysterious source. From the samples tested on behalf of The Telegraph, it has become evident that between 33 and 45 per cent of the content of katatel is petrol, which means at least round 60,000 litres of petrol is being found from unauthorised sources every day.        
	But everyone involved in the business  the oil companies and the pumps  and the government are in denial.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The body of the teenaged cyclist who was crushed by a truck on James Long Sarani on Friday morning was identified by his parents at the Vidyasagar Hospital morgue early on Sunday.        
	Navin Bikas Tirkey, 13, lived with his parents in Mahestala Co-operative Housing Society at Beledanga and studied in an English-medium school in Thakurpukur. He did not have siblings. Navins father Nazarius is a government employee.        
	According to police, the boy often used to stay at a relatives place which is closer to his school than his home is. On Friday morning, he was on his way to his relatives house.The teenager was hit by a truck at the crossing of James Long Sarani and Janakalyan Road. The driver ran over Navin in a bid to escape. A mob set the truck on fire and had put up a blockade. The body, however, remained unidentified.        
	Navins parents thought he was staying over and did not panic when he did not return at night, said a policeman. They learnt only on Saturday that their son was not at their relatives place and lodged a complaint with Mahestala police station.        
	The police said they could not track down the parents earlier because they could not find any clue and no missing complaint had been lodged with nearby police stations.        
	Late on Saturday, we received information that a missing diary was lodged on Saturday morning at Mahestala police station. We contacted his parents, who identified the body early on Sunday, said a senior officer of Thakurpukur police station.

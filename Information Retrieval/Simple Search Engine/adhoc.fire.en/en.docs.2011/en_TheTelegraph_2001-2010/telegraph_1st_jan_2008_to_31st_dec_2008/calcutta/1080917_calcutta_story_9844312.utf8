  - Depression over Bay of Bengal brings rain amp; relief to city          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A pedestrian caught in the Tuesday afternoon shower. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Gusty winds and sharp showers swept Calcutta on Tuesday after the seasons second depression  not to be confused with the one threatening Wall Street  formed over north Bay of Bengal.         
	But the city neednt fear a season-end dunking like the one at the start of the monsoon, Met officials assured.        
	The first monsoon depression on June 16 had led to 114mm of rain in 12 hours. However, this depression is far away from Calcutta and can, at the most, trigger several spells of rain in the city and the south Bengal districts. We have not issued any heavy rain warning, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.        
	Tuesdays rain brought down the maximum temperature by nearly 5 degrees Celsius. The Met office has forecast cloudy weather for most of Wednesday and clearer skies from the day after.        
	The low-pressure trough was around 300km from Calcutta on Monday. It intensified into a depression within 24 hours and headed towards the Orissa coast. Around 2.30 pm on Tuesday, the trough was over the Orissa coast, with its centre close to Chandbali, a Met official said.        
	Apart from the city, districts close to Orissa like East and West Midnapore and Purulia are likely to experience heavy rain in the next 24 hours. There will be rain in North and South 24-Parganas, too. Like on Tuesday, the rain will be accompanied by gusty winds, the Met official.        
	Once the depression hits land in Orissa, it is expected to weaken. The skies could clear immediately. But everything depends on whether the depression weakens. Sometimes, a depression is packed with so much moisture that it takes time to weaken, the official added.

	Five shops were gutted and 10 stores were damaged in a blaze in a single-storeyed building at Mullickbazar on Friday afternoon. 
    
	The destroyed shops, at 10A AJC Bose Road, sold cosmetics, food items and electronic goods. The fire broke out around 12.40pm, when most of the traders were offering namaz at a nearby mosque. The shop-owners claimed it was an act of arson by the new owner of the building.
    
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, however, said hooking or a short circuit could have sparked the fire. What else can happen, when no safety norms are in place? he asked.
    
	Kausar Ali, from whose shop the fire spread, said: I turned off the main switch before going for namaz. It couldnt have been a short circuit.
    
	Ashraf Gafaar, a local resident, rang up Park Street police station when he saw smoke coming out of Alis shop. By the time we rushed back from the mosque, the firemen had reached the spot, said another shopkeeper.
    
	Eleven fire tenders were pressed into service. Like in the case of the 100-hour blaze at Nandaram Market, the fire brigade was handicapped by the non-availability of water.
    
	Fridays rain, however, prevented the flames from spreading. The authorities of Assembly of God Church hospital offered the firemen access to an underground reservoir on their premises. The fire-fighters broke open the roof of the shops to spray water directly on the flames.
    
	The cause of the blaze could not be ascertained, said Diptendu Biswas, the director of West Bengal Fire Services.
    
	According to civic assessment records, the premises are owned by Aisha Khatun and Shamim Ara. Local councillor Nasreen Iqbal, however, said: Someone known as Ansar Bhai had recently purchased the building.
    
	Dulal Dutta, the general secretary of Mullickbazar Shopkeepers Association, alleged: The fire was an act of sabotage by the new owner of the building.

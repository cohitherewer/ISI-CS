The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Science chugs into city on wheels

	How does the human brain work? What constitutes sustainable development?        
	City students can seek answers to basic science posers such as these on a unique train over the next four days. Science Express, an Indo-German multimedia exhibition criss-crossing the railroads of India in a 400-metre air-conditioned train, reached Calcutta on Thursday.         
	The first-of-its-kind train will stay parked on platform 22 of Howrah station till February 11. People can visit it between 10am and 6pm.        
	Flagged off from Delhis Safdarjung station by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and German chancellor Angela Merkel on October 30 last year, the train is set to travel 15,000 km across 57 cities in 217 days. Calcutta is the 29th stop.        
	The exhibition seeks to address issues ranging from micro to macro-cosmos through 12 stories. The train has 12 coaches dedicated to major scientific achievements in the areas of natural and life sciences, more than 300 large-format images and over 150 video clips from current research projects, besides a chemistry lab specially developed for schoolchildren by German chemical major BASF.        
	This is an unprecedented effort in the arena of science and technology and I thank the Prime Minister for taking this wonderful initiative with his German counterpart, state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said at the inaugural ceremony.         
	The minister promised to press into service 10 special buses to ferry students from city schools and colleges to the science fair at Howrah station. The Indo-German Chamber of Commerce joined the department of science and technology and Eastern Railways in welcoming Science Express.        
	This is something that can wake up children and generate inquisitiveness among them, said Sister Cyril.        
	The exhibition has been put together by the department of science and technology in collaboration with Max Planck Society, Germany, and Vikram A Sarabhai Community Science Centre.        
	The purpose of the exhibition is to inculcate a scientific temper in the students and spot talent along the way, said Andreas Klauke, the project manager of Science Express. We are expecting a million visitors in five days, added Klauke.        
	Germans love trains and are also a leader in science and technology. On the other hand, India is famous for its Palace on Wheels. So, its appropriate that this rolling exhibition has come to India, said Gnter Wehrmann, the German consul-general in Calcutta.

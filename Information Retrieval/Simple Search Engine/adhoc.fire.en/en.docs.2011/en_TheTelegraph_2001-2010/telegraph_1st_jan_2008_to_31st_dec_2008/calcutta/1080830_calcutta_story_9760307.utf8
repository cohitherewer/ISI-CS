          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The chief minister will formal inaugurate the first college in Santoshpur on Saturday.        
	Classes started at the government-aided Panchur College on Santoshpur Bartala Link Road this academic session. It has 32 students, including seven girls, and six teachers.        
	Affiliated to Calcutta University, the institution currently offers general stream arts courses. There are plans to introduce more courses with emphasis on computer education.        
	The college is being set up on 37 cottahs at an estimated cost of about Rs 4.5 crore, of which Rs 2.5 crore has been utilised. The five-storeyed building, which will have a library in the basement, is ready, said Mursalin Mollah, the local CPM legislator and the president of the college committee.        
	It was our dream to have a college where local children, especially those from the minority community, can study. They usually join their family business after passing HS because there is no college in the area, added Mollah.        
	The college is likely to also benefit students from Rabindra Nagar, Akra and Mahestala.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The CID on Friday summoned the father of a candidate who had allegedly cleared the joint entrance examination (JEE) 2007 after procuring a copy of the final draft of the question papers.        
	Sujit Hazra, a Ghatal resident, has been asked to turn up at the CID headquarters in Bhawani Bhawan. The sleuths said they would like to ask him how he got hold of the question papers.        
	We need to find out whether more parents had bought JEE question papers before the test, said an official working on the case.        
	The sleuths have also summoned for interrogation two others, including Manab Patra, the elder brother of Manas who had allegedly leaked this years papers from the state-run Saraswati Press where he worked. Manas teaches biology in a Ghatal school.        
	The police came to know about the racket following the arrest of the Patras cousin Arun Choudhury, a lawyer, and his associate Mihir Dandapat in Ghatal last Saturday.         
	They were picked up while selling this years papers to two plainclothes officers.         
	The other person the CID summoned along with Manab is Choudhurys colleague Tapan Roy.        
	On Friday, investigators visited the JEE board office and talked to officials to find out details of the exam system. The sleuths also sought the answer scripts of a few students who had cleared the exam last year allegedly after procuring draft question papers.         
	Another CID team visited three Ghatal schools.

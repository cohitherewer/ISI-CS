The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Mahalaya noon to noon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mahalaya noon to noon
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Do the shradh and tarpan for your ancestors on Sunday but switch on the radio for the classic Mahishasurmardini programme at Monday dawn.        
	Mahalaya, the day that heralds the start of the divine fortnight, is creating confusion galore this year.         
	Our companys calendar shows Monday to be a red letter day but we will see tomorrow to find out if the banks are open. If they are, we will cancel Mondays leave, said Kishen Kejriwal of cast iron manufacturer and exporter Kiswok Industries.         
	The confusion heightened with the state government accepting Mahalaya to be on Sunday. Monday is supposed to be a holiday but with state government offices staying open, there is a chance that we will be told to work on Monday, said a Sector V employee.         
	We are being flooded with calls seeking clarifications, said proprietor of Gupta Press almanac Arijit Roychowdhury.        
	A look at the almanacs shows that Mahalaya this year straddles two days. According to Gupta Press, new moon period starts at 1.14pm on Sunday and continues till 12.55pm on Monday. For the other school of calculation, Bisuddhasiddhanta, the period is from 1.50pm on Sunday to 1.42pm on Monday.        
	This means Amavasya falls on both days. But almanac-makers say Mahalaya would still be on Sunday.         
	One major requirement for Mahalaya is that the new moon has to last till at least nine hours 36 minutes from the time of sunrise. On Monday, it expires much earlier. But on Sunday, new moon continues through the afternoon, says Manoj Lahiri of Bisuddhasiddhanta.        
	This means in ritualistic terms, the shradh that accompanies tarpan has to be done on Sunday. If it is not at all possible, then do the tarpan on Monday but not the shradh, priest Pulak Bhattacharya says.        
	But Birendra Krishna Bhadras Chandipath will play on the radio on Monday. We cant air the programme unless Amavasya starts, nor can we play it at any time except dawn. So it has to be Monday for us, says station manager Pradip Mitra.

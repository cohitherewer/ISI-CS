                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bail for Todi kin in Rizwanur case
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Anil Saraogi. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The city sessions court on Thursday granted bail to Anil Saraogi, a relative of Ashok and Pradip Todi and co-accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	The chief judge of the court, while allowing Saraogis bail, observed that since the CBIs investigation into the case was over, the agency need not interrogate him further.        
	Ashok Todi and his brother Pradip, currently in judicial custody, are expected to seek bail on the same grounds.        
	Appearing for Saraogi, advocate Amitava Bhattacharya said the trial would start only if the Supreme Court rejected the appeals moved by his client and Ashok Todi against the high court order allowing the CBI to file chargesheets against them.        
	With the CBI completing its investigation, the lawyer said, there was no need to keep Saraogi behind bars.        
	The lawyers representing the CBI and Rizwanurs family opposed the bail plea.        
	The judge asked Saraogi to produce two surety bonds of Rs 10,000 each for his release.        
	The bail plea by Pappu, another accused in the case, was turned down. He had surrendered on October 31.        
	Saraogi and Pradip Todi had surrendered in the Calcutta metropolitan magistrates court on December 8, following a Supreme Court directive. The CBI court had remanded the duo in jail custody till December 12.         
	Pradip Todis bail plea will be heard in the sessions court on Friday.        
	A special bench of the high court will hear the bail plea of Ashok Todi on Friday. Justice D.P. Sengupta of the high court has been assigned by Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar to hear the plea after two judges of a division bench of the court held contradictory views regarding his bail.

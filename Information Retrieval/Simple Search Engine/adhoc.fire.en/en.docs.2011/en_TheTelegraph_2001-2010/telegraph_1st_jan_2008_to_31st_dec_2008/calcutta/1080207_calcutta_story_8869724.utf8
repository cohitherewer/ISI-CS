                      Corporate champion                    Perhaps the most charismatic figure to have walked the corridors of corporate India, Russi Mody is best loved for his ready wit and the way he connected with workers on an equal plane. A historic association of 53 years with the hallowed Tata empire won him worldwide acclaim. A man of steely determination, but always known to wear a smile, his bonhomie could pierce through the most ominous situation. This evening, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, governor of West Bengal, will launch The Man Who Also Made Steel, a biography of the corporate czar by Partha Mukherjee and Jyoti Sabharwal. Hosted by Oxford Bookstore, Calcutta and Stellar Publishers Pvt Ltd.

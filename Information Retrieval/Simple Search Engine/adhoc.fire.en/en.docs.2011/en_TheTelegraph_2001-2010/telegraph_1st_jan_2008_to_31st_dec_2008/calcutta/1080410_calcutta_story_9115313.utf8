  - UNINHABITED PLOT TO BE AN AVIARY          A STAFF REPORTER                          RESIDENCE RESTORED: One of the 20,000-odd birds of various species that inhabit the 20-bigha forested plot in Baranagar. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	A 20-bigha forested land in Baranagar can well be declared an aviary, thanks to the local residents, who have been fighting takeover attempts by realtors.        
	A forest department team that visited the lush sprawl on Akshay Kumar Mukherjee Road  home to around 20,000 birds of various species like egret, shamuk khola, cormorant, woodpecker and snipe  has suggested that the walled plot be turned into an aviary.        
	The report, submitted by district forest officer (Calcutta) N. Mazedar Rahman, also stated that attempts at felling the trees had been foiled by the local residents.        
	Yes, an inspection report has come but it is too early to say anything specific, the principal chief conservator of forests, Atanu Raha, said on Wednesday.        
	The uninhabited plot belongs to the closed Bengal Immunity, which used to produce antivenom serum. The company had a stable there.        
	We had launched a campaign to protect the wooded patch when some unidentified people filled up a pond on it four years ago. In 2007, they came back with a bulldozer to fell the trees but had to back out following protests, said Madhu Nag, a local resident.        
	The residents approached Love-N-Care for Animals, a south Calcutta-based NGO, which drew the forest departments attention to the natural habitat of birds.        
	We have written to the environment department, Baranagar police station and Baranagar municipality, asking them to prevent a takeover of the plot by realtors, said Sushmita Roy, of Love-N-Care for Animals.        
	We have heard that the plot, a mini forest, has been sold to some realtors. As attempts were being made to fell the trees, we have requested the forest department to preserve the natural habitat of birds in the city, added Roy.

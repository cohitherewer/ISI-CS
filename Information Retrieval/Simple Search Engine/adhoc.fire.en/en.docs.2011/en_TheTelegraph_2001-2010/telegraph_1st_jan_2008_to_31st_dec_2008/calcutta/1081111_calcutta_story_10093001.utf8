	A 10-year-old boy died on Sunday after suffering from fever for four days. Doctors suspect that he died of dengue shock syndrome.         
	Oikyanarayan Bhattacharya of Baranagar died at the Institute of Child Health (ICH) in the city.         
	According to hospital authorities, Oikyanarayans blood sample was sent to a pathological laboratory for tests but the report hadnt reached them till Monday evening.         
	However, the symptoms indicated dengue. In case of dengue, the shock syndrome sets in after the fever subsides, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of ICH.        
	Oikyanarayan, a student of Class IV in an English-medium school in the city, was suffering from fever since last Wednesday.         
	He was running a high temperature since returning from school, said his father, Tapas Narayan Bhattacharya, an employee of a public sector bank.         
	Oikyanarayans family consulted a local physician on Thursday, who told them the boy was probably suffering from an enteric disease and prescribed medicines accordingly. But the fever continued and on Saturday, he started vomiting. The vomit had traces of blood, his father said.         
	Oikyanarayan was admitted to a nursing home in the Bagbazar area, near a house rented by the family. As his condition deteriorated, doctors at the nursing home suggested that he be shifted to a hospital. Although he was weak, my son was stable and was able to walk out of the nursing home, said Bhattacharya.        
	The boy was admitted to ICH at 4.10am on Sunday. But his condition continued to deteriorate and he became unconscious.         
	The family alleged that only junior doctors had treated him since it was a Sunday and no senior doctor was available.        
	An hour before his death, a senior doctor examined him but could not save my son. Moments before his death he went to the toilet and started feeling dizzy, he said. The boy died around 11am on Sunday.         
	Hospital officials said he was provided the best possible treatment. The head of the paediatrics department examined him despite the odd hour, said an official.         
	Oikyanarayans mother Ruma, a homoeopath, was inconsolable.         
	On Monday evening, his sister Ekta, a first-year student of homoeopathy, fondly remembered her little brother. He was an extremely sensitive boy and used to save money for my marriage. I cant believe that he is no more, she said.

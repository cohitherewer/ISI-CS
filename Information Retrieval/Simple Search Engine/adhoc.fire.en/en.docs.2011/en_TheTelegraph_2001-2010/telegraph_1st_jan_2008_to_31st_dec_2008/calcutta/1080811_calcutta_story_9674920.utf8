	Bengals first private medical college has been accused of discriminating against candidates seeking seats in the management quota but unable to deposit the entire course fee of over Rs 22 lakh at admission time.        
	The allegation was raised after 30 of those who turned up for a counselling session at KPC Medical College on Sunday found their names missing from the revised management quota list. They were told that the original list of 107 names, selected after an entrance test, was only a provisional one.                   
	Nowhere was it mentioned that the list (uploaded to the colleges website on Friday) was provisional. We thought it was the final merit list and were prepared to admit our daughter, said a Ranchi-based parent who accompanied his daughter to the Jadavpur campus.         
	After coming here, we found a list that had the names of 77 candidates, but our daughters name did not feature in it.        
	Disappointed parents questioned whether only money had guaranteed each of those 77 students a seat in the first batch. One guardian said a college that was allegedly pressuring students to pay the entire course fee in the first year itself could not be expected to have a fair selection process.         
	No other medical college in the country, state-run or private, makes such demands. It was not possible for us to meet the authorities demands.        
	Some parents accused the institution of favouring those who were ready to make donations in addition to paying the stipulated course fee, which is almost four times the amount fixed for students from the state-level JEE quota.         
	The first batch of 150 students at KPC Medical College will have 50 from the JEE ranks and 23 from the NRI quota.        
	The college disputed allegations about money being the deciding factor. The entire admission process is transparent and there is no question of any irregularity, said C.R. Maity, the chief adviser of KPC Medical College.         
	On whether management-quota candidates were being forced to pay over Rs 22 lakh during admission, he said: Crores of rupees have been invested for the development of infrastructure, and we are only requesting the candidates to pay Rs 22 lakh. However, there is no compulsion and they can pay in instalments.        
	There was trouble on the Salt Lake campus of Jadavpur University, too, with around 200 students and their guardians holding a demonstration against alleged irregularities in engineering admissions. They broke 18 chairs.         
	The protesting students had been turned back from a scheduled round of counselling on July 12 on the ground that there were no more seats left in any engineering institution. But another group of students who had turned up for counselling the next day were allowed to fill up forms, triggering allegations about foul play.         
	The chairman of the central selection committee, Sidhartha Dutta, said everyone who filled up application forms had been given the opportunity to attend counselling.

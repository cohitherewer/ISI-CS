          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 26-year-old salesman who was beaten up on Sunday night by an uncle of the girl he loved hanged himself in his Goabagan Street home on Monday morning.        
	Raja Dass affair with 18-year-old Geeta (name changed) was known in the locality and he had found it difficult to accept her recent engagement to another man, said police. The girls family opposed the match, said city detective chief Jawed Shamim.        
	On Sunday night, the youth went to meet the girl secretly. An elderly neighbour, Taraknath Das, saw the incident. Around 12.30am, Raja was waiting outside Geetas window. She probably took longer than usual to step out, so he tried to sneak a peek through a window. The curtain came off in the process. Geetas uncle Ram Prasad Rajak, who was sleeping in the room, woke up and came out running, he said.        
	According to Das, Rajak abused and thrashed the youth. A weeping Geeta came out a little later and denied any involvement with Raja.        
	He went back to the slum room he shared with his brothers Asim, 35, who sells old medical books, and Kalua, 32, a poultry dealer, around 1am.        
	Kalua and I left the room around 7.30am. When we returned half an hour later, the door was locked from inside. We broke in to find Rajas body hanging from the ceiling, said Asim.        
	He was very shy and emotional. The girls family is responsible for his untimely death, alleged Rajas cousin Anita Rao.

	A fire broke out on the mezzanine floor of a share-trading firms office in central Calcutta on Tuesday afternoon. Five fire engines took more than 90 minutes to douse the flames.         
	According to a senior fire services officer, a short circuit caused the fire in Mangalam (B) at 26 Hemanta Basu Sarani. Documents and computers were damaged.        
	Thick black smoke proved a bigger problem than the flames. Our officers had to use a breathing apparatus to enter the office and locate the fire. As there was no outlet, the smoke accumulated inside the office. The firemen did not find any fire fighting arrangements inside the building, said Gopal Bhattacharjee, the director general of West Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.        
	The firemen removed the air-conditioners to let out the smoke and used jets of water to douse the flames.         
	The fire was first noticed around 1pm by employees of Motilal Oswal, the share-trading firm. The building, which also houses offices of a bank, an insurance company and two newspapers, was evacuated through the only entry and exit point.         
	There was a commotion around 1.05pm. When we stepped out we saw thick black smoke all around. We rushed downstairs, said Amit Desai, an employee of the insurance company.         
	According to the fire brigade officers, the 1,000 sq ft office of the share trading firm is situated on the ground floor but the owners constructed the mezzanine floor. There were more than 50 computers in the office. The firm has over 30 employees. Thousands of clients visit the office daily.

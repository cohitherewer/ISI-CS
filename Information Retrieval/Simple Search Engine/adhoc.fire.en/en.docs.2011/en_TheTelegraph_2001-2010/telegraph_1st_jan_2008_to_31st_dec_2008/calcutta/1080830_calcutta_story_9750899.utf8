                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ray of hope for poor but bright students

	Sampriti Samanta, from a Bankura village, would have had to discontinue studies after scoring 87 per cent in Madhyamik 2006 but for a monthly scholarship of Rs 500. She secured 91 per cent in HS 2008. Now, she is studying chemistry honours at Bethune College.        
	The same scholarship helped Sushobhan Maity, who had obtained 87.5 per cent in Madhyamik 2006, continue with his Plus-II studies. The Bankura boy went on to score 92 per cent in mathematics in HS in 2008 and is now studying honours in the subject at RK Mission Residential College, Narendrapur.        
	Meritorious but poor students like Sampriti and Sushobhan now see a glimmer of hope in the efforts of a group of research scholars from in and around the city, many of whom are settled abroad.        
	The scholars have formed Rakshabandhan for Education (RFE), which has 250 members and 150 donors, and provide a monthly scholarship of Rs 500 to students who score 85 per cent or more in Madhyamik and whose monthly family income is less than Rs 2,000.         
	The support continues till the students write their Plus-II exams.        
	We have volunteers in the city and districts who visit the houses of poor but meritorious students. The scholarship is provided quarterly as that helps us assess the progress of the students, said Kaustuv Dutta Chowdhury, an RFE member and a research fellow at the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology.        
	The organisation that started journey in 2006 supporting 26 students will announce 200 scholarships on Saturday. Our members and donors have increased manifold over the past two years, said Chittaranjan Sinha, the RFE secretary and a teacher of Jadavpur University.        
	The group plans to continue with the support even after the students pass the Plus-II exams. Students like Sampriti and Sushobhan need such help.        
	Sampritis father, a farmer, earns about Rs 1,000 a month but the girl has to cough up Rs 1,760 a month for hostel accommodation. Sushobhans father is neck-deep in debt trying to send Rs 1,400 to his son every month.

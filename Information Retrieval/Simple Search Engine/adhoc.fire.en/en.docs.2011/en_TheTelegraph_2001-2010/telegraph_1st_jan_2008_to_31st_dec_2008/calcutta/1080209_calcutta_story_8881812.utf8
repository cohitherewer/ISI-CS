The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Panther to shield airport from fire 
                                                                                                            Panther to shield airport from fire

	Calcutta airport is revamping its fire-fighting system by bringing in state-of-the-art tenders from Austria.        
	Post-upgrade, we will be able to deploy more than one tender if a major fire, like the one in Burrabazars Nandaram Market, breaks out in the city, said an Airports Authority of India (AAI) official.        
	We could send only one tender to battle the Nandaram blaze, as sparing more would have compromised the fire-fighting preparedness at the airport, he added.        
	The AAI has procured 16 high-speed tenders, called Panther, which could put off an aircraft blaze within a few seconds. Manufactured by Austria-based Rosenbaur, a Panther costs Rs 4 crore.        
	Of the 16 Panthers, five are for Calcutta, a Rosenbaur spokesperson told Metro from Leoning, Austria. Two have reached the airport and the rest are on their way. The company started manufacturing Panthers last year and 100 have so far been sold to airports across the world.        
	A Panther can reach a speed of 80 kph in 27 seconds. Its maximum speed is 110 kph. If an aircraft fire cannot be doused in 140 seconds, it will lead to an explosion, said A.K. Chakraborty, the senior manager (fire) at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.        
	So, if an aircraft catches fire on the runway, tenders have to rush to it before the critical deadline and start spraying water mixed with foam. Panthers will help us tackle such emergencies better, Chakraborty pointed out.        
	A Panther can store 12,500 litres of water and 1,500 litres of foam, against the existing tenders (German-made Tetra) that can store 7,000 litres of water each.        
	The new tender can spray 5,000 litres of water and 50,000 litres of foam-mixed water in a minute. The Tetras, one of which was sent to Burrabazar, can spray only 3,000 litres of water in a minute. There are five such tenders at Calcutta airport .        
	Panthers have automatic control on main functions and special arrangements for precise application of extinguishing agents.         
	They are equipped with infra-red cameras that can locate the source of fire even in thick smoke. A Panther is designed in such a way that six persons can enter or leave it within 10 seconds, said a senior official at Calcutta airport.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Deadline looms for stay or surrender
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Deadline looms for stay or surrender
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Pappu and (below) Ashok Todi            
	The elusive Todi brothers and Anil Saraogi may move the sessions court on Friday seeking a stay on the execution of the arrest warrants against them.        
	If the prayer is not granted, the trio will have no other option but to surrender before court, said Deepnarayan Mitra, a lawyer for the accused.        
	The Bankshal court had on Monday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Ashok and Pradip Todi and their relative Saraogi in connection with the Rizwanur Rahman death case. They have been missing since.        
	The CBI has charged the trio and four others, including three police officers who are on bail, of driving the youth to suicide. Rizwanur had married Ashok Todis daughter Priyanka against her familys wishes.        
	We will move the city sessions court tomorrow seeking a stay on the execution of the warrants. If the plea is not granted, our clients will surrender before an appropriate court, said Mitra.        
	The CBI, however, is confident that the sessions court would reject the Todis plea for a stay. Let them file the petition. We are sure it will be rejected, said an official.        
	The investigating agency has intensified its nationwide search for the trio.        
	We have circulated their photographs to our centres across the country. We have got some leads on the trios whereabouts and are trying to arrest them, a senior CBI official said over the phone from Delhi.        
	If the Todis and Saraogi do not turn up by November 3, the official added, the agency will move court seeking attachment of their properties.        
	Once their properties are attached, they will have to surrender. From the very beginning, they have been trying to delay the proceedings.        
	Bail plea: Syed Mohiuddin, alias Pappu, one of the seven accused in the case, sent a notice to the CBI on Thursday saying he would move a bail plea before the sessions court on Friday. He is now in judicial custody. We have received the notice. Our lawyer will be present in the court tomorrow to oppose the petition, said a CBI official.

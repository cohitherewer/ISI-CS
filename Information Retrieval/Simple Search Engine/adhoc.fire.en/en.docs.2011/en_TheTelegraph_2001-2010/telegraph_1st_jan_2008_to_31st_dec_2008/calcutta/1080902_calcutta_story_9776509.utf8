	With every party out to fulfil its own agenda, politics has become the favourite battleground for everyone, from the businessman to the criminal.               
	On August 25, Abhinav Bharati High School hosted the 10th HP Lohia Memorial Inter School Debate Competition at Gyan Manch, where students fought it out on the oft-contended topic politics has emerged as the most profitable business in the country.         
	The chief guest was Tapati Basu, head of journalism and mass communication, Calcutta University.        
	The participants included DPS Ruby Park, Assembly of God Church, Park Street, St Xaviers School, Army Public school, Apeejay School, Park Street, Mahadevi Birla Girls Higher Secondary School, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy (LSA) and the hosts. Two speakers from every school spoke for and against the motion each.         
	Class XI student Somsubhra Banerjee of St Xaviers, speaking against the motion, felt that politics was a profitable business, but only because the people have made it so.         
	We are the ones who bring corrupt people to power, and allow them to continue to serve their own agenda at the cost of the people, he said.        
	 Aditi Singhvi of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy bagged the best speaker award speaking against the motion, with the quip: Politics is service before self, while business is self before service. LSA was chosen the best team, with speaker Sahiba Dhandhania ably accompanying Aditi.         
	She cited instances of politicians living it up with the taxpayers hard-earned money.         
	Politicians who have landed in jail for their malpractice, continue to maintain a luxurious lifestyle there, while the Congress has been accused of buying votes to remain in power.

	Thundering applause filled Gyan Manch as trailers of animation film Roadside Romeo and games like Assassin and Prototype were screened for animation students of Maya Academy of Advanced Cinematics (MAAC) and other institutes on August 28. The event was a workshop  Animation For Those Who Cannot Draw  organised by MAAC, the academic wing of Maya Entertainment.   
	Addressing the seminar, chief creative officer of MAAC Sanjiv Waerkar spoke about the growing career opportunities offered by the animation industry. Students can take up post-production, gaming, broadcasting or website-making jobs.         
	One need not be an artist to be an animator. What is required is sharp observation skills to produce good animation work, said Waerkar, adding that an animator should also have basic knowledge about acting, cinematography and lights that can be used as reference points.         
	In eastern India, the animation industry is in a nascent stage, but we wish to explore the possibilities. India is getting a lot of animation-related jobs outsourced from the West. We hope to make our presence felt internationally soon. As more projects come our way, we hope to create more job opportunities in the East too, says Waerkar.         
	Now MAAC has three branches in Calcutta. Another is slated to open at Chowringee in mid-September. At present, we have 60 branches across India. We wish to touch the 100 mark by the end of this fiscal year, says Abir Aich, associate director, academics, MAAC.         
	The workshop was very educative. We realised how important it is to think on your feet to be a successful animator, said Suparna Ganguly, an animation student.         
	Another student Nancy Agarwal added: We also learnt about the gaming industry and the career prospects it holds.         
	Four students also screened an impromptu five-minute film made by them at the workshop. It focused on the difference in lifestyle and body language of a college student and an office goer. It was followed by an audience interaction.

	Hiranmoy Roys father is a daily wage earner at a construction site. Despite facing acute financial crisis, this student of mechanical engineering at Jadavpur University (JU) dreams of a great career.         
	Raju Mukherjee, studying pharmaceutical engineering in JU, is eager to shoulder his mason fathers economic burden. Many like Hiranmoy and Raju, whose parents do not earn more than Rs 1,500 a month, had gathered at Kala Kunj auditorium in the second week of August to receive scholarships from Seva Mandir, an organisation run by non-resident Indians to help poor students pursue higher studies. One hundred and seventy of them were awarded scholarships this year, including 13 physically challenged students.         
	The cash prizes ranged from Rs 12,000 per annum for engineering students to Rs 3,000 per annum for those who have taken their board exams. The money is issued every six months, with scholarships of promising students renewed.        
	The event at Kala Kunj was inaugurated by chief guest Swami Tathagata Maharaj, in charge of Ramakrishna Mission, New York. We dont just help students with good marks but those with the zeal to perform better, said Nilanjan Mitra, a member of Seva Mandir.

	Whats on your mind this week  Sporting nation  
	The Tricolour going up at the Beijing Olympics was a very emotional moment for all Indians. Yes, we are getting ready for a revolution as far as the sporting scene is concerned. Indias dream run in the Olympics (one gold and two bronze) could not have been better timed. A couple of days ago, Bhaichung Bhutia and his men sealed Indias berth for the 2011 Asia Cup. We have come a long way for a nation that has always been tagged as nonsporting. There is no dearth of sporting talent here. Only, the Centre needs to realise that cricket is not our only sport and provide better infrastructure for other disciplines too.

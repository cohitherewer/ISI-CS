	An armed gang robbed cash and valuables worth Rs 2 lakh from a house in Mahamayatala, on the citys southern fringes, after injuring the owner and his mother on Monday night.        
	As soon as my mother opened the door on hearing the knock around 9pm, three youths in their 20s barged in. The others were standing guard outside, recalled Rathin Mondal, the house-owner.        
	The trio asked my mother for the keys to the almirahs. After she refused, one of them hit her with a revolver-butt. As I rushed out on hearing her screams, the goons started beating me on the head with a dagger, added Rathin, a trader, who lives in the house with his mother and newly-married wife.        
	The Mondals then handed over the keys to the men, who opened the almirahs in Rathins bedroom and his mothers room and took away cash, jewellery, a cellphone and a camera.        
	They probably knew that the valuables were kept in the house. The youths were all speaking in Bengali, said Rathins mother Tarubala.        
	After the gang left, the Mondals raised an alarm. Neighbours rushed in and called Sonarpur police station. Finger-print experts visited the house on Tuesday.        
	The criminals were likely to be from neighbouring areas, said South 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar.

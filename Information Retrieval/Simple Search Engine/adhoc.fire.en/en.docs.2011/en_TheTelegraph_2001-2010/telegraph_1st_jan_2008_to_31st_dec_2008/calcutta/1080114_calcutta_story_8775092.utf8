	Carpe Diem did deliver what it had promised  a weekend packed with fun and revelry at the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta.
    
	The three-day annual cultural fest, organised in association with The Telegraph, saw the participation of 97 colleges like the IITs in Kharagpur and Guwahati, NIFT, Presidency College and St Xaviers College.
    
	The fest started on Friday evening with Live Counterstrike, an inter-hostel competition.
    
	Day II saw the participating institutions compete with each other in the preliminary rounds of a number of fun events, including Footloose, a choreography contest, and Mish-Mash, during which the contestants performed with unknown partners to constantly changing music.
    
	The other highlights of the day were the prelims of Razmatazz, a fashion show where those with a penchant for designing vied for the best designer crown, and Aria, an English solo singing contest.
    
	The surprise event of the day was Run Joka Run, a treasure hunt across the campus.
    
	The Street Play contest, won by IIT Kharagpur, showcased the best of dramatic talents among the participants.
    
	A major draw at Carpe Diem 2008 was Armageddon, a rock band contest that saw registration of 80 bands from the city as well as Bangalore Delhi and Chennai. Sixteen bands finally battled it out in the contest, which continued into the final day and was judged by veteran musicians, including Monojit Dutta of Orient Express.
    
	Those more comfortable in the virtual world pitted their wits with one another in Apocalypse, a multiplayer network gaming competition.
    
	From speed trip to stealth operation, the contest had something on offer for every gaming enthusiast.
    
	Sunday was the D-day for the winners of the prelims. 
    
	Carpocopiens, an independent group (not associated with any particular college), was declared the winner of Razmatazz, which was judged by fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee. The team won Rs 50,000.
    
	The Bhawanipur Education Society team won Rs 30,000 as Footloose champion.

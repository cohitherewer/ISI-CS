  - Reckless amp; abusive driver slapped and hauled to police station        A STAFF REPORTER                          Beauty Pal recounts how she taught the auto-driver a lesson after he rammed into her foot and then hurled abuse at her.

	An auto-rickshaw driver learnt a lesson in road manners the hard way on Wednesday  at the hands of a woman enraged.        
	Beauty Pal, 44, slapped an errant auto driver, grabbed him by the collar and hauled him to the police station.        
	The mother of three accused him of driving recklessly, ramming into her foot and then hurling abuse at her.        
	A large office-time crowd that had gathered to see the woman taking on the auto driver and some of his comrades did nothing to help her, Pal later alleged.        
	Not every day do we see a woman standing up against the goonda raj of autos in the city. We have arrested the auto driver Sheikh Bobby based on her complaint, said a senior official of New Market police station.         
	Like any given weekday, Pal got off a bus at 10.15am in front of Elite cinema on SN Banerjee Road.        
	The Muchipara resident was on her way to the New Market office of a private firm where she works as a senior accountant.        
	As usual, the bus stopped in the middle of the road and so I had to cross a stretch to reach the pavement, said Pal. An empty auto was speeding towards me. I signalled for it to slow down but it did not.        
	The auto steered by Sheikh Bobby, a driver on the Chandni Chowk-Park Circus route, came straight at Pal and the front tyre hit her right ankle.        
	I protested, demanding an explanation from the auto-driver. Instead of apologising or inquiring about my injury, he started yelling at me. He blamed me for the accident, using filthy and abusive language. Something inside me just snapped... recalled Pal.        
	She yelled back and then slapped the auto-driver. Not once, but repeatedly.        
	Pal then boarded his auto and ordered him to drive to the New Market police station. Sheikh Bobby refused to budge but the feisty woman too did not back down.        
	Suddenly I saw some auto drivers stopping their vehicles and rushing towards me. They ganged up and started abusing and heckling me. A crowd had gathered but nobody came forward to help me, she said.        
	But that did not deter Pal, who kept shouting back and slapping the driver.        
	Before Bobby knew what had hit him, Pal managed to drag him to the police station not far from where she had been hit by the auto.        
	We have arrested the auto-rickshaw driver under sections 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering personal safety of others), said an officer of the New Market police station.        
	Protesting the arrest of Sheikh Bobby, more than 50 auto-rickshaws then blocked the Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road-SN Banerjee Road crossing for more than 30 minutes causing a traffic snarl in the area.        
	Later in the evening, nursing her injured ankle  a heavy sprain, according to a Calcutta Medical College doctor  in her Muchipara residence, Pal said she often protests when auto and taxi drivers misbehave with passengers.        
	Everyone else keeps quiet, but I just have to show them they cant keep bullying us all the time, stressed the woman who is on medication for hypertension.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Station swindle by men in uniform
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Four men, three in Government Railway Police (GRP) uniform and one dressed like a ticket checker, allegedly took away Rs 21,500 from a mason while conducting a security check at Sealdah station on Saturday night.        
	Sadiqul Alam, in his late-20s, then had to run from pillar to post for 15 hours to lodge a complaint with the Sealdah GRP.        
	The complaint said the four men had told him that the notes were forged and he would be put behind bars if he raised an alarm.The policemen and the ticket checker cheated me but when I went to lodge a complaint, no one was willing to listen, said Sadiqul.        
	Pranab Kumar Mitra, the officer-in-charge of Sealdah GRP, said he would ascertain why it took over 15 hours to lodge the complaint. We will also verify the complainants claims. If necessary, the GRP men and ticket checkers who were on duty on Saturday night will appear before Sadiqul so that he can identify the culprits.        
	Sadiqul reached the city from Midnapore, where he was working in a construction project, on Saturday night and bought train tickets for Lalgola, Murshidabad. The money he was carrying was to be distributed to labourers who were helping him in the project.        
	As I was walking towards platform 6 to board the Sealdah-Lalgola passenger, three RPF men and another wearing a black coat stopped me. They told me that they would search my bag and the pockets of my trousers, said Sadiqul.         
	He opened his bag. One of the policemen took out the bundle of notes and asked me where I got the money from. I told him that it was for paying labourers who had worked for me in Midnapore. But they refused to believe me and took away the money, he added.        
	The four then snatched away Sadiquls cellphone and melted into the crowd, threatening to put the mason behind bars for life if he raised an alarm.        
	Sadiqul went to the ticket checkers room. I narrated the incident but the ticket checkers did not pay any heed. I went to the GRP office and was shooed away.        
	After failing to file a complaint despite repeated attempts, Sadiqul called his maternal uncle Sheikh Phoolchand, who reached Sealdah on Sunday morning. We met the officer-in-charge of GRP, Sealdah, and narrated to him the incident. He finally registered a complaint, said Phoolchand.

                      Myth, allusion and reality                    Intuitive imagination is the cornerstone of the paintings of young artist Barun Chowdhury. Relying greatly on animal imagery, his works evoke allegorical significance even to the lay, careless viewer. The Season of Discontent, the ongoing solo show of his paintings, finds him self-consciously applying a strategy of draping reality in a mythic veil. By deliberately juxtaposing and arranging incongruous forms and objects, Chowdhury presents an unrealistic and abstract view of the world in his compositions. Interestingly, they only serve to emphasise that his imaginary world is an allegory of his real-life experiences. Dealing with themes ranging from the intensely personal to social, political and environmental concerns, his paintings reveal rare sensitivity of understanding coupled with remarkable maturity of expression.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Barun Chowdhury When: Till April 27; 11 am - 7 pm Where: Aakriti Art Gallery, 12/3A Hungerford Street, 1st floor

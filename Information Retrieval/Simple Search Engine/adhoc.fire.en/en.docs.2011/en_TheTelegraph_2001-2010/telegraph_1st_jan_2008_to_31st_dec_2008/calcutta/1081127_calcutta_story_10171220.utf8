                CPM MLA Rabin Mondal demanded in the Assembly on Wednesday that Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim set up a committee to probe allegations that Trinamul MLA Javed Khan was involved in the Rizwanur Rahman death case. The Speaker, however, said the matter should be raised in the presence of Khan, who was not around when Mondal raised his demand. You can serve a notice, which can be discussed, Halim told the MLA.    An additional pair of Sealdah-Barrackpore local will be introduced from December1 to ease commuter rush. The Up train will leave at 6.48am and the Down train at 7.40am.     Over 120 supporters of the Pragatishil Indira Congress were arrested on Wednesday as they were marching towards Writers Buildings. They were demanding supplementary examinations for unsuccessful undergraduate students of Calcutta University, police said. The protesters were later released.     A 50-year-old resident of Beleghata, Shanti Mondol, was arrested in Salt Lake for selling banned tortoise meat in a park behind Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan School. Residents informed the police, who arrested Mondol and seized a tortoise.    Around 18 shanties were gutted in Nivedita Pally beside the Bagjola canal on Wednesday.

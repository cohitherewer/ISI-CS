	A cloud cover led to the maximum temperature dropping to 20.7 degree Celsius, six degrees below normal, on Sunday.        
	A cyclonic circulation over Bangladesh and parts of Bengal caused the clouds, which are likely to stay for at least 36 hours, said Met officials. Humidity had caused a low cloud cover over the city last week.

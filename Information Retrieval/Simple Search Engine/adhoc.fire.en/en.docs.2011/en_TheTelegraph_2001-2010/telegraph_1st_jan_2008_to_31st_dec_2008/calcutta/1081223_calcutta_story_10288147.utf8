          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A mob ransacked Swadesh Basu Hospital in Thakurpukur and allegedly manhandled the staff on Monday after a woman delivered a stillborn.        
	The family of Sima Demonty, 26, accused her gynaecologist of being responsible for the babys death. Her father-in-law said the hospital had informed him on Sunday that the baby was dead but advised a normal delivery.        
	When Sima delivered a stillborn on Monday morning, her family members and relatives blamed Dr Jaba Basak for the incident. They then allegedly turned violent, forcing the hospital to call in the police.        
	Hospital superintendent S.N. Chatterjee said the baby died in the womb because of medical reasons rather than negligence. Superintendent of police Ajey Ranade denied that Simas relatives were assaulted without provocation. We took action because the hospital was being ransacked.

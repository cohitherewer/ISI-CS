          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 35-year-old man was found hanging from an overhead post near rail tracks in Howrah on Wednesday morning.        
	Amit Sur, a resident of north Calcuttas Shyampukur Street, was found dead between Bally Halt and Rajchandrapur stations in Howrah. A a case of unnatural death has been started.        
	Sankar Singha, the superintendent of railway police, said: We are investigating why the man chose a railway post for committing suicide, how he reached the spot and whether there was any foul play.        
	The police have recovered an empty liquor bottle from the spot.        
	Amits body was spotted by passengers of Dankuni and Sealdah-bound trains. After they sounded an alert, local residents informed the police who established his identity and contacted his relatives.        
	The police said Amit, who ran a tailoring shop in Baranagar, lived with his sister Sagarika.        
	Amar, his elder brother, said: We are five brothers and two sisters. All of us attended a get-together at my home in Dum Dum on Tuesday.         
	Amar said that around 8pm, Amit told them that he had to visit Birati and promised to come back in a couple of hours.         
	When he did not return even after midnight, we lodged a missing diary with the Dum Dum police. Next morning, the Belur GRP informed us of the tragedy, he added.        
	Apart from Amit, all of us are married. We attended the family gathering with our families. Amit appeared normal and was laughing and joking with the kids, Amar said.        
	No one in the family had any idea if Amit was suffering from depression or had any financial problems.

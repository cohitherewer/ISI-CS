	An overfed child from a well-off family can suffer from malnutrition if he doesnt get a proper breakfast.        
	Paritosh Chatterjee, an engineer, learnt this when he took his seven-year-old boy, who was becoming weaker by the day, to a doctor.        
	We had been giving him whatever he wanted to eat. Yet, he was losing strength. We were shocked to hear that he was suffering from malnutrition, said Paritosh.        
	Experts warn that bad or inadequate breakfast, coupled with a late-to-bed-and-early-to-rise schedule, is a primary reason for malnutrition among children.        
	The trend is disturbing. It doesnt matter what your income is or how much you are stuffing your kids with all day. If a child is denied a proper breakfast or doesnt get enough time to digest dinner, malnutrition will set in, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of Institute of Child Health.        
	An increasing number of children from well-off families are coming with symptoms of malnutrition, Ghosh added. At least 25 to 30 per cent of the children in the age group of five to 10 are suffering from malnutrition as they do not eat a proper breakfast.        
	Case studies reveal that kids who go to bed late and wake up early for school are most vulnerable to malnutrition. An average school-going child gets up at 5am and leaves for school at 6. In between, he hardly gets time to eat a proper breakfast, pointed out Ghosh.        
	Many a time, a child who doesnt get a proper breakfast is stuffed with food during the rest of the day. But this either results in obesity or digestive problems, Ghosh said.        
	Paediatrician Debasis Biswas said an improper breakfast also makes a child irritable. If a child does not eat a proper breakfast, his energy level decreases.        
	He has been treating an increasing number of kids suffering from poor concentration and irritability because of being denied a proper breakfast.

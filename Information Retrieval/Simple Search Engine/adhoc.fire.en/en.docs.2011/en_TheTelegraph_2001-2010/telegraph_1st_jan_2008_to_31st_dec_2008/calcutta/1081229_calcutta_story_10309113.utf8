                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cruise with Lord on lips
  - City group to marry spirituality amp; sightseeing on US ship          POULOMI BANERJEE                          Lord Vishnu and Disneys Mickey                                        
	Lord Vishnu is going to Disneyland.        
	After testing the waters of Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean, the Shrimad Bhagwat Katha is to set sail for the US of A in the summer of 09.        
	Steering the Bhagwat-on-sea sojourn  enumerating the life-stories of Lord Vishnus incarnations  is Shree Om Saarthi, a socio-religious organisation, from its office on Mahatma Gandhi Road. Two years ago we had organised a cruise to Southeast Asia and a year back we took some tourists on a Mediterranean cruise to Europe where we had meditation sessions and Bhagwat readings in the evening, said J.P. Toshniwal of Shree Om Saarthi.        
	The 10-year-old group started out by organising Ramayan readings on the Maidan. Someone suggested that the Bhagwat should be read on jal, sthal and vayu (water, land and air), and so the idea of a cruise was born, added Toshniwal.        
	For the Atlanta (Alaska) Princess Star Cruise, in May 2009, Shree Om Saarthi has tied up with two travel agencies  Club M Holidays and Gainwell Enterprises. The 20-day tour starts at Buffalo for the Niagara Falls, heads off to New York, then moves to Orlando for Disneyland, before flying to Seattle from where the seven-day cruise begins. The ship will stop at Juneau, Skagway, Ketchikan, Victoria British Columbia, and then Seattle. The tour party will visit Las Vegas and Los Angeles, before returning to India, said Mandira Kapoor of Club M. The Bhagwat-topped trip will cost approximately Rs 2,75,000.        
	The Bhagwat is a hit among the elderly and it is sure to lure some foreigners, said Toshniwal. Every evening there will be a half-an-hour meditation session followed by the three-hour Shrimad Bhagwat Katha. Prahlad Dutt Lata, a hotelier, is preparing for his third Bhagwat cruise. This is the perfect getaway for me.

          A STAFF REPORTER                            Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti                                 
	The state government issued a statement on Wednesday condemning the Trinamul Congresss role in the Charu Market incident.        
	It is unfortunate that an Opposition party supported violent activities organised by anti-socials in the Charu Market incident. The government would not tolerate any sort of provocative activity that would disturb the law and order in the state, read a statement by the information and cultural affairs department.        
	The statement  the first of its kind in recent times  came three days after Mamata Banerjee organised a rally and threatened to gherao Lalbazar police headquarters. She had described police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti as an active member of the ruling CPM.        
	The leader of the Opposition, Partha Chatterjee, allegedly called up Chakrabarti and threatened him saying he would set the state on fire if the Trinamul activists arrested in connection with the mob violence were not released.On October 5, policemen jostled with residents after a private bus overturned in the Charu Market area. A group of men, allegedly led by Trinamul Congress legislator Arup Biswass brother Swarup, later attacked Charu Market police station and set two motorcycles and two police vehicles on fire.         
	The government also condemned the language used against the police commissioner by the Trinamul.         
	When asked about the note, state home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said he did not want to add anything to the statement.        
	The general secretary of Trinamul and MP, Mukul Roy, said: Our leader has announced the agitation programme. We are not going to tolerate police high-handedness, which was evident in the Charu Market incident. We know how to deal with the police commissioner.

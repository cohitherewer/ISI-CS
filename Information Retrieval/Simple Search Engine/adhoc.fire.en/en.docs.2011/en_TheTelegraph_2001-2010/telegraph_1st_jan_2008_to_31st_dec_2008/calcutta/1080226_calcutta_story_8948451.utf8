                Bidhannagar Municipality on Monday decided to collect property tax from residents from fiscal 2008-09. Collection of property tax in the township had stopped after an apex court verdict in May 2007, criticising the process of the tax calculation. It is not possible for us to run a township without property tax, as it is one of the main sources of revenue for any municipality. So, a decision was taken to resume the collection. We will collect the tax on an ad hoc basis and the amount will be adjusted later, said Biswajiban Majumdar, the chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality.  omnath Mukherjee, the financial officer of the civic body, said legal advice would be sought on matters like calculation procedure and how the residents would be sent the bill.

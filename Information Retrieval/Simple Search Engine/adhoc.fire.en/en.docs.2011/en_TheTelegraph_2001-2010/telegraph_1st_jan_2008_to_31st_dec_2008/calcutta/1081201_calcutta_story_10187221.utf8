          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 14-year-old girl set herself ablaze in her Behala home on Saturday night after faring badly in her half-yearly examination.         
	Mallika Sen was taken to Vidyasagar Hospital where she succumbed to her injuries early on Sunday. She had suffered more than 90 per cent burns.        
	The Class IX student of Barisha Girls High School had been depressed since getting her half-yearly result on Saturday afternoon. She had fared badly in several subjects.         
	Around 9.45pm, when Mallikas mother Roma was watching television in their JK Pal Road home and her father Nil Ratan was in his PCO booth, the teenager went to the kitchen, took a can of kerosene and went into the toilet, said an officer of Behala police station.        
	Her mother noticed smoke coming out of the toilet. When she could not find Mallika elsewhere in the house, she ran to a neighbours house and sought help, added the officer.        
	Residents broke open the door and found the girl in flames.        
	We wrapped her in two blankets and took her to hospital in a taxi. The upper part of her body, including her face, was badly burnt, said a neighbour.        
	The investigators are trying to find out if Mallika had been scolded by her parents.

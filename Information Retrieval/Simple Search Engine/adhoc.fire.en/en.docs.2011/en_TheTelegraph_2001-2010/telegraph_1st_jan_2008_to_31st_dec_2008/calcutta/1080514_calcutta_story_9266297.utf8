	A 17-year-old girl cycling to her private tutorial class was run over by an oil tanker overtaking another from the wrong side on Andul Road on Tuesday morning.        
	The tanker brushed Subhra Patras bicycle and as she fell, crushed her head under its rear wheels.         
	The Class XII student of a local school died instantly.         
	The teenager was accompanied by her classmate Priya Sardar, who also studies in the Nityanandanagar tutorial.         
	Priya recounted: We were cycling side by side. Subhra moved ahead about 10 feet to allow a tanker to pass. Suddenly, another tanker tried to overtake the first one from the the wrong side and hit Subhras cycle. Her head was smashed. The girl passed out at the sight.        
	Bystanders took Subhra to Howrah District Hospital, where doctors pronounced her dead on arrival.         
	The driver of the tanker fled, leaving the vehicle behind. Residents put up a road block to protest the mishap.        
	We have impounded the tanker and are looking for the driver. He will be in our custody in a couple of days, said an officer of Nazirganj investigation centre.         
	Subhras body was handed over to her father Tarun, a trader, in the afternoon, after post-mortem.         
	Her mother Sujata, who is the BJP candidate in Wednesdays panchayat polls at Podhra, in Sankrail, was inconsolable.        
	Subhra returned home from a tutorial class around 9.40am. I was about to leave for campaigning and asked her not to go for the second tuition. But she bathed, wore a pink salwar-kameez, had a couple of biscuits and left. She never wanted to miss her classes, said Sujata, who received a call from a neighbour 15 minutes later, informing her that her daughter was dead.         
	Subhra passed Madhyamik with over 80 per cent marks in four subjects. She had also done well in the Class XI annual examination.         
	Her friends said she was a good singer and adept at using computers.        
	Prabal Naskar, the head teacher of Thana Makua Model High School, where Subhra studied, described her as a brilliant student who was also very well-behaved.        
	Subhras body was taken to her school in the afternoon. The head teacher and managing committee members of the school took part in the funeral procession.

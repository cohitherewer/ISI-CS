     A STAFF REPORTER
                  
	Five people, who were allegedly part of a racket in collecting money from unemployed youths by promising them railways jobs, have been arrested.
    
	The men include the suspected mastermind duo, who produce television serials. Fake appointment letters, railway seals and other documents have been found in their hideouts, which were raided over the past four days.
    
	Deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim said the accused had taken Rs 1-1.5 lakh from more than a dozen youths between July and October this year. They even conducted false medical tests with the help of private healthcare units and handed over fake appointment letters.
    
	The first three arrested were identified as Ajit Kumar Barnwal, Anuj Kumar and Parveen Chawdhury. Barnwal, who hails from Bihar, was picked up from a central Calcutta hotel, while Anuj and Parveen, who are from Patna, were picked up from a flat on Keshub Sen Street, added Shamim.
    
	The trio told the police that they worked under Shamsul Haque and Pramod Kumar Tiwari. We arrested Haque, a resident of Shibpur in Howrah, and Tiwari, who stays in Behala, in Marquis Street, said an officer of the detective department.
    
	Haque and Tiwari own an office in Chandni Chowk, from where they worked on television serials, said the officer.
    
	Shamim said raids would be carried out on the presses where the fake appointment letters were printed. We will also raid the healthcare units where the false medical tests were conducted. Shamim ruled out the possibility of railway officials being involved in the racket.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A woman in her mid-20s lodged a police complaint alleging that an autorickshaw driver had outraged her modesty on Sunday evening.        
	A case was registered against the driver but he was not arrested till late on Sunday.        
	The Behala resident complained that the auto driver had molested her at Gariahat.        
	She boarded the Ballygunge station-bound auto at Deshapriya Park. But on reaching Gariahat, the driver refused to go any further and asked the woman to get off, said an officer of Gariahat police station.        
	The woman protested, asking the driver why he had not told her when she boarded the auto that he would not go till Ballygunge station.        
	The women refused to pay the fare for her journey from Deshapriya Park to Gariahat, resulting in an altercation between the two, the officer added.        
	The woman alleged that the driver then grabbed her and pushed her. I almost fell on the road, she said. The woman gave the registration number of the auto-rickshaw to the police, who launched a search for the driver.

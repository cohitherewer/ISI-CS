           Mind over matter
          Four artists of the contemporary generation have come together to showcase the fruits of their individual creative impulses at their ongoing exhibition. Dreams form the core of Sumita Maitys works. Her paintings appear to delve into the subconscious mind, uncovering hidden layers of emotion. Pradip Kumar Sau attempts to reveal mans inner identity and to resolve the conflicts that exist within the self. Anjan Coomars (a painting by him appears left) interest in spirituality finds expression in his works; they are marked by a quest for religious experience both in daily life and away from it. The paintings of Arpita Chandra present semi-abstract explorations of an imaginary, illusory universe.

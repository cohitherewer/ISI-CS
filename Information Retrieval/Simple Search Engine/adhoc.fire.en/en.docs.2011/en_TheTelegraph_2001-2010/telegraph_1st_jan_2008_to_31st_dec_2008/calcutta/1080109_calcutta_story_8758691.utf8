	Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) announced four housing projects in south Calcutta on Tuesday. Half the flats in one estate will be reserved for minority communities.        
	The estate, consisting of about 296 flats, will come up in East Calcutta Township near the Rashbehari connector in Kasba.         
	There will be 112 flats, of about 650 sq ft each, for the medium income group (MIG). They will cost between Rs 6.5 lakh and Rs 7.5 lakh each.        
	For the low income group (LIG), there will be 184 flats, about 375 sq ft each, priced between Rs 2.75 lakh and Rs 2.80 lakh.        
	Fifty per cent of the flats will be reserved for the minority sections. There will be facilities like childrens park and community hall in the estate, said state municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya at Unnayan Bhavan in Salt Lake on Tuesday.        
	The other projects will be at Baishnabghata Patuli. Eighty-two plots have been reserved for the MIG. In another project in the area, 244 flats will come up for the LIG.         
	About 150 plots of one cottah each will be handed over to those evicted for development projects undertaken by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and CMDA. The beneficiaries  who will have to pay less than Rs 50,000 for a plot  will include those evicted from Tollys Nullah. Plots for the projects will be allotted through a lottery.         
	The application kits for the four projects, costing Rs 200, will be available from Wednesday at three branches of Bank of India  Baghajatin Super Market, Ruby Park and Park Circus. Application kits will also be available at Unnayan Bhavan.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sachin spring in young steps
  - Day belongs to Little Master in cradles of cricket in Souravland           A STAFF REPORTER                          Sachin fans at a cricket camp in Eden Gardens on Friday afternoon. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Ronit Khazanchis link with Sachin Tendulkar on Friday afternoon was a cellphone. The 15-year-old was on a bus near the Maidan on his way to cricket practice when the Little Master ran a three at Mohali to become the highest run-scorer in Tests. Describing the steer to third man to Ronit over the phone was his father, glued to the television set in their Sonarpur home.         
	For the young Sachin fan, a running commentary could not compare to watching the feat live. When I left home, Sachin was yet to take guard. I really wanted to watch my favourite batsman race past Brian Lara and lift his bat to acknowledge the ovation, he rued.        
	It was the moment that moved Varun Ajmera, a student of La Martiniere for Boys. I felt like shaking Sachins hands and congratulating him. What he has achieved is incredible, said the 11-year-old. Once his hero scaled the peak, Varun picked up his bat and left for practice at the Ultra Plus Steel Balak Sangha School of Cricket.        
	The mood was euphoric at both coaching camps  not only due to Sachins record but also because his batting partner and local hero Sourav crossed 7,000 runs later in the day.        
	Souravs milestone is no doubt special but the day clearly belonged to Sachin. Its wonderful that the two great players were with each other in their moments of glory, said Sanjay Das, the director of Sourav Gangulys Videocon School of Cricket in Salt Lake.         
	According to Dipak Ghosh, one of the coaches at Balak Sangha in Bhowanipore, there was a spring in the steps of the children on Friday. They were all discussing Sachins achievement and contribution to the game during the break, he said.        
	Left-handed batsman Purab Joshi, who played for Bengal Under-16 last year, told everyone who cared to listen that Sachins domination was now complete. He has the highest number of runs and centuries in both forms of the game. He is the greatest. Period.

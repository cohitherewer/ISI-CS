  - 11-year-old Jackie Chan fan cycles to airport from Kasba          A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	An 11-year-old boy who set out for China from his Kasba home on a Hercules bicycle with Rs 1,300 in his pocket was sent home from Dum Dum airport on Wednesday.         
	CISF men became suspicious on seeing Sayantan (name changed) loiter around the international terminal on a bandh day. Under persistent questioning, the boy revealed that he had cycled six hours down EM Bypass and VIP Road to catch a flight to China so that he could meet Jackie Chan and watch the Beijing Olympics.         
	Sraboni (name changed), who later picked up her son from the airport, said Sayantan is an avid Jackie Chan fan and watches a lot of martial arts movies. He left home in a red T-shirt and jeans, school bag on back, around 7am.         
	I thought he would cycle inside our housing estate as he does on all holidays, said Sraboni, who started looking for the boy when he did not return after two hours. Sayantans father, a doctor at a state-run hospital who did not return home on Tuesday night because of the bandh, kept calling home to find out about their son.         
	Airport security personnel spotted him around 1pm. It seemed the boy had fled his home and so we took him to the airport police station, said a CISF officer.         
	The boy initially claimed that he stayed at Ultadanga and found the money lying on the road. Hence, he could not be immediately identified even though Sraboni had filed complaints at Kasba police station and the detective department by then.        
	The confusion was soon cleared and the boy returned home with his mother, apprehensive of the outcome of his failed mission. For the last few days he was looking at the map of China. After returning home, he told us that he planned the trip last night, said Sayantans elder brother.

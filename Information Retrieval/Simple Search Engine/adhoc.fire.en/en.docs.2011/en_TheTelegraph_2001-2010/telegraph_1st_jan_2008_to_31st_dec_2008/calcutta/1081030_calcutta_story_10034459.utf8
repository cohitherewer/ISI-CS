          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five armed youths tied up and gagged a trader and his 65-year-old mother in their Nodakhali home, on the citys southern fringes, early on Wednesday and looted cash and jewellery worth Rs 1 lakh.         
	The robbers, with faces covered in black cloth and carrying improvised guns and sharp weapons, raided Tarun Paruis house in Sarkarpara around 1.30am. There was no one else in the house, except his mother Ira.        
	We woke up to find armed men standing outside our mosquito nets. One of them asked my mother to hand over the keys to the almirah. When she refused, they pushed her and hit me on my forehead. The youths then took away the keys, which were tucked under the bed linen, Tarun told police.        
	The youths, in their teens and twenties, took away gold and silver ornaments and about Rs 13,000 in cash. They rode away on motorcycles after an hour.         
	Neighbours rescued the mother and son after hearing their cries for help. Tarun lodged a complaint with Nodakhali police station.         
	The superintendent of South 24-Parganas police, Ajey Ranade, said the five had left vital clues in the house.

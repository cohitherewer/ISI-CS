          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Parents of two teenagers, Shruti, 19, and Kamalika, 15, (names changed) lodged police complaints on Wednesday after their daughters went missing on Tuesday afternoon.        
	Police said the two, students of Class X of a Narkeldanga school, are friends. Shruti is a resident of Salt Lake and Kamalika lives in Beleghata. Calls to their cellphones went unanswered on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, the phones were switched off, said an officer.         
	The police suspect the duo might have gone off in search of work. Last month, didi said they would look for a job in a hotel in Gariahat, said Kamalikas younger brother.

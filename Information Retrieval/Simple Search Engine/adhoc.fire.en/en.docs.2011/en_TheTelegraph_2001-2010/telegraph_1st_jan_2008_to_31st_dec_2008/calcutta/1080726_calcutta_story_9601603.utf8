                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Besu teachers   meet governor
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Teachers of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu) met Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi at Raj Bhavan on Friday and apprised him of the situation on the campus.         
	We told the governor why we wouldnt submit the mid- semester answer scripts to the authorities. We also told him how the current impasse at the university started and how the vice-chancellor was not convening the new academic session or allowing publication of results, said Besu teachers union secretary Manas Hira after the 45-minute meeting.         
	Vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea had demanded that teachers submit the answer scripts of the mid-semester exam according to Right to Information Act. Teachers refused to do so saying mid-semester exams are internal assessments and the answer scripts should remain with them according to the university norms.        
	The exams were held amid turmoil and agitation. Most of the students submitted blank answer scripts to protest against atrocities on students on campus.         
	The teachers said the governor, who is also the chancellor of the university, gave them a patient hearing and asked specific questions about the situation on the campus. Gandhi was reportedly concerned that the academic session and publication of results were being delayed. We are confident that he is going to intervene and solve the problem, said Partha Chattopadhyay, the former secretary of the union.         
	The campus remained empty with the students away for the third consecutive week. The teachers have resolved to go to class on Monday. They have threatened to start a hunger strike if the authorities fail to begin the session.        
	The teachers told Gandhi how the one-man commission to probe the campus unrest has not been able to start work.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             SSKM hostel reopens
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Students were asked to vacate the hostel on July 25 after violent clashes on campus. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Undergraduate students of the Institute of PostGraduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER) at SSKM Hospital were allowed to return to the hostel on Wednesday, almost three weeks after the authorities ordered them out following violent clashes between two student groups.        
	Members of SFI and AIDSO had attacked one another with rods and sticks while enrolling new students in their unions, prompting the authorities to bar all male students from the hostel on July 25.        
	The institute had also suspended classes indefinitely. Though classes resumed from August 1, the hostel was not reopened, causing problems for outstation students.        
	Gauranga Pramanik, a final-year MBBS student and a member of AIDSO, heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday. Being the son of a biri worker in Murshidabad, Pramanik had taken a bank loan for his studies. But I was forced to stay in a hotel and spend Rs 300 a day. My money was running out, Pramanik said.        
	The authorities have made the students sign a declaration that they will not indulge in any activity on campus that could disturb the law and order.        
	I had to put up at a friends house. The move was hampering my studies greatly, said Uttam Maji, a third-year student and an SFI activist.        
	We have allowed the students to return as they vowed never to turn violent again. Stringent action will be taken if they break the promise. The police picket will be here for another 15 days and we will monitor the situation closely for the next few days, said Pradip Kumar Mitra, the director of IPGMER.

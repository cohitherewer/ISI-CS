                      A German gig                    Schaeben and Voss have been making electronic music since the last 10 years. Their live acts are for dancing; the duo thrives on groove and the dance floor. Their uncontrived, spontaneous style has always bred a kind of solid fusion with the public. Along with the duo, Oliver Schad took the mike time and again, and in 2002, became a permanent fixture of their live shows, that would be billed subsequently  and now worldwide  as Schaeben amp; Voss feat. Schad Privat. With e-bass, e-guitar, vocals and analog Synthis, the group draws a line of suspense through its performances. What starts with a bluesy, guitar-heavy down-tempo track can go for a complete change of mood, mutating into a driving, energetic techno act. To break free from the formula of club music, Schaeben and Voss bring their guitar and bass along. Coupled with Schad Privats powerful stage presence on the microphone, it gives their shows a definite concert character. This evening, Goethe Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan presents the trio from Germany in a performance hosted jointly by The Princeton Club.                  Event: A programme of electronic club music When: Today at 9 pm Where: The Princeton Club

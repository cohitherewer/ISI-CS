     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	A number of Latin American countries, along with the US, the UK, Scotland, Bangladesh and Spain, will participate in the 10-day Boi Mela 2008 on the Salt Lake stadium grounds from March 1, said the organisers.
    
	While there would be no theme country, the main fair office will be a replica of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC.
    
	At least 800 stalls will come up over 13 acres.
    
	There may be some difficulties, but we believe the book-lovers will take them in their stride. We are confident that the event will be successful, said Tapan Roy, the minister in charge of libraries in the state.
    
	The state transport department will operate 100 buses to ferry people from 10 designated points in north and south Calcutta to the fairground.
    
	Tickets on the special buses would cost Rs 5.
    
	We would like the book fair to return to the Maidan. I believe we can organise the fair on the Maidan after making arrangements to prevent pollution, said author Nabanita Dev Sen, who is part of the Boi Mela 2008 advisory committee.

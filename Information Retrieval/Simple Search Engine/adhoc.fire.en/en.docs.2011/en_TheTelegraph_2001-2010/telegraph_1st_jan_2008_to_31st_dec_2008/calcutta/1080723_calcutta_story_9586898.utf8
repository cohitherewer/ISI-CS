	The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has suggested a number of ways for the Air Traffic Control (ATC) and airlines to save on air turbine fuel.        
	With rising fuel prices  over 50 per cent in the past six to eight months  the biggest concern for the aviation industry is optimising on its consumption.        
	The directorate-general in a recent circular has suggested ways to bring down the consumption of fuel.        
	According to the circular, start up should be provided in a sequential manner to ensure that take-off time is close to the time when aircraft reaches the taxi-hold position.        
	Usually, an aircraft, after starting from the parking bay, waits on the taxiway if the runway is occupied by another aircraft. Since the engines run during the wait, this results in extra consumption of fuel. The ATC can ask the aircraft to wait in the parking bay and not start the engine if there is congestion, an ATC official at Calcutta airport explained.        
	The DGCA has also asked the ATCs to provide short-cuts to an aircraft. Wherever possible and on request from aircrew, an aircraft can be given a short-cut by ATC only when it is within the radar coverage of a particular airport.         
	The short-cut can be provided even if there is no traffic congestion, and as long as the aircraft does not enter the military flying zone, the official pointed out.        
	Provide accurate estimates of in-bound and out-bound traffic to facilitate flow of traffic, the circular stated. If a pilot can be provided with an estimated time of arrival at the airport, he can reduce the aircraft speed well in advance so it does not have to hover and spend fuel.        
	The DGCA has also asked the ATCs to provide optimised Reduced Vertical Separation Minima  the minimum vertical separation possible between two aircraft. Usually, two aircraft are given a separation of at least 2,000 feet at an altitude of 28,000 feet or more. Now, with the advancement in technology, the separation can be reduced to 1,000 feet, the official said. The airlines have also been advised to carry less weight on board to spend less fuel.         
	Airlines have been asked to select appropriate take-off flap configurations so that the engine requires less thrust during take-off. To avoid holding, the pilots have been asked to plan proper descent profile, particularly in busy airports. Even if it has to hover, the aircraft must do so at a lower level so that less fuel is burnt, an air safety official said.        
	The tips will help operators conserve fuel. The circulars are for both air traffic management and airlines, Kanu Gohen, the director-general of civil aviation, said over the phone from Delhi.

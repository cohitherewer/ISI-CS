The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Puja over, potholes stay
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Puja over, potholes stay
                            
	The pujas have come and gone but the potholes remain. Several roads and pavements in the south of the city, particularly those near a puja venue, bear the tell-tale marks of the celebration. Calcutta seems yet to get over the Puja hangover. Why else will the potholes on the roads and pavements created by structures that came up in the name of worshipping Durga still remain while she has returned to her Kailash abode a month back?         
	Neither the Puja organisers nor the civic authorities seem in a hurry to restore the roads and pavements to their pre-Puja conditions. As a result, pedestrians, passengers, children and senior citizens run the risk of injury as they negotiate the holes and craters.        
	According to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) , over 65 per cent of the puja committees do not take the initiative to repair the damage to the roads, pavements and parks done during the pujas. The cost of damage is nothing less than Rs 5 crore a year, according to civic estimates.         
	At New Alipore, the pavements near Suruchi Sangha, one of the mega-budget pujas, remain mauled and mutilated, having borne the brunt of the grand structures. The park where the puja is held remains shut.         
	Residentspeak        
	This is nothing new. The park remains closed most time of the year because of Puja preparation. The condition of the pavements is such that it is risky to walk down them particularly at night, said Sarmistha Chowdhury, an LIC employee living in the locality.        
	Organiser response         
	This is like raising a storm in a teacup. We restore the pavement and throw open the park to the children as early as possible. This year, there has been a little delay in restoring the pavements. I will take care of this problem, said Aroop Biswas, the local councillor and MLA.        
	It is no different at the venues of Bosepukur Sitala Mandir, Jodhpur Park Saradiya Utsab or Dhakuria Babubagan Puja Committee pujas in south Calcutta.         
	At Jodhpur Park, where the puja committee has won three awards this year, the park as well as the pavements are damaged.         
	Residentspeak         
	Every year, these potholes remain unattended for months after Puja. Pedestrians walking down this pavement and children playing in the park often twist their ankles in these large holes. But no one is bothered, said Raja Chakraborty, the regional manager of a private sector bank residing at 13 Selimpur Road.

	response        
	We will cover the potholes inside the park. I admit there has been some delay this year. But it is the CMCs duty to cover the potholes on the pavements, said Abhinandan Banerjee, an executive member of the puja committee.        
	Bosepukur Sitala Mandir puja committee has bagged 12 prizes for the puja but is strangely reluctant to cover the potholes made by them.         
	Residentspeak        
	They are oblivious to the inconvenience caused, said Laltu Mitra of 59C Bosepukur Road.         
	Organiser response        
	It is a trivial issue. Potholes on the roads are covered by the PWD though we too, have a responsibility. We will cover these potholes soon, said Kajal Sarkar, the working president of the puja committee.        
	The Dhakuria Babubagan puja is held in a congested corner close to the Dhakuria bridge. There is a scramble for buses among office-goers during peak hours. The unattended Puja potholes have turned the place into an accident-prone zone.         
	Residentspeak        
	The potholes remain for months after the Puja. The head of the puja, who pretends to be a local leader, does nothing to repair them, said Moumita Roy, a resident of 36 Bagha Jatin.         
	Neither the secretary nor the executive members of the puja committee could be traced for comment.         
	PWD response        
	It is no big thing. It is the CMCs duty to fill up the potholes. However, my department will do the work as soon as possible, said Kshiti Goswami, the state PWD minister.        
	Civicspeak        
	Filling of potholes created by the puja committees is a sheer waste of public money. I plan to introduce restoration charges from next year that will have to be paid by the puja committees, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.         
	We will conduct a survey on the post-Puja condition of the parks. If the puja committees do not repair the damage we will serve them a notice, said mayoral council member (parks amp; gardens) Faiyaz Ahmed Khan.

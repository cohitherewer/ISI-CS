The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 24x7 road service for luxury cars
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       24x7 road service for luxury cars
          ANASUYA BASU                              
	Owners of luxury wheels need no longer be worried about being stranded in the middle of nowhere without a qualified mechanic anywhere in sight.         
	Auto companies that dont cater to the mass market and cannot, therefore, have authorised service centres everywhere have begun providing 24x7 roadside assistance to customers through globally renowned service providers. Ford India launched its roadside assistance service in Calcutta this month. Ikon, Fusion, Fiesta and Endeavour owners can now access a toll-free number and ask for prompt on-site assistance.         
	Mercedes Benz launched its 24x7 roadside assistance services in June and Honda Siel started the same a month ago. BMW will do so later this year, when our dealership network is further strengthened, a source in the company said.        
	Ford, Mercedes, Honda and Volvo have tied up with Mondial Assistance, an automotive service provider with a presence in over 27 countries spread across five continents. It entered the Indian market through its tie-up with Ford.        
	If a Benz, Ford or Honda meets with an accident, Mondial professionals will tow the vehicle or transport it to the nearest service station. If the battery of a car dies out, they will be ready with an alternative.        
	A car owner need not worry even when he or she is locked out with the keys inside. Mondial promises to reach anywhere to do the needful on receiving an SOS.        
	 The Mondial roadside assistance programme is available free of cost for a period of two years to all Ford customers who have purchased their vehicles in August, said Ford regional sales manager Rashid Mohammed.         
	For old customers, the programme is available for just Rs 1,100 for a year. Any customer within a 50km radius of a Ford dealership can call up the toll-free number for help.         
	 That actually covers the whole of the city, said Rashid.         
	With Honda, Mondial is providing road assistance up to a 100-km radius of an authorised dealership for a period of four years. Merc owners are entitled to the same service anywhere in the country, be it on a highway or a desert.

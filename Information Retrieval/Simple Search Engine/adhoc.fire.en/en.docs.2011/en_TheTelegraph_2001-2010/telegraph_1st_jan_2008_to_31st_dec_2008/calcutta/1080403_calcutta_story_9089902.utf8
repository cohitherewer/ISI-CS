The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Romance with verse
                                                                                                                   Romance with verse

	She is a 21-year-old poetess who admits to being an incorrigible couch potato. But that does not stop Sagnika Chanda from taking up subjects that would seem too ambitious. The third-year student of English at Loreto College began writing poetry when she was five years old and has been writing verse ever since.        
	On March 25, an anthology of her poetry, Moonbeams and Blooddrops, was released at the Oxford Bookstore. Priced at Rs 195, the slim volume is published by New Age Publishers. The poems date from the time she was in the eighth standard.         
	Poetry writing was an exercise to me rather than a flight of fancy, she says. She also tried her hand at prose, but verse seemed to come more easily to her. I was told that poetry limits the scope of expression. For me, this has been the challenge, compressing my thoughts in a few terse lines.         
	There are 30 poems, with social underpinnings (the blooddrops aspect of the collection) and those rooted in fantasy (the moonbeams aspect). But her vision of the future is lined with pessimism. As she writes in Arms and the Man, A cherished dream/ It could not come true/Is this what finally/ Our worlds coming to? She envisions India as a superpower in the near future.         
	But at what cost does such change come? Will economic progress come at the cost of humanity? Will we become efficient machines rather than human beings? she wonders in her poems.         
	She deserves points for her honesty. I have no qualms admitting that the social issues I write about are barely drawn from personal experience.         
	The imagery in The Leopard, where she describes the animal stalking its prey, was gleaned from wildlife shows on television, she says. It is perhaps this lack that renders much of her poetry facile, for her commentary on social ills like poverty, violence and the effect of globalisation do not stand out from the general opinion on these.         
	The Little Beggar Boy, for example, is about how I imagined the life of a beggar to be, she says.Yet, for one who sounds too grim for her age, she can also command the economy of words to compose lines like: I look into your eyes/And see my dreams/ The touch of your hand/ Makes it all seem/ Real.         
	A civil services aspirant, Sagnika is inspired by writers as diverse as O. Henry, Maupassant, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay and Jibananda Das. However she admits that she is far from being perfect.         
	My poems are a spontaneous outflow of my emotions and not worked on to be technically accurate, she says.As a poet, I consider myself an observer, of the world around me, as well as of my own inner life, she adds. One hopes that she can sustain the fervour.

	Give theatre a chance         
	Historically, theatre has been as much a vehicle of moral improvement as it was a form of entertainment. In many cases it was used as a vehicle of protest, as in Utpal Dutts Teer or Dinabandhu Mitras Neeldarpan. Though young people have always been associated with theatre, today a large section of them feel their time is better spent strolling in malls, switching channels on TV or surfing the Net.         
	Why not try spending the same time watching a play? Parents have a role to play in this. Their encouragement can make youngsters head towards Girish Mancha rather than Forum on a free day. It is less boring than the hip hop youth of today might consider.

	Vanishing values         
	The great Indian family is the subject of much discussion and debate. Nano was marketed as hamara car for hamara parivar. The Tatas have got the car ready, but what about the parivar? Ever increasing incidents of children abandoning old parents, husbands killing wives, dowry deaths and mothers killing their children greet us everyday. A growing economy may help us to lead a luxurious life, but what is the use of such prosperity if we forget our values? The upwardly mobile people of today should give the good old joint family system a chance for greater stability.

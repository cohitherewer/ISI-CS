The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Terror cop gets the axe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Terror cop gets the axe
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Metro report on September 27 on Milan Molla rsquo;s plight      
	Prasanta Majumdar, the police officer who had allegedly threatened to brand Milan Molla a terrorist unless he coughed up Rs 1.5 lakh, was suspended on Monday.      
	The officer was suspended after an internal inquiry found him guilty of harassing Milans family. Departmental proceedings are on against him, said Anand Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (port).        
	The action was taken within three days of Metro blowing the lid off the tale of police extortion in the port area.        
	An officer said the probe had revealed that Majumdar, a sub-inspector of the special staff port division, had demanded the extortion amount from Milans family after picking up the Cossipore resident in connection with a blast on August 2.        
	The blast occurred when Milans younger brother Deedar and cousin Ramzan were trying to break open a discarded shell they had brought home from the banks of the Hooghly. The duo and two other family members were killed in the explosion.        
	On August 6, Milan was arrested on theft charge. The probe report also revealed that Majumdar had implicated Milan in the theft case to extort money from his family. Anwara Bibi had paid the first instalment of Rs 35,000 to Majumdar before her son was released on bail, said an officer.        
	Things remained under wraps till CPM parliamentarian Mohammad Salim visited Cossipore and heard about Milans ordeal a fortnight ago. Salim took up the matter with police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, who called Milan to his office on September 13 and urged him to lodge a complaint.        
	The next day Majumdar and another officer from the special staff port division went to the Molla home, asked the family to withdraw the complaint and promised to return the bribe of Rs 35,000. But Milan and his mother refused.        
	Now that Majumdar has been punished, other officers will think twice before harassing and extorting poor people like us, Milan said on Monday.        
	But Anwara Bibi fears for her sons safety. The cops might target Milan later and implicate him in another case, she shuddered.

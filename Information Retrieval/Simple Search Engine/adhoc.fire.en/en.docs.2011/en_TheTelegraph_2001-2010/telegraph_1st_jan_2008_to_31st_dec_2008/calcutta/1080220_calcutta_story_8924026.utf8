                                                                                                               Spa balm for tired eyes

	Do your eyes burn after hours of work in front of the computer? Its time to make an appointment at the spa. A 15-minute sitting promises to give tired eyes a lease of freshness.        
	Calcuttas first eye spa has opened recently. It is the first of its kind in India, being run by an optical store, said Suman Anjoy, the head of professional services, Himalaya Optical, which has opened the facility behind Infinity Building in Sector V, Salt Lake.         
	At the spa, two sets of blinkers are put on ones eyes. The first provides air vacuum therapy by softly massaging the eyelids and eyeballs. The second refreshes the eyes by a cooling gel inside the blinkers.        
	The spa is also equipped with a masseur chair fitted with vibrators. This way, we can simultaneously give relief to back aches, says spa-in-charge Arpita Mitra. Add to that manual massage around the eyes using herbal oils.         
	The spa, Mitra says, is meant to take care of frontal headache, drowsiness, dry sensation, occular watering, redness and fatigue.         
	According to Anjoy, the experience, costing Rs 250, has nothing to do with the power of vision but relaxes and rejuvenates the eye muscles.        
	Bangalore-based Aditya Somani, who runs a computer business, has been to the spa twice in the 10 days of its existence. I suffer from insomnia. But at the spa, I fell asleep 10 minutes into the treatment.         
	Anushila Chakraborty, who works for an e-learning company, was glad to hear of the spa in her backyard. After 12 hours of work, my vision becomes blurred. All of us survive on balms and tablets to treat headaches.        
	The store has plans to open a second spa in south Calcutta.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                      Condemned CSTC buses in a depot. A Telegraph picture                                
	A bidder who missed the bus in an auction of junk vehicles owned by the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) has put the brakes on the process by going to court with a complaint against alleged favouritism.        
	Jagannath Chatterjee, the owner of Maniktala-based SK Traders, claims he was denied the opportunity to inspect at least 10 buses that were supposedly in a better condition than the remaining ones on the block. These buses werent there when I went to the Belghoria and Taratala depots for an inspection, he said.         
	Justice Dipankar Dutta last week asked the CSTC authorities not to sell the vehicles and asked for an affidavit by September 11, mentioning the prices quoted by the chosen bidders and other relevant details about the auctioning process.         
	The chief mechanical engineer of the CSTC had invited bids on July 10 for 144 buses that were lying unused in 10 depots.         
	Chatterjees lawyer Debabrata Chatterjee said his client noticed a few buses missing and immediately asked the CSTC to postpone the auctioning process till such time he inspected all the vehicles on auction. My client has been the highest bidder for condemned (CSTC) buses in the past 10 years. According to the norms, bidders have the right to inspect vehicles before deciding whether to purchase them. My client was allowed to inspect only two depots, one in Belghoria and the other in Taratala.         
	The businessman wrote a second letter to the chief mechanical engineer on August 19, requesting him to withhold the bidding process. But his proposal was not accepted. The chief mechanical engineer and the managers of the Belghoria and Taratala opened the bids on August 25 and chose two of the prospective buyers in alleged violation of auction norms, his lawyer said.        
	Chatterjee argued in court that the CSTC was required to ask the bidders to quote rates for individual vehicles, but it flouted this rule. The authorities asked the bidders to file a combined quotation for all the buses kept in various depots.

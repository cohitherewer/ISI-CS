          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A speeding police jeep mowed down a 51-year-old man in the port area on Sunday morning.        
	Jayram Chowdhury, a Group D employee of Calcutta Port Trust, was taken to SSKM Hospital, where he died.        
	Garden Reach resident Abdul Karim, who witnessed the 6.30am mishap, said the police jeep was being driven recklessly. Had the driver slammed the brakes on time, the accident could have been averted.        
	The driver has been arrested, said Anand Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (port). A team from West Port police station was patrolling the area in the jeep when the mishap occurred.        
	The police said Chowdhury was returning to his quarters after night shift when he was run over by the jeep.

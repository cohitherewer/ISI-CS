	The middle-aged wife of a bank officer was allegedly murdered in her Dhakuria flat by her 24-year-old masseuse on Wednesday afternoon.
    
	Neighbours found Shukla Dey, in her late 40s, lying on the ground in the bedroom of her first-floor flat on Dhakuria Station Road. Her forehead was smashed and there was a deep wound on the back of her head. Shuklas husband Aloke was in office and daughter Chaiti was in school.
    
	Dipali Maity, the homemakers masseuse for four years, had attracted the attention of neighbours by crying out: Boudike ora mere phelechhe (They have killed boudi). She said that a dacoit had hit her when she tried to stop him from leaving the four-storeyed building.
    
	To bolster her claim, Dipali showed injuries on her hands, which were later found to be self-inflicted. Police found a necklace, a pair of earrings and expensive clothes  stolen from the Deys flat  in Dipalis bag.
    
	She broke down in the face of interrogation and gave a blow-by-blow account of the murder, said Praveen Kumar, the South 24-Parganas police superintendent. 
    
	Boudi was lying with her eyes closed and I thought she was asleep. I stopped massaging her and took the almirah keys from the cupboard. She woke up at the sound of the almirah being opened. I immediately picked up a nutcracker and hit her on the head. As she slumped to the ground, I ran to the kitchen, fetched a grinding stone and kept hitting boudi on her head with it till she became still, Dipali told the police.
    
	The masseuses father is the caretaker of the 12 flats in the building. His other daughter works as a help in the flats. 
    
	Shuklas brother-in-law Shantimoy Dey, who stays in the neighbourhood, said that Dipali knocked on his door around 3.30pm. She told me that she saw a man in a black mask and gloves coming out of the flat. She claimed that she was attacked when she tried to resist him. I immediately called the police, said Dey.
    
	We were suspicious about Dipalis account from the beginning. We traced her father and took him to his residence in the nearby railway colony. Dipali was there. The stolen valuables were in her bag, said Kumar.
    
	The police are not sure if the murder was committed for the valuables. We are probing all angles, said an officer.

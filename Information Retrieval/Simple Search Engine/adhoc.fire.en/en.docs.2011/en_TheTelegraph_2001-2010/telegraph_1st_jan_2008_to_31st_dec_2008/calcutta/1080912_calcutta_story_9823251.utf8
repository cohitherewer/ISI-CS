                      Motherhood pangs                    The figure of mother as the creator of life defines the narrative collection, Janani: Mothers, Daughters, Motherhood, edited by Rinki Bhattacharya. It brings together autobiographical writings of women who have made a distinctive mark in diverse walks of life, sharing their experiences of being mothers, daughters, or both. The accounts combine memory and nostalgia in nuanced detail, making each story heart-warming and, at times, profoundly challenging. The authors abandon their public faces to provide humane, intimate and compelling narratives. It includes accounts of adoptive motherhood, stepmothering and single motherhood. On the one hand, the reader encounters the wrenching pain of an abortion, while on the other, the choice of a woman, determined not to be a mother. This evening, Starmark hosts the Calcutta launch of the book, followed by an interactive session featuring Rinki Bhattacharya, Nabaneeta Dev Sen, Bharati Ray, Mandira Sen and Shankarlal Bhattacharya.

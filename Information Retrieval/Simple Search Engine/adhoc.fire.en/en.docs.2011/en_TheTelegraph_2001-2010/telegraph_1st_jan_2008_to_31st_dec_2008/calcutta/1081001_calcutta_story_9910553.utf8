The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Safety first in times of terror
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Safety first in times of terror
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Udayan Sangha puja last year                                  
	Security is the buzzword this year at two of the crowd-puller pujas of the city.        
	Naktala Udayan Sangha and Manicktalla Chaltabagan Lohapatty Durgapuja Committee, feted by the judges of the CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja in 2007, are focusing as much on combating the terror threat as on defending their reputation of organising Five Star pujas.        
	Ten private guards armed with metal detectors will be deployed at the Naktala puja. Closed-circuit television cameras are being installed, too. We are leaving nothing to chance, says secretary Anjan Das.        
	The Manicktalla puja, which already had a security system in place, is adding six guards to its contingent.        
	Another thing common between these pujas is the use of iron materials for fire safety. Our pandal has a geometrical pattern that symbolises unity of power and peace. An iron framework supports corrugated sheets, says Das.        
	Next to the pandal at Manicktalla, there is a tableau of Ram worshipping Devi Durga, bringing alive the Akalbodhan myth. Two elephants stand guard on either side. The Devi is supposed to be riding an elephant to Earth, according to the almanacs, says Ashok Jaiswal, the vice-president of the puja.         
	All the figures are made of iron nets.         
	As in previous years, the two pujas are not compromising on community projects. We will hand over money to The Thalassaemia Society on Puja-eve, says Das, on behalf of the club which also bears treatment costs of five thalassaemic kids. Manicktalla has sent Rs 50,000 to victims of the Bihar floods.        
	This year we will reduce our power consumption further by using more solar energy, adds Jaiswal.

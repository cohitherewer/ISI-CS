                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Study fund for inmates children

	Ratan Halder used to come first in class but had to discontinue studies last year as his mother was not making enough by rolling bidis to fund the education of her two children. The 10-year-old and his eight-year-old sister will return to school after Puja, thanks to a grant they received on Sunday.         
	Rotary Club of Calcutta Mahanagar will pay the tuition fees of the siblings and 40 other children till they pass Plus II. If they later take up a vocational course, the club will provide funds for that too.        
	The first instalment of the grant was handed over to the children, whose parents are serving long sentences in Calcutta jails, at Bharatiya Bhasha Parishad on Sunday. The programme was jointly organised by the club and West Bengal police.With Puja coming up, the children were also gifted school bags, stationery and clothes under the project, named Muskan. Their mothers were gifted saris.        
	We have set ourselves a target of reaching 100 children by next year, said Sushil Sethia, the president of Rotary Mahanagar.         
	In West Bengal, there are 20,000 prisoners in different correctional homes and about 5,000 of them are serving terms of five years or more. That means, there are over 15,000 kids who are vulnerable and need societys help, said a correctional services official of West Bengal Police.        
	Almost all the inmates serving long terms in our jails were the sole breadwinners of their families. Their spouses and children suffer a lot because they get neither any compensation nor societys sympathy, said IG (correctional services) Bansi Dhar Sharma, the chief guest of the programme.        
	Special IG and DIG (Presidency range) Somen Mitra, who was present on the occasion, said: There are way too many convictions in sessions courts and often poor men suffer because they cannot afford a good lawyer.        
	South 24-Parganas police superintendent Ajey Ranade stressed it was the polices job to not only enforce the law but also to prevent crime.        
	If my purpose is to maintain law and order, it is also my duty to see to it that no criminals are produced. Projects like Muskan will help us in this regard, he said.

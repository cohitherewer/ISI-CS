	Twelve-year-old Pranati Nayak had never heard of Yakutsk, the icy city situated four degrees below the Arctic Circle. But on July 1 this young gymnast, along with three others, left for the city to represent India in the IV Children of Asia International Sports Games. The capital of Sakha Republic is hosting the meet  held under the patronage of International Olympic Committee  from July 3-14.        
	Of the remaining gymnasts, two are from West Bangal  Sangita Biswas and Mandira Hazra Chowdhury  while one hails from Maharshtra. The four were selected at the National Sub-Junior Gymnastic Championship held at Khelgaon, Allahabad.         
	Sangita found her way to Sports Authority of India (SAI) during the 2005 state championships, where she won gold in table vault.         
	For Pranati, it was a year earlier. She had won gold in floor exercises at the National Sub-Junior Gymnastics Championship held in Chandigarh and was picked up by SAI coach Minara Begum to train at the complex.         
	Now, SAI takes care of all the expenses of these two students, including providing them with training kits and education. They have also been put up at the SAI hostel.                     Mandira (middle), Pranati (left) and Sangita at SAI before leaving for Yakutsk        
	Mandira used to practise at a local club in Bandel before joining SAI. There were no proper trainers in Bandel, she rues.         
	The girls are trained in four categories: beam balance, floor exercises, table vault and uneven bar. Sangita says it is vaulting that she loves the most. Mandira adds: I took time to get over my fear of beam bars, but it is my favourite now.         
	Says Minara Begum, who is flying with the participants: Since the selection, the stress was on perfecting what they have already learnt rather than in teaching them new techniques.        
	Pranati and her teammates must practise at least four hours in the morning and evening everyday. The girls  affectionately nicknamed Kali, Dhuli and Muli  dont mind the hard work that leaves them drained at the end of the day. Sitting in the gymnasium, Pranati says: We dont mind the grind. We have come here to achieve something. She would know. A resident of Pingla area in Midnapore, she goes home once in six months. Her father is a bus driver.         
	In between three rounds of practice, the girls squeeze in time for studies. While Sangita doesnt care for it much, she knows that it must be done.         
	I get time to sit down with my books only late in the evening. By then, I am often too tired to continue for long, she says. Burning blisters from working on uneven bars are a routine.         
	Sometimes the blisters hurt so much that I find it difficult to sleep at night.        
	The next target for them is to make it to the 2010 Commonwealth Games to be held in India.         
	Young as they are, all three are certain that they do not wish to take up the sport as a profession. I want to have a regular job, says Sangita. One wonders if it is the Indian sport scenario, where gymnastics is largely ignored, that has made these young girls entrench their dreams firmly within reality.

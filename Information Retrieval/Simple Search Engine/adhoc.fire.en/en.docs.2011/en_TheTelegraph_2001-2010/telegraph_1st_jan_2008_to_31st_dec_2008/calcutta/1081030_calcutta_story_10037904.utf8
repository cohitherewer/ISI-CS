	Film appreciation now starts in school. To prepare young minds for the repository of celluloid and literary treasures, it is better to catch them fresh. So believe the teachers at Modern High School for Girls.         
	Thanks to their initiative and that of a few students, a film and literary appreciation club  Images  was started at the school from July this year. The club is open to students from classes IX to XII.         
	The club was formed to spare our friends the agony of our enthusiasm and to spare us the agony of their indifference towards films and poetry, smiled Anushka Sen, a Class XII student and a member of the club.         
	We want to inculcate a love for good films and books in them. What they watch or read need not always be award-winning, said Mita Pramanick, the coordinator of Images. We are not averse to mainstream cinema and blockbusters. The more exposure they get, the more knowledgeable they will be, she added.                                         
	The club has 45 members and sessions are held for one-and-half-hours after school, twice a month. To enter, one has to sit for a written test in which one has to write a short essay on stalwarts of cinema, like Satyajit Ray or Charlie Chaplin, and analyse ones favourite novels.         
	Principal Devi Kar, a supporter of the club, said: Films educate students. We encourage them to read about various films and their making. They have now even graduated to making one-minute movies.         
	The film roster is prepared with care. This sessions includes classics like Le Ballon Rouge (The Red Balloon) by Albert Lamorisse. It is the only dialogue-free film ever to win an Oscar. At the clubs first meeting in July, a film screening was followed by a discussion with Somnath Zutshi, a trustee of the Seagull Foundation for the Arts.         
	Other screenings included Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot, by Jacques Tati, and portions of Bille Augusts Les Miserables. We have shown a part of the 134-minute Les Miserables. There is also a blog where members of the club can learn more about a particular book or film, added Pramanick.         
	The literary activity of the club has until now been limited to holding discussions of classics. We will analyse Erich Maria Remarques All Quiet on the Western Front, Salman Rushdies Haroun and the Sea of Stories and Vikram Seths The Golden Gate, said Bishnupriya Chakraborty, another coordinator.        
	We will also make a list of all-time favourite films and watch them. At the top of our list are Pather Panchali, Meghe Dhaka Tara, Ghare Baire and Paromitar Ek Din, said Anushka.         
	I would never have watched a French movie had it not been for the club, said Akansha Bhattacharya, another member. Two members are also participating in a one-minute film-making session held by the Goethe Institut, in association with Eco Move International, Hamburg, and Humboldt Club from October to December.        
	Earlier, I watched movies only for entertainment, but now I realise that there is more to it than meets the eye, said Priyanjali Pal, who has been selected for the one-minute film-making.

	Measure for measure  
	Birla Industrial and Technological Museum (BITM) is hosting an exhibition, Measuring Our Planet, where one can learn first-hand how things like ultrasonic waves help to calculate the depth of oceans, photovoltaic cells detect sources of light and the hygrometer calculates atmospheric humidity. We have deliberately kept the level of the exhibition low to reach out to the maximum number of children. Instead of the usual themes of global warming and environment, we wanted to focus on something that would make people aware of the size, shape and character of the Earth, said BITM director Jayanta Sthanapati. The 25-exhibit display will travel to regional centres of the National Council of Science Museums, the parent body of BITM. You can come upon interesting information, like a manual on map-making written by Ptolemy in the Second Century AD, followed even in Renaissance engravings.The exhibition will be on from 10am to 5.30pm every day. Tickets are Rs 15 per head for the general public and Rs 7 per head for student groups.

	Tips for teachers        
	Laxmipat Singhania Academy organised a training for nodal teachers under the Adolescence Education Programme (AEP) between October 20 and 22. A training programme for principals was held on October 23. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is rescheduling AEP in all private schools affiliated to it. The objective of this programme is to help students cope with the physical, biological and emotional changes that they undergo during their growing years while initiating a sense of self-awareness.

Both the private firms signed the MoUs with the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC) and the Sunderbans Infrastructure Development Corporation.

	Emaar MGF is bringing in JW Marriott and Holiday Inn to the EM Bypass, with 500 keys between them, and developing a third luxury hotel, a Park Hyatt, on Russell Street, also having 250 rooms. All these hotels are expected to be ready in three years, according to Sanjiv Rai, the chief operating officer (hospitality) of Emaar MGF Land.        
	It will also develop 12 budget and mid-rung hotels in the state in tie-ups with Accor and Premier Inn. An eco-tourism resort hotel in the Sunderbans is also on the cards.

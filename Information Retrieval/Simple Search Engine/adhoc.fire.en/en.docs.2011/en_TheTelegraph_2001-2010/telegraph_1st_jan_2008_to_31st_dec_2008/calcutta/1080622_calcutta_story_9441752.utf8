The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More security for Tagores treasures
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       More security for Tagores treasures
                          Jorasanko Thakurbari                     
	Rabindra Bharati University is taking steps to upgrade security in the museum at Jorasanko Thakurbari.         
	The theft of the Nobel medal at Visva-Bharati was a wake-up call. We cannot risk Tagores treasures, so we are trying to bolster the security arrangements as much as we can with our limited resources. We will be happy if the state government supports us in our endeavour, said Karuna Sindhu Das, the vice-chancellor of the university.         
	The plans include replacing the analogue surveillance cameras with digital ones. We have 16 cameras but the images can be viewed only after a time lag. In the digital system, all the rooms will be simultaneously visible and without any time lag, said Amit Mukherjee, the registrar (acting) and finance officer of the university.        
	The number of cameras will also be increased to 35. Currently, the cameras are in only eight of the 14 rooms in the museum. The digital system will allow the premises to be monitored from outside.        
	The number of security guards will be increased from four to six or eight. The university also plans to scan cars at the gates of its two campuses at Jorasanko and on BT Road.        
	A magnetic swipe card system will be set up at the entrance of the strong room in Vichitra Bhavan, where Tagores paintings, documents and correspondence have been kept.         
	The upgrade was planned long back. We had appealed to the state government for funds. The universitys finance committee sanctioned Rs 50 lakh for the project. We expect the work to be completed in six months, said Mukherjee.         
	The fire detection system has been restored as part of the project. The system, which differentiates between a false fire alarm and a real one, was lying defunct.        
	Signing the visitors book has been made mandatory while entering and leaving the museum. Even I sign when I visit the campus, said Das.         
	The museum was inaugurated on May 8, 1961 and has a collection of Tagores paintings, robes, pens and furniture.

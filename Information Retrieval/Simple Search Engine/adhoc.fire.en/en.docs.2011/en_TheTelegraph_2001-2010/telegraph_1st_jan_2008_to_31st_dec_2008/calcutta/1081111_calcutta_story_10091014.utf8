	In an effort to provide less privileged students with technical expertise, Maruti Suzuki India has tied up with the La Martiniere Self-Employment Oriented Multi-purpose Training Centre (SEOMP) Society. The latter conducts vocational courses for underprivileged students, with the objective of setting them up as entrepreneurs.         
	According to an MoU signed on November 5, Maruti Suzuki will provide technical knowhow and equipment for SEOMPs Motor Mechanic course.        
	We want to add to the skills of the students so that they can get better opportunities in the industry, says B.S. Yechury, the deputy general manager of Maruti Suzuki India.         
	The upgraded one-year course, subsidised by SEOMP, will start in January next year with 35 seats. The minimum criterion is school-level education. Maruti Suzuki will arrange for guest lecturers, conduct workshops and also provide hands-on training in basic automobile engineering and repair of vehicles.         
	In the present economic condition, a technical skill will enable me to run my own unit. I hope it will at least fetch me a placement, said Uttam Singha, a trainee. After completing the course, trainees will find employment in Maruti and other automobile companies. We hope that other companies will also approach us for tie-ups, said the director of the society, Koely Roy.         
	The students will be able to meet our soft skill requirements, said Amitabha Ghosh, territory service manager of Maruti Suzuki.         
	The students will be awarded certificates by the West Bengal State Council of Technical Education and Maruti Suzuki.

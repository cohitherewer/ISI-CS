          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          BUS BREATHER: The Esplanade bus terminus, which environmentalists say is polluting the air around Victoria Memorial. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The state government has bagged an interim stay from the Supreme Court on a high court order to remove the Esplanade bus terminus. The state lawyer informed the high court about the stay when the case related to pollution around Victoria Memorial came up for hearing on Thursday.        
	The government had moved a special leave petition in the apex court seeking the stay.        
	The lawyer submitted that the state had no option but to move the apex court as shifting the Esplanade bus terminus was an impossible task. Huge space is required to set up a bus terminus. The transport department had failed to locate such a space near the citys central business district.        
	While hearing a petition on air pollution around Victoria Memorial, a high court division bench headed by Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya had on September 28 last year issued certain directives to the state government. The directives included shifting the Esplanade bus terminus to a spot at least three km from the marble monument within six months.        
	But the government failed to meet the deadline. Following a petition by environment activist Subhas Dutta, the high court asked the government to clarify why its order had not been carried out.        
	The Supreme Court had issued an ex-parte order staying the shift. When the case will come up again for hearing, I will pray for the stay to be vacated, Dutta said.        
	The government, through another report, informed the court that it had undertaken several measures to carry out the high court order banning parking of vehicles near Victoria Memorial and the Brigade Parade Ground.        
	Cases have been lodged against 267 bus-owners for parking vehicles on the Maidan during a Left Front rally on January 8, the report said.

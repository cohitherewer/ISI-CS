	Remote-controlled capsule endoscope and double-balloon endoscope are among the new gadgets that are changing the diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal diseases.        
	Capsule and double balloon endoscopy are already in use. But their improved versions will change the diagnosis and management of intestinal diseases, said Mahesh Goenka, the chief gastroenterologist at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, which organised an international conference on gastroenterology, on Saturday.        
	Capsule endoscopes can capture images of the entire intestine, which cannot be done by a normal endoscope due to the shape of the intestine. A normal capsule endoscope takes two seconds to pass from the mouth to the stomach. Now, a small magnet is placed in the capsule and a bigger one is used from outside to control its movement in the intestine, explained Paul Swain, a professor of gastrointestinal endoscopy at Imperial College, London.        
	Speaking about the double-balloon endoscope, H. Yamamoto from Japans Jichi Medical University said the gadget can be used for surgery.

                                                                                                               Cops on raze job sent back
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A section of Kidderpore residents, backed by local politicians, stopped a police team from entering a building where an allegedly illegal floor was being constructed on Saturday night.        
	Instead, the residents, including a few property developers in the area, assured the policemen that they would not allow any illegal structure to come up at 18/1 Maulana Mohammed Ali Road.        
	We had no option but to return. No complaint was lodged. We met the local residents on Sunday afternoon and asked them to stop the construction. A report will be sent to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, said an officer of Ekbalpore police station.        
	Some residents, however, alleged that the policemen had come to extort money from the owner.         
	The police team went to the spot around 11.45pm after being told that an illegal floor was being added to the single-storeyed building.        
	Local youths, led by leaders of various political parties, rushed to the spot and prevented us from entering the building, said an officer. An altercation ensued between the residents and our men, during which one of the constables was heckled.        
	Some residents alleged that leaders of the Congress and Forward Bloc are behind the mushrooming of illegal structures in the area.        
	They employ local youths, who double as promoters. Some policemen are in collusion with the racket, said a resident.        
	More than half the buildings in the area are illegal and the police have done nothing to pull them down. said another resident.

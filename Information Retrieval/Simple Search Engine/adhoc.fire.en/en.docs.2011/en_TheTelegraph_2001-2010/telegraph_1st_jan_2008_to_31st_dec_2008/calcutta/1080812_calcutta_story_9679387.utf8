          A STAFF REPORTER                        
	Two city hospitals were vandalised by relatives and neighbours of two patients who died on Monday, allegedly because of medical negligence. The hospital denied the charge.               
	At the government-run MR Bangur hospital, trouble started at 11.45am after the death of Kanan Saha, 22, who was admitted on August 8 with high fever. We were treating her for encephalitis and cerebral malaria. She was given all medical support, but she died around 11.30am, said hospital superintendent H.K. Chanda.         
	Kanans brother Palash alleged that the doctors did not treat her properly. Last night we were present in the hospital. But in the morning, the doctor told us he had been looking for us to buy an important medicine for my sister that could have saved her, but could not find anyone. But all of us were here, said Palash.         
	Kanans relatives turned violent after being informed about her death, said a hospital source. Soon, a contingent arrived from Jadavpur police station. But some of the relatives managed to ransack the office of the superintendent.         
	Chanda also alleged that instead of controlling the mob, local Trinamul councillor Shyamali Bhadra argued with him. The hospital has lodged a complaint with Jadavpur police station. South 24-Parganas police superintendent Ajey Ranade said eight persons have been detained.         
	Earlier in the day, there was trouble at RN Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences on EM Bypass following the death of 35-year-old Rajat Bhowmik. Some of his neighbours damaged doctors cars and the glass doors of the hospital.         
	The hospital authorities said that Bhowmik was admitted with chest pain on August 5. He was scheduled for surgery on Monday. But he expired at 3.15am. There was no question of negligence on the part of the doctors. The patients relatives did not participate in the vandalism. Some of their neighbours created trouble with an ulterior motive, the authorities added.

          A STAFF REPORTER                           Shankar Chakrabarty                                  
	CID sub-inspector Shankar Chakrabarty had been selling cartridges from the departments central armoury in Nadia for at least six years, suspect officers investigating the case.        
	Chakrabarty, who was arrested at Bhawani Bhavan on Tuesday, was posted at the armoury from 1979 to 1990.        
	So far, 84 cartridges have been recovered. We have started going through the records at the Krishnagar armoury to find out the number of missing cartridges, said a senior police officer investigating the case.         
	Chakrabarty claimed that he had sold 10 rounds. But Madhav Das, a criminal arrested in connection with the case, said he had bought 1,600 cartridges from him.        
	Investigators are checking whether Chakrabarty had contacts in courts across Nadia and North 24-Parganas, from where he would pick up his customers  criminals being released on bail or appearing in connection with different cases.         
	Chakrabarty knew that during shooting practice, some empty shells would go missing. They were difficult to trace and so there would always be a gap between the number of cartridges fired and the number of empty shells recovered. It appears that Chakrabarty sold cartridges to criminals taking advantage of this loophole, said a senior police officer.        
	Chakrabarty claims he had sold cartridges for Rs 100 each but we have learnt that he would sell them for Rs 60 a piece, added the officer.

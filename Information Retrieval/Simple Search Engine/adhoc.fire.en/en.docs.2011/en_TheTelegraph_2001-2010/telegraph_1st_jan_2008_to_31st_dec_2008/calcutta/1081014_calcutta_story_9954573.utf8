The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Funds freedom for college
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Funds freedom for college
  - Presidency can spend money without govt consent          MITA MUKHERJEE                                    
	Presidency College will soon be granted financial autonomy though academic freedom remains a distant dream.        
	Preparations are on to grant more financial powers to Presidency College, higher education minister Sudarshan Raychaudhuri said. We will be able to say after the Puja vacation when the power will be transferred.        
	Financial autonomy will enable the college to spend funds without the governments consent.        
	Presidencys money matters are now under the control of the state government. All funds for the college  from state or central agencies  are routed through the finance and education departments.        
	Even for spending a small amount, we have to wait for the finance departments nod, said a teacher of the college. This results in delay in utilisation of funds, affecting the smooth functioning of the college and research activities.        
	In 2006, the government had set up a seven-member committee comprising former students of Presidency College to suggest the ideal status for the institution and measures to improve its functioning.        
	The panel did not favour academic autonomy for the college  an affiliate of Calcutta University  but recommended freedom to handle financial matters. Academic autonomy would have empowered the college to recruit teachers and frame undergraduate syllabi on its own.        
	The government was allegedly sitting on the report, submitted in November 2007, prompting the college authorities to write to the education department in September, seeking immediate implementation of the panels recommendations.        
	The letter prodded the government to set in motion the process of granting financial autonomy to the century-old institution. The committees suggestions regarding financial autonomy will be fully implemented,the higher education minister announced on Monday.        
	The seven-member committee had recommended that financial powers should be transferred from the state education directorate to the college to the fullest possible extent.        
	The committee had also suggested that the college be allowed to keep tuition and other fees and spend them on various projects.        
	The college should also enjoy the right to raise funds for staff development and general upkeep and form administrative and finance committees with teachers and other employees to supervise utilisation of funds, the panel felt.

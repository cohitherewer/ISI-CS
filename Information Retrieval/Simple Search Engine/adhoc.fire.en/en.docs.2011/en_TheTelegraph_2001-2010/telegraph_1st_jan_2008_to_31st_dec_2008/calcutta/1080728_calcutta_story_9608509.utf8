	Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan is planning to set up an undergraduate medical college and install a cathlab for minimally invasive cardiac treatment. The plan was announced at the concluding function of the hospitals year-long platinum jubilee celebration and the inauguration of the MRI unit in the new annexe.        
	We are awaiting permission from our headquarters at Belur Math for the medical college. Work will start after that, said Swami Sarvalokananda, the secretary of Seva Pratishthan. The cathlab, which may cost around Rs 5 crore, is expected to be set up by early next year. The cost of setting up the medical college and other details are yet to be worked out.        
	A space inside the hospital has been allocated for the cathlab, said Swami Prabhananda, the general secretary of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission.        
	The seven-storeyed annexe, named Adhish Chandra Sinha Memorial Building, was inaugurated by Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi in 2007. Set up at a cost of Rs 10 crore, the hospital houses a general emergency department, an advanced paediatric unit, diagnostic facilities for outdoor patients and a school and a college of nursing. A canteen, a waiting hall for patients relatives and an auditorium have also been built there.        
	Swami Atmasthananda, the president of the Math and Mission, Swami Gitananda, the vice-president of the Math and Mission, and external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee were present on the occasion.

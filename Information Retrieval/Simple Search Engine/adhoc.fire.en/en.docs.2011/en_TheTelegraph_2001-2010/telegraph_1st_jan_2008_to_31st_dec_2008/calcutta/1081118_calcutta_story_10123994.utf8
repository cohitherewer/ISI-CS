                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Apex court lifts bar on Todi arrest 
          OUR BUREAU                          Ashok Todi at a CBI office in Calcutta. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The Supreme Court on Monday refused to extend the validity of its verbal order of November 10 asking the CBI not to arrest the Todi brothers and Anil Saraogi for a week.        
	The apex court bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan will hear on November 25 the trios petition seeking a stay on non-bailable arrest warrants issued against them in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM)s court issued the warrants on October 31, after Ashok and Pradip Todi and their relative Saraogi failed to appear in court while charges were being framed against all seven accused in the case. The trio have been missing since.        
	The CBI, which had opposed the Todis plea on November 10, opposed it on Monday, too. Kalyan Banerjee, who appeared for Rizwanurs elder brother Rukbanur, said the CBI would now face no hurdle in arresting the Todis and Saraogi.        
	Since there is no stay on the execution of the CMM courts order, the CBI can arrest the trio, Banerjee said.         
	Rana Mukherjee, appearing for the Todi brothers and Saraogi, however, said his clients would move the Supreme Court again if the CBI made any attempt to arrest them.        
	When the case came up for hearing in the apex court last week, the Chief Justice had told the CBI: Dont arrest them till Monday (November 17).        
	As the trios plea is pending with the apex court, subordinate courts in Calcutta are not hearing any Rizwanur cases.

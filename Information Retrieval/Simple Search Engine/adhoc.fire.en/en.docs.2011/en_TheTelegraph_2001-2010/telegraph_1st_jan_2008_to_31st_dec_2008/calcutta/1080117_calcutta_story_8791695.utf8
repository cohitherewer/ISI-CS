	Relief mingled with rage as the anxiety over the fire not being doused for four days gave way to mixed emotions on Day V, as no more flames leapt out of the forbidden floors of Nandaram Market.
 
	From early on Wednesday, Burrabazar traders started queueing up in the hope that they would finally be allowed into the 14-storey complex mdash; by the firemen and the cops mdash; to check if any of their goods or documents could be salvaged.
 
	Pressure from the traders to enter the building grew with every passing hour. S.K. Bajaj of Bajaj Trading Company was in the forefront, a copy of the day rsquo;s Metro in hand. 
 
	 ldquo;See, this is mine, rdquo; he said, pointing to the photograph of a shop untouched by the flames. ldquo;Please allow me to go to the ninth floor to save what I can, rdquo; he pleaded.
 
	Suddenly, there was a scramble for ldquo;chits of paper rdquo; that would serve as passes, apparently to climb up to the fifth floor of the Nandaram Market complex.
 
	But then, a few chunks of concrete came tumbling down, sparking trouble. Loose talk of ldquo;a few floors from the top rdquo; being demolished had spread like wildfire. With allegations of ldquo;conspiracy rdquo; and ldquo;corruption rdquo; being hurled around, the sight of a few Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) workers demolishing a portion of the 10th floor hanging precariously, added fuel to the fiery mood.
 
	A group of traders from Jamunalal Bajaj Street rushed towards Brabourne Road, shouting that they would not allow any of the floors of Nandaram Market to be pulled down. The handful soon swelled to hundreds as some traders shouted that ldquo;a secret deal rdquo; had been struck behind their back to demolish a few floors.
      
	 ldquo;A meeting took place last evening between some traders and a few influential people. They are trying to convince the owner to pull down the top floors of the market. We will not allow this, rdquo; they cried, straining against the police cordon. 
 
	With matters threatening to spin out of control, senior police officers used hand-held microphones to allay fears and cool tempers.
 
	By the time the VIP visitors mdash; from Rajasthan and Delhi mdash; trooped in for another round of disaster tourism late on Wednesday afternoon, the traders were back in wait-and-watch mode.
 
	Finally, just as dusk began to descend, the police allowed traders to go up to the fifth floor of Nandaram Market. Some returned with a sense of relief, others with a deeper sense of despair.
 
	nRelief route: Following some confusion over funds for relief and rehabilitation of the Burrabazar blaze victims, the Rajasthan Foundation of Calcutta has decided to steer all contributions to the Chief Minister rsquo;s Relief Fund.

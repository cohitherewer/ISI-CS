The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | South City traffic plan under scanner
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       South City traffic plan under scanner
          KINSUK BASU                          South City mall                                  
	Police have blamed the multi-point entry and exit system at South City, which houses the citys tallest residential towers and one of the countrys largest malls, for the traffic chaos on Prince Anwar Shah Road and its arteries.        
	We believe that traffic would be easier to manage if there was just one entry and exit. There is a huge amount of space available inside to put in place such a circulation plan. All our efforts are directed towards making things easier for everyone, said Ranvir Kumar, the special additional commissioner (traffic).        
	Deputy commissioner (traffic) Manoj Verma has led police teams to South City several times since the mall opened in January to study the traffic pattern. Based on these assessments, the traffic department has asked the consortium behind the project to seal all entry and exit points except the east and west gates.        
	There are three gates on the western end (towards Tollygunge) of South City, one of which leads to the malls multi-level parking area and another to the residential complex. The police have suggested that all vehicles should enter through the east gate and exit from the west.        
	The police want the new traffic plan to be implemented before flat owners start moving into two of the residential towers next month.        
	Residents of South City could take the same entry route and head straight towards the towers. All that the promoters need to do is demolish a part of the wall that separates the residential and the school areas from the mall, said a traffic officer.        
	The promoters of South City have accused the police of repeatedly picking on a soft target, alluding to the official hassles they have faced since starting the project.        
	We have already paid Rs 40 crore to the state exchequer and one is curious to know what happened to that money. Why wasnt a part of this money used in developing infrastructure around this place? Why are the authorities not clearing up the footpath so that people can walk on it? The problem is not with South City but the way cops are looking at it, said Sushil Mohta, the director of South City projects.

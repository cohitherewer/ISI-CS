The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Doctor kills self after patient dies
                                                                                                               Doctor kills self after patient dies
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A patient's death wish probably pushed a doctor over the edge at Pavlov Mental Hospital on Thursday morning.        
	Three weeks after inmate Balwinder Singh was found dead - by psychiatrist Dipak Kumar Chowdhury - hanging from the ceiling of a bathroom, the doctor hanged himself from the ceiling of his resident medical officer's room.        
	Chowdhury, 52, was two years younger than Singh and had slipped into depression following the inmate's suicide on January 24.        
	The psychiatrist ended his life exactly five years after Singh had been admitted to Pavlov Mental Hospital - on February 14, 2003.         
	Chowdhury was on duty at the hospital from 9pm on Wednesday till 9am on Thursday. "He was last seen late at night, doing his rounds. No one seems to have seen him in the morning," said an officer of Beniapukur police station.        
	A nurse first spotted Chowdhury hanging, with a muffler round his neck, around 9am. No suicide note was found, police said.        
	A resident of SP Mallick Road in Jadavpur, Chowdhury is survived by a wife and three children. According to his colleagues, Chowdhury was suffering from depression since December and was undergoing treatment at National Medical College and Hospital.        
	"The doctor had given him medicines but we heard from his family members that he was not taking them," said a doctor at Pavlov.        
	Chowdhury did not allow his state of mind to impede his work at the hospital. "He treated patients and seemed normal when at work," said a colleague.        
	Psychiatrists felt Balwinder Singh's suicide could have deepened Chowdhury's sense of depression and prompted him to end his life.         
	"Such an incident often acts as a catalyst to an existing depression and can lead to suicide," explained a doctor.        
	Last week, Chowdhury was more reserved than usual, recounted his colleagues. "He was hardly speaking to us, but we put it down to some problem at home," said a colleague.         
	On Wednesday night, Chowdhury had all his educational and professional certificates with him in a bag.        
	"It is not clear why he was carrying those documents with him. Was he afraid they would be stolen? The police must find these answers," said a doctor.

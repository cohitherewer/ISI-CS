          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is building 2,500 flats, catering to all income groups, on 40 acres on the southern fringes.        
	Work on the housing estates has started. If the CMDA manages to stick to the schedule, the flats will be ready in a year and a half.        
	The buildings are coming up on six acres at Baishnabghata, 10 acres at Nonadanga in Kasba and 20 acres under the East Calcutta Area Development Project, also in Kasba. The total cost of the projects has been estimated at Rs 270 crore.        
	The CMDA was granted financial and administrative approval for the projects at a recent meeting chaired by urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.        
	According to an official of the CMDA, the projects are part of the Basic Urban Services to the Poor programme. About 75 per cent of the flats will be earmarked for the low-income group. The rest of the flats will be allotted to the middle-income and high-income groups.         
	The Centre will provide 35 per cent of the cost under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission for the flats for the low-income group.        
	The state government will fork out an equal amount. The flat-owners will have to pay 20 per cent of the cost and the remaining 10 per cent will be borne by the agency.         
	We have started infrastructure work such as laying sewage and drainage pipes, said Deepankar Ghosh Hazra, the chief engineer of the project.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two contract labourers who earn Rs 40 on good days handed over to police Rs 47,000 they found lying on Howrah-Domjur Road on Wednesday.        
	Amrito Pandey, 31, and Sambit Pandey, 32, were walking to a Domjur factory where they are currently employed when they saw Rs 500 notes scattered by the side of the road. Three residents of the area had started picking up the notes.        
	The two, who stay with their wives, children and aged parents in huts in nearby Kathliya, started gathering the notes. They then took the money to a CPM leader in the area.        
	Around 8am, the leader accompanied the group to Domjur police station, where they handed over the money to an officer.         
	We had not seen so much money. The first thought that occurred to me was that someone might have withdrawn the money from a bank in an emergency and dropped it accidentally. It was our duty to hand it over to the cops. But we couldnt muster the courage to go to the police station alone and approached the leader, said Amrito.         
	Bharati Patnaik, a middle-aged resident of Kathaliya who was working in an agricultural field adjoining the road, said she had seen the notes fall off the pocket of a motorcyclist who zoomed down the road.        
	I called out to the biker but he did not stop. I hurried from the field to the road and had just started collecting the money when the two came along, she said.         
	Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh said: The Pandeys showed exemplary honesty. We are thinking of rewarding them. The residents who handed over the money must also be commended.        
	Till late on Wednesday, no one turned up at the police station to claim the money. The notes probably came off a bundle of Rs 50,000. If someone approaches us with proof, we will hand over the money, said Singh.

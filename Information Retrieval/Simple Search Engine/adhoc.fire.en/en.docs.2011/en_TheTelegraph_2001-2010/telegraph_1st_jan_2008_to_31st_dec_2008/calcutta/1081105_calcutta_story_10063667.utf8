	Seven passengers of the bus that overturned in Salt Lake on Monday killing a civil engineer and injuring several others were being treated at Ruby General Hospital till late on Tuesday.         
	Two of them were in the Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) while five others were kept under observation.        
	Arnab Biswas, the civil engineer whose account of the accident was published in Metro on Tuesday, was admitted to bed No. 11 of Regency Ward. According to doctors, he will have to undergo a surgery to install two plates in his left shoulder. I was treated and discharged at ILS Clinic on Monday. I had to be admitted again to Ruby Hospital on Tuesday with shoulder pain, said Biswas.         
	His colleagues Ranit Mukherjee, 36, and Subir Banerjee, 38, both senior construction engineers with Bengal Unitech Universal, were in a state of shock on Tuesday evening. Both vowed not to board the small buses that ferry the company employees again.         
	I will request the authorities to let me board the bigger bus after I rejoin office, said Banerjee.        
	The CEO of the hospital, Brigadier S.B. Purakayastha, said all seven were out of danger. The patients in the ITU are responding to treatment and may be shifted to general wards tomorrow evening, he said.        
	Paritosh Chandra Sarkar, 62, and Udayan Banerjee, 34, were wheeled into the ITU on Monday evening in a semi-conscious state with heavy bleeding from the nose and head. Banerjee is suffering from fractures in his collarbone and left wrist. He also has three stitches on the back of his head. Sarkar, too, has fractured his collarbone, dislocated the steel plates in his spinal cord and is bleeding from his nose.        
	I can still hear the cries of my colleagues and see the pool of blood around me. The memory will haunt me as long as I live, said Sarkar who was sitting in the drivers cabin.         
	According to him, the 55-year-old driver was driving recklessly.         
	Sameer Bahri, the executive vice-president of Bengal Unitech Universal, said the company has been sourcing vehicles from the same agency, MS Travels, for four years. We will review our transportation policy for the staff. Our employees are being asked to be vigilant against rash driving by contract carriage drivers.

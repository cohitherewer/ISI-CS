	Parts of a north Calcutta building housing two state-aided schools caved in on Monday afternoon, killing a woman and injuring two men.        
	The dead and the injured were relatives of the caretaker of the three-storeyed building at 28 WC Bonnerjee Street, in the Girish Park area.        
	Both institutions  Kamala Girls School and Nanibala Balika Vidyalaya  were closed during the mishap.        
	We have started an investigation. The injured were taken to Medical College and Hospital, said Ajey Ranade, the deputy commissioner of police (central division).        
	The police said Rubi Singh, 26, Jeetu Singh, 19, and Ajay Singh, 20, were in caretaker Darika Singhs first-floor room when the floor caved in around 3.30pm.        
	The three fell around 20 feet  along with the floor, some adjacent walls, too, crumbled  before being buried under the debris.        
	Rubi was dead and the other two were injured when local residents, firemen and the police brought them out.        
	Suddenly, I found myself falling. I fainted after I hit the ground. When I came to, I found myself buried under the debris. Breathing was difficult and I could not even move my limbs. But I managed to free a hand and waved it desperately at the rescuers, said Ajay, who has been released from the hospital.        
	Jeetu, a hospital official said, suffered critical injuries.        
	An official of Nanibala Balika Vidyalaya said: The building needs repairs but we havent been able to start work because of a funds crunch.        
	Gora Chand Mondal, the civic director-general (building), said a team would be sent for investigation.         
	The building is not condemned. It was in a good condition. We will try to find out what had led to the cave-in, Mondal said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | More billboards mean less winter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       More billboards mean less winter
										      Climate   Watch                        Trees trimmed to give better visibility to a billboard. A Telegraph picture				                           
	The Calcutta winter has been warming up over the past hundred years and the greenery, which controls the microclimate of an area, including warming, is being trimmed down rampantly for commercial gains.         
	Our study over a period of about 100 years suggests that the average temperature during winter has risen, especially of January, and we feel that urbanisation is the cause, says G.C. Debnath, the regional director of Indian Meteorological Department.         
	But who cares? Full-grown trees are being regularly chopped  either in full or in part  for various reasons, from giving hoardings a better display to construction work.         
	Recently, over 30 trees were cut down in the Botanic Gardens in Shibpur  supposed to be the safest haven for trees  to allegedly make space for a flower garden.         
	Within the city, be it Kasba opposite Sitalabagan, the Anwar Shah Road stretch between Lake Gardens and Jadavpur police station or in Salt Lake, trees are being felled to put up billboards.         
	According to its mayor-in-council Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has filed complaints with the police that trees had been cut down in the Phoolbagan area to facilitate construction of buildings.         
	We have come across a number of cases where trees have been cut to remove obstacles to hoardings or facilitate construction of buildings and we have lodged complaints with the police, said Majheder Rahman, the divisional forest officer (utilisation), who has Calcutta and Salt Lake under his jurisdiction.         
	The violators are unrepentant. Why single us out? Everybody cuts trees for the hoardings to be seen, said a representative of Venus, a billboard company. It was accused recently of cutting a tree close to Kasba police station.         
	The West Bengal trees (protection and conservation in non-forest areas) Act, 2006, is proving more of an encouragement than a deterrent. Though the act has provisions for both imprisonment and fine, only the latter is currently enforced, if at all, and the violators have to pay between Rs 1,000 to Rs 10,000 to be let off  a minuscule amount in comparison to the commercial gain.         
	But trees control the microclimate of any area, including its temperature, moisture and rainfall, and it also acts as a local carbon-dioxide sink reminded Dipak Chakrabarty, the chief scientist at the state pollution control board.         
	Combating climate change has only remained on paper and maybe on hoardings  in Calcutta.       JAYANTA BASU

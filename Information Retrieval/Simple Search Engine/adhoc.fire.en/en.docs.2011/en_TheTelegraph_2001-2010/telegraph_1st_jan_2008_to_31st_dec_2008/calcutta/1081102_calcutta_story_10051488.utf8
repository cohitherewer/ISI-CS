                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Next week you can be at ... Chopta 
                                          
	A walk in the clouds is what Chopta offers. Nestled in the Garhwal Himalayas at an altitude of 2,900 metres, the town is called the Switzerland of the Garhwal. It is hard to imagine that any other place can match the beauty of its snowcapped peaks and lush green fields.         
	The drive from Hardwar to Chopta through Devaprayag, Rudraprayag and Ukhimath is long but does not seem tedious even for a moment. Waterfalls, river confluences and dense alpine forests kept us occupied by providing great photo opportunities almost every minute.         
	And finally, after almost nine hours, when the picturesque Chopta valley unfolded before our eyes, it was love at first sight. A shroud of mist hung over the carpet of greenery. It lifted later in the afternoon to reveal the iridescent countryside in all its glory and snow-sprinkled cliffs peeking through clouds.         
	Accommodation options in Chopta are limited to roadside shacks and a handful of small hotels. Power and telephone connections have not yet reached this nook in the hills. Nature is the sole source of sustenance.         
	Dusk descends late here, so we could explore the surroundings till late evening. Perched on a rock in the green valley, we watched the sun set, clothing grey clouds and snowcapped peaks in shades of lilac and orange.We then sat on the balcony of our hotel and watched the town go to sleep. Once darkness descended, stars sparkled in the clear mountain sky like diamonds.         
	Rain is difficult to predict in the mountains, especially in June, when we went to Chopta. But the sun-kissed evening motivated us to plan a trek to Tunganath and Chandrashila the next day.         
	However, we woke up next morning to the sound of heavy rain pounding the tin roof of our hotel. After a couple of hours, when we had almost given up hope, the rain gods relented a bit.         
	With dark clouds looming in the horizon and through a drizzle, we set out on the 4 km trek towards one of the highest Hindu temples in the world. The winding road to Tunganath is simple to follow but can be difficult to negotiate because of its steepness. What made one forget the hardship was the view of the mountains and the valley. Even though it was still raining, we felt tempted to venture into the virgin forest.         
	Horses and mules are available for the journey but its better to walk as it allows you to marvel at natures wonders at your own pace.         
	Four hours and a drenching later, we made it to Lord Shivas abode. The small and peaceful temple inspired reverence. The scenery stirred deeper emotions. The clouds parted once in a while to allow us a glimpse of the peaks beyond. Time stood still  it was as if the door to heaven was slowly opening.         
	We sat transfixed for an hour and started our journey downwards after a cup of hot tea at a shanty.            
	Going         
	Take a car or bus from Hardwar or Rishikesh. The distance from Hardwar is around 210 km. The best rates are available at the Hardwar Taxi Union stand and not at local travel agents. The taxi stand is next to the railway station, opposite hotel Sachin International        
	Staying        
	Cottages and small hotels are available. At hotel Nilkanth, tariff is Rs 250-400 per night for a double-bed room. Contact Diamond Tours in Calcutta for reservations. The Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam cottages can also be considered. There are cottages at Tungonath. The rate is about Rs 200 per night. Theres no electricity, so one has to make do with solar lights and candles. There is no telephone connection. Food is mainly vegetarian (and a little expensive). Carry your woollens.

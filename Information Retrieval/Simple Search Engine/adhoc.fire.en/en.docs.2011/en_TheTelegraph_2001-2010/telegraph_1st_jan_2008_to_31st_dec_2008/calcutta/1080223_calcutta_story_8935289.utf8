The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CU scraps staggered review results
                                                                                                               CU scraps staggered review results
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) will reduce the delay in publishing the review results of its undergraduate exams and announce them at one go.        
	From now on, all review results of BA, B.Sc and B.Com examinees will be published simultaneously and within a specified deadline, said Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor of the university.        
	The deadline, an official pointed out, will depend on the number of applications received. But we are trying to impose a cap of two months.        
	The rule comes into effect from next year. This year, the review results of the commerce students will be published on Monday and of the rest, by the first week of March, Das added.        
	In the earlier system, the results used to be announced in a staggered manner, often resulting in a years loss for the students.        
	Citing an example, an official said, a student of a south Calcutta college had applied for a review of a Part I political science answer script in 2004. The student had scored four less than the qualifying marks.        
	Following the review, her marks were increased, making her eligible to take the Part II test in 2005. But by the time the result was announced, the deadline for submitting the examination form for Part II 2005 had elapsed. The student had no option but to wait for Part II 2006, said the official.        
	There are several such instances. Two students from a central Calcutta college had applied for a review of a commerce and a physics paper in Part I 2006.        
	The result of the commerce student arrived in 45 days but the university took five months to announce the result of the science student.        
	The delay occurs mostly because of the examiners appointed for re-evaluation. Now, the deadline for submitting the scripts will be strictly enforced, said the official.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Two college students were killed and another was seriously injured when their motorcycle met with a mishap near Jibanananda Setu in Jadavpur early on Thursday.        
	The three were out Kali puja pandal-hopping on one bike and none of them was wearing a helmet.        
	The nature of the mishap was unclear as there were no witnesses, police said. A group of pandal-hoppers saw the students lying on the road bleeding around 3.20am and alerted the police.        
	The three were taken to MR Bangur Hospital, where Debashis Mondal and Suvronil Chatterjee, both 22, succumbed to their injuries. Sandipan Kali, 21, was shifted to the intensive care unit of a private hospital off EM Bypass.        
	Debashis, a resident of Mohammadpur in Bangladesh, was studying in a private engineering college in Sonarpur. Suvronil, a resident of Suri in Birbhum, studied in Heramba Chandra College.         
	Sandipan, from West Midnapore, is a student of the same college.        
	The trio stayed in a flat belonging to Suvronils father on North Road in Jadavpur.         
	According to residents of the area, the three had shifted there six months ago, after Suvronils father bought the flat.        
	On Wednesday evening, Suvronil went to a relatives place for bhai phonta. After he returned, the three friends and another youth from the locality played carrom on the street till late, said Achintya Chatterjee, a neighbour.        
	The three left the flat around 2am on the motorcycle to see some Kali puja lighting, he added.        
	Classmates and friends were keeping a watch on Sandipans condition till late on Thursday as his family members were yet to reach the city.         
	Sandipan is not out of danger. He has been kept under observation and nothing can be said before 48 hours, said Biswajit Sengupta, the doctor attending to the student with injuries on his head and shoulder.        
	We will interrogate Sandipan after he recovers. We havent been able to find out how the mishap occurred. We have sent the bodies for post-mortem and contacted the family members, said Sunil Kumar Chaudhari, the additional superintendent of South 24-Parganas police (industrial).        
	Early on September 29, a motorcycle mishap had claimed an engineering student and seriously injured another in Sonarpur.         
	The two were returning home after a night out and were not wearing helmets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | President to unveil civic charter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       President to unveil civic charter
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                              
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) is all set to launch citizens charters to underline its commitment to providing timely services. The charters will be released by President Pratibha Patil at Raj Bhavan on Saturday.         
	This is the first time that citizens charters will be released by the President.        
	The CMC prepared the charters under the guidance of the department for international development of the British government. The UK government has also given the civic body a grant of Rs 212 crore for the programme.        
	A citizens charter is a commitment of a civic department to deliver civic services within a stipulated time to a citizen, failing which the officials concerned will be liable to pay a token penalty, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said on Tuesday.        
	It does not by itself create new rights, but the charter certainly helps in enforcing the existing ones and in focusing on the commitment of a civic body towards the citizens, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	According to the municipal commissioner, each civic department  like building, assessment, roads, parks amp; gardens and sewerage amp; drainage  will have a separate charter.         
	For instance, the civic assessment department has prepared a 32-point charter. The minimum and maximum time the assessment department will take in dealing with a case are one week and six months.         
	Similarly, the building department has promised in its charter to clear the construction proposal of a residential building within a month.         
	Fifteen civic officials from the rank of director-general (building) down to borough executive engineer have been designated as citizens charter officers. They will oversee implementation of the charter and will be easily accessible.        
	In the original concept of citizens charter, there was no provision for a token penalty. It was inserted as the mayor felt that a commitment without provision for penalty wont benefit people.

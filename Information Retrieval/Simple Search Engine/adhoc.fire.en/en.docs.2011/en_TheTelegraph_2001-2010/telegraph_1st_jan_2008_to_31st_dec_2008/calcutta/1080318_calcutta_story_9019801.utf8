	A Rs 100-crore amusement park, called Kolkata Pleasure Island, will come up near Ruby Hospital, off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.         
	The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is developing the water park with private partners Shrachi Group and International Amusement, which had built Appu Ghar in Delhi.        
	Construction will start in six months and is expected to take a couple of years. The park will be built over 33.78 acres, of which 23.72 acres is taken up by two water bodies separated by a canal.        
	The water bodies were formed when soil from the area was used to level the surrounding zones. Rainwater collected in the pits, giving them the appearance of ponds. They are not a part of East Calcutta Wetlands and there is no mention of them in official documents, said Kalyan Roy, the additional director (socio-economics) of the CMDA.         
	We are providing land for the project, while our private partners will be responsible for the rest, added Roy.        
	Amit Bhasin, the general manager (business development) of Shrachi Group, said: The entire family can hang out at Pleasure Island, which will be modelled on Disneyland. The park will be affordable. People from all economic strata will be able to visit it.         
	According to Shrachi Group vice-president (corporate affairs) Mrityunjoy Ghosal, technical experts from Germany, Italy and the US have been hired for the project. TUV Germany will monitor the safety aspects. Toronto-based Forrec will design the park.         
	Apart from the water-based entertainment, the park will have a commercial section. Shahartali Bazaar, or Town Plaza, will have an anchor store that will stock high-end brands. There will also be craft outlets. Neera Chalachal, or Water Walk, will have an artificial lagoon, restaurants and cafes. Bazaar Street will house an amphitheatre, which will be rented out for seminars and cultural programmes.         
	The rides will include tube slides and water coasters. Besides, there will be wave pools and boating facilities.         
	The parking lot for the park will accommodate about 500 cars, said the developers.

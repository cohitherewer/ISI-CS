The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Autos off road after raids on fringes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Autos off road after raids on fringes
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Autorickshaws have stopped plying on several routes on the southern fringes following a crackdown on three-wheelers over 15 years old and plying without route permits.         
	The Regional Transport Authority (RTA) and police seized over 200 autorickshaws plying from Mahestala, Akra, Rabindranagar and Batanagar on Sunday night and early on Monday. About 1,500 three-wheelers went off the road soon after, inconveniencing lakhs of office-goers and students.        
	Commuters in these areas are forced to depend on autos because buses ply after long intervals and are usually overcrowded.         
	The drivers who stopped plying autorickshaws, most of them owing allegiance to Citu, demonstrated outside Mahestala police station on Monday morning demanding that their vehicles be returned.        
	The RTA and the police claimed that they were carrying out the high courts order.         
	According to a court directive, we seized autos that are more than 15 years old. We also impounded vehicles plying without valid documents, said Sunil Roy, the regional transport officer of South 24-Parganas.         
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Monday met Citu leaders at Netaji Indoor Stadium. The minister said autorickshaws would not be allowed to ply without documents.         
	Local CPM leader and the Citu secretary of South 24-Parganas, Ratan Bagchi, however, sided with the operators whose autos have been impounded.        
	About 12,000 autorickshaws ply in South 24-Parganas and for various reasons, a number of them dont have route permits. But these vehicles are the only source of livelihood of unemployed youths. After implementation of the court order, the owners of the autos and the drivers will face financial crisis, said Bagchi.        
	A senior officer of the RTA said the number of autos plying without valid documents is swelling by the day. The three-wheelers that ply in the city proper have their documents in order. But those operating on the fringes dont bother about licence or pollution control board clearance. These autos cause pollution and traffic congestion. The raids will continue till they can be brought to book, said the official.        
	We have invested a lot of money to buy an auto. But the authorities are only harassing us, said Seikh Rajen, an auto operator in Mahestala.

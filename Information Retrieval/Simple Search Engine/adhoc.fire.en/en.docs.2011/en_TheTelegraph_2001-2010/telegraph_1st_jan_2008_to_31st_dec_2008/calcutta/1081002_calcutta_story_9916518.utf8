          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Security concerns and tension dogged the three cops arrested in the Rizwanur Rahman case through their 20-hour stay in Presidency jail.        
	Ajoy Kumar, an IPS, and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das remained stoic but assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty often lost his cool on Tuesday night, said sources.        
	The authorities had decided to house the three in the jail hospitals outpatient department but Chakraborty raised the security issue. He feared that criminals he had sent to the jail might try to murder him, said a jail officer.        
	Chakraborty later claimed he was not feeling well and wanted to be admitted to a private clinic. The jail doctor found nothing wrong with his health.        
	The three were shifted to the special courtroom set up for the trial of Aftab Ansari, the American Center attack mastermind, after a couple of hours. Three beds with clean linen and pillows and three pedestal fans were placed in the room. The toilet was cleaned.        
	The policemen refused the food we offered and said they had eaten in the court lock-up. They had six mineral water bottles with them, said a jail officer.        
	On Wednesday morning, the cops had tea and asked for newspapers. Breakfast was two pieces of bread and a boiled egg. Kumar refused to eat food brought from outside by colleagues. The other two had dal, rice, vegetable curry and fish for lunch, added the jail officer.         
	The three became very tense when they were told that the hearing had started.

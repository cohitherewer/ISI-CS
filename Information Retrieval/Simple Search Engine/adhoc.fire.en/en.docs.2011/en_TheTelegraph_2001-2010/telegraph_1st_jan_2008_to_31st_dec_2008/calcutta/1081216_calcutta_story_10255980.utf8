	The eyes of Major (retired) Mohammed Wahid moistened as he was introduced to a 4,000-strong gathering on the occasion of Vijay Diwas on Monday afternoon.        
	This day has revived the memories of December 16, 1971. The entire city of Dhaka had congregated at the racecourse ground. People marched, sang, danced and chanted the name of Bangabandhu Mujibur Rahman to celebrate their new-found freedom. The jubilation today has transported me to those days, Major (retired) Wahid said at the Royal Calcutta Turf Club.        
	The 79-year-old from Bangladesh had fought the Pakistani army in 1971.        
	For Major (retired) Abu Talob Munshi, 75, it was a moment of great pride to be honoured for his services during the freedom war of Bangladesh. I still feel like a soldier, ready to fight for my country, said the well-built armyman.        
	Wahid and Munshi are among 14 mukti joddhas (freedom fighters) who were in the city to attend Vijay Diwas, which marks the surrender of the Pakistani army in 1971 leading to the birth of Bangladesh.        
	Along with the mukti joddhas, three serving officers of the armed forces of Bangladesh attended the celebrations.        
	This is another of a series of firsts this year, like throwing open the celebrations to civilians, said an officer of the Eastern Command.        
	Around 4,000 people gathered on the RCTC ground to pay their respects to the Indian and Bangladeshi soldiers who took part in the liberation war.        
	Every year, the Indian armed forces observe December 16 as Vijay Diwas and invite freedom fighters from Bangladesh. This year, the event was organised by the Indian army and the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation, in association with The Telegraph.        
	The senior-most mukti joddha present on Monday was Major-General (retired) Jamil Ahsan, 80, who recalled the day when Lieutenant-General A.A.K. Niyazi surrendered his gun to Indias Lieutenant-General Jagjit Singh Aurora.        
	As young soldiers, it was a moment of great pride for me and my colleagues. The very moment when Bangladesh was created is still etched in my memory, said the war veteran.         
	Every time the audience cheered the sky-divers and clapped for the motorcyclists, it brought a smile to the lips of the freedom fighters.        
	We are pleased to see such a huge turnout. Most of these people were not even born in 1971. These celebrations will enrich the young minds, said Brigadier (retired) Rahman.

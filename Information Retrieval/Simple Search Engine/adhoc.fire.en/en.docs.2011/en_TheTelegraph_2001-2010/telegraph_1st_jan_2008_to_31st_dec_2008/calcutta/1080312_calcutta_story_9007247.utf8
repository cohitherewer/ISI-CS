          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The body of a 60-year-old Liluah resident, who had been missing since Sunday, was found in the well of his house on Tuesday morning.        
	Amarendra Heits hands were tied with a rope and there were blood clots in his eyes. Police suspect he had been murdered.        
	His sons  Subhas, Pravash and Bikash  have been detained. They did not lodge a missing persons diary, though their father had been missing since Sunday, said an officer of Liluah police station.        
	A murder case has been started and investigation is on. We are interrogating his sons, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the superintendent of police (Howrah).        
	My brother told me that he was often tortured mentally and physically. I want the police to catch his killers, said Bina Khamrui, Amarendras sister. She refused to specify who used to torture her brother.        
	The police said Heit, originally from Dhurkhali village, in Amta, was last seen on Saturday night, when he went to bed after dinner.         
	He used to share the room with his younger son, who told the police that he had no clue when his father had left the room. The decomposed body was found by Arun Tiwari, a tenant in the Heits Belgachhia L Road house.        
	Subhas runs a cycle-repairing shop, Pravash is a carpenter and Bikash manufactures machines to make ornaments. Amarendra helped Bikash run his business. Daughter Kajal is married, while wife Mamata lives in Amta, said an officer.

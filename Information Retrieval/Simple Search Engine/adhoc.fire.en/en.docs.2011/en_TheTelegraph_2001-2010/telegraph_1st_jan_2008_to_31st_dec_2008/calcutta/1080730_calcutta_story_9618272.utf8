                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Customers, cars under scan at malls 
                                          
	Lalbazar issued a 14-point security directive to shopping malls on Sunday night after serial blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad. The guidelines were finalised after discussions between home secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti, municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay and mall officials. The malls were given time till August 1 to comply with the directive, which called for installation of door frame metal detectors and deployment of former police officers to liaise with local police stations. Metro visited four malls to find out how tight the security is:        
	Forum        
	Average footfall: 15,000 on weekdays, 20,000-23,000 on weekends        
	Security personnel: 60 plus 40 employed by individual stores        
	Tools: 65 CCTVs, handheld metal detectors, door frame metal detectors, under vehicle search mirrors, searchlights, extended mirrors and motion sensors.        
	Recent measures: Checking of cars has been intensified and customers are being frisked. The identity cards of mall employees are being examined and stores have been asked to issue such cards to their employees.         
	What we saw: A handheld metal detector was being used in only one of the two mall gates. Womens bags were being checked by male security guards. One could enter the mall through the Shoppers Stop outlet, where bags were being checked and kept by the security personnel, but the visitors were not being frisked.        
	Visitors voice: The security check here is not stringent and there is no woman guard at the gates. I would feel more comfortable if security was tighter, said Suchana Mukherjee, a law student at Calcutta University.         
	South City        
	Average footfall: 50,000        
	Security personnel: 120 plus those employed by individual stores, 15 added after Sunday.        
	Tools: 144 CCTVs, handheld metal detectors, under vehicle search mirrors.        
	Recent measures: Visitors are being frisked and shop employees without identity cards are being denied entry. Cars are being checked thoroughly and given stickers with time of entry. In case a vehicle is parked for too long, it is being checked.        
	What we saw: Vehicles and pedestrians were being checked thoroughly, though there werent metal detectors at every entrance. Two officers of South 24-Parganas district intelligence branch were on duty at the main entrance throughout the day. Plainclothesmen from Jadavpur police station were also on vigil.        
	Visitors voice: Entering the mall is time consuming with all the checking, but then it is for our own security and I am ready to comply, said Urmi Ghosh, a student.        
	City Centre        
	Average footfall: 12,000-15,000 on weekdays, 30,000-35,000 on weekends

	Tools: 60 CCTVs, handheld metal detectors, door frame metal detectors, under vehicle search mirrors        
	Recent measures: Five out of the 11 entrances and exits have been barricaded and the width of the remaining six has been reduced. Security guards in plainclothes have been deployed. Two sniffer dogs and two guard dogs are on vigil. The car park along the INOX wall has been shifted to the other side of the road. The mall authorities have issued a circular to shop-owners asking them to be alert and not allow customers to move out leaving their baggage at the counter.         
	What we saw: No female security guard had been employed. Some women visitors refused to let the male guards check their belongings. The staff were not being checked while entering and leaving the premises.         
	Visitors voice: Only female security guards should check womens baggage. I did not notice any security guard at the FE block entrance, said Moumita Kundu, who is training to be an airhostess.

Shop employees have been provided identity cards by the mall authorities. Two armed guards and two officers from Phoolbagan police station are on watch through the day.        
	What we saw: Male and female security guards were frisking the visitors. Those reluctant to open their bags in public were being taken to a separate room. Most shop employees, however, did not have their photographs pasted on their identity cards. We have repeatedly asked them to display their photographs on the identity card, said Uttam Chakraborty, the safety and security manager of the mall.        
	Visitors voice: The security scan should not be eased after a couple of weeks, said Suman Dutta, a south Calcutta resident.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rain alert amp; power cut

	The city and its adjoining areas may receive widespread rain in the next 24 hours.        
	A cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) over the northwest Bay of Bengal and the coast is drawing in loads of moisture from the sea, the Met department said on Monday.        
	Under the influence of the cyclonic circulation, there will be rain, including heavy showers, at many places in Calcutta and the south Bengal districts in the next 24 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The maximum temperature on Monday was 32.5 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. Tomorrow, it is likely to come down by two or three degrees because of the rain, said a Met official.        
	What could also come down is the pre-Puja shopping fever that has gripped the city, with non-mall options being worst hit by dark skies and slushy roads.        
	Unit trips        
	The rain warning came on a day Calcuttans suffered power cuts ranging from one to three hours, following the collapse of the 250-MW second unit of CESCs Budge Budge plant. The shortfall varied from 195 to 200 MW.        
	The disruption in supply started around 8am when the Budge Budge unit collapsed after a fault in its protection transformer.        
	We replaced the transformer by 3pm and the unit was synchronised, but another snag developed in the switchyard foiling our attempt to resume generation, said a CESC official.        
	According to the power utility, south Calcutta suffered more than north. The Budge Budge unit collapsed while repairs were on at the Kasba receiving station, which routes supply from the state grid. The repairs prevented us from drawing power from the state grid after the breakdown, said a CESC official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bengal ban on chicken and egg
                                                                                                            Bengal ban on chicken and egg
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Culling of chicken in Birbhum                                           
	The movement, sale and purchase of chickens, ducks, quails and their eggs have been banned for an indefinite period in Calcutta and all districts across Bengal.        
	The extreme measure announced by the state government on Tuesday comes three weeks after the first fear of bird flu broke out in Birbhum. The ban covers all private farms in the state as well.        
	Though bird flu has actually hit only 13 districts, the possibility of the virus striking the adjoining districts, located within a five km radius, cannot be ruled out. Barring Calcutta, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling, almost all districts are affected, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said at Writers Buildings on Tuesday afternoon.        
	The entire country is keeping an eye on the measures we are taking. If any human being is infected the government would be pulled up. We cant afford to leave anything to chance at this juncture, he added.        
	Later, in a notification, the principal secretary of the animal resources development department stated: Although no case of human infection has been reported so far, it is imperative that the government does not ignore that possibility.        
	Officials said surveillance is being maintained on three million human beings, but 23 samples, which were sent to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal, have tested negative.         
	Municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhayay has directed the chief manager (markets and licence) Bhaskar Ghosh to cancel licences of traders found flouting the ban.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee left for Delhi on Tuesday to meet the Prime Minister and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar regarding rehabilitation funds for affected families.

	Calcutta police has written to Calcutta University (CU) and Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) authorities asking them to bolster security on their campuses.        
	In view of the bomb scare in Calcutta, the police have issued guidelines to the universities for handling bomb threat calls, suspicious baggage, recovery of bombs and blasts. The guidelines include comprehensive plans to prevent an explosion and deal with one.        
	We have asked the university authorities to tighten security on campuses. Similar guidelines have also been sent to the Indian Museum and Victoria Memorial authorities, said Sivaji Ghosh, the additional police commissioner.         
	According to the officials of the universities, the police have held meetings with security guards regarding implementation of the guidelines.        
	We have alerted officials, teachers and heads of departments of our seven campuses. They have been asked to strictly follow the guidelines given to us by the police, said CU registrar Basab Chaudhuri.        
	RBU vice-chancellor Karuna Sindhu Das also said staff members and students have been asked to abide by the guidelines. The guidelines include identification of vulnerable points in every building, vigil at such points and installation of caller line identification machines with recording facility, cameras and public address system.

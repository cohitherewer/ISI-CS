                      Composite reality                    In a post-colonial, global world, the term hybrid is one of empowerment. It evokes the idea of oneness and constructs an impression of a community that is intermingled and intricate. Rajesh Rams imagination pushes these associations of the term to their extreme. In Hybrid, the ongoing solo exhibition of his paintings and sculptures, he conjures up off-springs that are not just mixed racially, but are a mixed species  human, animal and vegetable, envisioning his concept of a future where this may come to pass. In his works, the complex patterns of Rams imagination weave through contemporary concerns. Through the repeated use of vegetables and the construction of bodies that are lean and frail due to lack of food, the artist addresses the world food crisis. In the painting, Daughter of a Vegetable Seller (picture along), a young girl going to school is painted with an elaborate, strange hairdo. Brinjals and pointed gourds cover her hair instead of plaits and pins. Burdened by the dual task of studying and working, she sells vegetables in her spare time. Yet, the beauty of the work shines through. Not one to cloak the world in greater despair, Ram is seen pointing gently, beautifully and imaginatively towards situations and problems.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Rajesh Ram When: Till August 16 (Tuesday to Sunday); 11 am - 7 pm Where: Anant Art Gallery, 18A Alipore Road,

          RITH BASU                                             
	The puff brigade in town is getting a Puja bonus from the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee administration.         
	With hours to go for the smoking ban in public places to come into effect, there is no system in place to penalise offenders. Fines for violating the ban cannot be collected without handing the offenders a challan.        
	Challans have not been provided to any of the officials authorised to implement the law, despite the health department getting four months to prepare for the ban.        
	The act regulating tobacco products was passed in 2003 and the notification on the ban was issued on May 30 this year.        
	It will take us at least till the end of October to provide challans to all hospital superintendents and college principals, said Satyoban Ghosh, the nodal officer (tobacco) in the state health department.        
	Tax inspectors, station masters, gazetted officers, postmasters, public and private office heads, librarians and airport officers, too, can slap the Rs 200 fine.        
	According to sources in the health department, a joint task force of representatives from various departments like education, tourism, home and information and culture was formed on Tuesday to work out how to sensitise institutions associated with each department to the new law.         
	Hotels and restaurants, though unhappy about the inevitable slide in footfall after imposition of the ban, said they would follow the rule. We received the ban guidelines from the health ministry months ago, said S.K. Khullar, the president of the Hotels and Restaurants Association of Eastern India.        
	The acting registrar of Jadavpur University, Subir Chandra Chakraborty, and the superintendent of NRS Hospital, L.K. Ghosh, said they had not received fine receipts or any intimation from the state government regarding the ban.

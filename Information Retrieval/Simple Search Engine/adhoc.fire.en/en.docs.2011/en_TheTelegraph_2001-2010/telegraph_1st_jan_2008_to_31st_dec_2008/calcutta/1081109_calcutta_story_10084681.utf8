Manalee Aranyak
                                          
	Manalee Aranyak (Manalee Forest Resort), situated 15 km from Durgapur railway station, is an idyllic destination for the nature lover.         
	First, it is not crowded  at least till now  because very few people have heard of it and even fewer go there.         
	Secondly, it is easily accessible from Calcutta. One needs to board one of the many trains from Howrah or Sealdah that touch Durgapur and then take a taxi.        
	Spread over 22 acres, Manalee Aranyak gives you a taste of virgin nature.         
	The red laterite soil is not conducive to greenery, but the untiring effort of some nature lovers has turned the spot lush green.         
	Manalee Aranyak boasts of all types of trees  mango and jackfruit to cashew and tissue-culture Burma teak and even rare medicinal plants. There are also sal, akashmoni and mohua trees in and around the resort.         
	Though a planted forest, the place has the look and feel of a virgin forest.        
	We had the unique experience of watching the moon rise over Manalee Aranyak, bathing the resort in soothing silver light.         
	If you go there during the monsoon, you will witness the heavenly sight of rain falling over a lush green forest from an observatory. It is an ideal place for rejuvenating your senses at the end of a hectic week.        
	The living arrangements are simple  there are three bedrooms with attached bathrooms (the water is drawn from a well through a mechanical pump). A makeshift dining table placed under a neem tree makes eating out a memorable experience.         
	Manalee Aranyak may not retain its virgin beauty for long.         
	Plans are afoot to turn the quaint resort into a commercial tourism hub  horse-racing and camel-racing are on the cards, subject to government approval. An additional 19 acres have been earmarked where artificial lakes and hillocks may be built. As nature lovers are unsure whether such initiatives will enhance the attraction of the place, it may be a good idea to visit Manalee Aranyak as soon as possible.                    
	Going         
	Manalee Aranyak is 15 km from Durgapur railway station. Take a train to Durgapur and hire a cab. The fare is around Rs 400. Or take a bus from Durgapur Benachiti and get off at Pratappur.                     
	Staying         
	There are three cottage-style rooms at the resort. The tariff is Rs 600 per day up to four persons and Rs 100 extra for each additional person.

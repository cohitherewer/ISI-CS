                      A slice of lifes rich tapestry                    Around the world, women are at the highest risk of being poor. Greater economic opportunity empowers women  and their families  to escape poverty. Chandaben Shroff, a social worker, discovered the remarkable minehouse of creative talent lying latent among the rustic women of the Kutch region of Gujarat in 1969. Guided by the principle of women empowerment, she penetrated into the lives of these poor, marginalised villagers and gradually, with a local craftsperson, Parmaben, set up the first workshop with 30 women at Dhaneti. Shrujan was born. Since then, there has been no looking back for this organisation. It has been providing employment and generating income at the micro level for the last 40 years. Today, more than 3,000 women use their skills to create exquisite hand embroidery that is fashioned into high quality garments and home furnishings. The ongoing exhibition depicts a wide array of exquisitely embroidered sarees, chaniya-choli sets, dupattas, salwar sets, stoles, bags, tops, skirts, pants, shawls, mufflers, wall hangings, bed spreads, cushion covers, et al. The multi-coloured creations by these nameless, faceless but highly talented women from the arid land continue to fascinate art connoisseurs all over the world.            Event: Hand-embroidery products by members of Shrujan When: Till December 6; 10 am - 7 pm Where: Artisana, 13 Chowringhee Terrace, 1st floor, 9422

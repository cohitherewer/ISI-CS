                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Govt drags feet on tuition crackdown
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	After six years of futile attempts at stopping private tuition the state government is now trying to delay a crackdown on the parallel education system.         
	The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) will conduct a series of studies to find out what draws students and guardians to private tutors, school education minister Partha Dey said in the Assembly on Monday.         
	That the minister did not set a timeline for the survey was an indication that the government was buying time before a politically sensitive decision.         
	The grant of autonomy to Presidency College was delayed similarly, following opposition by the CPM-controlled Government College Teachers Association.         
	Dey tried to put up a brave front on the issue of private tuition. He said the survey would help the government gather critical information.         
	The state government is against private tuition and has taken a number of steps over the past few years to stop the practice. We need to know why students are still so keen on taking personalised help. Are they really benefited by private tuition? said Dey while replying to a question by CPM member Samsul Mollah.        
	Sources in the academic circle feel the government has intentionally adopted the delaying tactics as it knows that the problem is deep-rooted.        
	Guardians do not have faith in the government-controlled and government-aided schools. Having failed to motivate students and guardians against private tuition, the government has realised that it is not easy to keep them away from private coaching. Hence the attempt to delay a crackdown, said a senior teacher of a government-aided school in south Calcutta.         
	The state government had announced its plan to stop private tuition in 2002. An order was issued asking teachers of state schools to provide a written undertaking that they would not offer private tuition.        
	The government said teachers who taught students in private for money would be punished but was forced to soften its stand following opposition by the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Association.

	The Centre for Rural and Cryogenic Technologies of Jadavpur University (JU) has developed herbal mosquito repellents in association with the Moromi Human Resource Development Society based in Tollygunge and Howrah.        
	The repellents, available as incense sticks, candles and sprays, were launched on campus on Tuesday.        
	The floral-scented incense sticks called Mukti and candles called Puspa will hit the shelves within a fortnight. A box of 10 incense sticks will cost Rs 20.         
	The researchers say each stick will burn for two to two-and-a-half hours and keep mosquitoes at bay for six to seven hours. The candles will last longer and are priced between Rs 25 and 40. The sprays, which will also kill larvae, is expected to be ready in another month.         
	After seven to eight months of research and field tests on 1,000 people in Jadavpur and Howrah, we have concluded that these products are 100 per cent effective in repelling all kinds of mosquitoes, said JU pro-vice chancellor Siddhartha Datta.         
	Most insecticides we use are banned in other countries and repellents available in the market are known to affect the health of children and the elderly. But because our products have been developed from plants like neem, eucalyptus and nrishingha, they wont have harmful effects, Datta added.        
	JU will, however, not take up the task of marketing the products. They are willing to provide training to self-help groups or other agents who wish to manufacture them.         
	The prices are slightly high now because we had to bring the raw material from outside the state, but if the plants are grown here, the prices will fall, said Datta.         
	He, however, warned that mosquitoes could develop resistance to these repellents over time.        
	We need to continue the research and develop newer combinations, he said.

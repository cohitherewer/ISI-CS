          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Rizwanur Rahman                                  
	The high court division bench on Wednesday adjourned the verdict on pleas seeking an interim stay on Justice Dipankar Duttas order in the Rizwanur Rahman death case.        
	Justice Dutta had allowed the CBI to start criminal proceedings against seven persons accused of abetting Rizwanurs suicide. All the accused and the state moved the bench against the trial courts order.        
	We hope the CBI will not start criminal proceedings and file chargesheets against the accused till we pass the verdict, said Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice M. Sinha of the bench on Wednesday.        
	Ranjan Ray, the CBI counsel, assured the court that his client would not start the proceedings before the judgment was delivered.

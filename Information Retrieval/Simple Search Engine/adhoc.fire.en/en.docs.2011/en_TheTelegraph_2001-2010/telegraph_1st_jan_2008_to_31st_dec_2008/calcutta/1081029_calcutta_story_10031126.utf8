           hot wheels: Nano, which will now roll out of Sanand in Gujarat                           
	The Tata pullout will affect the rural youth more than those in the cities. The Nano project would have generated employment and introduced the rural people to a sphere of industry which, I am sure, would have been a pleasant and readily accepted change. Agriculture is no doubt very important as it is the mainstay of the economy of the state, but does Bengal have no place for any sort of industrialisation? Yes, there was a lot of controversy regarding the acquisition of land, but I am sure it could have been solved without such drastic measures. And I am really curious to know what the government will do with the land in Singur.           
	It is our bad luck that the leaders of our state do not know the limits of protest. This issue will not affect the Tatas in any way. They have already decided to build the Nano factory in Gujarat. The actual loss is ours, and it is all because our politicians could not rise above the egoistic race for power.           
	What message are we sending to the world? Do we want to project Bengal as a state that wants development? Or do we want to remain as a quagmire where bandhs, political disruptions and riots rule?

	The pullout by the Tatas marks the end of a beginning. It not only promised a better job environment for home-bred engineers in Bengal, but also a better life for the technically skilled but unemployed youth who are not engineers. Even the Tatas were imparting technical training to create a pool of skilled labour. However, while ruing the fate of these youths, one tends to forget the plight of the hundreds who gave up their land for the project. With the Nano project gone, these people have lost their jobs in the factory, they dont even have land to cultivate and earn a livelihood. Our leaders are worried about the political outcome of the fiasco, but nobody is concerned about the future of the land, which is now unfit for cultivation. We, the students, do not understand politics of either those in power or those in the Opposition, but we do understand what is good for Bengal, even if our leaders dont.

	The withdrawal of the Nano project is a major blow to the economy of the state and to the image of Bengal. More than employment and future industrial development, I think the youth of Bengal will suffer from a crisis of a sense of belonging to the state. One of our honourable ministers has said he does not want to live in Bengal. It is more natural for the youth to feel the same way. At a time when the whole world is undergoing a severe economic crisis, the pullout hurts our sense of well-being. The image we nurture of our motherland is under threat. We are almost ashamed to belong to this state. Every political leader is out to garner personal gains, thinking little for the common people of Bengal. If this is the example they are setting, should anything better be expected from the youth? This is the downfall of not only this project but also the state leadership. Even if we, the youth, want to do something for our state, we are denied the opportunity. The future of West Bengal seems bleak.

	Whatever progress Bengal made in the past few years and the positive image it created has been negated. The common perception is that Mamata Banerjee is responsible for the setback, but I believe the state government is equally to blame for the outcome. They must have known this would happen, but did not act at the appropriate time. It seems our politicians care more for their own good and their partys interest than for the state and its people, whom they claim to serve.

	I strongly believe that the youth of Bengal are resilient enough to weather this storm. They will eventually overcome the repercussions of the Singur fiasco. The cultural revolution of China had affected an entire generations education and training, but the nation managed to steer back on the right track. Todays youth, especially those who are likely to take up politics, should use the Singur controversy as a lesson to guide them in future.             
	Amiyo Sengupta,

	If India is a country of unpleasant politics, West Bengal is its motherland. Rather, it can be said that our state is the largest institution of disruptive politics. As a youth of West Bengal, I feel miserable about the Tata pullout. The Nano project would have provided employment to many young people like me. It would have boosted sectors like marketing, finance, engineering and manufacturing. The government and the Opposition must be thanked for their performances which would put any TV reality show to shame.

	It seems as if the Tata factory in Singur would have solved all our problems. Even if the Nano rolled out of Bengal, wouldnt we still have to commute in the same rickety, overcrowded buses? Wouldnt our roads still have potholes? Wouldnt there still be at least one road accident each day? Our necessities are more basic than just a few factories. We need education for all, food for all, safe roads and proper healthcare facilities. I do not see these related to the Nano project. Whether we have Nano or not, our lives would remain the same.

	It is common knowledge that an investor will always look for the best deal. The Tatas were getting a good deal from the West Bengal government. By setting up their small car factory here, the Tatas were not doing the people of Bengal any favour. As Bengal needs industries desperately, the Tatas were able to bargain with the state government to get the land almost for free. Is there any guarantee that the company wouldnt demand more concessions, costing the state exchequer dear? In the Nano project, probably the intentions were not right. Thats why things ultimately fell apart.

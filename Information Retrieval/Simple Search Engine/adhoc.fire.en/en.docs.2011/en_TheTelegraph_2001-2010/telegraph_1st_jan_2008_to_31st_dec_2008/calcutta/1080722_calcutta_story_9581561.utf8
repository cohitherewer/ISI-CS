The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | After death, admission
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       After death, admission
  - Hospital flouts rules fearing violence over negligence          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Medical College and Hospital on Monday allegedly admitted a man who died in the emergency department after lying unattended for several hours and issued a death certificate before the stipulated four hours had elapsed.         
	Relatives of Majan Lal Hari said the authorities were anxious to hush up the criminal negligence that led to his death and hastily issued the death certificate to pre-empt an attack on the hospital.         
	According to the death certificate, the 35-year-old resident of neighbouring BB Ganguly Street was admitted to the hospital with alcoholic hepatitis and died at 2.50pm. The rules prohibited the authorities from issuing the death certificate and releasing the body before 6.50pm. But Majans relatives and friends left the hospital in a mini-truck with his body around 5.15pm.        
	Binod, his brother, said they received the death certificate within an hour of Majans death. The doctors at the emergency were repeatedly asking us to take away the body from hospital as fast as possible.        
	Majan was first brought to the hospital on Sunday night with severe pain in his abdomen, chest and head. The authorities did not admit him, saying there was no bed.        
	He was brought back to the hospital around 7.30am on Monday and was again denied admission because of lack of beds.        
	He lay in the emergency for hours but no doctor even went near him. We watched him die, gasping for breath. How can the hospital say he was admitted? He died without any medical attention, said Binod.         
	Haris uncle Babulal, an employee of the hospital, said it was a mistake to take him there. I thought at least my relatives would receive proper treatment. Thats why we took him to the hospital today, even after the brush-off on Sunday night. Had we taken him to some other hospital, he would not have died without treatment.        
	A senior health department official expressed shock over the incident. Something seems very wrong. Except for the case of patients who had donated their eyes, a hospital cannot issue a death certificate or release a body within four hours of death, he said.        
	A.N. Biswas, the deputy medical superintendent of the hospital, said: This is a grave allegation. We have launched a thorough investigation. If we find anyone guilty of dereliction of duty that led to death of the 35-year-old man, we will take stringent action against him.

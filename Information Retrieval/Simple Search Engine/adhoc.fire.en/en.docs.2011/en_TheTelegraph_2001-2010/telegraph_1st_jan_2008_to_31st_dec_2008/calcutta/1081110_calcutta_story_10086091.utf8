	A mishap on Maniktala Main Road on Saturday evening sparked mob fury at Kankurgachhi crossing on Sunday morning.         
	More than 300 men from Kankurgachhi Second Lane vandalised vehicles and disrupted traffic at the intersection for more than three hours.        
	Stones hurled by the protesters damaged at least 10 autorickshaws and injured three drivers. Cars parked outside buildings in the area were damaged.        
	Police had to resort to lathicharge to control the mob.         
	Later, more than 100 autorickshaw drivers of the Girish Park-Phoolbagan route blocked the crossing to protest the vandalism and the police refusal to arrest the culprits.         
	On Saturday evening, 15-year-old Kaushik Patra was hit by a speeding Tata Sumo.         
	Doctors at Medical College and Hospital said my son might not be able to use his right leg again. Some angry residents of the area blocked the road to protest rash driving, said Kaushiks father Kartik, who drives an autorickshaw on the Girish Park-Phoolbagan route.

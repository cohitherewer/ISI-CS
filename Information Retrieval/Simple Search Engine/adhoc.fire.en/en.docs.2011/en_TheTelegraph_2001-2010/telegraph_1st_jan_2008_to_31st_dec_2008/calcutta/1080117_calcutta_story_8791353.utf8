    Two women pummelled each other at Calcutta airport on Wednesday, with one accusing the other of having stolen money from her employer in London, and the other stoutly denying the charge. Sukla Chandra, 35, told officials she had been working as a maid in the house of Jayanta Guha in London for the past three months. But, she alleged, Guha was not paying her the promised wages and was trying to forcefully keep her in London. She escaped and arrived in Calcutta. Kanon Devi, Guha rsquo;s mother-in-law, was waiting for her at the airport with some neighbours. A scuffle broke out between the women as soon as they saw each other. Both were arrested and a probe was launched.

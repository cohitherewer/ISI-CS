          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 50-year-old woman was arrested on Saturday for allegedly drugging a homemaker and robbing jewellery and cash worth Rs 55,000 from her flat in Girish Park.        
	Sandhya Ray had visited 40-year-old Tulsi Kherewals flat in the first week of October to sell saris after meeting her at a relatives house. Ray offered Kherewal prasad spiked with drugs and decamped with the valuables, said police.         
	Kherewal, who lived alone in the flat, lodged a complaint with Girish Park police station.        
	Investigations revealed that Ray had called up Kherewal on her cellphone from a public call office (PCO) in Salt Lake before she visited the Girish Park flat. We went to the PCO in Salt Lake and spoke to the owner but could not get any information about her, said Amit Mukherjee, an investigator.         
	The police got Rays cellphone number from Kherewals relatives house in Beleghata. The service provider helped them trace her house in Salt Lake.         
	Ray claimed she was the wife of a sepoy and was suffering from lung cancer. The family had taken a loan for her treatment. She said she was trying to repay the loan. Her two sons work in a private firm, stated an officer.

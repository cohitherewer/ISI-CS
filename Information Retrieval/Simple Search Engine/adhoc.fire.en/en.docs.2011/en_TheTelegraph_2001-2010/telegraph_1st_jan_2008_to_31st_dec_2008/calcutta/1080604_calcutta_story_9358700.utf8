                      Treachery and tragedy                    In a world where material wealth is considered the yardstick of success in life, there is no place for love, compassion and understanding, even within the family. This is the theme of Mukhomukhis play Aarohan (a scene from it appears here), being staged this evening as part of Mukhomukhi 12, the ongoing festival of plays by the group to mark its 12th anniversary. A family drama with a sinister plot, it shocks us into the realisation that natural human virtues have become totally extinct in a society that thrives on lust for power and money. The play confronts us with a family of siblings, in which the sister, Madhumita, conspires to rob her brothers of the wealth they have acquired from their business ventures. Such is her greed for money that not even her husbands failing health will restrain her from her evil designs. No less a match for her is her brother Tarakdas, who also does not hesitate to resort to dishonest, corrupt means to secure his ends. Full of malicious, dangerous intrigues, the play brings us face-to-face with the bitter, savage face of humanity. Drama, direction and acting: Soumitra Chattapadhyay. To be staged tomorrow: Nashta Asim, directed by Biplab Bandyopadhyay.                  Event: Play in Bengali, Aarohan, produced by Mukhomukhi When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Madhusudan Mancha

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta University (CU) is putting in place a system to regularly monitor academic and research activities in its 60-plus departments.        
	Under the system, the departments will have to state every six months the details of the papers published by its teachers and scholars in Indian and foreign journals.        
	The department heads will also have to provide particulars of seminars conducted and teachers selected for awards and invited to other institutes for attending seminars and delivering lectures, said university officials.        
	The proposal to start the system was discussed in a CU syndicate meeting on Thursday.        
	We want to track the academic activities, particularly research projects, taken up by our departments. Action will be taken if we find that a department is falling behind in terms of research, said CU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.        
	The syndicate is likely to take a final decision on the proposed system in next weeks meeting, added Das.        
	On Thursday, the syndicate decided to probe the large number of failures in pass papers of BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I and Part II examinations.        
	We are noticing that many examinees are clearing their honours papers in Part I and II and failing in the pass papers, said Das.        
	The inquiry will determine whether the syllabi of the pass papers need to be changed or not.        
	The university had received complaints that colleges are encouraging students to concentrate on honours papers at the expense of pass papers.

	The money in the bag could take him three years to earn. But thats something Gopal Saha, 21, did not even wait to find out.
    
	The sole breadwinner of his family had just one thought on his mind  that the heavy bag he had found in an auditorium of INOX (City Centre), after the evening show of Jodhaa Akbar on Monday, must be returned to its owner at once. The housekeeping staff member of the plex promptly deposited the bag  with Rs 1,22,000 and a bunch of credit cards  at the counter.
    
	Gopal, who lives with his ageing parents, takes home Rs 2,900 every month. So the bag was stuffed with 42 months of his salary. Even if I had known that the bag contained so much money, I would obviously have given it back. Etai to amar kaaj, said the shy youth, who comes to work from the interiors of Madhyamgram.
    
	Gopal (aami Madhyamik pass), lives in Humaipur Patuli, from where it takes him roughly two hours, by train and foot, to reach City Centre.
    
	This rare act of honesty was acknowledged by Salt Lake resident Radha Santhalia, who had gone to the movie with her daughter and only realised that she had left her handbag behind after returning home. She rushed back and much to her amazement, the plex authorities promptly handed over the bag. My belongings were intact; its not every day that you get to see this kind of honesty, she said.
    
	For Gopal, it was all in a days work. I have earlier returned mobile phones, a gold chain and other valuables, he said, reluctant to even pose for a photograph.

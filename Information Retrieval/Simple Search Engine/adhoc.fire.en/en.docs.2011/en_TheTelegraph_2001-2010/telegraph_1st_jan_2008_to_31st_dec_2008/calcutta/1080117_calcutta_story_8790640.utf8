     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra criticised the state-run hospitals on Wednesday for not acting in tandem to improve the healthcare system.
    
	Tell me frankly, how many of you really feel proud of this institution? the minister asked a large gathering at the 51st foundation day celebration of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education amp; Research at SSKM Hospital.
    
	The minister said that a majority of the requests for grants that reach his office come from individual departments of the state-run hospitals. 
    
	Everyone seems to be worried about his or her own department. I am not saying thats bad, but what we need is coordination among the departments and a unified attempt to push our healthcare system forward.
    
	Moreover, many of the departments fail to utilise the entire grant, stated the minister, in the presence of the medical education director, Jayasree Mitra.
    
	Mishra cited an example. There is a pressing need to expand the maternity wards in state-run hospitals. On the other hand, there are many departments where beds remain unutilised due to dearth of patients. This disparity would have been eliminated if there was coordination among the different departments of the hospitals.
    
	Former minister and economist Ashok Mitra, who was the chief guest, spoke about lopsided government spending.
    
	The defence budget always exceeds the health or education budget by far. For the past 60 years, about Rs 500,000 crore has been spent on security in Jammu and Kashmir. Has this expenditure ensured security? The money could have immensely improved our healthcare or education system, said Mitra.
    
	No one is safe if the countrys overall development is stunted due to poor economic policy, added Mitra.

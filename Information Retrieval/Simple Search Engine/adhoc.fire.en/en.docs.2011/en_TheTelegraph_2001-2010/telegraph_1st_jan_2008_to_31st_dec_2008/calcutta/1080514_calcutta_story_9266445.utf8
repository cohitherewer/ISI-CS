          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Flight services between Calcutta and Port Blair were affected for the second consecutive day on Tuesday due to heavy rain in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.        
	Water started accumulating on the runway since 3am. Conditions improved after 8am, said R.S. DCruz, the airport controller at Port Blair.        
	One flight of Air India and two flights of Deccan were cancelled. Following the runway clearance at 11am, two flights of Jet Airways and a flight each of JetLite and SpiceJet could land at and take off from the islands capital.        
	Air India officials said they would operate two flights on Wednesday to clear the rush at Port Blair. K.K. Das, the assistant meteorologist at Port Blair, attributed the heavy shower to the onset of monsoon.

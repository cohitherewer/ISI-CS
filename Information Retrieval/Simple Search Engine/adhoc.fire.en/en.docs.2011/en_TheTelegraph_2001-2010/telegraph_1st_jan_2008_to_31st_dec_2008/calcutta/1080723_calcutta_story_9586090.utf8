                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Double treat for theatre lovers 
          A STAFF REPORTER                          The Minerva theatre after renovation                                   
	The stage is set for two theatre festivals in Calcutta this monsoon.         
	The Minerva Festival, organised by the state department of information and culture, is scheduled from July 25 to August 8 and will be free and open to all. This will be the first public function at the 115-year-old theatre after its renovation.         
	The second festival, hosted by the Natya Akademi, will begin in Delhi with a seminar on The influence of Tagore on Indian theatre on September 6 and 7. This will be followed by four days of theatre, music and discussions at Sisir Mancha in Calcutta from September 25 to 27.         
	The selection of plays for the Minerva festival has, however, created a flutter since a number of theatre groups has been sidelined. Kaushik Sen, whose group Swapnasandhani was left out, said: Even if I had been asked, I wouldnt have participated. It is just an eyewash; there is still no plan on how Minerva will function as a theatre centre and how itll be different from other halls.        
	Pradip Ghosh of the information and culture department said: We cant include everyone. We have to make space for a few groups from the districts too.         
	The Minerva festival will be inaugurated by the chief minister on July 25 in the presence of Kumar Roy. Theatre songs by Debajit and Riddhi Bandyopadhyay and Bohurupees play Phulloketur Pala will follow. On subsequent evenings (6.30pm), various plays will be staged with two shows (3pm and 6.30pm) on weekends.        
	Theatre Commune will stage Gaganendra, Rangakarmee will perform Kashinama, PLT will perform Utpal Duttas Ekla Chalo Re, Nandikar will stage two short childrens plays  Tomar Naam and Pakhi. Natadha will present Palashi and Theatre Workshop will enact Bhagoban Ja Koren Ta. Chetanas Putul Naacher Ithikatha will be followed by Theatre Passions Anukul, Mukhomukhi will present Praantoposhha, Rangapat will stage Aurangzeb and Aneeks Adventure Kare Koy.         
	The Natya Akademi festival, also to be inaugurated by the chief minister, will begin with a session of play reading. Next, Rabindrasangeet will be performed by RBU students, who will also present Tagore play  Kaaler Jatra  directed by Kumar Roy. Plays by other groups will follow.

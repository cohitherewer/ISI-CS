   A STAFF REPORTER
        Items from the Dagas rsquo; almirah lie strewn in their flat. A Telegraph picture 
   
	A gang of burglars broke into the flat of an iron merchant on BK Pal Avenue and decamped with Rs 30,000 and jewellery worth Rs 11 lakh on Monday.
 
	Police said the burglars struck around noon, when Ram Narayan Daga, 52, an iron pipe dealer, and his wife had gone to a relative rsquo;s house. 
 
	 ldquo;They returned at night and found the door of their fourth-floor flat open. On entering the house, they saw the almirah open, with the jewellery and cash inside missing, rdquo; said Vineet Goyel, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).
 
	A team from the burglary section of the detective department inspected the flat with sniffer dogs on Tuesday afternoon.
 
	 ldquo;A professional gang seems to have been involved in the burglary. No one has been arrested, rdquo; said the deputy commissioner. ldquo;The maid has been detained. We suspect the burglars had been tipped off by someone close to the Dagas that they would not be at home on Monday morning, rdquo; said an officer.
 
	The sleuths are puzzled over the fact that no one had seen any person entering the building in such a busy pocket around noon. A Montessori school is on the second floor.
 
	The police said after a preliminary probe that Daga, who owns two shops in Burrabazar, had bought the flat 10 years ago. The couple rsquo;s only son works in Dubai.
 
	 ldquo;Gangs from Bihar and Jharkhand are active in the area, targeting mostly business families. On many occasions, they had been tipped off by the servants of the families, rdquo; said a senior officer.
 
	Over the past few months, several such gangs had been rounded up in Burrabazar and its adjoining areas.

	A computer game on the right way to cross roads, puzzles and card games illustrating road safety  these were part of an automobile companys project to educate children in traffic safety. The Toyota Safety Education Programme (TSEP), directed at students of six to 12 years, was launched on the second week of August at St Xaviers Collegiate School. The project was launched in Bangalore last year. It will cover students of Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi this year.         
	A seven-minute animation film on small mistakes leading to big accidents was shown at the launch. It explained the need to follow oft-flouted rules like wearing a helmet, avoiding rash driving and using the zebra crossing. TSEP has identified three kinds of accidents: pedestrian-related, those happening due to road conditions and bad infrastructure facility.         
	Transport secretary Sumantra Choudhury said: Efforts are being made to introduce traffic rules and regulations as a compulsory subject in schools.        
	There will be five-minute instruction sessions during social studies or moral science classes to cover aspects of traffic safety. Traffic booths displaying messages will also be installed in the school premises to ensure active participation of children.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Two cheats who used to extort money by masquerading as police officers landed behind bars after one of their victims found the duo idling under the shade of a tree and discreetly made enquiries about their profession.        
	Sambhu Agarwal, 55, and Mohammad Iqbal, 38, had been preying on traders in the port area for a couple of months and brick supplier Ayan Chakraborty was one of those who paid them money for fear of being implicated in a false case.        
	Luck ran out for the duo when Chakraborty spotted Sambhu and Mohammad in Watgunge on Wednesday afternoon, looking more like vagrants than police officers. He asked the owner of a nearby paan shop who they were and was told that the duo specialised in duping people.        
	Chakraborty immediately approached a police patrol team that was passing by and it was endgame for Sambhu and Mohammad.         
	The officer-in-charge of Watgunge police station, Tenzing Bhutia, said Sambhu and Iqbal extorted money from Chakraborty when he was returning home from Munshigunge on May 21.         
	Clad in shirt and trousers, they intercepted Chakraborty around 9.30pm and introduced themselves as cops in plainclothes. They asked him to explain why he was roaming about in the area at night. When Chakraborty said he was a brick supplier and had gone to meet a client, the duo asked him to pay up, Bhutia said.        
	Sambhu and Iqbal would have settled for Rs 1,000 but got Rs 5,100 from Chakraborty. He panicked at the thought of being harassed and gave them all the cash he was carrying. The duo asked him to leave the area immediately, the officer said.         
	Sambhu is from Muchipara and Iqbal a resident of Tiljala.

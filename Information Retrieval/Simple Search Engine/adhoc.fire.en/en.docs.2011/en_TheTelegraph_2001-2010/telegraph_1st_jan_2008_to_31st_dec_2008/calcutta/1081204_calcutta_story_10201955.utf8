                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lawyer no-show delays Todi bail plea
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Ashok Todi                                  
	Tum bhanr mein jao (Go to hell), Ashok Todi had reportedly told son-in-law Rizwanur Rahman when he called him up and requested him to send back Priyanka.        
	Quoting from the CBI report, Todis counsel Jaymalya Bagchi said in the high court on Wednesday: These words dont suggest that my client had abetted Rizwanurs suicide.        
	He said the only intention of Ashok Todi  who will have to remain behind bars at least till Friday, thanks to lawyers no-show  was to break the relationship between daughter Priyanka and Rizwanur. This intention does not prove that he drove Rizwanur to suicide, the lawyer said.        
	Moving Todis bail plea before the division bench of Justice A.K. Talukdar and Justice P. S. Banerjee, Bagchi referred to a medical report of March 2008 which said the industrialist was suffering from a heart ailment. Todi needs immediate treatment. His health will deteriorate if his bail prayer is rejected, Bagchi submitted.        
	He said the Supreme Court had on October 13 restrained the CBI court from holding the trial in the Rizwanur case till Todis petition challenging the validity of an order allowing the CBI to file chargesheets was disposed of by the high court.        
	The Supreme Court had also directed the high court to dispose of the appeal by six months. So, the trial of the case will be held after six months. Since the investigation is over, what is the point in keeping my client behind bars? Bagchi asked.        
	Appearing for Rizwanurs brother Rukbanur, counsel Rajdeep Majumdar said: My senior, Kalyan Banerjee, is not in court today. The court should allow him to make a submission on Thursday.        
	The court granted his prayer and adjourned the hearing of the case till Thursday.        
	CBI counsel Ranjan Roy told the court that he would not be available on Thursday. The court should allow me to argue on Friday. The court granted Roys prayer, too. Legal experts said Todi could hope for bail only after the court heard out the lawyers representing Rukbanur and the CBI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Abductor of trader says he killed shoe baron
                                                                                                               Abductor of trader says he killed shoe baron
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Sadab Siddique, who kidnapped Howrah-based coal trader Sriram Bochasia, has confessed to plotting the murder of Ashish Dey, one of the owners of Sreeleathers, in Jamshedpur last year, said police.        
	The 24-year-old abductor had convinced his associates in Bochasias kidnapping to work for him by telling them how he had killed Dey.        
	The investigators did not disclose why Sadab had shot Dey on November 2, 2007, while the businessman was riding a two-wheeler to a Sreeleathers outlet.         
	We are working on the basis of Sadabs statement and are in touch with our counterparts in Jamshedpur, said Rajeev Kumar, the special inspector-general (operations) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).        
	The confession followed the arrest of Sadabs aide Kamran Akhtar, who was allegedly involved in the abduction. Sadab gained Kamrans trust by telling him how he had killed Dey, said a CID officer.        
	Bochasia was abducted in Salt Lake on March 9. His family paid a ransom of Rs 40 lakh to Sadab. The police first arrested Khalid Khan in Asansol. His interrogation led to the arrest of Sadab at Dum Dum airport when he was about to fly to Jaipur.        
	Sadab is wanted by Mumbai police. He had escaped from police custody after being arrested in an abduction and rape case.         
	His father, too, is lodged in a Mumbai jail in connection with a kidnap case.

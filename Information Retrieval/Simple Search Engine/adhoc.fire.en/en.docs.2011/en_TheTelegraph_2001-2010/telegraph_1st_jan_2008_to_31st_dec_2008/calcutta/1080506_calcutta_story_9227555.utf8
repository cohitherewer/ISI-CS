                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Besu upgrade runs into note block
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Besu campus in Shibpur. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Besu is not going to function as an Institute of National Importance (INI) from the 2008-09 academic session.        
	The upgrade of the Shibpur university to an INI has hit a roadblock, with the human resources development ministry yet to ready a Cabinet note that will kick-start the process.        
	Post-upgrade, the university will be known as Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology (IIEST).        
	The university was due to start its first IIEST session from the 2008-09 academic session. But ministry officials have told vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea that Besu will have to function as a state university for some more time.        
	N.K. Singh, the joint secretary in the ministry, told us that the bill to upgrade Besu could not be tabled in the Budget session of Parliament. He did not give us any deadline for tabling the bill, said Besu registrar Biman Bandopadhyay, who accompanied the vice-chancellor to New Delhi last week.        
	State higher education minister Sudarshan Roychoudhuri has been informed about the upgrade status. Officials said the vice-chancellor would write to the Centre, seeking an early upgrade of the university.        
	Ministry officials said the IIESTs (a cluster of five institutes, including Besu) could be set up by including a schedule in the NIT Amendment Bill. The bill was scheduled to be passed in the Budget session of Parliament.        
	Officials who are preparing the Cabinet note ahead of tabling the Bill are yet to get the nod from the finance ministry, planning and development ministry and the department of science and technology.        
	The finance ministry had recently sent back a draft note as it was not routed through the expenditure finance committee of the human resources development ministry.        
	Back at the university, the blame game is on. The authorities have not followed up the case with the ministry properly, said Besu Teachers Associations N.R. Bandopadhyay.

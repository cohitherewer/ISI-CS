                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chaos marks Day I of diversion
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Frayed tempers and heated arguments marked the first day of the traffic diversion to facilitate the construction of a ramp on the AJC Bose Road flyover. The police later put up more signboards along the rejigged routes.        
	The diversion took effect at 8am with all Mullickbazar-bound buses and minibuses along AJC Bose Road being forced to take SN Banerjee Road and the Park Street flyover, via the Dorina crossing.         
	Sealdah-bound vehicles had to take Cathedral Road and JL Nehru Road before hitting Moulali, via Lenin Sarani.        
	Lenin Sarani and the Dorina crossing struggled under the pressure of extra vehicles. Since Thursday was a holiday, we will wait for a few more days before assessing the situation, said a traffic police officer.        
	North-bound vehicles taking a right turn from Lansdowne were diverted to the Park Circus seven-point intersection, creating bottlenecks. It became worse in the evening. We had to work out a diversion plan at the rotary, said another officer.

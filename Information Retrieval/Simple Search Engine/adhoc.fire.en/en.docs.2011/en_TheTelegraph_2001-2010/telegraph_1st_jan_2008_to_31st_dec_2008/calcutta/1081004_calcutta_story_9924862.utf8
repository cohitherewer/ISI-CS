The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Varsity to challenge college seats order
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Varsity to challenge college seats order
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta Universitys decision to challenge the high court verdict that rejected a slash in B.Com (hons) seats at Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College has once again put a question mark on the future of 1,700 students.        
	We are waiting for the certified copy of the order. We will definitely challenge it when the court reopens after Puja vacation, said Dhrubojyoti Chatterjee, the pro vice-chancellor (academic affairs) of Calcutta University.        
	The university has no right to issue such an order without the senates approval, the court had observed on September 23 while delivering the verdict.         
	The college completed the admission procedure and started B.Com first-year classes on September 26  over two months behind schedule.         
	The seat-slash order was delivered after an inspection revealed that the infrastructure facilities as well as the number of teachers in the college were not enough for 2,000 students. The college must understand that cutting down seats is aimed at improving the standard of undergraduate education, said a university official.        
	A college official said the filled-up registration forms of first-year students had been sent to the university last Thursday. CU officials accepted the forms and the registration fees.        
	The students, however, fear for their careers. We do not want to lose more classes because of legal complications, said a student.        
	The CU authorities had issued the seat-slash order on June 20, when the admission process in the college was almost complete. The institute moved the high court against the order.        
	We are hopeful that the university will not do something that will jeopardise the careers of students, said Heena Gorsia, the secretary of the college.

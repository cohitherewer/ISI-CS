          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday asked the state government to file an affidavit within 24 hours stating details of the person who had first informed police about Rizwanur Rahmans body lying on the railway tracks at Patipukur.        
	It is mandatory for the police to record the details of a person who informs the force of an unnatural death. The documents that the state submitted to the court do not provide any information about the person who called the police after finding Rizwanurs body.        
	Justice Dipankar Dutta wants to know who had first alerted Government Railway Police (GRP) about the body and what exactly he had said on September 21 last year.        
	Rizwanurs family claimed that the GRP, which recovered the body and send it for post-mortem, had mentioned the age of the victim as 55 years. Rizwanur was only 29 years old. According to the family, the body found on the tracks was that of another person.        
	Kalyan Banerjee, representing the Rahmans, said if the CBI had not considered the discrepancy, the court should ask the agency to investigate the death again.

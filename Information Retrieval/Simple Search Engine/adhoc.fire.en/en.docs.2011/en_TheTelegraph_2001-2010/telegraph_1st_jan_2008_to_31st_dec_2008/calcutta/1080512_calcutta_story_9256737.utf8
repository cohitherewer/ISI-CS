The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | CMC in a single window
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CMC in a single window
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Come August 15, it will be simpler for citizens to pay their civic dues. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Come Independence Day, Calcuttans will not have to run from one civic office to another to deposit taxes or fees.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will introduce a one-window system of depositing house tax, trade licence fee, registration fee for a birth certificate or the fee for a revenue-clearance certificate.        
	We will introduce the system in all CMC offices across the city from August 15, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	A citizen will have to approach a revenue counter anywhere in the city during office hours and pay the tax or the fee. He will immediately get a receipt. The sanction fee for a proposed building in Sinthee can be paid in a Jadavpur office, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	Tata Consultancy Services has developed the one-window software and the trial run is on.        
	The system is being introduced as part of the CMCs Rs 100-crore e-governance programme, being funded by the British governments department for international development.         
	The department has given Rs 212 crore to the civic body to take up a capacity-building programme.        
	The civic authorities collect Rs 1.7 crore daily from the 100-odd counters across the city. The counters are item-specific in most borough offices  for instance, a counter that collects property tax will not accept amusement tax.        
	The new system is fool-proof and there is no chance of defalcation, like the one reported from the Gariahat treasury four years ago, said chief civic finance and accounts officer Debotosh Dasgupta.

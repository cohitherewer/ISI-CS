                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Todi moves for bail
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Ashok Todis lawyers filed a bail application in Calcutta High Court on Tuesday, claiming he was seriously ill and that there was no possibility of him leaving the country.        
	Todi, Rizwanur Rahmans father-in-law, was remanded in judicial custody till December 12 after he surrendered in the metropolitan magistrates court on Monday.        
	He complained of discomfort in the evening and was taken to SSKM Hospital for a check-up before being admitted to the Presidency jail hospital.        
	A senior official of Presidency jail quoted doctors who examined the businessman as saying that his condition was now stable.        
	But advocate Jaimalya Bagchi, one of the lawyers representing Todi, insisted that he was unwell and had a history of cardiac problems. We have filed the bail petition and it will be heard on Wednesday, he said.        
	Todi is one of the seven accused in the Rizwanur Rahman death case. The other accused are Todis brother Pradip, relative Anil Saraogi, three police officers and Pappu, a family friend of the Rahmans. Pappu is the only other accused in custody.        
	Bagchi said his client had co-operated with the CBI ever since it took up the case and would continue to do so.        
	Being a law-abiding citizen and an eminent businessman, our client will surely help the investigating agency as and when it is required. He will not leave the country if he is granted bail.        
	Another member of Team Todi said the bail plea hinged on the fact that the CBI hadnt arrested him during the probe. The CBIs investigation is over. So why keep him behind bars now? he asked, pointing out that the arrest warrant had been issued on the contentious point of the businessmans no show during court proceedings.        
	Rizwanurs family intends to oppose Todis bail plea. My clients have not been made party to the case but they will challenge the bail application, said the familys lawyer, Kalyan Banerjee.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Monday asked the state joint entrance examination (JEE) board to clarify why it would not produce the answer scripts of two candidates.        
	The candidates argued that their scripts had not been properly assessed and pleaded with the court to ask the board to produce the scripts.        
	Opposing the prayer, board counsel Subrata Mukhopadhaya said JEE rules do not allow production of answer scripts in court. The Supreme Court has issued a ruling empowering examination-conducting bodies to frame such rules.        
	Justice Soumitra Pal asked Mukhopadhaya to show him a copy of the apex court order and submit an affidavit on July 7 justifying the boards stand.        
	Four JEE candidates who are not satisfied with the results have moved the high court. Two of the petitions came up for hearing on Monday.         
	Yealina Chakraborty, one of the petitioners, said she had scored more than 90 per cent in the Higher Secondary exam but her JEE rank was 14,000. I was confident of a better rank, Yealina said, requesting the court to ask the JEE board to produce her answer scripts.        
	The judge asked the board to preserve Yealinas scripts.        
	The second petitioner, Rajdwip Das, said he had scored 92 per cent in Madhyamik and more than 80 per cent in the Higher Secondary exam. But his JEE rank was lower than 45,000, his lawyer said.

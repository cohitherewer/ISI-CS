     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	The civic authorities on Monday took over the management of a pond in south Calcutta that was being allegedly filled up by local promoters. It will soon be restored.
    
	A civic official said one-fourth of the privately-owned waterbody  spread across a bigha on Bakultala Road, in Kasba  has been filled up with sand and garbage.
    
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, mayoral council member (environment) Sushil Sharma and local councillor Dipu Das were present during the takeover of the pond, worth at least Rs 7 lakh.
    
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation acted following a landfill complaint lodged a month ago by local residents, including the councillor.
    
	We slapped a notice on the owners who could not be traced and lodged a police complaint. But the landfill did not stop, prompting us to take over the management of the pond under Section 17A of the Inland Fisheries Act, said Sharma.
    
	The civic body has taken over the management of seven ponds being illegally filled up by promoters over the past two years and restored them.
    
	The save-waterbody campaign will continue in 2008, asserted Sharma. Hundreds of ponds across the city have been filled up. The civic environment department should be given more teeth to fight landfill attempts.
    
	The pollution control board, too, has issued a guideline for the upkeep of ponds.

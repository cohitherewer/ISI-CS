  - COP KUDOS          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sergeant Saradindu Tikader: Gallant retriever. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	A womans bag was recovered within half an hour of her leaving it behind on a state bus on Friday morning, thanks to an alert traffic sergeant. The bag contained her voter identity card, office identity card, keys and spectacles.        
	The sergeant, Saradindu Tikader, from the Howrah bridge traffic guard, stopped the Howrah-bound bus near Brabourne Road after being alerted on the wireless and recovered the bag.        
	I knew that the bus was on route 6 but had no clue about its registration number. I had to stop and search three buses on the route before the bag could be recovered, recalled Tikader.        
	Sikha Dutta boarded the Calcutta State Transport Corporation bus in Garia on her way to office on Camac Street. She got off at the Exide crossing around 9.30am but left the bag behind. I realised my mistake minutes after the bus left, Sikha told Metro.        
	She approached a sergeant at the crossing and was escorted to Maidan police station, across the road.        
	The officers asked her to describe the bag and immediately sent a message to the Lalbazar control room, which in turn alerted all sergeants deployed on the route.        
	Tikader, posted at the Brabourne Road-Woodburn Road crossing, heard the message on the wireless at 9.40am.        
	He stopped two buses on route 6 and searched them with the help of the conductors and a constable, Pradip Singh, but in vain.        
	I was losing hope when a third bus appeared, around 10am. The womans bag was on it. As soon as I retrieved it, I sent word to my officer-in-charge Debu Bose, who informed the traffic control, Tikader said.        
	But the police could not get in touch with Sikha, as she was not carrying a cellphone.        
	A couple of hours later, she went to Howrah to enquire about the bus. It was from the depot that she called the police and came to know that her bag had been found.        
	Dutta was relieved to get it back. She wanted to treat me to some sweets but I refused, as I had only done my duty, the sergeant said.

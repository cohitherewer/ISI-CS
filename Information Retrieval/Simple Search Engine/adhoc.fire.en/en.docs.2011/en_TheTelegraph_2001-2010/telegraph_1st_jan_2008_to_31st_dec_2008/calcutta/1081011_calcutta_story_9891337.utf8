	Two green power plants, slated to come up in Calcutta and Howrah by summer 2010, may ease the electricity crisis in the city.         
	The West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation Limited is undertaking two green power projects in Calcutta and Howrah. The city plant will yield 60 MW of power and the one in Howrah, 7.5 MW. The power will be supplied to the distribution grid.        
	Both projects will come up through public-private partnership. We hope both projects will be commissioned by summer 2010, said S.P. Gon Chaudhuri, the managing director of the corporation.        
	Aston Field, a US-based company, and an NRI have shown interest in the Calcutta project. The civic body will take the final decision. The cost and location are yet to be decided, said Gon Chaudhuri.        
	The power corporation has decided to set up the Howrah plant on 20 acres in Sankrail. About Rs 50 crore will be required. The Howrah civic body has signed an agreement with SELCO, a Hyderabad-based company, he said.

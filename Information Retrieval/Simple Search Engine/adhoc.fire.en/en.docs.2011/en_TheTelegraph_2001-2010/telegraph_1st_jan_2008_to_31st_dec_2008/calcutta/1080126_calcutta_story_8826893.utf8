     OUR LEGAL REPORTER
               
	The fate of Book Fair 2008 will be decided a day before it is scheduled to start.
    
	After a day-long hearing on Friday, the high court division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose said the order on the two petitions challenging the legality of holding the fair on Park Circus Maidan will be delivered on January 28.
    
	The petitions have been filed by Voice of People and Darga Road Citizens Forum.
    
	On Thursday, the lawyers appearing for the petitioners had claimed that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had not called a mayoral council meeting before deciding to allow the fair in Park Circus.
    
	Nor did the civic body take the states consent  as required by the CMC Act  before approving the Publishers and Booksellers Guilds proposal on the fair venue, the lawyers had argued.
    
	Jayanta Mitra, appearing for the civic body, said on Friday: There is no provision in the CMC Act that makes the governments consent a must for approving the Guilds proposal. Whatever the CMC has done is for the cultural betterment of the city.
    
	Shaktinath Mukherjee, the Guilds lawyer, submitted that his client has taken a series of steps to keep pollution under check and ensure smooth flow of traffic.
    
	The state pollution control board, a party to the case, tabled a report of the study on the environmental ambience of Park Circus. We are only concerned about the environment of the area. The Guild will have to take steps to check pollution during the fair, said Kallol Basu, the boards lawyer.
    
	The fair verdict is pending but that has not prevented the Guild from going ahead with preparatory work on Park Circus Maidan. The court has not passed any order staying construction work at the site, said Tridib Chatterjee, the general secretary of the Guild. 
    
	He is confident that the fair will start according to schedule, provided the court gives the go-ahead.
    
	The confidence, however, is not shared by some publishers, who are yet to start stall decoration, fearing a last-minute cancellation. Even if the fair starts on January 29, it will wear a shabby look at least for the first couple of days, said a publisher.
    
	Road rally case
    
	The case related to curbs on weekday rallies was included in the daily cause list of the court on Friday, after a gap of four years. Sources said the case will be heard on February 2.

										      Climate watch                      A  polluting  factory                          
	What the Bengal government preaches, it does not practise, at least on the climate front.        
	At a recent meeting in the pollution control board office in Salt Lake, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the time when only scientists were concerned about climate change has passed, and politicians must understand its implications and act accordingly.        
	The government, though, is hardly acting the way it should  be it by planning a chemical hub in Nayachar or not controlling emission of greenhouse gases by industries and foul fumes by vehicles.        
	Nayachar, an island near the Sunderbans that emerged from the Bay of Bengal in the 1930s, was chosen as the site of the chemical hub after mass protests in Nandigram, where the facility was initially planned. The small, unconsolidated sandbank is just three metres above the mean sea level and is often inundated by high tide.        
	Nayachar is located near the place where the Haldi river drains into the sea. It is in the same coastal offshore zone where islands like Lohachhara, Supari Bhaga, Kapasgadi and Bedford were submerged by the sea not too long ago as an effect of global warming. Nayachar is likely to suffer the same fate, said Subrata Sinha, the retired deputy director general of the Geological Survey of India.        
	According to him, the government did not consider the islands vulnerability to climate change while planning the hub.        
	From sea-level rise to cyclone, a disaster triggered by climate change can wipe out not only Nayachar but the entire region, said Sunanda Bandopadhyay, a Calcutta University professor who has worked extensively in the region.        
	We did not consider the impact on climate change on the proposed hub, confirmed a member of the state-appointed expert committee on Nayachar.        
	The mushrooming of sponge iron factories in the state over the past decade is another result of the state governments callousness towards environmental damage.        
	The government agencies have minimal control over industries and they continue to pollute the environment with toxic emission, often completely ignoring the norms, said an environmentalist.        
	He complained that apart from imposing token fines from time to time, the government has not made any effort to control the menace.        
	The situation is as bad, if not worse, in the transport sector with polluting vehicles belching out poisonous fumes every day. And to not upset the powerful transport lobby, the state government has so far only watched in silence.       JAYANTA BASU

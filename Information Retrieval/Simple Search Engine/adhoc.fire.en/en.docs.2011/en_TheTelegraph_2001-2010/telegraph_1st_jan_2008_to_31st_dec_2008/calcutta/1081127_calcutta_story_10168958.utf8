The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Cops blame probe delay on dual complaints
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cops blame probe delay on dual complaints

	Police claim action against the loan recovery agents who had assaulted Pradip Sureka and taken away his car has been delayed by a procedural hassle caused by two complaints on the same incident.         
	Sureka, a 52-year-old businessman, had first gone to Behala police station and filed a general diary. After getting his car back from the Upper Wood Street branch of ICICI Bank, he went to Shakespeare Sarani police station to file a complaint about harassment, damage to the vehicle and theft of certain articles that were inside it.        
	 There cant be two parallel cases on the same incident. Shakespeare Sarani police station has already drawn up a case and started probing it. We can take up the case only if a court orders us to do so, said Sunil Kumar Chaudhary, the additional police superintendent of South 24-Parganas. By the time we could conduct an inquiry, a case had been lodged with Calcutta police.         
	The incident occurred on November 21, when Sureka and his son Pranay were leaving their Behala home for work. Four youths stopped them, snatched the keys and assaulted them before driving off in the Ford Ikon.         
	They beat me up saying I had not been paying the EMIs for the Rs 4.5-lakh car loan I had taken from ICICI bank. The court document they flung on my face was in the name of Chanda Prasad but the car number mentioned alongside was the same as that of my vehicle. I knew the bank had made a mistake, Sureka said.        
	The mistake was confirmed when father and son reached the Upper Wood Street branch of ICICI Bank but officials there allegedly misbehaved with them.        
	Sureka said he would file a case in the Alipore criminal court on Thursday. Around 50 people, including employees of other banks, staged a demonstration outside the Upper Wood Street branch on Wednesday.

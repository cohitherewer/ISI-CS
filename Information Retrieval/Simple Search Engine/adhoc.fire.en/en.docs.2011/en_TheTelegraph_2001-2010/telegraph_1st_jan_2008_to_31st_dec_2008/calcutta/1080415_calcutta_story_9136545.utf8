                      Sensuous strokes                    Marked by a wistful romanticism, the paintings of Nirmalendu Mandal bear impressions of a style that is contemporary, yet harking back to an age of blissful indolence. Principally, women are the subjects of his works, their moods wavering from the coquettish to the sublime. Natives of an idyllic, peaceful world, they are surrounded by delicate flora, fauna and foliage. Just Figuratives, the ongoing solo show of his works in acrylic, presents a collection that is distinguished by a certain dream-like quality. Inspired by the beauty in women and nature, Mandals canvases are enveloped by a warm sensuousness.                  Event: An exhibition of paintings by Nirmalendu Mandal When: Till April 16; 3 pm - 8 pm Where: Gallery Exposure, 54B Mahanirban Road

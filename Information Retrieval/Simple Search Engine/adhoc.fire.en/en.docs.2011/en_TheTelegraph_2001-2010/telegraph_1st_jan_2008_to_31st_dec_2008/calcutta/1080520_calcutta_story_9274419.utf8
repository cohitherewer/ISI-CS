  - Demand for evening, weekend classes        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	 Software professional Rupam Paul needed a management degree to climb quickly up the corporate ladder but he could not afford to leave his job and pursue a full-time course.        
	 Arnab Sadhu, an NIIT employee, decided to pursue a part-time business course but was struggling to find one compatible with his work hours.        
	Rupam and Arnab are on their way to fulfilling their MBA dreams, thanks to customised courses being offered by B-schools to reach out to more students.        
	While the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, conducts a full-time, one-year residential course for executives, the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Management (IISWBM) offers a three-year evening course and the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT), a three-year weekend programme.        
	The courses draw people from diverse backgrounds, from software professionals, WBCS officers and bankers to doctors, journalists and accountants. The range of experience varies from three to 30 years.        
	Applications to executive programmes have doubled in the past two years in institutes like the IISWBM.        
	The demand has increased mainly because of the need for skill upgrade to cope up with the volatile business environment, says K. Rangarajan, a professor and the head of the Calcutta centre of IIFT.        
	Change in work culture has necessitated such courses, feels B.B. Chakraborty, a professor at IIM Calcutta. People no longer stay in one job. Employees need to acquire varied skills, so that they can fit whatever role they get.        
	Paul, who has joined the part-time international business course at IIFT, says: Taking time off from work is not an option for me. Thankfully, I can attend classes only on weekends.         
	Part-time courses must be flexible to maintain their demand, according to Ashok Banerjee the head of the evening programme at the IISWBM.        
	For example, evening classes have given way to weekend ones in some institutes as it difficult for working executives to concentrate in the classroom after a day in office.        
	The shift proved a boon for Sadhu, who has joined the programme at IIFT. He has been working for four years and could not join an MBA course earlier as he is generally in office till night.

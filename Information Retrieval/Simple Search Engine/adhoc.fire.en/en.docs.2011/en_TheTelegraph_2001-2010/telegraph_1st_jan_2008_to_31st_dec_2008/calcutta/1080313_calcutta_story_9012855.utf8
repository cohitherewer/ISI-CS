The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | 96 scripts lost, found
                                                                                                               96 scripts lost, found
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A schoolteacher had left behind 96 physical science answer scripts of Madhyamik in a taxi on Tuesday night. But fortunately for the examinees, driver Dwarika Roy proved to be more alert and helped police return the scripts to Mohammad Khaliquezzaman the next morning.        
	The 51-year-old teacher of Bangalipara High School, in Garden Reach, had gone to the Bansdroni residence of head examiner Rabindranath Panigrahi to return a set of corrected scripts. After receiving the scripts, Panigrahi handed over another set to Khaliquezzaman.        
	The teacher boarded a bus from Bansdroni and got off at Hazra around 10pm. From there, he took a cab for Garden Reach along with a few others. But when he got off at the crossing of Kidderpore Road and Diamond Harbour Road, Khaliquezzaman left behind the bag containing the scripts.        
	He realised his mistake just after reaching home and immediately went out looking for the taxi. He went to Hazra and Esplanade but failed to spot the driver. Finally, around midnight, he approached Watgunge police station, said an officer.        
	Meanwhile, Roy, after dropping off the passengers, parked the vehicle on Orphangunge Road around 11pm and retired for the day. Early on Wednesday, while cleaning the vehicle, Roy noticed the bag lying under the glove apartment.        
	He immediately informed the police station about the bag. Officers rushed to the spot and on realising that the bag contained Madhyamik scripts, they brought it to the police station and called up Khaliquezzaman. The driver has done a good job. We will recommend his name for the police medal, said an officer.

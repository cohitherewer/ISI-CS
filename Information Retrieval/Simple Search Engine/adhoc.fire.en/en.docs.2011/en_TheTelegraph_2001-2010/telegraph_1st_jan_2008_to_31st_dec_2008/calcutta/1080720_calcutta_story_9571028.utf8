The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | On the beaten track 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       On the beaten track 
										      Eyewitness                                (Top) A work by Ramu Das on display at Mon Art Gallerie; (above) a painting by Abani Sen				                           
	Mon Art Galleries current exhibition titled Ideas, Images, Experiences highlights young artists trained in Calcutta and Santiniketan. There are six artists on view. They are technically sound like most artists from this part of the country but have no new experiences to offer.         
	The quasi-surrealist, quasi-folk, quasi-erotic images do not fail to follow the beaten track. Ramu Dass realistically painted snail lady and the milk pouches ensconced on a sofa are meticulously painted to look like the real thing. And everyone knows what a cowrie shell resembles. But the works tell little more than that.         
	Chairs, houses and hollow shirts and ties proliferate in Soumya Samantas canvases. But in each work a single chair or shirt is strikingly different from the rest.         
	Arunima Sanyal paints large human figures that seem to exist in various dimensions simultaneously. The Europa-style man on the bull has a bright red backdrop.        
	Mahmud Husains fluid lines are borrowed from patachitras and his improbable hybrids from a contemporary master. Two artists have two installations to their credit. But Saikat Surais hands of puppeteers and photographs hanging from them, and Bhaskar Chowdhurys corner are more like assemblages than anything else.              
	Abani Sen (1905-1972) is enjoying a new lease of life at Emami Towers on Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in a retrospective organised by Emami Chisel Art. He along with Gobardhan Ash founded Artist Rebel Group in 1930 but that did not last long.         
	Sen was a powerful draughtsman and watercolorist who could bring to life human beings and animals and landscapes with a few telling strokes of his brush and hardly any colour.         
	His experiments with form are also very significant and are precursors of much of the experimentation done at a later stage by the more progressive Bengali artists.         
	Ina Puri, who has curated this retrospective, has also published a book on Abani Sen which was released on this occasion. Abani Sen: Whispered Legacy is well produced with faithful reproductions of the artists work. It also has some invaluable photographs.       SOUMITRA DAS

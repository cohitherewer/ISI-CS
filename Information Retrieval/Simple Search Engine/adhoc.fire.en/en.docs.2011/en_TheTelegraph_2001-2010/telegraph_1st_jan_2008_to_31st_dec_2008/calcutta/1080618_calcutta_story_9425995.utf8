          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	A gang broke into a garment traders flat in Lake Town on Monday and fled with cash and ornaments worth Rs 5 lakh.         
	Ashok Jain said he detected the heist on returning from his Burrabazar shop around 10pm. As he reached his fourth-floor flat in Puja Apartments, on Canal Street, he noticed the front-door lock broken. Inside, the steel almirah was ransacked.         
	The robbery comes a day after a gang raided the flat of Shib Shankar Das, a bank officer, in Dakshindari, half a kilometre from Jains flat, and fled with jewellery and cash worth Rs 26 lakh. It seems a gang of professionals are at work, said Ashok Biswas, the additional superintendent of police (North 24-Parganas).

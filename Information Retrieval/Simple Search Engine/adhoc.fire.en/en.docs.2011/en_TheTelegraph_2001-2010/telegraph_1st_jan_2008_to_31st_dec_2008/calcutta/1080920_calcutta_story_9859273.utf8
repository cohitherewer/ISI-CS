The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Land transfer law back in force
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Land transfer law back in force
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	A Calcutta High Court ruling on Friday will help stop illegal transfer of plots and other property in Salt Lake.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice S. Banerjee quashed a state government notification dated March 23, 1998 that had kept in abeyance the West Bengal Government Land (Regulation of Transfer) Act, 1993.        
	The legislation had been enacted to restrict transfer of land in Salt Lake. But the law was kept in abeyance as it was challenged several times in court, said advocate Arunava Ghosh, who has been involved in several property transfer cases in Salt Lake.         
	The notification was issued in 98 as the government felt the need to give the legislation more teeth. The other trigger was the complication over property transfer because of ambiguities in the legislation.         
	The 1993 act had several loopholes. There was no provision to check property transfer through the gift route. Though the municipality challenged such transfers, in most cases the courts allowed them, added Ghosh.        
	The government, however, kept the law in abeyance and did not modify it, allowing property transfers in Salt Lake to escalate over the past decade.         
	Quashing of the notification will apparently stop plot transfers in Salt Lake, said Basab Aich, the secretary of Salt Lake Welfare Association, said. But we have not got a copy of the court order, so it is difficult for us to comment on the issue at this moment.        
	Fridays order was passed on a PIL by Himangshu Halder. The high court also took up another case  originally filed in a Barasat court  in connection with the abeyance notification.         
	Halder, in his petition, alleged that the government had made a mistake by keeping a vital act in abeyance.         
	The petitioner in the Barasat court case had argued that property transfers in the state were suffering because of the notification.         
	As the two cases were similar, the high court decided to hear the matters simultaneously, said advocate Ghosh.         
	When the judges asked advocate-general Balai Roy on Friday to explain why the government had issued the notification, he replied: I have also advised the government to withdraw the notification. He pleaded with the court not to quash the abeyance notification till the necessary alterations were made to the land transfer act.        
	The court gave the government three months to make the changes.

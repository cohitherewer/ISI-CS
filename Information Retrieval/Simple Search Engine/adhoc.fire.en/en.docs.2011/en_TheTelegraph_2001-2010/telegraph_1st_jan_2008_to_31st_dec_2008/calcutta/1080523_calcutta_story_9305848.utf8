  - Bengal shelter eager to renovate Heritage college street address          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                          Caffeine-fuelled adda: Inside the College Street Coffee House. A Telegraph picture				                                       
	Indian Coffee House on Bankim Chatterjee Street, one of the enduring symbols of the citys penchant for caffeine-fuelled adda, wants a makeover as its gift on the 50th anniversary of its takeover by the Indian Coffee Workers Cooperative Society Ltd.        
	The cooperative society has requested Bengal Shelter to renovate the historical building, which continues to attract around 1,000 customers a day, despite the peeling plaster and paint on the walls, the cracked ceiling and the creaking stairs.         
	A meeting between officials of Bengal Shelter and members of the management is slated for Monday to discuss the terms and conditions of the proposed revamp.         
	We approached several companies and Bengal Shelter was the one that seemed the most eager to help us. We do not have the money to renovate the premises ourselves, said Dipankar Dasgupta, the accountant and spokesman for the cooperative society.         
	Bengal Shelter, which is also developing a book mall on College Street, will spend around Rs 25 lakh on Indian Coffee House. What remains to be decided is when the company will start work and how soon it will complete it.         
	We cannot afford to close down the establishment even for a short period. So, work has to be done at night, Dasgupta said.        
	Indian Coffee House earns Rs 20,000 a day on an average and employs around 70 people.         
	Apart from repairing the damaged portions, Bengal Shelter intends to spruce up the interiors of the building without tampering with the original look.         
	We have to repair the toilet, kitchen and the staircase and paint the walls. We have other plans, too, like having an area where posters can be pasted. We could also put up a board for visitors to leave comments, but it has to be ensured that obscene remarks are not scribbled there. We do not want to change the look of the place, Samar Nag, the managing director of Bengal Shelter, said.         
	Dasgupta echoed him, saying it would be inappropriate to turn Indian Coffee House into a swank outlet like the ones in shopping malls across the city. We will ensure that the companys proposals do not clash with ours. In any case, we have to seek the state governments permission, though getting it wont be a problem because we will not be making structural changes.        
	The government acquired the two coffee house floors of the building, formerly owned by Bhabi Property, for Rs 26 lakh in 1996.

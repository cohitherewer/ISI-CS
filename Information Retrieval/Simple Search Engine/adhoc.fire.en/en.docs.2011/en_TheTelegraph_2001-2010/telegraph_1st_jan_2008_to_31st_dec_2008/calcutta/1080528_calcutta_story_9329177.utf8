          A STAFF REPORTER                          Concretisation of 66 km of tram tracks is pending for funds. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Concretisation of the citys remaining 66 km of tram tracks will start very soon. The process started in 2004 and 76 km have already been completed.        
	Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty on Tuesday said: We have asked for funds. We want to start work before monsoon and complete it ahead of Puja 2008. Though the project requires Rs 5 crore, work can start even if we get Rs 3 crore now, he added.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, in a meeting held at Writers Buildings on Tuesday to discuss the project, sought a report on the condition of the tram tracks to be repaired.         
	The money will be sanctioned after I get the report. A proper plan to control the traffic has to be worked out, since tram services will be suspended while the repairs are on, he said.        
	The meeting at Writers was attended by transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, finance secretary Dipankar Mukherjee and Calcutta Tramways Company chairman Rajdeo Goala.        
	The repairs will be carried out on the stretches between Shyambazar and Khanna cinema, Shyambazar and Belgachhia, Hazra and Tollygunge and Judges Court and Gariahat at the initial stage, said a transport department source.         
	Chakraborty said the government would launch a set of new-look trams of international standard next year. He claimed the trams will change the look of the city.         
	Officials and engineers were sent abroad to survey trams for the new look, said a transport department source.

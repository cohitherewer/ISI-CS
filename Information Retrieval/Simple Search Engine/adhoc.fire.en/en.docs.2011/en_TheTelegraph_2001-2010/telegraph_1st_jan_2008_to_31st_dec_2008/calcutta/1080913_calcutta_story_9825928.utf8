The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Bus mishap toll rises
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bus mishap toll rises

	Two of the passengers injured in the Nischindapur bus accident died early on Friday, taking the toll to eight.         
	Baneswari Singh, 26, died at Medical College and Hospital and Malay Chakraborty, 28, at SSKM Hospital. Aparna Porel, 21, was the victim who could not be identified on Thursday.        
	The ramshackle, overcrowded E-43 bus with a flat tyre fell into a roadside trench after hitting a branch of a tree on Thursday morning.        
	According to officials of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA), the flat tyre did not cause the mishap. The bus was racing a Trekker for more passengers when it fell into a trench.        
	An official of the RTA confirmed on Friday that all the six tyres of the bus were retreaded and in bad condition.        
	He added: Bus owners have to obtain a fitness certificate every year. The tyres are inspected first. In six-wheel vehicles, at least four must be in good condition. The owners hire new tyres to bag the certificate. We do not have enough manpower to stop buses from plying on retreaded tyres.        
	A driver on route 59 said he had hired tyres from a shop on Andul Road for Rs 250 per hour. If the owners do not buy new tyres, what can we do? he asked        
	Abdul Rahman Saha, who runs a tyre repair shop on Benaras Road at Salkia, said he repairs about 20 tyres a day on an average. I ask the drivers to replace the tyres but they insist on repairing them.

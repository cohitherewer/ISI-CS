          JHINUK MAZUMDAR                                    A comic strip from Timeup enumerating the merits of education.               
	A group of street children have found an innovative way of making people aware of their plight. About 35 of them have come up with a compilation of comic strips, Timeup, that focus on child labour and every childs right to school education. The effort is part of Snehadeep Street Children Project undertaken by NGO World Vision.         
	The comic strips are both in Bengali and Hindi. Though the illustrations are amateurish, the stories are well told. Snehadeep Street Children Project works for the upliftment of underprivileged children and helps them get into schools. The children and their families are also given vocational training.         
	Four of the young artists  members of Ujjwal Childrens Club, World Vision  attended a training organised by World Comics India in Delhi. The five-day workshop taught the kids how to design comic strips and how to use it as an effective tool of communication and peer group education.         
	Back home, the four-member team gave tips to the remaining kids on comic strip measurements, the technique of framing a story, sketching figures and reflecting various moods on them.         
	The young artists feel that their art could help change society. These comics will change the outlook of people. It is an effective to reach out to illiterate people through illustrations, says Sheikh Shahid, who gave his Class X exam this year and lives in a shanty on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. His friend Sonam Mahto chirps in with his new found knowledge: The drawings should be compact and the story should not contain many characters. I have shown the booklet to my teacher and she wants me to teach the other students as well.         
	The booklet is deliberately done up in black and white so that they can be photocopied and stuck as posters on walls. As the kids are not very proficient with letters, they can best express their agony and hardships through comics, says Remi Manoj, programme manager for Snehadeep Street Children Project.         
	We are lucky to go to school, but many of our friends are forced to give up their books and earn a living. I want to depict their tales through my drawings, says Pawan Kumar Roy, a Class VII student at Rani Rasmoni High School, pointing to his comic strip with pride.

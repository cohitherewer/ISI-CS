  - TALE OF CHANGE FROM CHANGEMAKER TOPS CHART          A STAFF REPORTER                          It is a book of the people and with the people. It is very accessible and very contemporary, said governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, after unveiling Nandan Nilekanis Imagining India on Monday evening. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                         
	Nandan Nilekanis ideas for India have caught on big time.        
	Billed as the biggest bestseller of the year from the Penguin stable, Imagining India has sold 40,000 copies in the first two weeks.        
	The 531-page book priced at Rs 699 is the best thing to have happened to book retail at a time when sales are really low, said Anantha Padmanabhan, the vice-president (sales and marketing) of Penguin India.        
	In the city for the book launch on Monday, the co-architect of the information technology (IT) boom played down the super success of his first book. Things move when ideas get embedded, shrugged the co-chairman of Infosys Technologies Ltd.        
	His multi-disciplinary 12-point programme for India has captured the imagination of not just the IT sector down south (which has accounted for half the sales till now) but also politicians, policymakers, entrepreneurs and students.        
	I have talked to economists, political scientists, historians, sociologists, bureaucrats, politicians  the entire spectrum of society. I did it over 18 months, conducting 128 interviews. Its like a renaissance book, said Nilekani.                
	With the book set to cross the 100,000 mark within six months, according to Penguin India, it certainly marks a renaissance of sorts for an industry bruised and bleeding.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who unveiled the book on Monday evening , said it was very accessible and very contemporary and it had managed to survive the meltdown and the Mumbai attacks.        
	Its our biggest book of the year and it comes at a time when the retail scene is grim, said Padmanabhan. I suppose a book on Indias growth from one of the pioneers of the IT industry is what is driving the sales. The story of change is coming straight from the horses mouth.        
	The changemaker is changing the rules of the book-buying game at the end of a bleak year. Imagining India is bringing people to the store. They are coming in asking for the book, said Sidharth Pansari of Crossword.

          A STAFF REPORTER                           Nivedita Setu, that connects BT Road with GT Road, celebrated a year on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	The consortium that built Nivedita Setu has requested the state government to add two more ramps to it.        
	Two ramps are being added to the 880-metre-long bridge connecting GT Road with BT Road on the Dunlop side. The consortium, which collects toll on the bridge, wants ramps at Uttarpara and Bally for more traffic flow.        
	Two more ramps will raise the volume of traffic and more people will benefit from the bridge. We are awaiting the nod from the government, said a company official.        
	According to him, a survey for the construction of the two proposed ramps has started.        
	The ramps on the eastern side should be ready within the next few months. That should address the problem of executing a hair-pin turn near the entry to the Dakshineswar temple, said S.S. Chakraborty, the chairman of the Second Vivekananda Bridge Tollway Company Pvt Ltd, on Friday, the first anniversary of the bridge.         
	About 15,000 vehicles have used the toll bridge daily. Next year, we hope the figure will go up by 10-15 per cent, added Chakraborty.         
	Lala K.K. Roy, the CEO of the consortium, said there should be a clean link over the Dunlop rotary to ensure smooth flow of traffic from north to south and east to west.        
	Its only a matter of time before the projected capacity of the bridge  48,000 vehicles a day  is reached, said Ravindra Verma, the managing director of the consortium.

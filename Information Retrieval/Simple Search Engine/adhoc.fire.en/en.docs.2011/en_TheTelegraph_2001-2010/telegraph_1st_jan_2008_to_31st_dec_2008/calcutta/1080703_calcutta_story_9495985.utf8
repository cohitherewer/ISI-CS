                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lathicharge at hospital

	Members of a staff union are demonstrating outside Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) in violation of a court order. On Wednesday evening, police had to lathicharge demonstrators who tried to force their way into the hospital.         
	The executive magistrate of Alipore court had banned political activity within 200 metres of BM Birla Heart Research Centre and CMRI and imposed Section 144 of the CrPC in the compound. The order was passed on the basis of a police petition in February after recurrent union problems in the hospital.        
	The police, however, have not taken action against the demonstrators. We have not been asked to take any steps as long as the demonstrators are sitting outside. We had to lathicharge today because the demonstrators tried to enter the hospital, said an officer of Alipore police station posted at CMRI.         
	Members of the unrecognised CMRI-BM Birla Employees Union, backed by the Congress, have been agitating outside the hospital since Thursday to press for reinstatement of five employees expelled on charges of misconduct. They have been using loudspeakers, inconveniencing patients.         
	Ambulances with emergency patients are being blocked at the gate. The agitators are also preventing employees from entering the hospital, said Rupak Barua, the chief operating officer of CMRI.         
	We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to patients and their relatives but we also have to think about those who have lost their jobs, said Rakesh Singh, a member of the union.         
	Johar Dholey, the officer-in-charge of Alipore police station, refused comment.

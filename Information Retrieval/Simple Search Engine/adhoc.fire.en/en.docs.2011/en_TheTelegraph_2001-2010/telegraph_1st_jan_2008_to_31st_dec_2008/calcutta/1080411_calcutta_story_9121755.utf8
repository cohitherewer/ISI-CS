                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ten days at SSKM, not a doctor in sight
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	A teenager from East Midnapore, who lost both his legs while trying to save a friend from being run over by a train, is lying at SSKM Hospital for 10 days waiting for treatment to begin.        
	Gopal Kamila (picture right by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya), 18, was admitted at 6pm on April 1, but no doctor has been able to take the four-minute walk from the orthopaedic ward in Woodburn block  where no bed was available at the time of admission  to the Curzon ward for general surgery patients.        
	No doctor has came to see me even once. I am dying in pain. Please ask them to give me an injection to ease the pain, Gopal pleaded on Thursday afternoon, tears trickling down his cheeks.        
	Gopal, from Heria under Khejuri police station in East Midnapore, lost both legs from below the knee on March 31. He was returning with a group of friends from a fair when one of them tripped on the tracks. Gopal made a desperate attempt to save his friend as a train rolled in. His friend died and Gopal was rushed to Contai sub-divisional hospital where doctors amputated both his legs.        
	The doctors referred him to Calcutta for treatment and medical care. Both have eluded Gopal in Calcuttas premier state-run hospital.        
	For the past 10 days, he has been crying in pain but no doctor has found time to even see him once, said his father Mahadeb, crippled by polio.        
	Mahadeb, his wife Lakshmirani and elder son Naru are all camping at SSKM. Naru is the sole earning member, working as an electrician in the village.        
	The only treatment Gopal is getting is a fresh dressing every alternate day, but that too for a fee.        
	A Group D staff member takes Rs 100-Rs 150 for every dressing. He has warned us not to tell anyone about the payment, said Mahadeb, seated by Gopals free bed.        
	The family has had to borrow money from policemen at the SSKM outpost and local Trinamul Congress leaders to buy food and pain-killers for Gopal.        
	Unable to bear his sons cries of pain, Mahadeb finally lodged a complaint with the hospital authorities.        
	I am conducting an inquiry into the charge, said Ashok Ghosh, the medical superintendent. The doctor under whom he was admitted said there is a shortage of postgraduate trainees due to their exams, so no one could visit the patient.        
	Ghosh also said Gopal would be shifted to the orthopaedic ward and all cost of medicines reimbursed.

	Six questions on the buzzer, 10 points for the correct answer and minus 10 for the wrong, said quizmaster Andrew Scolt, as four schools reached the final round of the Limca Book of Records Quiz held at Vidya Mandir auditorium on November 24. The scoreboard showed St Augustines Day School leading the pack at 65, Don Bosco Liluah and Birla High School for Boys tied at 55 with Calcutta Public School, Kalikapur trailing at 45.         
	A flurry of questions later, the boys of St Augustines Day School emerged victorious, answering three out of six questions. They will represent Calcutta in the national finals to be held in New Delhi in mid December. Don Bosco, Liluah and Birla High were the first and second runners. The winners bagged gold, silver and bronze medals respectively.        
	The eight schools that made it to the city finals  from a participating 36  included Don Bosco, Park Circus, Apeejay School, St Augustines Day School, Birla High School for Boys, Calcutta Public School, Kalikapur, National Gems Higher Secondary School, Don Bosco, Liluah, and Army Public School, Ballygunge. Four teams were eliminated in the course of the quiz.         
	The quiz had direct rounds based on the Limca Book of Records. But what made it more interesting was the audience enthusiasm. They got unruly at times, loudly prompting answers to participants. When a picture of a piranha was shown to the Birla High School boys and their classmates shouted out the answer even before the quizzers could open their mouth, the quizmaster was forced to cancel the question.        
	In the audio-visual round the students had to identify the voice of Naseeruddin Shah, a still of soccer player Cesc Fabregas and the singers of the song Bachna ae haseeno. The audience too were asked to identify a song.         
	There will be five teams in the finals  one each from Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai and a combined team from Chandigarh, Ludhiana and Amritsar. The national finals will be conducted by Derek OBrien.

	SHOUT OUT LOUD  
	Whats on your mind this week  When death comes calling  
	The recent terror attack in Mumbai has left us all shell-shocked. The terrorists proved to be too smart for our National Security Guard forces. They had trained for months and done a thorough research of both the Taj as well as the Oberoi-Trident. What were our security forces doing then? Obviously they slept as the terrorists planned a genocide. The Centre can only condemn the act and reassure us of peace. But peace is perhaps the interim period between one terror attack and another! Top cops lay down their lives, NSG personnel die in encounters. But politicians are busy making tall claims in their speeches and taking part in the blame game.         
	As we followed the cat-and-mouse game that the terrorists played with our security forces for three days, we could not help but feel a little panic-stricken. What if we were the next targets? Let us not depend on politicians anymore, but fight against terror as a united nation. Mumbai, we are with you.               
	Swagata Basu        Second chance for Maradona  
	Footballers like Franz Beckenbauer, Jurgen Klinsmann and Zico had been stalwarts on the field as well as off it. They followed up their careers as players with one as successful coaches. Will another name be added to this list of successful players? Diego Armando Maradona  the only name that is mentioned in the same breath as Pele  has begun his second stint in football as the coach of Argentinas national team. Maradonas valuable tips will no doubt come in handy for the likes of Lionel Messi.         
	His boys made a great start by beating Scotland in a friendly match on November 19, where Maradona debuted as the coach. Years ago  on June 2, 1979  he had scored his first senior international goal against the same team.        
	But the soccer great needs to be more disciplined and level headed to be a successful coach in the long run. His negative qualities had once ended his career before time. Let us hope he does not repeat those mistakes.        
	We his fans want to see him rise like the phoenix and take his boys to new heights.

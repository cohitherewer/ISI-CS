	The state government will try to rehabilitate traders displaced from Bowbazar for the East-West Metro project in the same area, transport minister         
	Subhas Chakraborty told representatives of traders bodies on Tuesday.        
	The minister said he would visit the area, where Central station of East-West Metro is slated to come up, along with senior officials of his department on October 29. The government will try to ensure that those displaced are rehabilitated in the Bowbazar area, he said at Writers Buildings.         
	Representatives from traders bodies and a Bowbazar-based citizens welfare committee told Chakraborty they were opposed to shifting to Rajarhat or Salt Lake.         
	Traders and house-owners in Bowbazar have protested against the governments attempt to acquire 4,830 sq m for the station. Around 2,000 owners of shops, houses and godowns in the area are likely to be affected.        
	The 13.7-km East-West Metro will have 13 stations between Howrah and Sector V.

        Meeting of poetic minds
   Poetry, as they say, is the music of the soul. It appeals to us with the sheer depth of the emotions it conveys, lifting the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, making familiar objects appear romantic, ideal and magical. Bringing together the best of contemporary world poetry, International Bengali Poetry Festival, in association with Indian Council for Cultural Relations, National Library and Sahitya Akademi, presents for the first time in India the ongoing World Poetry Festival 2008. The three-day event features sessions of poetry recitation, readings and seminars by 200 poets from different parts of India, as well as poets from all over the world. Participants include: Nirendranath Chakraborty, Shankha Ghose, Sunil Gangopadhyay, Nabaneeta Dev Sen and Buddhadeb Dasgupta (Bengal), Jayanta Mahapatra, Kedarnath Singh, Rajendra Upadhyaya, Dilip Chitre and Neela Padmanabhan (Indian poets outside Bengal), Ketaki Kushari Dyson, Hironmoy Bhattacharya, Nirmal Brahmachari, Gajendrakumar Ghose and Daud Haider (Indian poets staying abroad) and foreign guests and poets including Elizabeth Billstorm (USA), Yevtushenko (Russia), Brook Emery (Australia), Keiko Azuma (Japan), Jones Negalha (Brazil), Huu Thinh (Vietnam), Krishna Bhakta Shrestha (Nepal), Shaukat Mirza (Pakistan) and Mahfil Haque (Bangladesh).

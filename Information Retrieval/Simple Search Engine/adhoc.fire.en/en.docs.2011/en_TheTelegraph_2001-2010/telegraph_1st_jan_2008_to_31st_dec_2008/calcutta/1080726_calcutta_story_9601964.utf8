The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Traffic chaos in township
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Traffic chaos in township
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The death of 25-year-old engineer Satyasunder Rath under the wheels of a private bus has again exposed the lack of traffic policing in Salt Lake.        
	He was walking to his BK block home from his Sector V office on Thursday night when the bus, which was moving down the wrong lane, mounted the footpath and knocked him down before smashing into a house. The driver is still absconding.         
	Satyasunders father Shyamsunder arrived in Calcutta from his home in Khurdah, Orissa, by a morning flight on Friday. He returned with his sons body in the evening.         
	Residents of CJ block, where the mishap occurred, are shaken by the incident. That a bus moving down the wrong lane crushed a person on a footpath proves there is no traffic monitoring in the township. So many mishaps here are not reported, said resident Subhankar Dasgupta.        
	The grievance was echoed by a councillor. Traffic management in Salt Lake is restricted to Sector V and to the area around the shopping mall in Sector II, said Debashish Jana, a member of the opposition in Bidhannagar municipality.         
	The infrastructure is insufficient. There are no heavy cranes or ambulances, said a police officer.

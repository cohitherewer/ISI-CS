                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Four held after mystery death 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Four men were detained in Howrah on Friday following the mysterious death of a youth. One of the four, Subhas Sapui, allegedly took the body to a crematorium without the death certificate.        
	The body has been sent for post-mortem.        
	The youth, who apparently died after a bout of severe abdominal pain, has been identified as Sudip Dey, a contractor from Cooch Behar who had been staying as a tenant in Sapuis house in Puillah Daspara.        
	Police said Sapui took Sudip, 32, to a nursing home on Andul Road on Thursday evening. The doctor on duty, Himanshu Adhikari, declared him dead on arrival but refused to issue a death certificate.         
	He informed Sankrail police station, but the cops did not turn up.        
	Adhikari said: On examining the man, I found him dead. I immediately informed Sankrail police station but the cops did not come. I committed a mistake by allowing Sapui to take the body, instead of sending it for post-mortem.        
	Around 5am, Sapui asked Narendra Khatal, 25, who accompanied him to the nursing home, to call a truck for taking the body to crematorium.        
	Sapui took the body to Puillah burning ghat. He brought it down with the help of the driver, Sunil Shaw, and cleaner Basu Das.         
	But residents got suspicious on seeing Sapui dragging the body alone. They informed the police after Sapui failed to answer their queries satisfactorily.        
	Apart from Sapui, the police detained the driver, the cleaner and Khatal.        
	Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh said: We are investigating why Sapui took the body to burning ghat without informing the police. The cause of death will be known after post-mortem.

	The damaged Bagha Jatin flyover, closed for six months, is set to be reopened to traffic in three months.
    
	Ircon International Limited started reconstruction of the damaged part  around 100 ft over the railway tracks  on January 29. The redo project of the state government and Ircon, a Union government undertaking, will cost Rs 25 lakh.
    
	Ircon will also conduct an inquiry to find out why the high road was damaged within seven years of being commissioned.
    
	The 100-ft stretch caved in on August 19 last year, prompting the authorities to allow only small vehicles, like cars and two-wheelers, on the flyover. But following the collapse of a flyover under construction in Hyderabad on September 9, the government closed the Bagha Jatin high road on September 11.
    
	Ircon deputy general manager I.N. Chakraborty said the reconstruction work is being closely monitored to ensure there are no more cave-ins. We are not taking any chances. We are also trying to book the agency that had been hired to construct the flyover.
    
	An Ircon official said the damaged part is now being demolished. This will be followed by shuttering and then casting. After casting, we will have to wait for four weeks for the mortar to settle down.
    
	Its taking us longer than usual to complete the stretch as we are being able to work for only four hours at night, when train services on the Sealdah South section remain suspended, said another official.

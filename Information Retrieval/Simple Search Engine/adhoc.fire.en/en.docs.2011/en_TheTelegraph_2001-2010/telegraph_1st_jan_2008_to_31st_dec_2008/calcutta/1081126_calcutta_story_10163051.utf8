          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A 50-year-old employee fled with Rs 20 lakh from a shop selling ball bearings in Burrabazar on Monday night        
	Police said Santosh Shaw, a resident of Bihar, had been working in the shop on Canning Street for 20 years. The shop owner lodged a complaint on Tuesday. A police team has left for Bihar to trace him, said an officer.        
	In another incident, a 32-year-old employee of a jewellery shop in Burrabazar, Manish Poddar, was arrested by the city police in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, for stealing two gold bars worth Rs 26 lakh from his employer.        
	On October 10, gold merchant Dilip Kumar Chamaria had asked Poddar to bring two gold bars from a bank locker. But Poddar fled with the booty, an officer said.         
	A city police team had raided Poddars house in Samastipur, Bihar, but couldnt find him. We later nabbed him at a relatives house in Muzaffarpur and brought him to Calcutta on Monday, the officer said. Poddar told the cops he had sold off one of the gold bars for Rs 5 lakh.

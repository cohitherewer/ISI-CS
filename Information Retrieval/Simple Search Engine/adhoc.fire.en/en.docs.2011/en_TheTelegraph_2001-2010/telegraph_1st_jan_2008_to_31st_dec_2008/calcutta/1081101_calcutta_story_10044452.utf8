                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       UGC nudge for college autonomy
  - Parent body prescribes ways to ease pressure on varsities          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta will get more autonomous colleges if the government accepts the recommendation of the University Grants Commission (UGC).        
	On Friday, the UGC suggested that more colleges in the city and the rest of the state be granted autonomy so the workload on affiliating universities could be reduced.        
	The UGC wants universities to focus on research instead of getting tied up with undergraduate studies.        
	Institutes like Calcutta University (CU) are unable to cope with the increasing workload, resulting from a rise in the number of undergraduate colleges. The workload can be reduced if more colleges are declared autonomous, S.P. Thyagarajan, who heads a committee set up by the UGC to draw up an action plan to streamline the functioning of affiliating universities, said in Calcutta on Friday.        
	CU is the largest affiliating institute in the state, with 140 colleges in its fold. According to the UGC, no more than 100 colleges should function under one university.        
	In Bengal, only three colleges  St Xaviers and two Ramakrishna Mission institutes  have been granted autonomy. The state-run Presidency College has been denied full autonomy by the state government following opposition from CPM-controlled teachers unions.        
	A number of city colleges had sounded out the university for autonomy but later backed out gauging the governments mood. Now with the UGC spelling out its stand, the government will have to soften its position, said a university official.        
	Thyagarajan was in town to take part in a review meeting with vice-chancellors and officials of 31 universities in the east and the Northeast. All the vice-chancellors agreed that the colleges rated A+ by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) should be considered for autonomy.        
	The UGC team, which also suggested setting up of more universities, will submit its report to the Centre by December. The suggestions are likely to be implemented in the next academic session.

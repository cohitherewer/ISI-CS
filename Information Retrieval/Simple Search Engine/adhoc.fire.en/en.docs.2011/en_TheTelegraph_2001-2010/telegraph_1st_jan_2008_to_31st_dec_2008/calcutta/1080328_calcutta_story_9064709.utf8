The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Court scanner on cop role
                                                                                                               Court scanner on cop role
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          Rizwanur Rahman: Hearing continues                                  
	The high court on Monday trained its scanner on the alleged role of police in separating Priyanka Todi from Rizwanur Rahman.        
	Justice Dipankar Dutta asked what action the accused officers had taken after Rizwanur and Priyanka sought their help and whether they had tried to break the marriage after Ashok Todi lodged a complaint alleging that daughter Priyanka was missing.        
	The police did not call Priyanka and Rizwanur to Lalbazar. Instead, Rizwanur had written to the police, seeking help, said Samaraditya Pal, representing former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and the other officers.        
	Rizwanur, in his letter, had annexed a copy of the marriage certificate. What action had the police taken? Justice Dutta asked.        
	Ashok Todi by then had lodged a missing diary, Pal replied.        
	How could the police act on the diary after being informed that Priyanka had married Rizwanur and was living with him? the judge asked.        
	As the marriage involved two religions, there was a possibility of a law and order problem. So, the police had to interfere, Pal said.        
	He reiterated that the CBI report should be given to his clients.         
	The CBIs observation that the officers had abetted Rizwanurs suicide was against the Police Code. The observation has maligned the status and dignity of the officers, he claimed.        
	The judge asked the CBI to place its manual before the court.        
	Pal also claimed that journalists had distorted the statement of Prasun Mukherjee. The former police chief had said that Rizwanur had apparently committed suicide. The journalists omitted the word apparently, he submitted.        
	Kalyan Banerjee, appearing for Rizwanurs family, said: If the court wants, I can provide the footage of Mukherjees statement.         
	Pal also pleaded that Priyanka be made a party to the case. The hearing will continue on Friday.

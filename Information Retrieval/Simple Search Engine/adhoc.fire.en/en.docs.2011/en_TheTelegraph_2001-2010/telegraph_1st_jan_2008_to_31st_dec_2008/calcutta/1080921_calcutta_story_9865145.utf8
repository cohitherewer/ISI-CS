	Are Calcuttans waking up to global warming? Unlikely, but Puja themes are.           
	From FD block in Salt Lake to Ajeyo Sanghati in Haridebpur, from Suruchi Sangha in New Alipore to Tridhara Sammilani near Deshapriya Park, environment is the theme. At least 10 pujas in Calcutta will focus on global warming.          
	We considered the Olympics, but felt global warming is one of the most important issues facing mankind, said Santanu Biswas, the secretary of the FD block puja. Last year this puja had a pandal modelled on Hogwarts Castle from the Harry Potter series.          
	This year, the FD block pandal will look like a globe with the triggers of climate change  industrial emission, vehicular pollution, unplanned urbanisation and deforestation  depicted on a ring of fire at the base. The solutions will be showcased in the centre of the ring.          
	Scribbles on whiteboards on the pandal premises will illustrate concepts vital to preserving the environment. There will also be world maps depicting changes brought about by rise in sea level as a consequence of climate change.          
	Ajeyo Sanghati, which last year won the eco-friendly puja award from the state environment department, has nature as its theme this year.           
	Debasish Kumar, the chief organiser of the Tridhara puja, said: We are recreating a 17th century rosewood temple surrounded by greenery. We have decided to plant at least 40 mature coconut trees around the pandal. We will also distribute leaflets on climate change among visitors. The club will adopt the coconut trees.           
	The environment department will boost the initiatives of four puja committees by setting up green booths called Sabuj Thikana along with NGOs.           
	The booths at FD Block, Suruchi Sangha, 21 Palli and Tridhara will host green quizzes, addas and contests on the Puja days.

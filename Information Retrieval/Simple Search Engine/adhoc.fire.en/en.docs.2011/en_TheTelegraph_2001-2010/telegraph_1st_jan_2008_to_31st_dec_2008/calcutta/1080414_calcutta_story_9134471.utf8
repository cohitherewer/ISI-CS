          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	A Norwester on Sunday evening brought relief to a city reeling under a hot spell even as the weatherman warned of warm days ahead with isolated rain and thundershowers in the evening or night.        
	There may not be any sharp drop in the maximum temperature, even though the discomfort might ease marginally, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The Met office had issued a squall warning for Calcutta and adjacent districts for Sunday evening. A wind blowing in from the Bay of Bengal and a cyclonic circulation over sub-Himalayan Bengal had led to incursion of moisture.

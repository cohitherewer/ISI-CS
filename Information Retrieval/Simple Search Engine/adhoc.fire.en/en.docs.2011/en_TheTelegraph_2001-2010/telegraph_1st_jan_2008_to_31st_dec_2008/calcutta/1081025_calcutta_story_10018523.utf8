                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wheels crush, mob erupts
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A young woman was run over by a speeding garbage truck while jaywalking on Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road on Friday morning, triggering mob fury that brought peak-hour traffic to a crawl for two hours.        
	The mob forced passengers off buses and shattered the windshields of some vehicles. Eight persons were arrested.        
	The accident occurred around 9.30am, when 25-year-old Hena Sardar of Raidighi, in South 24-Parganas, was trying to cross the road between the ESI Hospital and Jagat cinema. The driver of the garbage truck, owned by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, fled.        
	Over 200 residents and shopkeepers then blocked the road, demanding the driver be arrested and more cops deployed on the stretch.         
	Senior officers, including the deputy commissioners of the north and central divisions, tried hard to calm the agitators but they wouldnt listen. Contingents from Muchipara, Burtola, Maniktala and Ultadanga police stations, Calcutta Armed Police and the RAF were called in to help Amherst Street police restore a semblance of order.        
	APC Road, AJC Bose Road, Sealdah flyover, Vivekananda Road, Maniktala crossing, Amherst Street, MG Road, CR Avenue, Lenin Sarani, SN Banerjee Road, Shyambazar and Moulali were choked during that period.        
	The police said the victim used to live in a rented house in a red-light area. Witnesses told us she was in a hurry to cross the road. But the driver was also at fault. He was driving recklessly, a traffic police officer said.

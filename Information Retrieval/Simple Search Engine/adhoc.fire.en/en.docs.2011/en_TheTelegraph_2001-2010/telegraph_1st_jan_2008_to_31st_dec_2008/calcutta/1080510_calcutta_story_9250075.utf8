                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Extra class for students 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The Calcutta University authorities on Friday asked the English teachers to hold extra classes, if possible, for the 97 MA second-year students who havent met attendance requirements.        
	A decision on whether the students can be allowed to write their Part II examination can be taken after we get the report from the English teachers, said vice-chancellor Suranjan Das.         
	The students were barred from taking the examination, scheduled in July, because they did not have the mandatory 55 per cent attendance.        
	A Supreme Court ruling bars universities from allowing students to write examinations if they do not have the required attendance. It further states that a university would have to change the rules through an amendment if it wanted to allow students with low attendance to write an exam.        
	It is impossible to change the rules for the 97 students, said an official.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Disease compounds water woes
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                          Suvadra Debnath has been suffering from skin ailments for the past 15 years because the floodwaters wont recede from her low-lying Behala home. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                  
	Prolonged waterlogging in parts of Behala after the first spell of heavy rain this monsoon has brought ailments in its wake. Many residents have contracted skin diseases after wading through dirty water for days.         
	Suvadra Debnath is one of them. Skin diseases have been her constant companion for 15 years because of poor drainage facilities around her Porui Daspara home.         
	My courtyard remains submerged all through monsoon. I have been suffering from diseases for the past 15 years because of this filthy water, said Suvadra, who stays with her daughter and two grandchildren.        
	White patches have developed on her feet. Her cheeks, neck and the back of her ears have swollen up. She complains of constant body ache.        
	Suvadra has been suffering like this for 15 years. She used to work as a maid in neighbouring households, but hasnt been able to work for the past five years, said Aneema Chanda, a neighbour of the family.        
	My feet itches and of late, I cant even walk properly. I lose my strength, said Suvadra. The widow used to consult a doctor but could not continue her treatment because of financial problems.        
	Her 28-year-old daughter Bulbul is the sole earning member of the family. She gets Rs 1,500 per month at the tile factory where she works.         
	I feel helpless for not being able to provide for my mothers treatment, but what can I do with so little money? I also need to pay for the education of my orphan nephew and niece, said Bulbul. My mothers health will change for the better if the civic authorities improve the drainage in our area, she added.        
	Tarak Das, the doctor who used to treat Suvadra, said she suffers from contact dermatitis. The stagnant water around her house caused the disease. Unless the infected parts dry up, none of the medicines will work.        
	Metro found the Debnath home in a pool of water even though there had been no heavy shower in the past five days. Heaps of garbage dumped near the house had washed into the courtyard.        
	We requested the civic authorities not to keep garbage in front of my house but they did not listen to us, said Suvadra.        
	Her grandson Pritam, 9, was twice afflicted with malaria and suffers from dysentery every monsoon.        
	Trinamul Congress councillor of the area, Anjan Das, said: I understand the situation but theres nothing I can do because the area is low-lying. There was ankle-deep water in front of my house till two days ago.        
	The adjoining wards do not let us pump out accumulated water into their area and the Airports Authority of India prohibits us from draining our water into Begor Canal that passes under Behala Flying Club. The mayor has said there would be no relief till 2011. added Das.

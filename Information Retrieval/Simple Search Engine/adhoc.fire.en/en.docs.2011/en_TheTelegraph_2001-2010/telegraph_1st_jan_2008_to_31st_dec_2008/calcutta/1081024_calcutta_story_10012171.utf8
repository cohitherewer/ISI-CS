          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	The unrest in Bihar continued to affect train schedules in the city on Thursday, though the services became normal in the evening.        
	Ten Eastern Railway trains were cancelled and some city-bound ones were diverted.        
	Seven trains originating from the Howrah, Sealdah and Calcutta stations, including the Howrah-Patna Janshatabdi Express, Howrah-Hardwar Puja Special and the Sealdah-Balia Express, were cancelled. Trains bound for the city, including the Gorakhpur-Calcutta Purbanchal Express, Varanasi-Howrah Puja Special and the Jodhpur-Howrah Express, were diverted.        
	The trains that do not have alternative rakes had to be cancelled as the Down trains did not arrive, said an Eastern Railway official.         
	The agitation in Bihar affected train services in the morning and afternoon. Normal services resumed after the situation improved in the evening, he added.         
	On Wednesday, more than 15 long-distance trains from the city, including the Rajdhani Express (Howrah and Sealdah), were cancelled.

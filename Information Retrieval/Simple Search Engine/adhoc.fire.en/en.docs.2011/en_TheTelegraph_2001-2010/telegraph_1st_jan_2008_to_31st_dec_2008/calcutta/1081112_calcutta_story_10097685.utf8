          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	A promoter was arrested in Kasba on Tuesday for confining a houseowner and her family for nearly nine hours. Harriet Dawson, 60, and her two children were rescued by police early on Tuesday.         
	Police said Dawson had been staying in the house at South Purbachal for more than 10 years.         
	Recently, her son got a job in Bangalore and she was planning to shift base.         
	Wishing to dispose of her property in Calcutta, Dawson had contacted Deepak Das, a local promoter. Last month she signed an agreement of Rs 16.5 lakh with Das and his partner. Das paid her Rs 3.5 lakh as advance.         
	On Monday evening, Dawson returned with her children from Bangalore after 10 days. Das had learnt from some source that Dawson had made an agreement with another promoter and was waiting for her.         
	When she returned at 5pm, Das and his men locked the main gate of her house from outside.         
	Dawson told Das they could talk to her lawyer but they were adamant and pressured her to sign some papers, said Pratima Das, a neighbour.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fever fear stings city 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fever fear stings city

	Ananda Chakraborty (name changed) was running a temperature for six days. His family physician told him after a blood test that it was not a case of dengue or malaria, but he was not convinced.        
	The symptoms were similar to that of dengue. I had joint pains, headache and nausea. I panicked and went for a second blood test, the 68-year-old resident of Jodhpur Park told Metro. The repeat test reconfirmed that Chakraborty was not suffering from a vector-borne disease. He could breathe easy.        
	Chakraborty is no exception. Fear of the vector-borne fever, which has claimed 19 lives this season, has gripped the city. People suffering from fever are rushing to the nearest pathological laboratory.        
	The number of blood tests for malaria has gone up significantly at our clinics. Around this time last year, we were conducting fewer tests, admitted DebDwaipayan Chattopadhyay, the chief medical officer of health of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	The number of blood tests for malaria and dengue has also shot up in private laboratories. Last year, too, there were cases of vector-borne diseases but not as many people were coming for tests, said an official of Ashok Laboratory in south Calcutta. On an average, 15 people with fever  as opposed to six or seven last year  are visiting the laboratory every day for blood tests.        
	The alarming news is that between 20 and 30 per cent are testing positive for vector-borne diseases.         
	There are other telltale signs of fever fear. The sale of mosquito nets has more than doubled in the past three weeks. Many buyers told me that they had decided to switch from repellents to mosquito nets, said the owner of a mosquito net shop on Rakhal Das Auddy Road in Chetla.        
	The message from the civic body and the health department is that there is no cause for panic. But not many are convinced, given the rising death toll.        
	The government and civic wings were obviously not doing their duty. There have been cases of malaria in our area and I am doing everything I can to avoid a mosquito bite, said Debanjan Roy, a resident of Salt Lake.        
	Doctors see a positive in the promptness among people to consult a doctor and go for blood tests. Early detection will stop the spread of the diseases, said critical care specialist Subrata Maitra, stressing the need for repeat tests of confirmed reports.

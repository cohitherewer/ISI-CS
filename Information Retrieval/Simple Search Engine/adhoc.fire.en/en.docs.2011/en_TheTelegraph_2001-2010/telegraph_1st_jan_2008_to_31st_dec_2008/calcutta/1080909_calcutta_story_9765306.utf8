  - Sector V adopts innovative measures to keep employees happy          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE AND MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYA                          Employees practise salsa in the TCS office. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	From shopping to salsa, Sector V is trying out a host of new-age ways to retain professionals, make them bond better and increase productivity.         
	Wipro was among the first off the blocks with an initiative called Wipro at Home (WAH) for parents and guardians of young employees at their Calcutta BPO.        
	While interacting with young inductees, it was apparent that their family members were wary of what working in a BPO might entail, especially on night shifts, said Ashutosh Vaidya, the head of Wipro BPO.        
	As part of WAH, families spend a day on the campus in Sector V, getting to know the employees and the facilities. More than 250 families have attended the 25-plus WAH events so far. Many of those who quit the company cited family pressure as the reason. It was necessary to demonstrate that work in a BPO is as professional as in any other sector, added Vaidya.        
	Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has its own set of employee engagement programmes ranging from photography workshops to trekking expeditions. The latest is the salsa workshop organised by the dance club. Techies gather in a large room on the campus every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon to groove to Latin beats.        
	The salsa workshop has been a great experience. And our work schedule doesnt get affected, said Bhaswati Chakraborty of the TCS corporate communications.                    
	The aim is to increase employee interaction and team spirit as well as reduce attrition rate.        
	We chose salsa because it allows participants to learn how to lead and follow at the same time. It hones crucial skills, which help us at work as well, said Neelkanth Satpatty, an employee at TCS.        
	We also have clubs for dance, photography, adventure sports and trekking, quiz, music and yoga, said Prithwish Ray, the regional HR head, TCS (east).        
	To boost interactivity and increase the level of commitment, Wipro initiated the Josh programme. It involves an array of mass connect activities like Josh Walk, Josh Idol and Josh Quiz.        
	Even smaller companies like eRevMax, which makes revenue maximisation software for the hospitality sector, are adopting innovative policies to maximise productivity and reduce attrition level. One of the initiatives, Tiger Rock provides employees a platform every month to interact and have fun together.        
	There is also a team activity fund that allows teams to pursue a constructive activity, like buying books, attending seminars or watching plays, films and sporting events.

	Come December, students, techies and language enthusiasts need not rush to Max Mueller Bhavan to learn German. In response to the growing demand, Descon Limited, an international IT service provider, tied up with Max Mueller Bhavan to promote German language courses in Sector V, Salt Lake.         
	At the signing of the memorandum of understanding, Reimar Volkar, the director of Max Mueller Bhavan, said: Learning German will significantly improve job prospects in the global economy. It will be easier for companies to interact with clients and forge closer business ties.         
	The target groups for this course are students who want to upgrade their language skills to improve their job prospects and also corporate houses who are working with German clients on various projects. The classes will start from December 1 at Descon Training Solutions from 6pm to 8.15pm. Students are being offered six courses A1 and A2 (basic level), B1 and B2 (independent level) C1 and C2 (advanced level). Each will span a period of three months and cost Rs 7,200.         
	A 15-minute slide show on learning German was also displayed on the occasion. The audience had a good time picking up basic German phrases like guten abend (hello), wo wohnen sie? (where do you stay?) and danke (thank you).

 - Plan sanction without cheque for one per cent faces freeze
     A STAFF REPORTER
                  
	What the rest of Salt Lake did last year, Sector V did today but there is no clue when Calcutta will follow suit.
    
	Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority, which looks after the IT hubs civic affairs, introduced on Tuesday a one per cent cess on the construction cost of new buildings worth Rs 10 lakh or more.
    
	A building plan will not be sanctioned if it is not accompanied by a cheque for the cess, said S.A. Ahmed, the chairman of Nabadiganta.
    
	The cess has been mandated by the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Working Conditions) Cess Act, 1996.
    
	The act, introduced in the rest of Salt Lake last year, states the amount will have to be deposited with the state labour department.
    
	A government official said the money will be spent on workers in the construction sector and their families. 
    
	The fund will be used to pay the medical expenses of the workers and their families, education cost of the children and compensation to the next of kin of those who die in harness, he added.
    
	How will the cess be calculated? Nabadiganta has fixed three rates  Rs 5,400, Rs 6,300 and Rs 7,300 for a sq metre of cement, mosaic and marble floor, respectively. 
    
	While sanctioning a plan, the cess will be charged at a flat rate of Rs 5,400 per sq metre. Once the building is ready, officials will run a check and charge the additional amount, if needed.
    
	Abhijit Das, the regional director of property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj, called the imposition of cess a positive move. The one per cent cess will benefit the labourers, without pushing up the price much. In any case, for commercial buildings, the hike will be passed on to customers.
    
	State labour department secretary Subesh Das, however, was under the impression that the cess had already been implemented across the state. For the past three-four years, it is being paid all over the state, including in Calcutta, Das said.
    
	Gorachand Mondol, the director-general (building) of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, clarified that the act is yet to be implemented in the city. How can we determine the cost of a building while sanctioning its plan? asked Mondol. He claimed the act, a copy of which the civic body has received, does not specify any deadline.
    
	Bidhannagar Municipality, on the other hand, paid Rs 10 lakh to the government last year as cess.

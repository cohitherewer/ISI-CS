                      Photographic tribute                    His passion for photography born during his early days in college, Asit Poddar began his professional life as a designer for HMV covers. A sensitive photographer and painter, he, like many of his generation, was inspired by the films and writings of Satyajit Ray. Working with renowned cinematographer Saumendu Ray gave him his first opportunity to observe Ray from close quarters. Studying Ray at work was an experience that left an enduring impression in his mind. Besides attempting to reveal the man behind the filmmaker, Portraits of a Director, the ongoing exhibition of his photographs on Ray, is his way of paying tribute to a person who, he confesses, has taught him more about his work than anyone else. Capturing Rays passion, enthusiasm, discipline and attention to detail in his work, the photographs on show bring alive special moments from the directors life that Poddar feels he was fortunate enough to share with him. They also provide a glimpse of his profound curiosity, acute intellect, wide knowledge, natural charm, warmth and geniality as well as other aspects of his personality that he laid bare only among close friends.                  Event: An exhibition of photographs on Satyajit Ray by Asit Poddar When: Till May 30 (except Sundays); 11 am - 8 pm Where: Gallery Kanishkas, 2/1 Hindusthan Road

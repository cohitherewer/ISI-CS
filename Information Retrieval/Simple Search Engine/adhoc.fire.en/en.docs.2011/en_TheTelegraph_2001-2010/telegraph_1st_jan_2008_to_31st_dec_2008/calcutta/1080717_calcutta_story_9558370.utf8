                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Retired official found killed 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Shyamalbaran Biswas                                  
	A retired joint secretary of the state government was found lying dead beside his unconscious wife in the bedroom of their Barasat house that was raided by robbers on Tuesday night.        
	Shyamalbaran Biswas was probably hit on the back of his head with a blunt weapon. He was also stabbed. His wife Dipali suffered deep cuts in the neck and throat.        
	Shyamalbaran was killed while trying to resist the robbers, said police.        
	The gang members rummaged through the items in the house but what they took away is not clear. The couples two daughters are married and live in other parts of the city.        
	Ashiya Biwi, the couples help, suspected something was amiss when the couple did not open the door around 7am on Wednesday. She alerted Shyamalbarans nephew Subhas Roychowdhury, who lives in the neighbourhood.        
	He found that the grille gate of house locked from inside and went to the back along with neighbours. The rear door was broken. Inside, my uncle and aunt were lying on the bed in a pool of blood, said Roychowdhury.        
	Shyamalbaran was declared brought dead at hospital. Dipali is undergoing treatment.        
	We are investigating if robbery was the motive of the murder, said an officer. Fingerprints of five unknown persons were found in the house. A dog squad also visited the house.        
	Shyamalbaran, who served in home, information and cultural affairs and several other departments of the state government, shifted to the Barasat house from Bamangachhi after his retirement four years ago.        
	I repeatedly told my parents not to stay in such a secluded place. But they hardly paid any heed to our warning, said the couples daughter Tumpa Das, a resident of Dum Dum.

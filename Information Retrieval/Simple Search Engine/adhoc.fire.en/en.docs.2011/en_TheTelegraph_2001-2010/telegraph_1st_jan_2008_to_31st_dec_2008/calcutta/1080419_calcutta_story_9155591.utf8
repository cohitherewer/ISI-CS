	Ranjana Maity fought visual impairment to score nearly 80 per cent in Madhyamik. With a monthly family income of Rs 500, the weavers daughter from Eral, East Midnapore, is struggling to continue her studies.        
	Priya Singh is the daughter of a casual labourer who earns Rs 800 per month. The Class VII student at Deshabandhu Balika Vidyapith wants to pursue higher studies, finances permitting.        
	The two girls are a little closer to their dreams, thanks to The Telegraph Education Foundation scholarships, worth Rs 3.2 lakh, which were awarded to 85 students from the state on Friday morning.        
	I am going to buy books with the scholarship money, said Priya, who came with her mother.        
	For Mohammad Halim, a metallurgical engineering student at Jadavpur University, the scholarship means he can seek admission in the IITs for his masters degree.        
	Joining hands with the Foundation were the students of The Frank Anthony Public School, the venue of the ceremony. The school contributed Rs 43,000, which was raised through a carnival organised by the staff, students and the parents.        
	The scholarships were given away by Frank Anthony principal I.T. Myers and trustees of the foundation Abhijit Deb and Rudrangshu Mukherjee.        
	I am extremely proud that I, through my school, have been able to make a difference to so many students like me, said Seima Alam, a Class VIII student of Frank Anthony.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Some youths beat up a couple and their son with rods and sticks in Sonarpur after the family protested against their drunken behaviour.         
	Amal Haldar, a 50-year-old trader, wife Sabita, 45, and son Asit were attacked in their Sonarpur home early on Wednesday. Sabita has been admitted in MR Bangur Hospital and was administered three stitches on her face. Amal and Asit were discharged after treatment.         
	The couple have lodged a complaint with Sonarpur police station, but no arrests have been made. Ajey Ranade, the district superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said a search was on for the culprits.         
	The couple said some youths of the locality used to regularly drink and take drugs in front of their house.         
	Every night they used to create a nuisance. After drinking alcohol, they would throw the empty bottles into our compound. We repeatedly asked them to stop their activities, but they didnt pay any heed to us, said Sabita from her hospital bed.         
	Two months back, we informed the police about their activities, but no action was taken, she added.         
	On Tuesday night, the couple again asked the young men to behave properly. After a few hours, a dozen youths barged into their house and started beating them with iron rods and sticks.         
	Faces covered, they started hitting and kicking me. My husband tried to save me, but they beat him up too. They didnt even spare my son or our neighbours, who had come to our rescue, Sabita said.        
	She alleged that the youths also damaged their house and the belongings. The violence continued for more than an hour. Before leaving, they threatened us not to go to the police, she said.

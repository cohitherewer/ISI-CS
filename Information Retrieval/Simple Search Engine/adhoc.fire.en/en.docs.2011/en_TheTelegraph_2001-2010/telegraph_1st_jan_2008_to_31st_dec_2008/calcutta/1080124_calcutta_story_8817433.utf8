             Spring Fest 2007 at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur
                    
	Its time for students to hone their seafaring skills, as the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur gets ready to celebrate the true spirit of youth with its annual festival, Spring Fest.
    
	Sailing the seas is the theme of this years fest, organised in association with The Telegraph. We have built a ship and there will be people dressed as sailors and pirates on it. Decorating the campus plays an important role in a fest of this scale, said Tanuj Dora, an organising committee member.
    
	Spring Fest, one of the biggest campus fests in eastern India, begins on Thursday. It will see the participation of leading colleges from across the country. The footfall is expected to cross 15,000.
    
	The opening night will see a performance by UK-based band Breathe  The Delicate Sound of Floyd. Three days of fun and frolic will follow.
    
	The biggest draw at the annual festival is the Star Nights that have seen performances by singers like Shaan, Shankar Mahadevan and Shivani Kashyap and bands like Parikrama, Zero and Indian Ocean. Rahul Sharma and brothers Amaan and Ayaan Ali Khan have also performed classical recitals at the fest.
    
	This year, it is the turn of Grammy-winner Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt on the Classical Night. Pentagram will be the rock band on song. The star performances will be followed by a fireworks display. Amateur and semi-professional bands will fight it out in Wildfire, the rock-band competition.
    
	The other attractions at the fest include inter-college dance competition Centrifuge, street play contest Nukkar and amateur drama competition Rangmanch. Evam will perform a play called Hamlet  The Original Spoof.
    
	On Republic Day, the students and faculty members will participate in a Youth Marathon for a Green Revolution, being held by the Petroleum Conservation and Research Association.

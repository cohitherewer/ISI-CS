The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Station erupts over assault
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Station erupts over assault
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Trouble broke out at Dum Dum Metro Railway station on Monday evening after RPF men allegedly beat up a passenger who they said was travelling without a valid ticket.        
	Police lathicharged passengers after they ransacked the RPF booth. The situation was brought under control after a RAF team was deployed on the station premises.        
	Gobindo De, 29, who runs a garments shop in Dum Dum, got off the train around 7.10pm. He had a ticket of a shorter journey. So, the gate did not open when he swiped it, said a Metro official. Guards caught him while he was trying to escape.        
	But passengers claimed De had a valid ticket and the gate did not open because of a technical fault. He was beaten up by RPF men without any provocation. The cops slapped and kicked him. The youth was frothing at the mouth while he was being dragged to the RPF booth, said Samik Sarkar, a witness.        
	De passed out in the booth and was handed over to the police. He was later taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Doctors said his condition was stable.        
	Passengers who saw the assault on De ransacked the RPF booth, smashing the glass panes and furniture. RPF men and Metro guards then started beating up innocent passengers. There could have been a stampede, said Debdut Banerjee, another witness.        
	A RAF team was deployed around 8.30pm and the situation returned to normal half an hour later. Passengers were seen leaving the station with their hands up. We will decide later whether to arrest De, said deputy commissioner (north) A.K. Ghosh.

                      India rediscovered                    To the many admirers of his fiction, Amit Chaudhuri is all the more remarkable because of the excellence and accessibility of his non-fiction. Clearing a Space: Reflections on India, Literature and Culture brings together many of Chaudhuris best essays, written over the past decade in journals London Review of Books and Times Literary Supplement. This body of his work reveals a literary project of great value in understanding Indian and global modernity. Chaudhuri also makes a powerful case for thinking about Indian literature and culture in a way that departs strikingly from the parameters created since the publication of Salman Rushdies Midnights Children and the consolidation of post-colonial studies. While his mode is broadly oppositional, it is also one of constant engagement with the positions he is arguing against. This evening, Oxford Bookstore hosts the launch of Clearing a Space: Reflections on India, Literature and Culture, a book that promises to reinforce the authors already considerable reputation as a writer who communicates with large audiences because of the elegance of his prose and the persuasiveness of his ideas.                  Event: Launch of Amit Chaudhuris Clearing a Space: Reflections on India, Literature and Culture When: Today at 6.30 pm Where: Oxford Bookstore, Park Street

           Tourists ahoy: (Clockwise from left) Calcutta Police Museum, Dakshineswar temple, China Town and Subhas Sarobar                           
	Apropos the report In death, barrister beats bandh, July 2, most people connected with the courts agree that declaring a holiday each time a judge or a lawyer dies is not the right way to mourn the departed. Yet, the the system has persisted. Barrister Peston Padamji Ginwala deserves a posthumous award for breaking the custom.           
	Justice delayed is justice denied. This is probably truer in India than in any other country. A recent study found that even if no new cases are filed, it may take another 30 years to clear the pending cases.           
	Various factors contribute to the delay in disposing of cases. Holidays and bandhs are two of the prime causes. The chief justice of Calcutta High Court, S.S. Nijjar, applauded Ginwalas last wish that lawyers do not stop work to commemorate his death. Will the chief justice now ensure that the court is not shut down when a judge or a lawyer dies? That will not only be a worthy tribute to the late barrister but also a wonderful gift to the thousands of litigants.           
	Kunal Saha,
  Ohio, US                       
	Apropos the report Upgrade to woo tourists, July 7, it is good to learn that the state government is spending crores to make tourist spots like Subhas Sarobar, Calcutta Police Museum, China Town and Dakshineswar Temple more attractive. While the Sarobar and China Town need a clean-up, there is plenty of scope of making the museum a bigger draw. Dakshineswar can be properly illuminated, too.             
	Sukumar Ghosh,
  Mukundapur           
	Apropos the report Civic salve for temple twins, July 2, it is wonderful that the civic body has taken an initiative to restore two of Calcuttas oldest temples and a mosque in the northern part of the city. Places of worship are a part of our cultural heritage and need to be preserved with utmost care. Other municipalities too should come forward and join this mission to save our past.           
	Sourish Misra, 
  Salt Lake           
	The civic authorities should have taken up the restoration of the temples and the mosque long back. The authorities should remember that these structures make the citizens aware of their past and make them proud of their country.           
	Rathin Chatterjee, 
  Dum Dum                   
	The presentation and passage of the West Bengal University of Technology Amendment Bill to keep a watch on private tech colleges epitomises the declining standard of the Assembly debates (Watch on private tech colleges, July 3). The learned MLA, Saugata Roy, heard about some colleges so small that they look like canteens. This is an example of the king seeing through his ears.             
	It is surprising that no one questioned this statement. Roy should know that an engineering college is not a mushroom. It comes into being only a year after obtaining permission from the All India Council for Technical Education.           
	An engineering college shouldnt also be confused with an employment exchange. Nowadays, engineering education is a status symbol. Many guardians force their unworthy wards to study engineering and thats why the standards are declining.           
	Jatindra Nath Bhowmick,
  Kalyani                   
	The report Special classes in school to stamp out private tuition, July 7, will bring relief to             
	many parents. They wont have to search high and low for good private tutors if schools go the extra mile to prepare students for examinations. All schools in Calcutta, at least the reputed ones which charge tuition fees by the bagful, should try to follow the lead of South Point.           
	B.N. Bose, 
  Dum Dum Park             
	Apropos the report Lathicharge at hospital, July 3, it is unfortunate that union trouble has reared its ugly head at CMRI Hospital once again. Conflict between management and union is common in commercial institutions throughout the state. In a civilised society, neither party should disrupt the functioning of hospitals over such a dispute.             
	Govinda Bakshi, 
  Budge Budge             
	Despite spending lakhs of rupees, patients are often getting a raw deal from doctors and staff at hospitals (Doctor error after death too, July 4). Healthcare throughout the state has taken a nose dive. The health department should not shirk from taking drastic steps.             
	Prahlad Agarwala,
  Majdia, Nadia             
	Bhansaheb Bhawar deserves kudos for his efforts to root out dowry (Crusader on a bicycle, July 2). The problem is acute in rural areas and many girls still commit suicide because of this social malady. I wish Bhawar success.             
	B. Bose,
  Dum Dum Park                   
	It is wonderful that Coffee House is ready for a makeover (Coffee House facelift, July 1). The institution should be preserved keeping in mind the great men who used to frequent it. To make Coffee House more attractive, suggestions can be sought from eminent personalities who used to go there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Nandaram clone unfit to fight fire
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nandaram clone unfit to fight fire
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Khaleque Ahmed spent three tense hours on Tuesday till firemen managed to douse the flames that engulfed the 75-year-old Mehta Building.        
	I was fearing a repeat of the Nandaram tragedy... My shop is illegal and I could not have recovered anything had it been gutted, said Khaleque, who runs a 6ftx6ft makeshift stall selling calculators and wrist watches.        
	Khaleque was not alone  a similar fear gripped the owners of around 300 illegal stalls and the 1,000-odd legal shops in the five-storeyed market.        
	The illegal stalls  daalas and almirahs  thrive on items smuggled in from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Bangkok. Till the late 90s, before Chinese goods started invading the Indian market, Mehta Building was the most sought-after place for electronic items like calculators, watches and pens.        
	The traders fear of a Nandaram-type disaster  the market less than 500 metres from Mehta Building burned for 100 hours  was not unwarranted. For, like Nandaram, Mehta Building lacked the basic fire-fighting arrangements.        
	The Canning Street market, where the daily transaction is around Rs 100 crore, does not have any arrangements to tackle a blaze, said an officer supervising the fire fight.        
	Anyone who has ever visited Mehta Building knew that the mishap was just waiting to happen. Goods piled on the exit passage have narrowed the space and the daalas along the corridors make movement almost impossible. Live electric wires dangle overhead and water seeps through the roof.        
	Only a handful of fire extinguishers hang on the walls.        
	This is what happens when you violate rules to make money, said Deepak Kumar, throwing up his hands in despair while pointing towards the black smoke billowing from SB and Company. Deepaks toyshop is just below.         
	Around 90 per cent of the legal shops and godowns in Mehta Building are owned by medicine wholesalers and stockists. Medicine supply in the eastern zone is hugely dependent on this market, said Swapan Das, a stockist in Block A.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Minerva is reborn
                                                                                                               Minerva is reborn

	Minerva theatre, ravaged by a fire in 1922, was born again on Thursday, with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee unveiling the revamped auditorium and announcing that it would be developed into a centre of dramatic excellence.        
	The unveiling coincided with the birth anniversary of stage legend Girish Chandra Ghosh, whose creations, along with Utpal Dutts, marked the heyday of the 115-year-old Beadon Street address.         
	The chief minister called on Natya Akademi president Kumar Roy to lead the next phase of the renovation  turning the hall into a centre of excellence.        
	Now that the CMDA has handed over the hall to the state information and cultural affairs department, there should be a concerted attempt to turn Minerva into a hub of all kinds of drama-related activities, said Roy.        
	The announcements, to a section of stage veterans, laid to rest the fears that the hall, renovated at a cost of Rs 6.36 crore, would just be another run-of-the-mill auditorium.        
	Roy said the hall could not support big productions but had useable space and the best theatrical equipment.         
	Actor-director Meghnad Bhattacharya expressed the hope that Natya Akademi and the government would pay heed to proposals from theatre personalities in running the hall.        
	Technical staff and basic infrastructure, however, are still missing in the hall. This was evident when Theatre Workshop staged Utpal Dutts Lohar Bhim after the inauguration.

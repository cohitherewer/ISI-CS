The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Dreams lie in fire debris
                                                                                                               Dreams lie in fire debris
  - TYREPATTI BLAZE          A STAFF REPORTER                                    Zahida Khatoon, who was to get married later this year, and (bottom) Shama Begum, her next-door neighbour. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Zahida Khatoons dream has been reduced to ashes.        
	The 27-year-old resident of Smith Lane will tie the knot later this year, and brother Anwar Hussain had started making the arrangements.        
	But Thursday evenings fire in the tyrepatti, which reportedly originated from 15/H1F Smith Lane where Zahida lives, gutted all household items, including the wedding gifts and Rs 55,000 that Anwar had kept aside for the ceremony.        
	Similar is the fate of the other residents of the double-storeyed building.        
	While deputy commissioner (central) Ajey Ranade refused to comment on the source of the blaze before a forensic test, sources in Taltala police station and a section of local residents claimed the fire started in a tyre-retreading shop on the ground floor of 15/H1F Smith Lane.        
	The sources said the shop was run by a tenant. On Thursday evening, one of his family members was pumping a gas stove when it burst.        
	The inflammable material stacked in the shop immediately caught fire and a little later, an LPG cylinder exploded. The blaze soon spread to the other rooms of the building and to a few adjacent shops.        
	Local residents said the disaster was waiting to happen, as the narrow lane is lined with tyre-repairing shops that lack of even the basic fire-fighting measures.        
	Anwar, who sells fruit juice on the pavement of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, broke down while relating his misfortune.        
	I earn barely Rs 150 a day. Our father passed away long ago and I have to look after the family of three. I had bought clothes and other valuables for my sisters marriage, but everything got destroyed. How will I marry off my sister? he cried.        
	His next-door neighbour Shama Begum, who stays in a one-room flat with husband and three children, was too shocked to react. Her right hand was burnt, but I do not have the money to take her to a doctor. I could not even salvage Rs 40,000 I had kept in the room, said husband Firoze.

  - Drowned teens family refuses to believe it was an accident          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    A cellphone picture of Atib and (above) his grieving mother at their home on Wednesday. Picture by Gopal Senapati      
	The family of a 15-year-old footballer who drowned while taking a dip in a pond after playing an inter-class school game on Wednesday refused to accept it was an accident because he was a good swimme r.        
	Atib Rahaman, a Class IX student of Guru Nanak Public School in Howrah, had accompanied 20-25 boys from the same institution to a pond near the Andul Rajbari ground after the game ended and dived in straightaway. Nobody noticed that he hadnt come out until after 10 minutes had elapsed, police quoted some of the other students as saying.        
	When the boys informed games teacher Gadadhar Dey, he went into the water and came out with Atif after five minutes. He was unconscious and bleeding from the nose, the teacher said later.        
	Dey and a local youth took Atib to a private nursing home on a scooter, but he was declared dead by the doctor on duty in the emergency section.        
	The police later arrested the teacher and the school librarian, Gurdeep Singh, but did not specify the charges.        
	Atibs lawyer father Ataur Rahaman, who practises in the Alipore court, said he suspected foul play. I still do not believe my son died of drowning. He was a good swimmer. He practised swimming at Marine Club in Kidderpore every day. There must have been some foul play in the death of my son.        
	Sources close to the Rahamans said the family was contemplating suing the school authorities for alleged negligence. We have received a complaint, but only post-mortem will reveal whether there was foul play in the death, Howrah superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said.         
	The post-mortem will be done on Thursday.        
	According to the schools version of the incident, the football game ended around 11.45am and Atib and the other players headed for the pond almost immediately.        
	Principal Yogesh Maheswari said: In previous years, the inter-class tournament was held in our own playground. This year, the playground was waterlogged and we decided to organise the tournament at the Andul Rajbari ground, which is a 15-minute walk from our school.         
	Atibs family stays at 34 Mominpur Road and he would always go to school in his fathers car. Janasree Sarkar, who teaches English at Guru Nanak Public School, described him as a well-mannered, good student who always showed respect to his teachers and often gave us a lift.

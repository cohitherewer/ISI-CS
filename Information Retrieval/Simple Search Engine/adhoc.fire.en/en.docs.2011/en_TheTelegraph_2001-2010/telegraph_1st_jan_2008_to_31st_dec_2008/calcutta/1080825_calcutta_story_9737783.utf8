The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Grapple and punch bask in glow of medals
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Grapple and punch bask in glow of medals
          RITH BASU                        Wrestlers practise at Panchanan Byayam Samity in Jorabagan; (below) young boxers warm up at Alipore Bodyguard Lines. Pictures by Aranya Sen and Amit Datta				                                       
	 Thirteen aspiring wrestlers, seven of them girls, have enrolled at Panchanan Byayam Samity since unheralded grappler Sushil Kumar won India an Olympic bronze in mens 66-kg freestyle last week.        
	 The Bengal Amateur Boxing Federation (BABF) pushed back the dates of the 55th state senior championship by a week so that the final bouts coincided with the Olympic boxing finals scheduled for Saturday and inspired the competitors to give their best.         
	Indias three medals in the Beijing Games have created ripples of excitement among coaches and trainees of the so-called fringe sports, events in which people have been sweating it out unnoticed for years.         
	This newfound zeal, however, will not be enough to sustain sports like boxing or wrestling in Calcutta, warns Asit Saha of Panchanan Byayam Samity. We need proper equipment and infrastructure, without which our trainees cannot compete at the international level. Such support can only come from government or corporate patronage, he adds.        
	There is just one wrestling mattress of international standard in Bengal. The second one, kept at the Salt Lake complex of the Sports Authority of India (SAI), is used for gymnastics.         
	Wrestlers need good nutrition. They should ideally drink two glasses of giri badam and milk sharbat every day. This alone would cost them Rs 100 daily. In earlier times, wrestlers used to enjoy the patronage of maharajas but today they are neglected, at least in Bengal, rues Saha.        
	At the state boxing meet that was held at the Alipore Bodyguard Lines on Friday and Saturday, participants and viewers alike couldnt stop talking about middleweight Vijender Kumars bronze feat. But beyond this inspiring story, theres little for pugilists in Bengal.        
	The boxing ring in Alipore is the only one in the state that complies with international specifications. The others have cement floors that curb rather than enhance natural skills.        
	The BAFB has requested the police commissioner to allow city boxers to practise at Alipore Bodyguard Lines on a regular basis.         
	We need punching bags of different weights, speed balls and wall pads for the Alipore ring to become a complete practice facility. There must also be a full-time coach with knowledge of physiology and psychology. The commissioner has given us a patient hearing and we hope for the best, said Asit Banerjee, the president of the BAFB.        
	Even with these shortcomings, boxers and wrestlers from the state have been doing quite well, say coaches. In the national boxing sub-junior tournament in Assam last year, Bengal won three gold medals. Experts are upbeat about more girls taking up contact sports, regarded as male bastions.        
	Women represent almost 10 per cent of boxers and wrestlers in Calcutta.         
	They, however, complain that SAI and the state government have not done enough for Bengal. In north India, SAI and the state governments run residential camps and schools for sportspersons. No such initiative is ever taken here. How do you expect our athletes to win on an empty stomach? asks Mehrajuddin Ahmed, a former boxer and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Qamar Alis coach.         
	Ali, a Kidderpore boy, feels that infighting in the various sports associations and federations in the state has also come in the way of development of sports in Bengal.

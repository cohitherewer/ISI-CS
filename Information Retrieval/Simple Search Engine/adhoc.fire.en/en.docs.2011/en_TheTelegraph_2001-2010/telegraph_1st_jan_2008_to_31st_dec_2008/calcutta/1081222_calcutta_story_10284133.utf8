          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The lone survivor of the car crash on Vidyasagar Setu on Saturday morning is unaware that it had claimed three of his childhood friends.        
	We have not told him that his friends are dead. Since morning, he has asked us several times about the condition of his friends. We have only said that they have been admitted to another hospital and are recovering, said Vineets father Pawan Saraf.         
	The 21-year-old is admitted to CMRI Hospital with injuries in his spine and waist. According to doctors, the youth is recovering fast but would need to be in bed for at least three months. Vineet is stable and in his senses. His pain has also subsided. We are currently treating his cuts and bruises, said an official of CMRI. We would keep him under observation for three to four days.        
	Vineets family is more concerned about the shock he might receive when he learns about his friends death than his physical injuries.        
	We have removed newspapers from his cabin and have also requested the doctors not to switch on the television in his room, said Vineets uncle Shiv Shankar Saraf.        
	The four had studied together in Jain Vidyalaya School and stayed in the same Shibpur estate. They were returning home after offering puja at Kalighat temple on Ankit Agarwals 19th birthday when a tyre of the car burst. The vehicle hit the divider and turned turtle.        
	Vineet was seating at the back with Garvit Sharma, 20. Swetank Jain, 20, was driving the car. Two of my friends who were passing the spot pulled Vineet out of the wreck, said Saraf.

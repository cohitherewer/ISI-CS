The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Husband denied bail
                                                                                                               Husband denied bail
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	The high court on Tuesday rejected the bail prayer of an NRI, arrested last month in Hooghly after his wife lodged a complaint of sexual assault against him.        
	The division bench of Justice Amit Kumar Talukdar and Justice P.S. Sinha said the husbands passports should be kept with the Regional Passport Officer till further orders.        
	Moving the bail plea, the husbands counsel said his client was originally a resident of Ranchi. Currently, he is working as an executive for a private firm in Sharjah. The allegations against him are baseless. He is an educated young man who has no vices, said the lawyer.        
	The wifes counsel said: Unless a wife faces intolerable physical torture by her husband, she does not lodge a complaint against him. My client was forced to lodge a complaint. If she had wanted to put her husband behind bars, she could have brought charges of mental and physical torture against him under Section 498A of the CrPC. But she has lodged a case under Section 377 of the IPC, which deals with unnatural sex.        
	The lawyer told the court that the wife had returned to her parents home in Konnagar, unable to bear regular torture by her husband. She lodged the complaint with the local police last October.        
	Fearing arrest, the husband had moved the high court on December 24 for anticipatory bail. He was granted interim bail and asked to behave himself. But he continued to torture my client, forcing her to move the trial court, which ordered his arrest, said the wifes lawyer.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       5 held for lynching thief
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Five persons were arrested on Sunday night in connection with the lynching of a suspected thief in Liluah.         
	Howrah police superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh said it was not clear whether the five, all of whom have been charged with murder, were members of a resistance group in the area or residents.        
	On Monday morning, however, residents blocked Belgachhia Road for nearly an hour to protest against the arrests. They alleged that members of the resistance group had been falsely implicated in the lynching case. The blockade caused severe traffic snarls on Belgachhia Road.         
	Biswanath Dey, a resident who put up the blockade, said: Das was a victim of mob fury. The resistance group had no role to play in his death. We want police to release the arrested persons immediately.        
	The five  identified as Gopal Das, Alok Koley, Bantu Dutta, Rupam Pathak and Madhu Dutta  were produced before the chief judicial magistrates court in Howrah and sent to 12 days jail custody.        
	Resistance groups are formed for better police-public relationship. They are supposed to help the police control crime. They have no right to beat a criminal to death, said the police superintendent.        
	Around 1am on Sunday, members of the resistance group saw four men sitting near a water tank on Q Road. On being chased, three ran away but 26-year-old Debdas Das jumped into a pond filled with water hyacinth.        
	The resistance group members cordoned off the pond and stood guard till morning. When they saw Dass head among the hyacinth, they dragged him out and allegedly beat him to death with logs and bricks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Truce on Jadavpur University campus
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Truce on Jadavpur University campus
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Order was restored at Jadavpur University (JU) on Monday as the authorities and agitating students reached an agreement on most issues that had put the campus on the boil last week.        
	Senior university officials met representatives of all three student unions on Monday afternoon and agreed to consider their demands. The Faculty of Arts Students, We the Independents and the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union send their members to the meeting.        
	We have agreed to set up a committee with student and teacher representatives to review the need for segregating first-year boarders, said pro vice-chancellor Siddhartha Dutta.        
	The panel  to be formed before the next executive council meeting scheduled for August 6  will comprise five teachers, five students and the dean of student affairs.        
	The students are opposed to the authoritys proposal to segregate all first-year boarders to save them from ragging. Sources said the review committee may explore other ways to discourage ragging on campus.        
	The students saw another victory in the universitys decision to create a placement cell for each faculty.        
	We have already appointed an advisory committee for the placement cells. Each cell will have a placement officer and students from the faculty, said pro vice-chancellor Dutta.        
	The students who spent the day campaigning for their demands were happy with the outcome.        
	We are satisfied with what the vice-chancellor and pro vice-chancellor told us but still we will be on guard. We will join classes from Tuesday as we do not want to disrupt the academic process, said Abhishek Chakraborty, the general secretary of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union.        
	Officials said the universitys faculty council would take up two other contentious issues  reducing the Puja vacation to nine days and bringing forward the semester exams. The students are opposed to both.        
	We will try and explain to faculty council members why we dont want the semester system to be brought forward, said Chakraborty.        
	The truce was a relief for the university authorities, more so because an 11-member UGC team is visiting the campus.        
	The team, led by G.D. Sharma, will visit all faculties, schools, centres and departments. On Monday, the members visited the central library and some of the departments, said Dutta.

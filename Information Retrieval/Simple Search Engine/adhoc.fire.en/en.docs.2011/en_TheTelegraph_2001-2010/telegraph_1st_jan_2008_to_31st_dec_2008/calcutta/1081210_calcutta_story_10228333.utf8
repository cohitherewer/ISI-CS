The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Worry over voter identity   Jan window for missing names
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Worry over voter identity     - Rajarhat residents end up in electoral no-mans land          MEGHDEEP BHATTACHARYYA                          New Town on Tuesday.   Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                              
	When Gautam Bhattacharya, 58, invested his lifes savings in a Rajarhat apartment, little did he know that living in the showpiece township would be like living in no-mans land. No drinking water, no drainage system, no proper roads, no street lighting, no markets, no medicine shops, no BSNL landlines  and now no voting rights!        
	New Town has been our home for close to two years but there is no document to prove that this is our permanent address. We dont know how we will cast our votes within a few months, said Bhattacharya.        
	The names of most residents of the housing estates dotting New Towns Action Area-I have been deleted from the constituencies under which they were previously and not included yet as Rajarhat residents in the revised electoral roll. This is a strange identity crisis. How will we prove our identity and address without a voter ID card or a BSNL telephone bill? wondered Rabindranath Das, a 34-year-old techie.        
	Most New Town residents have been denied a BSNL landline because of an alleged dispute between the service provider and Hidco, which is in charge of the townships development, over underground cables.        
	There is no disagreement with Hidco, claimed a BSNL official, while a source in Hidco confirmed that BSNL was reluctant to pay the charges fixed for laying of cables. Penetration in New Town has begun and there will be steady growth in the future, claimed the BSNL official.        
	That to Rajarhat residents means yet another long wait for a basic facility.                                      
	When we went to find out from Mayukh Bhavan in Salt Lake last month, we were told we had missed the bus. We do not have any government document stating our permanent address, rued Prakash Bajpai, 49.        
	But the state election commission holds out hope for Bajpai and his neighbours. We might make special arrangements for those who missed out after the list comes out on January 10, said chief electoral officer Debashis Sen.        
	We had published advertisements in all leading newspapers stating that November 25 was the last date for electoral revision. There might have been a gap in communication at the local level, he added.        
	The likes of Dipak Sen, 56, are keeping their fingers crossed. Our names do not appear on voter lists. We dont have valid voter ID cards with our new permanent address. We practically have no voting rights, said the New Town resident.

                A 21-year-old youth, identified as Subhojit Garai, was arrested from the Shyampukur area on Sunday after a 14-year-old girl of the same locality lodged a complaint that he had tried to abduct her in a taxi on Saturday evening. Police said Arpita Ghosh, of Mohun Bagan Lane, mentioned in her complaint that Subhojit intercepted her when she was returning from a dance class and forced her into a taxi. She was, however, allowed to get off on Jatindra Mohan Avenue. The accused was produced in court on Sunday and remanded in judicial custody.

A 35-year-old undertrial, Dolly Haoladar, escaped from the female ward of MR Bangur Hospital on Saturday evening. Police said Haoladar, an inmate of Presidency jail, was arrested under the Foreigners Act for entering India from Bangladesh without valid documents early this month. She was admitted to hospital after being diagnosed with an infection in her lungs. She managed to flee on the pretext of collecting drinking water from a tap outside the ward.    Four persons were injured on Saturday night when a minibus skidded off the road and hit a lamp post at the crossing of SP Mukherjee Road and Hazra Road.

All the four injured were rushed to Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan for treatment. The driver jumped off his cabin and fled but police impounded the vehicle.

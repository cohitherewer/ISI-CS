          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Representatives of the 97 students of Calcutta Universitys MA second-year English class who were declared discollegiate on Monday for poor attendance met the vice-chancellor on Wednesday.        
	He said he would try to organise extra classes to help the students increase their attendance, said a member of the delegation.        
	Students with less than 55 per cent attendance are declared discollegiate and barred from writing examinations.

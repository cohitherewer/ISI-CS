The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Fabregas, here we come!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fabregas, here we come!
                            
	They know that the footballing scene in the city is sad. They know that the prospects in football compared to cricket are dismal. But these six Calcutta boys cannot spend a day without dribbling and diving, shooting and saving. Because they are like that only.        
	And its this passion for the beautiful game  coupled with eye-catching skill on the ball  that has become their passport to Arsenal. These six teenaged boys (along with 10 others from other parts of the country) will be attending an intensive training camp in the UK club from July 26 to August 3.        
	They will train under head coach Paul Shipwright and deputy coach Martin Davis from the Arsenal International Soccer School, they will witness the 18th edition of the Arsenal International Soccer Festival that kicks off in August and get Arsenal memorabilia personally autographed by the likes of Cesc Fabregas.         
	Picked by head scout and former Maidan marksman Jamshed Nassiri from among hundreds of boys battling it out in the Tata Tea Arsenal Soccer Star tournament, they are all geared up for their dream trip. Metro on Sunday gets to know these little-known city heroes better...

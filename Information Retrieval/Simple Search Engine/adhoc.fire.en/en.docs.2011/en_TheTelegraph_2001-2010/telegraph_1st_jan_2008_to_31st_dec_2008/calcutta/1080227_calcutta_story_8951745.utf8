	Hawkers are a socio-economic reality and cannot be driven out of the city, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said on Tuesday. He, instead, stressed the need to prepare a resettlement or rehabilitation package for them.
    
	But the mayors statement, at a conference organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, was greeted with scepticism by his own officials.
    
	Crores were wasted in the name of hawker rehabilitation after Operation Sunshine in the late 90s, said a civic conservancy department official. Few hawkers relocated to the markets built for them. Rather, since Sunshine, the hawker count in the city has increased threefold.
    
	The mayor also criticised the mindset of the middle class and upper-middle class people for their unwillingness to pay water tax. Households getting filtered surface water on their premises should pay the tax, he stressed.
    
	Once again, he stood refuted by his own men. Whatever water tax the civic body gets from domestic consumers is paid by people in the middle class-upper middle class bracket, said an official in the civic water department.
    
	Of the 2,36,057 households in the city that receive filtered water, only 26,940 are taxable for using ferrules of 20 mm and 25 mm.

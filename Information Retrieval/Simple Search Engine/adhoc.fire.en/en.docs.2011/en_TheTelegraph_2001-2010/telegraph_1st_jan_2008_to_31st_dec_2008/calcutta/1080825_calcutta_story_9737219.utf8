                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cover-up slur on cops 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	A police station in Calcutta allegedly tried to destroy evidence of a mans arrest after he slunk away from there while an officer was writing a general diary and others were too busy or careless to notice.        
	Jogendra, arrested for his alleged complicity with a domestic help who had robbed his employer, fled Bhowanipore police station last month but the incident remained under wraps until someone from within leaked the news to the office of the deputy commissioner of police (south), Rajesh Subarna.        
	A source in the police station said Amiyo Bandopadhyay, the sub-inspector who was writing the diary when Jogendra escaped, had been asked to tear off the page but he refused to do so. He went on leave after that and still hasnt joined.        
	Jogendra was seated on a wooden bench at the rear of Bhowanipore police station when Bandopadhyay started doing the paperwork. Nobody knew when he walked out. It was only when a constable was asked to take him to the lock-up that we realised that the arrested man was no longer in the police station.        
	When a cover-up operation was planned, Bandopadhyay refused to be part of it. Someone else then allegedly tore off the page on which details of the arrest had been written.        
	Officer-in-charge Badal Maity, who has been asked to explain how Jogendra fled the police station and why evidence was allegedly destroyed, declined comment. I will explain it to my superiors, he said.        
	Subarna said the inquiry would focus as much on the lax vigilance that allowed the arrested man to flee as on the allegation about evidence being destroyed. We started an inquiry by an officer of the rank of assistant commissioner three days ago. Appropriate action will be taken after we receive the report.         
	A senior officer in Lalbazar said destruction of evidence was a serious offence that was punishable by imprisonment for up to seven years. Allowing an arrested man to sit on a bench with no policeman guarding him is an example of carelessness. Since the police were about to start a case against Jogendra, they should have put him in the lock-up straightaway.         
	Jogendra, accused of hiding valuables stolen by domestic help Narayan from the Ashutosh Mukherjee Road residence of businessman Sailesh Sanghvi, had been arrested from Ironside Road. Narayan, picked up from Phuldungri village in Banka district of Bihar, remains in custody.

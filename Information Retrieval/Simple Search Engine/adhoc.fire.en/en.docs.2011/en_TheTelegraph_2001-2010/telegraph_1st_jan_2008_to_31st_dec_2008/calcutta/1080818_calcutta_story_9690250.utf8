The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Civic body mulls curbs on billboards
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Civic body mulls curbs on billboards
          DEEPANKAR GANGULY                                          
	The civic authorities have decided to ban giant goal post-type billboards.        
	Instead, all billboards will come up on single poles to ensure that pedestrians passage is not encroached on.        
	The changes in billboard rules will be incorporated in a code the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will enforce from September.        
	According to the proposed code, billboards will not be allowed in the BBD Bag area, declared a heritage zone, and in front of heritage structures, places of worship and parks.        
	A number of billboards will have to be pulled down to restore the beauty of the citys skyline, said mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya.        
	The CMC has also decided to invite tenders to let out roadside space for erecting billboards.        
	Of the 5,000-odd billboards in the city, only 370 are along roads and on civic land. The rest are on private land or atop private buildings.        
	According to a civic estimate, more than 3,500 billboards on private premises are illegal. The owners of the premises earn more than Rs 1,000 crore from them.        
	The new billboard code will be enforced in two phases, said an official. In the first phase, tenders will be invited for about 190 roadside billboards whose licences will lapse on August 31. The licence of the other roadside billboards will lapse in September 2009.        
	The civic authorities have already blackmarked the roadside billboards that violate the proposed code. Some of them are in front of Park Mansion, Park Street cemetery and Deshapriya Park. Hence, tenders will be invited for only 150 roadside billboards.        
	The new system will make the process of distribution of billboard space more transparent and help the civic body earn more revenue, said civic commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhyay.        
	Unlike previous years, the rates will vary from one civic pocket to another.         
	Last year, the CMC earned Rs 26 crore from billboards. This year, the target is over Rs 50 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Water relief for housing estates
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Water relief for housing estates
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	Bringing relief to over 20 lakh people living in housing estates  who are mostly dependant on underground water  the state water investigation directorate has decided to renew licences of all deep tubewells sunk before September 15, 2005.        
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will not conduct the mandatory probe to ascertain the necessity of drawing water from the underground aquifer before renewing the licence.        
	After the renewal, the civic authorities will get in touch with the directorate for registration of the tubewells. We will soon issue a notification on the matter, said Subhabrata Basu Roy, the superintending geologist of the directorate.        
	According to civic rules, the licence of a deep tubewell has to be renewed every year. Most deep tubewells are now running without a licence, as the applications for renewal have been lying with the civic water supply department, pending investigation reports.        
	Investigation takes time. The water supply department does not have enough people to carry out investigation on the dependence on underground water in each case, said mayoral council member (water supply) Mrinal Kanti Mondol.        
	Last year, in a bid to conserve underground water resources, the state government had made the directorate the sole registration authority for deep tubewells.        
	For sinking a new deep tubewell or renewal of licences of those sunk after September 15, 2005, civic officials will first ascertain whether they can supply filtered surface water to the premises.        
	The main reason for the curbs on the renewal of licences was to assess the quantum of water being withdrawn from the underground aquifer. The 5,000-odd deep tubewells in residential and commercial estates have been drawing around 100 million gallon of water.        
	If not checked, depletion of the underground water table will one day cause the city to subside. The water level under Park Street, Sealdah and Shyambazar has fallen by up to nine metres over the past 40 years, said civic chief engineer (water supply) Bibhas Maity.

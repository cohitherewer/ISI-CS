	The registrar of Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), Biman Bandopadhyay, resigned on Wednesday after a legal notice challenging his appointment was served on him and university vice-chancellor N.R. Banerjea.        
	The notice sent on behalf of the Besu Teachers Association stated that Bandopadhyays appointment was in violation of university and University Grants Commission rules. According to the rules, a registrar must have 15 years of academic experience of which five years must be as a professor or in a higher administrative capacity. The current registrar has an experience of 15 years as valuation officer at Calcutta Improvement Trust (CIT), said advocate Agniswar Dutta Gupta, who is representing the association.        
	The letter stated that if the registrar did not resign within a fortnight, the association would move the high court.         
	Bandopadhyay, who is a former student of the university, said he had resigned for personal reasons. I have asked the vice-chancellor to release me from my duty on and from January 15.

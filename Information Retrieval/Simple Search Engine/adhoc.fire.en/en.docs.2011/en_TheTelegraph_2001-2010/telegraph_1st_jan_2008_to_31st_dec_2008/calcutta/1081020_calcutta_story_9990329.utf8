          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	A team from Cossipore police station seized banned fireworks weighing 850kg from a private bus from Gaya on Sunday.        
	The crackers were stashed in 17 gunny bags that were being ferried unmanned on the roof of the bus. The driver has been arrested. He told the police that he was supposed to drop the consignment near Mohammad Ali Park, in central Calcutta.        
	Vineet Goyal, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said sleuths had been tipped off that banned crackers were being transported to the city on long-distance buses, instead of lorries and Matadors, in the run up to Diwali.        
	A team from Cossipore police station intercepted the city-bound bus from Gaya on BT Road, he added.        
	Some businessmen are smuggling in banned crackers from Bankura, Birbhum, and North and South 24-Parganas, as well as from neighbouring states, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Jawed Shamim.        
	We have contacted our counterparts in the districts and asked them to launch a crackdown on units that produce banned fireworks, he added.        
	nAnother haul: A team from Jorasanko police station seized banned crackers weighing 60 kg from a godown in Burrabazar. Two men have been detained.

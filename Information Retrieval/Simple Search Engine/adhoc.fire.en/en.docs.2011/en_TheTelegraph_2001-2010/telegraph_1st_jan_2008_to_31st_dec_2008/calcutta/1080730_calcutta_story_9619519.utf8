The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Metro | Maid in net for burglary
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Maid in net for burglary
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	The CID on Tuesday arrested a gang of burglars led by a maidservant and seized more than six bhoris of gold, two cameras and US and Malaysian dollars.        
	Those held were Rakhi Kahar, the kingpin, her daughter Pinky, son-in-law Robin Naskar, other daughter Rita and Raju Rai, who the police said had an affair with the team leader.        
	They were picked up following raids across the city and in some district towns, including Sainthia (Birbhum) and Sonarpur (South 24-Parganas). The sleuths said an organised gang was at work and expressed hope that the arrest of the five would lead them to the others.        
	A few days back, a flat off the EM Bypass, near Ruby General Hospital, was burgled. We came to know during the probe that the gang that broke into the flat was the one that struck some other apartments in the area. Rakhis name surfaced at this stage, said a CID official.        
	The sleuths came to know that Rakhi, in her early-40s, had been living in and around the city for the past 13 years. Apart from making a living as a maidservant, she also supplied domestic help to families living on the citys eastern fringes.        
	After supplying the maids, she would collect information through them about the wealth of the families. She would then drop in and run a quick check before plotting the final strike, the officer added.        
	In her last strike, Rakhi had robbed a family of six bhoris of gold, two cameras and US and Malaysian dollars. All were recovered from her possession.         
	The cops said she would pass on the booty to Raju and son-in-law Robin, who would sell them off.         
	We are trying to find out where the other members of the racket are based. If required, we will raid other districts as well, the officer said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Police detectives have arrested a thief who would first steal a motorcycle and then cruise through the streets of the city on it, looking for people to snatch cellphones from.         
	Mohammad Nazir, 22, was arrested from a hideout in Kidderpore during a raid on Thursday night.         
	We have already solved two cases with his arrest, and expect to crack several more after verifying his antecedents and interrogating him further, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department.        
	Nazir, who interrogators described as a glib talker, had been arrested once before for snatching and granted bail when he promised not to return to crime. But he was apparently hooked to the challenge of stealing a motorcycle and using it to commit another offence.        
	After selecting a potential victim  people talking on their cellphones while walking were usually his targets  Nazir would rev up and speed past him/her after snatching the handset in a flash.        
	Nazir stole a parked motorcycle owned by one Mushtaq Hussain from Manasatala Road, under Watgunge police station, on May 27, Shamim said.         
	The first cellphone he snatched while riding that bike belonged to Deepak Kumar Biswas, an employee of the police wireless workshop. He was walking down Syed Amir Ali Avenue, near the Park Circus seven-point crossing, around 6.30am on June 24 when Nazir came close to him on the bike, snatched the cellphone and zoomed off.        
	Two days later, around 8.30am, college student Sreyoshi Ghosh was crossing Ram Dulal Bose Street at the Hedua intersection while talking on her cellphone when she heard the roar of a motorcycle engine behind her.         
	Before she could react, she felt a tug and lost her grip on the phone.         
	Sreyoshi watched helplessly as Nazir sped away with the cellphone in his hand.        
	On being reminded about his promise not to steal when he was given bail, Nazir said he had not committed any crime in South Calcutta. We are convinced he was active in other parts of the city, said deputy commissioner (detective department) Shamim.
